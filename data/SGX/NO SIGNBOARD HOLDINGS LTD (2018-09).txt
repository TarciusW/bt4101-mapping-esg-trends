Statement from sustainability committee chair 

The Sustainability Committee (“The Committee”) at No Signboard Holdings Ltd. ("NSB Holdings") 

is pleased to present our inaugural Sustainability Report 2018 for the period of 1 October 2017 

to 30 September 2018 ("2018 Report"). Our subsequent reports will be published annually.

The Committee believes that in order to continue to be a leading seafood restaurant chain, our 

business must focus on sustainable growth through our policies and practices, creating value for 

our stakeholders. It is also the people behind the scenes and the customers we serve that make 

up the backbone of the business. We have thus further identified two more material ESG topics 

for next year’s Sustainability Report – Workplace Health &amp; Safety, and Customer Relationship 

Management. 

 

I am pleased to work with a dedicated Committee which is supported by a Sustainability 

Working Group to implement strategies, monitor and measure performance of the material 

factors. We look forward to this journey towards greater sustainability for the team, company 

and the restaurant industry in Singapore.

Chief Operating Officer and Chairman of

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

4

In this inaugural 2018 Report, we are formalising the sustainable practices we have put into place 

over the past 30 years of NSB Holdings' presence in Singapore’s restaurant scene. With a strong 

track record of quality cuisine and customer focused service, we showcase our sustainability 

approach in relation to material social factors. For 2018, the Board has considered various

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics through a materiality assessment exercise and 

has approved three material topics, namely Food Hygiene, Staff Welfare &amp; Training, and Staff 

Remuneration &amp; Benefits for this reporting. The scope of our reporting is currently only limited to 

our restaurant business unit.


About the report

This Sustainability Report (“Report”) is No Signboard Holdings Ltd.’s inaugural report. 

This Report marks our commitment to sustainability development into the 21st Century 

and gives an overview of our approach towards sustainability in our chain of seafood 

restaurants under our NSB Holdings Seafood brand. The information presented in this 

Report covers only the restaurant business and its internal divisions for the reporting period 

from 1st October 2017 to 30th September 2018. 

Reporting standard

This Report has been prepared using an international reporting framework Global 

Reporting Initiative’s (“GRI”) Standards 2016 and SGX-ST Listing Manual (Rules 711B).

We have chosen to report using the GRI standards as it is an internationally recognised 

reporting framework that covers a comprehensive range of sustainability disclosures. 

Furthermore, the structured framework promotes reporting a full and balanced picture of 

NSB Holding’s material concerns and the management of its impact. 

This Report has been prepared in accordance to the GRI Standards: Core Option.

Reporting boundaries and standards

Following GRI Standards, we applied four main principles to determine reporting the Report 

content:

1.

Stakeholder inclusiveness: stakeholders to be involved in the reporting process,

starting from report contents determination to feedback collection on published

reports.

2.

Materiality: report to contain material topics that are needed by stakeholders in

making decisions.

3.

Sustainability context: report to include sustainability issues that are relevant to the

publisher of the report.

4.

Completeness: report to be prepared with a clear scope of reporting period and

supported by complete data that are relevant to the scope and reporting period.

Our strategic approach to sustainability

With our vision and corporate values in mind, we target to integrate sustainability efforts 

systematically and seamlessly into the businesses of NSB Holdings. Where possible, we 

incorporate sustainability considerations in our decision-making processes. 

Our senior management team leads us in our sustainability efforts, ensuring that the 

company’s business objectives are in line with our commitments to sustainable development. 

They are also responsible for on-going communication to the Board of Directors. 

Our senior management has determined focus areas where NSB Holdings can have the 

greatest economic, environmental and social impact, as well as in areas that are most 

important to our stakeholders.

Information update by 

management

Stakeholders are important to NSB Holdings' business. As this is our first sustainability 

report, we have engaged internal stakeholders – our Board members, managers and 

employees in identifying three key ESG topics, and to implement sustainability throughout 

our restaurant business.  For 2019, we plan to engage our external stakeholders to identify 

areas that are material, sustainable and necessary for future development.

8


Our materiality matrix

An extensive list of ESG topics was generated through interviews with senior management, 

and ranked according to their importance via an online survey with key internal stakeholders 

including members of the Board, management and staff. 

The results of our stakeholders’ engagement were collated and presented to the Board for 

the selection of the material factors. For this inaugural Report, the Board has assessed and 

approved the following ESG factors as materials to be featured in subsequent sustainability 

reports until so updated. 

These ESG factors are material to the restaurant business and fall under the GRI-400 Social 

core topic disclosures. They are defined as those that reflect the reporting organisation’s 

significant ESG impacts or substantively influence the assessments and decisions of 

stakeholders. The boundaries for the topic disclosures are for all our restaurants and HQ 

staff.

Supply chain &amp; procurement practices

We only purchase key ingredients such as seafood, meats and vegetables from pre-qualified 

suppliers on our approved supplier list based on pricing, reliability, quality of ingredients and 

service. 

NSB Holdings strives to be agile and flexible in our purchasing strategies. We are not solely 

dependent on any particular supplier as the purchases are made from a range of suppliers, which 

gives us greater agility and reduces major losses to our business and profitability. For this reason, 

we generally do not enter into long-term or exclusive contracts with our suppliers as this allows 

us greater flexibility for our purchasing options.

Our key ingredients –mainly seafood, meats and vegetables are purchased on a daily basis from 

selected pre-qualified suppliers to ensure freshness. These pre-qualified suppliers are approved 

based on pricing, reliability, quality of ingredients and service. Our approved supplier list is 

updated and evaluated regularly based on factors such as quality of products, payment terms, 

competitive pricing and timeliness of delivery . We also seek assurances from our suppliers 

regarding compliance with our quality requirements and hygiene standards and require certain 

suppliers to be certified by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA). 

Freshness of ingredients remains one of our top priorities and purchases occur on a daily basis. 

At the end of each day, orders are placed with approved suppliers for the ingredients required 

for the next day. The manager of each outlet is responsible for maintaining adequate beverage 

supplies, including wines and liquor.

Food hygiene

Food hygiene and safety is of utmost importance to us as a restaurant business.  NSB Holdings 

places great emphasis on cleanliness within our kitchens and customer dining areas. We strive 

to adhere strictly to the food safety standards and regulations to ensure that our customers 

consume food prepared in safe, hygienic conditions.

All our food handlers undergo Workforce Skills Qualification training on Food Safety and Hygiene 

Procedures as well as mandatory in-house training courses to safeguard the highest food safety 

standards. For new employees, they undergo a rigorous orientation programme that emphasises 

the importance of food hygiene. 

Personal hygiene

The simple but crucial practice of proper hand washing before handling food products is 

mandatory in all our restaurants. All kitchen crew must be properly attired in their uniforms, 

complete with hairnets to ensure minimal exposure.

To further guarantee a high standard of personal hygiene, food-handlers for non-processed foods 

use disposable hand gloves, which must be replaced if they come into contact with raw food and 

other non-food objects. 

In the event of kitchen crew who sustain minor injuries, open cuts or wounds must be disinfected 

and protected with waterproof plasters to ensure personal safety. 

Customer health and safety

SOCIAL

Maintaining food freshness 

The health and safety of our customers remains a top priority, especially through the 

process of receiving and storing of food items. Ingredients from our suppliers are sent 

directly to our storefronts to maintain optimal freshness, while outlet employees carry out 

rigorous checks on the condition of the goods.  This includes the checking of expiry dates 

on perishable goods. All our goods and food products are stored in appropriate conditions 

and the temperatures are monitored according to the differing needs of various goods and 

food products

With regards to procurement of fresh food imported directly by us, we prioritise suppliers 

who conform to the requirements of Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Chain of Custody 

Default Standard (v4.0).  

Staff welfare and training 

Staff meals

As a restaurant business, the meal and break timings of our employees can be varied. We 

are thus committed to providing our kitchen and service staff with in-house meals at our 

three restaurants in Esplanade, Clarke Quay and VivoCity. For the year 2018, we provided 

about $100,000 worth of in-house meals for our restaurant employees across three 

restaurants.

Training

We believe in providing our staff with the necessary training to ensure that they are equipped 

with the right skillset for proper job performance. We place great emphasis on improving and 

upgrading our employees’ knowledge and skills in their respective fields. We are committed to 

providing continual education and learning for our staff. Our human resources department is 

responsible for overseeing the training and development of our staff and providing our staff with 

learning opportunities to improve their skills. 

We conduct an orientation programme for new employees to familiarise them with NSB 

Holdings' business and corporate policies, such as our vision, mission and core values. The 

programme includes visits to our restaurants to help new employees assimilate quickly. We also 

provide on-the-job training to new employees to help them familiarise themselves with their 

respective roles within our organisation. 

Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) is a national system that trains, develops, assesses and 

recognises individuals for key competencies, based on national standards developed by the 

Workforce Development Agency, in collaboration with various industries. All our food handlers 

are required to attend the Basic Food Hygiene Course on WSQ Follow Food &amp; Beverage Safety 

and Hygiene Policies and Procedures.
