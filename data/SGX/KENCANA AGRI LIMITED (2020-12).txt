PUSHING BOUNDARIES

2020 is the year that changes everything. It changes how we live, how we 

interact with each other, and how we do business. It made us revisit our 

priorities. It made clear that human progress stands on a delicate balance of 

social, economy and environmental elements. 

For Kencana Agri, 2020 is the year that tested our sustainability strategy 

implementation and The Group's commitment towards sustainability. Our 

priority this year, first and foremost, is to ensuring the health and safety of 

our people, sustaining our business and operational, and at the same time 

maintaining our commitment to the highest standard of environmental and 

governance practices, as well as continuing our social contribution to the local 

communities where we operate. 

To do so, we need to go the extra mile, put extra efforts, get out of our comfort 

zone, be innovative, and push all  boundaries in everything we do so we can 

persevere all the challenges and come out stronger.

Dear Stakeholders,

On behalf of Kencana Agri, it is our pleasure to present 

Kencana Agri’s sustainability report for the year ended 

31 December 2020 (FY2020). 

The global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly 

disrupted most sectors of the businesses across the 

supply chain and we are no exception. We have to 

acknowledge that 2020 was indeed a challenging year 

where we had to prioritize resources &amp; relook at how 

the business is functioning. Despite these challenges, 

we are committed to ensure that we abide by 

sustainable practices to achieve business, social and 

environmental sustainability. 

During this pandemic crisis,  we had implemented 

new regulations and Standard Operating Procedures 

“SOP” in order to adapt the impacts brought about by 

the pandemic and hopefully, we will emerge stronger 

thereafter.  We strictly observed governments’ COVID-19 

protocols while we strived to work efficiently and aim 

to deliver a desirable outcome to our stakeholders. I 

am thankful and proud that everyone in Kencana Agri 

held hands and worked together as members of one 

entity, pushing boundaries and overcoming hurdles 

together to ensure that our Company’s sustainability is 

maintained.  

Palm Oil as Part of Our Sustainable Future

The oil palm industry is a major global agricultural 

player. It only occupies a small area of the total 

area under agriculture today, but it accounts for 

approximately 1/3 of all the oils and fats produced in 

the world. Besides, it secures jobs for many millions of 

people globally, most of whom are smallholder farmers 

who depend on this crop for their livelihood. More than 

50 percent of the products we use on a daily basis uses 

palm oil as one of its base ingredients. Items ranging 

from food and beverages, soap, beverages, packaging, 

to biofuel. The versatile uses of palm oil have made it 

a commodity that is immensely crucial to sustain life 

and society.

Indonesia geographical location attracts the soil and 

climate conditions that are highly suitable palm oil 

cultivation and this give rise higher yield and better-

quality produce compared to those from other 

countries. Indonesia’s natural condition and strategic 

location have made us the world’s biggest producer 

of palm oil. With increasing global population and 

better living standards, the demand for palm oil will 

undoubtedly continue to grow. According to data from 

the Ministry of Trade of Indonesia, despite the COVID-19 

pandemic, demand for the commodity continued to 

grow. Indonesia’s annual palm oil export registered 

an increase of 13.65% to US$ 22.97 billion in 2020 as 

compared to the preceding year. 

Bringing More Value, Less Impact

Sustainability at Kencana Agri is based on our core belief 

that palm oil can and should be a business rooted in 

sustainability. To that end, our sustainability strategies 

and initiatives focus on how we can provide “More 

Value, Less Impact” in the areas of our operations. 

Kencana Agri strives to develop our operations based 

on best management practices that are sustainable 

and environmentally friendly, whilst reinforcing our 

responsibility as a good corporate citizen. We follow 

conducts and principles of No Deforestation of high 

carbon stock areas and the preservation of high 

conservation value areas, no burning and no new 

planting on peat of any depth as well as no exploitation 

of human rights. Hence, our buyers and consumers 

can rest assured that our palm oil is produced 

with the highest commitment and compliance to 

responsible and sustainable palm oil standards, 

namely the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO), 

International Sustainability &amp; Carbon Certification 

(ISCC), and PROPER (Program Penilaian Peringkat 

Kinerja Perusahaan Dalam Pengelolaan Lingkungan 




Kencana Agri Limited

– Corporate Environmental Performance Assessment 

Rating Program)   from the Indonesian Ministry of 

Environment and Forestry. 

Through the “More Value, Less Impact” as the 

Company’s umbrella commitment and initiatives 

towards sustainable palm oil we can better monitor and 

evaluate it progress on a continual basis, particularly 

in key areas, such as: Economic and Operational 

Performance, Community Development &amp; Inclusive 

Business, Workplace, Environmental Management &amp; 

High Conservation Value (HCV) Areas, and Protecting &amp; 

Respecting Human Rights. 

Actively Contribute to the Achievement  

of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

[GRI 102-12]

We see Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as an 

opportunity to contribute and provide benefits to the 

stakeholders and the society at large. We adhere to the 

global goals that we work for together as part of the 

global community.

We have embedded some the SDGs goals related to our 

sustainability initiative of “More Value, Less Impact”, 

including SDGS 1 - No Poverty, SDGS 3 - Good Health and 

Well Being, SDGS – 4 Quality Education, SDGS 5 - Gender 

Equality, SDGS 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation, SDGS 8 - 

Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDGS 10 - Reduce 

Inequalities, SDGS 12 - Responsible Consumption and 

Production, SDGS 13 - Climate Action, SDGS 14 - Life 

Below Water, SDGS 15 - Life on Land, and SDGS 16 - 

Peace Justice and Strong Institutions.  

Moving Forward

The versatility of palm oil has made it a commodity that 

is immensely crucial to sustain life and the progress 

of society. Its versatility span over many products 

which are essential to our daily life. We believe that it 

will continue to play a central role in many products 

present and future. 

We want to thank our stakeholders for their continued 

trust and support in our endeavor and journey 

towards sustainability. Kencana Agri will always be an 

active player in sustainable palm oil and to push our 

boundaries in ensuring that production of palm oil can 

be sustainable.

We Believe that Palm Oil Can be Sustainable

Palm oil is everywhere. It’s in our food, soap, 

beverages, packaging, to our fuel. The versatility of 

palm oil has made it a commodity that is immensely 

crucial to sustain life and the progress of society. It 

plays a central role in our lives. From food security 

and alternative low- carbon energy. Palm oil is 

indeed part of the future.  

Indonesia is blessed the soil and climate in which 

palm oil can be optimally cultivated with relatively 

higher yield compared to other palm oil producing 

countries. Indonesia’s natural condition has made 

us the world’s biggest producers of palm oil. With 

increasing global population and living standard, 

the demand of palm oil in the future will continue 

to grow. According to the Ministry of Trade data, 

despite the pandemic, Indonesia’s palm oil recoded 

an increase of 13.65% in export value amounted to 

US$ 22,97 billion in 2020. 

New technologies and approaches open the 

possibility to ensure the sustainability of palm oil 

value chain, including increase in yield, the use of

Goals (SDGs) [GRI 102-12]

As a corporate citizen and part of the global community, 

Kencana Agri acknowledges the importance of 

supporting the Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs) as our common efforts to actualize a better

Sustainability at Kencana Agri:  

More Value, Less Impact

The Group was built from its humble beginning in 

Bangka Island, Indonesia in 1996. We have been 

working hand-in-hand and growing together with our 

stakeholders along those years, and we will continue 

to do so for more year to come. We believe that our 

success is built from the mutual respect and beneficial 

relationship with them. 

On that note, at the heart of our sustainability strategy 

is an Indonesia phrase of “gotong royong”, which means 

working together to achieve a common goal. It has 

been the underlying ethics that drives everything that 

we do, the decision we make, and how we interact with 

our stakeholders. It drives our sustainability strategy to 

bring “More Value, Less Impact” which embedded into 

Kencana Agri Environmental Sustainability Policy.

The provisions of this policy apply to all operations 

of Kencana Agri Limited (Kencana Agri, its subsidiary 

companies and any associated companies where 

Kencana Agri has management control.

SUSTAINABLE OPERATION &amp; PRODUCTS

Palm oil is a highly versatile crop. It is one of the main 

ingredients for many of our daily needs, from our 

foods, beauty, alternative fuels, to household cleaning 

products. It has many uses, namely foaming, binding, 

stabilizing, and many more. It is the most land-efficient 

crop, with a much greater yield per hectare than other 

oils like sunflower, rapeseed, or soy. For these reasons, 

it is the most commonly produced vegetable oil in the 

world. According to the World Wild Fund (WWF), palm 

oil supplies 35% of the world’s vegetable oil on just 

10% of the land. To get the same amount of oil from 

other sources, we would need around 4 to 10 times 

more land. 

The palm oil industry brings trade, income, and jobs 

to economies around the world. It employees millions 

of smallholders farmers. Approximately 4.5 million 

people rely on the palm oil industry for the livelihood. 

The demand of palm oil globally will continue to 

grow with the increasing global population and living 

standard. According to the Ministry of Trade data, 

despite the pandemic, Indonesia’s palm oil recorded 

an increase of 13.65% in export value amounted to 

US$ 22,97 billion in 2020. Growing demand coupled 

with increasing environmental concerns means that to 

continue to be viable, more sustainable approaches is 

required. 

Here at Kencana Agri, we have been committed in our 

practices and approach to ensure a sustainable future 

for palm oil. As a member of the ISCC and ISPO, we

committed to achieve No Deforestation, No Peat and 

No Exploitation (NDPE) everywhere we operate We also 

strive to increase traceability and transparency through 

our operations by utilizing technology, empowering 

smallholders, and working with the industry, NGOs, 

and government on the ground. 

Primary Operations  

Our operations include the development of oil palm 

plantations, cultivation of oil palm, management 

of estates, milling of FFB to produce Crude Palm Oil 

(CPO) and Palm Kernel Oil (PKO).  

In 2020, We operate 6 mills and 13 nucleus oil palm 

plantations with a total of 68,150 ha of planted areas 

within our palm oil plantations and 16,470 ha of this 

total planted areas are dedicated for our plasma 

smallholders. 

This year, the Group produced 569,348 tonnes and 

133,285 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) from the 

nucleus and plasma estates respectively, totalling to 

702,633 tonnes of FFB which then processed in our mills 

to produce a total of 148,837 tonnes CPO. We recorded 

a yield of 11.92 ton/Ha and 9.70 ton/Ha for our nucleus 

and plasma operations respectively this year.

Sustainbility Certifications [GRI 102-12]

Kencana Agri has been actively implementing ISCC, 

ISPO and PROPER Principles and Criteria in all of our 

operations. Our mills and estates have been audited 

by third-party independent parties to assure that our 

implementation adheres to the high standards of 

those standards. 

ISCC Progress

ISCC is an international certification system that was 

established based on an EU Directive on renewable 

raw products for producing biofuel, food, feed, and 

chemicals. ISCC outlines the need to avoid planting 

on no-go areas, GHG emission reduction, and social 

sustainability. 

Kencana Agri adopt ISCC principles in PT Sawindo 

Kencana. By the end of 2020, We have achieved 

Sustainable Palm Oil certification from ISCC for 10.8% 

of our eligible nucleus palm oil plantation area which 

represents 7,331 hectares of plantations that equal 

to 14,207 tonnes of CSPO, and equivalent to 9.5% of 

the total CPO produced by the group in 2020.

ISPO Progress

ISPO was initiated by the Government of Indonesia 

to ensure the sustainability of the production of 

oil palm. Kencana has implemented sustainability 

strategies at our plantations that are in compliance 

with ISPO certification main assessment criteria. ISPO 

aspects that we adopts include: Legality, Plantation 

Management, Protection and Utilization of Primary 

Forest and Peat land , Environment Management,

Yield and Extraction Improvement

At Kencana Agri, we continuously seek to improve 

our yield and extraction rates, which are dependent 

on a combination of complex factors, including 

weather and changes in climate, pest, soil types, as 

well as agricultural practices, such as fertilisation 

and harvesting efficiency. To improve our yield, 

we implement a number of practices, namely 

fertilisation using land application of biomass 

from our processing process to increase soil 

fertility, which also help use to reuse and manage 

our biomass, increase mechanisation such as the 

use of fertiliser spreader, and empty fruit bunches 

spreader.

In 2020, the average FFB yields were 11.9 tonnes 

(nucleus) and 9.7 tonnes (plasma) per hectare, while 

our Oil Extraction Rate (“OER”) was 21.57  %. The OER 

increase in 2020 was as a result of improvement in our 

FFB handling mechanism, especially during the FFB 

unloading process from gathering points to the loading 

ramp to minimize loss, hence increasing our overall OER. 

The Group’s current processed FFB derived mostly from 

71% production of our prime mature oil palms (nucleus 

and plasma). We would expect to see a higher FFB 

yield in coming years as a result of an increase in the 

percentage of oil palm reaching their prime age. 





The OER increase in 2020 was as a

Traceability In Our Supply Chain

Ensuring Product &amp; Service Quality [GRI 416-1]

Kencana Agri builds quality into our products and 

services. From service perspective, we strive to 

provide the best services and prompt response to our 

customers, from the very first encounter, to delivery 

and after sales services. From production perspectives, 

this means a Groupwide commitment to eliminate 

errors at every stage of production process, which 

includes FIFO treatment for FFB to ensure freshness, 

maintaining low stockpiles for CPO &amp; kernel, ensuring 

sufficient labour to support harvesting rotation, clean 

condition of collection point (TPH) and minimising 

mill breakdown amongst others, to maintain the 

quality of our FFA. This year we successfully managed 

to achieve the FFA level of 3.98% for all (100%) of our 

products, which is lower than the maximum preferred 

level of 4.5%. 

We strengthen these practices by implementing the 

industry best practices and continually improve the 

effectiveness of our quality management system. We 

have adopted Good Management Practices (“GMP”) 

which reflected within all of our Standard Operating 

Procedures (“SOP”). Along with regular quality and 

operational audits and quality assurance, we conduct 

routine training and socialization to all employees and 

workers on the GMP and SOP to ensure everybody 

aware, understand, and have the same spirit toward 

quality as we are.







Traceability in our supply chain is important aspect in 

actualizing a sustainable palm oil production. Kencana 

Agri traces supply flows so we can map our supply 

base, evaluate supplier performance against our 

sustainability policy, and engage with our suppliers 

to drive continuous improvement. We strive to make 

our supply chain as transparent as possible to all 

stakeholders. 

As of the end of December 2020, 100% of all FFB 

products coming out and into the Company are 

traceable to any of our stakeholders. Our ability to 

provide product traceability guarantees that our CPO 

and FFB were produced in and by reputable sources.

HOW OUR PALM OIL IS MADE

Palm oil is one of the most widely-used ingredients globally. It can be 

found in almost every products we use every day, from soap, shampoo, 

cakes, to our coffee creamer. It is even currently being used as alternative 

fuel with lower carbon footprint. Every part of the palm oil fruits and 

trees can be utilized for our needs.

As a proud producer of palm oil, Kencana Agri ensures that quality is 

instilled every step of our value chain, from seeds to our mills, up to 

deliver to our customers. 

At The Nursery

Seeds are grown in our nursery 

for about 8-12 months before it 

was planted in our plantation. 

Kencana Agri only uses top quality 

seeds with high yield and more 

resistant to pests than regular oil 

palm, hence we can maintain the 

quality and productivity of our 

palm plantation.

Planting The Seedlings

Seedling of 8-12 months old 

are planted in our nursery 

where they received daily 

watering and careful upkeep 

before being transplanted to 

our plantations. 

Upkeep &amp; Harvest

In the plantations, the trees are treated 

with fertilizers to ensure their optimum 

growth. After 30 month, these trees 

are considered mature and are ready 

for harvest. Harvesting process will 

be repeat every 7-10 days. Fresh Fruit 

Bunches (FFB) obtained from this 

harvesting process will be transported 

to our mills to be further processed. 

At The Mill

At our mills, the FFB is first sterilized using stream then stripped from the bunches. This 

process helps deactivates any enzymes which may cause the FFB to deteriorate in quality. 

Any waste from the stripping process is reused. The fibres from the oil palm processing is 

currently being used as fuel in our mills’ boilers. Meanwhile the empty fruit bunches are 

returned to the soil in our plantations where they help retaining soil moisture. When these 

empty bunched are naturally decomposed, they will become organic fertilizers for our trees 

in the plantation, creating a close loop system of waste management. 

After the stepping process, the palm fruit is then processed into two main products: Crude 

Palm Oil (CPO) and Palm Kernel (PK). CPO is extracted from the mesocarp or flesh of the 

fruit, while PK was processed from the seed. CPO was pressed from the mesocarp, then 

the oil is clarified to ensure it is free from contamination, and dried to meet standard CPO 

specifications from our buyers.

As the most versatile vegetable oil, palm oil is used in 

both food and non-food products globally. It also has 

the highest yield compared to any alternative oil crops, 

making palm oil as the crop with the most efficient 

use of land. However, with the increase in demand for 

palm oil, concern on the environmental impacts of the 

industry is also growing. 

As a palm oil producer, our business clearly depends 

on the sustainability of the environment. Therefore 

environmental stewardship and combating climate 

change are extremely vital to us. Moreover, we 

acknowledge that this is a common challenge faced 

by the global community. So we pledge to be green

Energy 

Energy consumption is closely linked to climate 

change. Therefore, energy has been one of the focal 

points in our sustainability focus areas. We strive to 

enhance energy efficiency throughout our operations 

and utilize palm oil waste as biofuel to generate 

electricity for our operations. [GRI 103-1]

We categorize our energy source into three category: 

biomass from shell and fibre which we use to generate 

electricity, non-renewables sources such as fuels and 

petrol for our diesel generators, machineries, and 

lights vehicles, and third party grid electricity from the 

state-owned electricity company.

In 2020, our total energy consumption was amounted 

to 98,156.52 Gigajoule. 55% of our total energy 

consumption in 2020 was sourced from biomass as 

alternative fuel, which was used to generate electricity 

for our mills from steam turbines that are fuelled by 

kernel shells and leftover fruit fibre. Using biomass as 

alternative sources of energy not only helps manage 

input costs, but also reduces our carbon footprint. The 

total electricity generated by these biofuels in 2020 

was amounted to 14,920,016 KWH, represent 79% of 

our total electricity usage of 2020.

In 2020, similar to our total energy consumption, our energy intensity 

was increased due to the energy consumption monitoring data 

expansion which now include grid electricity usage for operational 

activities from SWK, LK, and EKP. These expansion of grid electricity 

monitoring data has impacted the total energy consumption in 2020, 

hence our overall energy intensity, which was significantly higher 

than the previous years when grid electricity data were only covered 

grid electricity usage in our estates’ housings facilities.

55% 

of our total energy 

consumption in 2020 was 

sourced from biomass as 

alternative fuel, totalling to 

more than 53 Gigajoule

79% 

of our total electricity usage of 2020 

was generated by steam turbines that 

are fuelled by kernel shells and leftover 

fruit fibre, generating more than 14 

million KWH of electricity.

GHG Emissions &amp; Intensity

Kencana Agri committed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emission from our operations and existing plantations 

progressively. We strictly prohibiting new development 

on peatland regardless of depth and enforcing a strict 

no deforestation, also zero burning policy and practices 

for new developments and land preparation. On top of 

that, We have been consistent in our strategies to reduce 

GHG emissions at all operations by:

•	 Utilizing biomass as fertilizer and an alternative fuel 

substitute for generators and boilers.  Also reducing 

emissions from the use of fertilizers and diesel fuel 

in our estate and factories. 

•	 Monitoring the use of generators for housing 

electricity. Housings in estates are connected to the 

government grid whenever possible, thus reducing 

emissions from diesel generators.

Water Consumption

Water is life. Therefore the availability and sustainability 

of clean water is essential for our sustainability. 

From business point of view, maintaining a clean 

and uninterrupted supply of water constitutes one of 

the most critical components in sustainable palm oil 

production. Water is crucial not only for the well-being 

of our crops but also in other areas of our operations 

such as the well-being of our workers and to generate 

steam for processing. [GRI 103-1][GRI 303-1]

Based on the Asian Development Bank: Indonesia Water 

Studies (2019), Java island is identified as water stress 

area due to high population and industrial activities. 

Kalimantan dan Sumatera islands are not categorized 

as water stress area as water (surface water) availability 

and rainfall are high while population and industrial 

activities are relatively lower than Java. 

Our major operations are located in Bangka (Sumatera) 

and Kalimantan island, hence non-water stress areas. 

Nevertheless, The Group impose a strict water strategy 

to ensure the availability and sustainability of water as 

share resources. The Group’s water strategy includes: 

reducing withdrawal from groundwater and surface 

water, increase recirculation and reusage of water, and 

ensuring the quality of water discharge to water bodies. 

We adopt best water management practices to 

ensure the efficient use of water. We implement 3R 

programmes, as well as the installation and integration 

of wastewater treatment systems with our overall 

waste management. The objectives are to maximise 

the utilisation of wastewater from our operations and 

to be able to discharge it back to water bodies safely 

and responsibly. We developed our water management 

system with comprehensive hydrology, agronomy, and 

topography studies which enable accurate control and 

monitoring of water flow. Kencana Agri also puts into 

consideration on environmental conservation aspects. 

Moreover, we conducted assessment on social impact 

of our system. [GRI 103-2][GRI 303-1]

Further evaluation has been done on the effectiveness 

and impact on our water management system started 

from the construction phase.  The Group uses computer 

software modelling and simulation of the system, thus 






Kencana Agri Limited

57

Throughout 2020, the Group withdrew a total 989,969 

m3 water from reservoirs and rivers. Most of the 

reservoirs we use sourced from rainwater. Total water 

usage by the Group consists of 78% from reservoirs and 

the remaining 22% from rivers surrounding our estate 

aiding the Group in designing an optimal system for 

each particular area. [GRI 103-3][GRI 303-1]

All the water used for our milling operations is 

withdrawn from rivers and we do not use groundwater. 

Various initiatives has been conducted to ensure water 

conservation by maintaining optimal water condition, 

thereby creating an ideal environment for palm oil 

cultivation. Our water management system aims to 

prevent flooding, minimise erosion, and to secure 

the water supply for our plantation areas during the 

dry season. Moreover, we also developed Watergate 

system in low lying areas, terracing system, and cover 

crops planting, were among these efforts for creating a 

better environment for our trees. [GRI 103-2][GRI 303-1]

Palm Oil Waste Management: Plantation and Mill [GRI 306-1][GRI 306-2]

“It is our commitment to continue prioritising 

and optimising the use of organic fertilizers, 

such as the application of EFB for mulching 

that can help retain soil moisture which is 

important during dry seasons, and application 

of POME that have high organic matter to 

improve and maintain soil fertility.”

Kencana Agri follows waste management best practice 

for our palm oil estates and mills and we seek to 

recover and re-use all waste where possible. The 

solid waste produced from our production processes 

include empty fruit bunches (EFB), mesocarp fibre, and 

palm kernel shells. These are used as energy or fuel 

and composed or mulched as organic fertiliser. EFB is 

applied as mulch to conserve moisture, improve soil 

fertility, and reduce weed growth. 

We also generate palm oil mill effluent (POME) which is 

used as a fertiliser through land application. Our studies 

from 2014 to 2019 showed that POME application as 

fertilisers help add extra nutrients to the soil hence 

might boost yields of oil palm production from 6 to 8 

ton/ha. Based on those studies, we put into use 100% 

of our production POME as fertilisers back into the 

field on areas that have already been licensed for land 

application. It is important to note that the Group does 

not discharge any of our POME into waterbodies. 

On top of that, in order to protect the quality of 

groundwater and prevent any risk of contamination 

from our activities or waste, The Group install 

monitoring wells in surrounding areas. These wells 

are covered, locked and maintained regularly. As part 

of the PROPER assessment, representatives from the 

Regional Environmental Agency inspect the quality of 

the water within the wells regularly. 

Furthermore in 2020, five of our mills improved their 

waste management system, particularly in handling 

empty fruit bunches (EFB) waste. Previously, EFB were 

stockpiled in a designated areas in our mills, which 

now directly loaded to trucks to be transported back 

to our estates to be used as organic fertilisers. This way 

we managed to minimise and to some extent eliminate 

leachate from those stockpiles and created a more 

neat, safe, and clean working areas in our mills.  

Throughout 2020, we can report there is no significant 

complaints from the surrounding communities or 

sanctions from the regulators regarding our palm oil 

waste management and compliance.

Integrated Pest Management 

Kencana Agri’s integrated pest management approach 

is a combination of good agricultural practice, cultural, 

mechanical, biological, and chemical strategi to control 

pest. Through this approach we aim to minimise the 

use of chemicals, including pesticides and chemical 

fertilisers to achieve the optimum yield, hence mitigate 

negative impacts to the environment and our workers’ 

health and safety. 

Kencana Agri will use as proof to report to the Ministry 

of Environment and Forestry. Our Health and Safety 

Officers at each site has been properly trained and 

are qualified to monitor and ensure that the waste 

management practices are in accordance with the 

rules. 

In 2020, there were no reports of any significant spills. 

[GRI 306-3]

The Group implement non-chemical pest control 

measures in our plantation to minimise the use of 

chemicals to sustainably maintain pest populations 

within economic thresholds with minimal harm to 

local ecosystems. Since 2015, through the measure 

of using natural predators have help us control and 

significantly reduce the use of chemical pesticide in all 

operations.

OWL TO THE RESCUE

Rats is the most common pest found in our palm oil plantation estates. They can consume 

food as much as 10% of their body weight daily and bring food to their nest up to 40 times 

per day. In palm oil plantation rats contribute to the damaging of fronds, oil palm flowers, 

and fruits, thereby significantly affecting yield. 

As an Integrated Pest Management solution, Kencana Agri has been controlling rat 

population by breeding and releasing owls. They are natural predators of rats and 

serve as an optimal solution. By applying this measure, we have been able to minimise 

chemical rat bait use in the plantation since 2011 at all estates. 

As for other most common pests in our operations such as rhinoceros beetles, bunch moths, 

bagworms, and nettle caterpillars, we planted species of plants known to attract natural 

predators of the major leaf eating pests of oil palms, including bagworms and caterpillars 

to flourish by planting Turnera subulata, Turnera ulmifolia, Antigononleptopus, Cassia 

tora, and Nephrolepis.

Moreover, to control Metisanaplana, a pesky caterpillar native to West and Central 

Sulawesi region, the Group cultivates Turnera Subulata, Turneraulmifolia, Cassia tora, 

Euphorbia heterophylla, and Antigonon leptopus which are planted at each block 

alongside palm oil crops. These plants contain nectar and pollen that serve as a food 

source for parasitic insects and natural predators of caterpillars, ultimately bringing pest 

populations under control.

OWL 

Owls helps us control rat population. Thanks 

to our owl troops we managed to control rats, 

reach our optimum yield, and minimise the use 

of harmful chemical pesticides. We placed nest 

boxes around the perimeter of our plantations to 

invite barn owls to nest. 

By the end of 2020, our estates are home to a 

total 242 adult Owls (Tyto alba), 272 juveniles 

as well as 151 unhatched eggs. These 242 adult 

Owls help us safeguard up to 12.673 Ha.

TURNERA ULMIFOLIA 

Turnera Subulata blooms every 8 AM in 

the morning. This flower is originally 

from Mexico and the West Indies. Aside 

from helping make the plantations look 

more colorful, the flower is also the 

perfect home for Sycanus. The flower 

becomes a food source and host plant 

for Sycanus, the predators of leaf-feeding 

worms, so that the pest attack can be 

controlled and minimised. 

TURNERA SUBULATA 

Turnera subulate is extensively 

cultivated throughout our 

estates as biological control 

for leaf-eating pests. The 

flower is the perfect home for 

Sycanus, a type of insect that 

hunts caterpillars and worms 

that can damage oil palms. 

This beautiful flower has been 

helping us to suppress and 

minimise pest attack. 

ANTIGONON LEPTOPUS 

Antigonon leptopus 

is regarded as an 

environmental weed in 

many parts of the world. It 

is flowering shrubs which 

host a range of predators 

of leaf-eating pests. This 

powerful beauty help us 

in our integrated pest 

management approaches.

regarding sustainable palm oil

These practices are aligned and support the SDG 12 

(Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 

(Climate Action), SDG 15 (Life on Land).

Kencana Agri’s NDPE policy emphasises than high 

carbon stock (HCS) forest and high conservation 

value (HCV) areas in all estates with in our operations 

must be protected and conserved. We use The High 

Conservation Value Resources Network (HCVRN) and 

High Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA), as well as the 

ISPO and ISCC standard to identified these areas. 

Our approach towards nature conservation includes 

continual improvement of our High Conservation Value 

(HCV) area monitoring, internal capacity building, 

engagement with local communities and other oil 

palm plantation companies, as well as partnerships 

with academic and research institutions, NGOs and 

governmental organizations.  

We ensure to conduct HCV studies for all new 

development areas, through accredited independent 

HCV assessors, and implements a management 

strategy that focuses on these following key aspects: 

•	 Preservation of river border lines. 

•	 Cultivation local trees in HCV area 

•	 Educating the local community on the importance 

of preserving HCV areas. 

•	 Regularly monitoring river water quality. 

•	 HCV areas are regularly monitored and audited by 

the internal sustainability team. 

•	 Recording every wildlife species found in the 

estates, and taking notes of those classified as 

vulnerable and above on the list of protected 

species under Ministry of Environment and Forestry 

Regulation No. P.106 of 2018 on Preservation of 

Flora and Fauna. 

As of December 2020, a total of more than 18,081 

hectares at our palm oil estates is conserved. [GRI 304-4]

Fire Prevention

Forest fires pose a huge risk for both our employees and 

the communities living in and around our estates. It 

also jeopardises the livelihoods of the local community 

and impacts to our operations requiring resources to 

be diverted to suppress any fires risk. 

We are taking proactive measures to ensure that we 

explore further ways to develop more robust fire 

prevention measures. Our plantations are designed 

to help us manage the risk of fire better and faster. 

Canals were constructed between our plantations 

with areas with high fire risks. Small fireboats and 

patrol cars which are equipped with water pumps are 

always in standby in the perimeter of those canals 






Kencana Agri Limited

We recognise that investment in fire prevention through 

education and capability building is more effective 

than having a world-class suppression capability. We 

cooperate with government authorities on a range 

of community and education-based prevention 

initiatives to ensure that fires are not started within 

our concessions and take all necessary precautions to 

ensure fires are prevented.

We collaborate with the Manggala Agni team, a special 

unit under the Ministry of Environment and Forestry 

specially appointed to control forest fires, in firefighting 

simulations training for our Kalimantan estates. The 

training that our team received from Manggala Agni was 

specifically aimed to monitor, manage, and ultimately 

eliminate forest fires, as well as how to conduct emergency 

procedures such as evacuations during such events. 





Fire incident throughout 

2020 at all operation areas. 

In order to advance our prevention initiatives, we have utilized a satellite mapping program that has the 

capability to track hotspots throughout the country since 2018. This program is implemented Group-

wide at all operation, including fire management and monitoring by our top management at the Group’s 

head office. This way, our estates and the Jakarta head office can conduct joint monitoring of hotspots 

located throughout the perimeter of Kencana Agri’s estates.

   45 

 

    employees 

from Kencana Agri (AEK, SKL, and ATK) joined 

firefighting simulation trainings from Manggala 

Agni in 2020 as an continuous effort to monitor, 

manage, and ultimately eliminate forest fires, as 

well as how to conduct emergency procedures 

such as evacuations during such events. 

     47 

          security personals  

From our Kutai region operations (SKL, AEK,

TAMAN GIZI

Building an Economically and  

Food Independent Community







We started the Taman Gizi and Palm Sugar 

Development Program in late September 2018. 

It was first initiated by an socio-economic 

assessments on the needs and economic potentials 

of the villages and its surrounding areas. 

The assessment results showed that there was 

a vast potentials in the area for the cultivation of 

vegetables, fruit and spices as there are constant 

need of vegetables, fruit and spices from the local 

community in the villages and its surrounding 

region, which then still majorly supplied from and 

dependant to other region. On the other hand, 

there is an increasing need of jobs and income for 

the locals. 

After a consultative engagement with the local 

communities leaders and members, we designed 

Taman Gizi - Vegetable, Fruit and Spices Cultivation 

Program. The program aims to create an 

economically and food independent community. 

The program encompasses several key activities, 

namely assistance in the provision of vegetable 

seeds, material for fertilisers, and routing training 

and mentoring session which is conducted once a 

week every Sunday. 

We are targeting the local communities members 

in Pengguren Jaya Village, Batu Engau in the region 

of Paser as the main beneficiaries of this program, 

totalling to 28 PKK members. Routine socializations 

of the Taman Gizi program is continuously carried 

out together with the village official to support 

the sustainability of the program and maintain 

participants’ enthusiasm.

This program covers the following practical 

training activities:

1. Producing Local Micro Organisms (MOL) 

from natural materials, which will be used 

as compost or organic fertilizer processing 

materials.

2. Producing organic fertilizers that utilize 

plantation and agricultural waste, such as 

jangkos, solids, and rice husks, and using MOL 

as a decomposing material.

3. Making permanent beds as a medium for 

growing vegetables, where this method has 

the advantage, namely the land that does not 

need to be hoed again.

4. Nursery particular type of fruits, vegetables, 

and spices, namely spinach, kale, bok-choy, 

long beans, green beans, chilies, etc. Fruits 

include papaya, banana and spices, namely 

lemongrass, ginger, kencur, and many others.

5. Planting seeds and seedlings training

6. Plant maintenance training

7. Basic marketing training

In its development, the Taman Gizi program has 

expanded and integrated into a government 

program called Dasa Wisma Program that now 

covers of three neighbourhood associations. 

The program has been successful in knowledge 

transfer and skill enhancement for the local 

community in vegetable, fruit and spice cultivation, 

which ultimately help them to generate income 

and improve welfare. Weekly harvests are first 

distributed to the participant of the program 

for their own consumption and sold to the local 

villages market to generate revenues.

We identified that the palm oil industry is exposed to 

the risk of child labour which is driven by the nature 

of its operations and the culture and socio-economic

child labour, and we rigorously enforce these principles

18 years. On that note, our recruitment officers check 

identification cards of all prospective employees.

all operational sites for our employees and workers so 

they do not bring their children to the workplace and 

rest assured for the child safety and well-being while 

the parents are at work. [GRI 408-1]

Regarding forced labour, the Group strictly against 

forced labour of any kind. We address key risks of 

forced labour including, but not limited to, prohibiting 

workers paying fees for employment, requiring 

employment terms and conditions to be provided 

and explained clearly to all employees prior to any 

work engagements with adequate time for review, 

providing contracts in both the worker’s language, 

and prohibiting requirements to post bonds or make 

deposits as a condition of employment. [GRI 409-1]
