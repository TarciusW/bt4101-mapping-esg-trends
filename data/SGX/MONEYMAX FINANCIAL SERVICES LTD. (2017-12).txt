SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AT MONEYMAX

Sustainability is often defined as development which 

fulfils present needs without compromising the 

needs of future generations. MoneyMax considers 

sustainability as a critical factor to our long-term 

growth. We are pleased to present our inaugural 

Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 

December 2017 (“FY2017”), highlighting the economic, 

environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors 

that are material to our stakeholders and our strategy 

in managing these expectations.

The key expectations of our respective stakeholders 

are major considerations that the Group takes into 

account when formulating our business strategies. This 

ensures that the Group is able to optimise its financial 

and human capital resources in a manner that generates 

growth that will be sustainable in the long term. With 

our focus on customer centricity and innovation, we 

believe 

that 

the 

Group will continue 

to break through the 

traditional frontiers 

of the pawnbroking 

industry.

BOARD STATEMENT

MESSAGE FROM

EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CEO



“Our strategy towards sustainable growth is 

anchored upon 4 main tenets: prudent financial 

management, being a trusted provider of financial 

solutions, the provision of a diverse and progressive 

workplace, and corporate social responsibility.”

Dato’ Sri Dr. Lim Yong Guan 

Sustainability Report 2017

STRATEGISING FOR THE FUTURE 

Our focus on innovation and service standards has 

underscored the Group’s rapid growth over the past 

decade. As we strive to balance our commitments 

towards our ever-expanding pool of stakeholders, it 

has become apparent that there is a growing need 

to shift our focus towards achieving growth that 

would be sustainable in the future. In many ways, 

this Sustainability Report serves as a marker for the 

Group’s paradigm shift towards achieving sustainable 

growth, and I am delighted to be presented with the 

opportunity to share the highlights of our progress 

with you.

From the conceptualisation of the modern-day 

pawnbroking outlet to the Group’s foray into the 

digitalisation of our services, the knack of altering 

the status quo to cater to the changing needs of 

our consumers has been a key business aspect of 

MoneyMax. The challenges of achieving sustainable 

growth are numerous and complex, yet the underlying 

philosophy remains the same. 

The Board recognises the importance of sustainability 

and how it can contribute to our business strategy, 

operations and performance. To this end, the Board 

has considered sustainability issues as part of its 

strategic formulation, determined the material ESG 

factors highlighted in this Sustainability Report, and 

is responsible for overseeing the management and 

monitoring of these material ESG factors.

Our sustainability efforts are led by senior management 

and our Board oversees and manages the direction, 

approach, and performance of our sustainability 

goals against our business strategy. Our strategy 

towards sustainable growth is anchored upon 4 

main tenets: prudent financial management, being a 

trusted provider of financial solutions, the provision of 

a diverse and progressive workplace, and corporate 

social responsibility. 

We view financial prudence as being fundamental to 

maintaining a competitive advantage in our businesses. 

The Group also places a heavy emphasis on corporate 

governance, anti-corruption and anti-fraud measures 

as part of our on-going commitment towards being a 

trusted and transparent provider of financial solutions 

for our consumers.

Our workplaces are designed in a manner to provide 

our employees with a conducive working environment. 

We are committed to ensuring that our employees are 

afforded equal opportunities and benefits, regardless 

of their gender or age. We also believe in empowering 

individuals within the Group and leaving a positive 

impact in our local communities.

Through this report, we hope that you will get a sense 

of the rationale behind the various measures that have 

been implemented across the Group. You will also see 

how these seemingly distinct policies come together 

to create value that is sustainable to our stakeholders.

Sustainability is at its essence a balancing act that 

requires our stakeholders to be constantly engaged. 

This Sustainability Report represents an important 

facet of this engagement. There is so much more to 

the story of MoneyMax than just revenues and profits. 

We will continue to work towards the frontiers of 

sustainable growth and we hope that you join us on 

this journey as well.

Dato’ Sri Dr. Lim Yong Guan 

Executive Chairman &amp; CEO

GROUP BUSINESSES

PAWNBROKING

The provision of pawnbroking services is a primary 

business of the Group. To cater to the needs of our 

consumers, the Group has strategically positioned 

its outlets in highly accessible locations across 

Singapore. In addition to our extended operating 

hours, our outlets are also conceptualised and 

modelled in a manner that allows our customers 

to experience our services in a professional and 

friendly environment.

The availability of pawnbroking services provides 

an alternative source of short-term financing 

that is convenient and lawful. This also steers 

the public away from resorting to illicit forms of 

moneylending. The Group extends loans to our 

pawners on a pre-determined loan to value ratio that is based on the valuation of their collateral assets (“pledges”). 

These pledges are often items such as gold jewellery, diamonds, gemstones, timepieces and other luxury items.

The Group recognises that there is a need to provide an environment that is safe and secure for our pawners. 

Our outlets are equipped with advanced security systems and storage facilities, and are kept under round-the-

clock surveillance. The Group also engages an independent external security firm to constantly monitor our alarm 

systems. The pledges of our pawners are insured in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the Registry 

of Pawnbrokers.

The Group is governed by and strictly adheres to the prevailing laws under the Pawnbrokers Act 2015 and the 

directions of the Registry of Pawnbrokers for its pawnbroking business in Singapore



RETAIL

From the pawnbroking business, the Group has also 

expanded into the retail and trading business for luxury 

products. Our operations comprise the retail and trading 

of new and pre-owned luxury products such as gold, 

jewellery, timepieces and handbags.  Leveraging on our 

pawnbroking business, the retail and trading of new 

and pre-owned luxury items expands on the Group’s 

core competencies of retail outreach, customer-centric 

service and valuation expertise to increase our range 

of products and services. Besides our brick and mortar 

outlets, consumers can also access our 3-in-1 online 

platform to shop, sell and appraise valuables.

Our supply chain for our retail and trading business is 

primarily made up of manufacturers and second-hand 

luxury goods dealers. To cater to the preferences of our 

vast consumer base, the Group sources its products on a global scale, with our suppliers being based across Asia, 

the Middle East, and Europe.

To ensure the quality of our products, each individual item undergoes stringent quality and authentication checks 

by our trained employees before reaching the shelves of our retail stores. The Group also engages our suppliers 

in constant feedback to ensure the quality of our products. 

Aside from being a luxury products retailer, MoneyMax also creates value for customers by providing an avenue 

for them to sell their pre-owned items to us.

GOVERNANCE

16     MoneyMax Financial Services Ltd.

Sustainability Report 2017

LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND CORPORATE 

GOVERNANCE

The pawnbroking industry is heavily regulated under 

the Pawnbrokers Act 2015 and the Pawnbrokers 

Rules 2015. The whole gambit of our operations, 

from the application for our pawnbroking licences 

to our monthly operational reporting obligations, are 

governed by these regulations. 

As a company listed on the Catalist Board of the 

SGX-ST, MoneyMax is further regulated by the 

Catalist Rules, particularly in relation to transparency 

and disclosure requirements. The Group’s financial 

statements are  audited by an independent external 

auditor and the Group also engages an external 

professional firm to carry out internal audits on the 

Group, the results of which are communicated to the 

Audit Committee and the Board. 

MoneyMax undertakes periodic reviews of the Group’s 

decision making process and operational policies to 

ensure compliance with these prevailing regulations 

and guidelines such as anti-money laundering (“AML”) 

regulations. 

The Group has a policy of strict compliance with 

the AML regulations applicable to the pawnbroking 

industry. Our employees are trained to perform 

basic customer profiling and further due diligence 

when necessary. New developments or changes to 

existing regulations are communicated directly to our 

operational and management staff via our established 

communication channels and the Group’s work and 

training processes will be updated accordingly. 

The Group has also established a risk and compliance 

team which regularly conducts random checks on our 

outlets to ensure that our AML policies are adhered 

to. Our risk and compliance team ensures that our 

operational practices are compliant with the prevailing 

regulations and guidelines.

Target: The Group intends to conduct more training 

and refresher sessions for our employees to ensure 

that they are kept up to date with any changes to AML 

regulations.

CONSUMER EXPERIENCE AND PRODUCT 

RESPONSIBILITY

MoneyMax views the adoption of a customer centric 

business model that prioritises service quality to our 

consumers as a key facet of our long-term growth 

strategy. The Group is committed to providing each 

and every consumer with financial solutions that are 

fair and transparent. Our customer feedback platform 

handled by our administrative staff also serves as 

a crucial component of our Customer Relationship 

Management process.

As part of the Group’s on-going commitment to service 

quality, the Group has also been a member of CaseTrust 

since 2008. CaseTrust is the accreditation arm of the 

Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), and 

is Singapore’s de facto standard for companies who 

wish to demonstrate their commitment to fair trading 

and transparency to its consumers. Our Executive 

Chairman and CEO, Dato Sri’ Dr Lim Yong Guan, is 

also a Council Member of the Singapore Pawnbrokers’ 

Association. 

Our retail employees are required to attend our in-

house authentication and valuation training sessions in 

relation to the goods dealt with at our outlets to ensure 

that they provide quality service to our consumers.

The Group is also pleased to announce that there were 

no incidents of non-compliance with consumer laws 

for FY2017. 

Target: The Group targets to maintain its track record 

of zero incidents of non-compliance for FY2018.

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-FRAUD

MoneyMax is committed to maintaining strict standards 

of business conduct to safeguard the interests of our 

stakeholders. The Group maintains a strict policy 

towards dishonest and corrupt practices and has in 

place various policies and procedures to ensure that 

our practices, both administrative and operational, are 

in compliance with anti-corruption and anti-fraud laws. 

The Group has in place a well-established whistle-

blowing process that ensures that any identified 

potential or actual improprieties in financial reporting, 

fraud, 

corruption, 

bribery 

or 

regulatory 

non-

compliance will be independently investigated by the 

Audit Committee and appropriately dealt with. Details 

of our whistle-blowing policies and arrangements are 

made readily available to all employees. 

It is also the policy of the Group to provide assurance 

that whistle-blowers will be protected from reprisal 

within the limits of the law. Our risk and compliance 

team is tasked to oversee and monitor this area of 

compliance and reports directly to the Management 

with access to the Audit Committee. The Audit 

Committee reports to the Board on such matters at 

the Board meetings. 

The Group places heavy emphasis on ethical business 

conduct and all our employees are expected to conduct 

themselves in accordance with the expectations set 

out in the Employee Handbook of the Group. The 

Employee Handbook sets out the core values of the 

Group as well as the behaviour standards that are 

expected of our employees. The Group takes a serious 

view of unethical conduct or malpractice in relation to 

corruption or fraud and employees who are found to 

be engaged in such conduct will be subject to formal 

disciplinary proceedings.

The Group is pleased to share that no whistle-blowing 

reports were received for FY2017. The Group is also 

pleased to report that there were no reported incidents 

in relation to anti-corruption and anti-fraud regulations 

for FY2017.

Target: The Group targets to maintain its track record 

of having zero reported incidents in relation to anti-

corruption and anti-fraud regulations for the financial 

year ending 31 December  2018 (“FY2018”).

DATA PRIVACY

In line with our customer centric philosophy, MoneyMax is committed to ensuring that the personal 

information of our customers is adequately protected. The Group limits the collection of personal data to 

such information as is required by the relevant regulators such as the Personal Data Protection Council. 

In order to minimise the risk of information outflow, the Group has implemented stringent data policies 

and procedures that our employees are required to abide by. These policies are designed to ensure 

compliance with the relevant regulations (including the Personal Data Protection Act). Printed copies of 

customers’ information are not maintained at the outlets but kept at our headquarters. Our employees are 

also contractually obliged to keep confidential all information communicated to them in the course of their 

employment. The Group further limits the data access rights of our employees to their scope of work as a 

measure to manage data privacy risks. 

In FY2017, there were no substantiated complaints received concerning breaches of customer privacy, or any 

identified losses of customer data.

Target: The Group intends to bring data regulations compliance within the purview of our risk and compliance 

team for FY2018. The team will conduct random checks on our operations across Singapore on a regular 

basis, to ensure that our data privacy policies are being adhered to.





RISK MANAGEMENT

The Management regularly reviews the Group’s procedures in accordance with the Enterprise Risk Management 

Framework. This framework ensures that our management is able to systematically identify risks, determine 

the probability and impact of each risk, assess the appropriateness of the existing risk controls, and implement 

additional risk controls where necessary.  

The management also holds regular meetings with our risk and compliance team to review their findings. 

The information gathered provides current data to the management and facilitates the identification and 

mitigation of any risks that may arise.

GENDER DIVERSITY

Gender diversity is a core component of the Group’s human resource strategy as we look to balance the 

representation of both genders within the Group.  Our workforce comprises a total of 85 males and 214 females 

on a permanent, full-time basis. Our female leaders account for over half of the top and middle management 

positions in the Group. Career progression and remuneration within the Group is based on meritocracy. The Group 

also adopts a strict policy against any form of discrimination within the workforce.

The Group is pleased to report that there were no incidents of gender discrimination for FY2017.

MULTI-GENERATIONAL

MoneyMax embraces age diversity within 

our workforce by focusing on both recruiting 

the talents of tomorrow and retaining 

the experience and skills of our veteran 

employees. The Group’s multi-generational 

workforce brings a degree of dynamism to 

the organisation that is essential for us to 

cater our services to consumers across all 

age groups.

COMMUNITY

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 

MoneyMax believes in empowering individuals within 

our company and making an impact in our local 

community. Through our initiatives and donations, we 

strive to leave a positive impact on these beneficiaries.

The Group has participated and contributed to the 

fundraising and charity activities of various charitable 

organisations, including Sian Chay Medical Institution 

(a charitable organisation registered with the Ministry 

of Health of Singapore which offers traditional Chinese 

medicine treatment and provides free medical care 

to the local community), and Radin Mas Citizens’ 

Consultative 

Committee 

(“CCC”) 

Community 

Development and Welfare Fund.

The Group is pleased to report that our donations 

to these causes totalled to an amount of S$81,763 in 

FY2017.



MoneyMax also adheres to labour practices and 

regulations to ensure all employees enjoy fair and 

just treatment, not only in terms of rewards and 

opportunities, but in the course of carrying out daily 

operations. MoneyMax is committed to continuing to 

seek for more ways to promote sustainability and to 

leave a positive impact on society.

Target: The Group targets to participate in local 

outreach programmes with a specific focus on the 

elderly in FY2018. Through these programmes, the 

Group hopes to promote a culture of giving back to 

the society as well as a culture of volunteerism within 

the Group.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

MoneyMax places great emphasis on growth that is 

environmentally sustainable. Our internal policies and 

practices are designed to optimise the management of 

energy, water and waste within the Group. MoneyMax 

maintains a core commitment towards maximising 

the environmental efficiency of our operations and 

towards building a cleaner future for everyone.

The Group is pleased to report that there were 

no 

reports/incidences 

of 

non-compliance 

with 

environmental laws and regulations for FY2017.

WASTE MANAGEMENT &amp; RECYCLING 

Inherent in the retail of pre-owned luxury products 

is the recycling of pre-owned items like jewellery, 

handbags and timepieces for sale.  We purchase pre-

owned items, and professionally refurbish them into 

a rejuvenated state for sale to our customers.  In this 

way, we are prolonging the useful life of these items 

and reducing wastage.  We also create value as these 

pre-owned items fetch economic value for the sellers 

instead of being kept in storage or disposed after a 

period of time.   

The Group also has the facilities and expertise to 

recycle our aged inventory into raw materials such as 

gold and loose gemstones. Selected gold items may 

be sold to third party refineries which are recycled by 

them for the production of new gold bars. 

The Group has launched the following policies aimed 

at reducing the amount of waste produced by the 

organisation as a whole:

• 

By encouraging double-sided printing in our 

workplaces

• 

By encouraging the submission of electronic 

operation/management reports

• 

By encouraging the recycling/reuse of used 

materials wherever possible

Precautionary Principle

Principle. However, given the Group’s current scale 

of operations, we have not undertaken any specific 

measures to apply the Precautionary Principle or 

approach.
