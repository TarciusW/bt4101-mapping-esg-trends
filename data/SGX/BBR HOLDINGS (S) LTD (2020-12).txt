1 MESSAGE FROM THE GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 

It gives me great pleasure to present our Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 

December 2020 ("FY2020”). In our Sustainability Report, we highlight the progress and achievements 

of our organisation over the previous 12 months, with particular focus on our commitment to 

working alongside our valued stakeholders to build a sustainable business based on our resilience, 

adaptability and innovation.  

Our Board recognises the importance of sustainability in our Group’s business operations and 

performance and oversees the overall strategic plan including considering sustainability and 

environmental issues as part of our strategic formulation. Our sustainability efforts are led by the 

management and our Board oversees and manages the direction, approach and performance of our 

sustainability goals against our strategy and business objectives. Our Board concurs with the 

management on the material Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors identified by them 

and their monitoring process. 

It is our belief that building a sustainable business is vital to our continued success and that we must 

be fully accountable for our impact on the environment, our customers, our people and our 

community as well as its financial performance.  

The delivery of sustainable results is a critical aspect of our ability to remain strong and financially 

stable. Acknowledging this helps to put into focus our commitment to principles laid out in our 

Corporate Sustainability Policy. Our responsibility to society is to ensure that sustainable practices 

are incorporated into every link of our value chain. We must meet the needs not only of our 

customers, employees and the community we operate in, but also those of our environment and our 

future generations.  

This report provides details about how we have met our responsibilities with our key stakeholders 

during FY2020 and beyond.

2 ABOUT THE REPORT 

This sustainability report articulates our commitment to sustainability and transparency. The report 

is designed to provide a transparent and balanced view of BBR Holdings (S) Ltd (the “Company”) and 

its subsidiaries (the “Group”), to reflect the interests of our key stakeholders, and to address those 

interests pragmatically. This report aims to include comprehensive and accessible information on the 

company’s strategy towards sustainability, key issues as well as data according to recognized 

standards.  

2.1 Report Scope 

The report covers the performance of our consolidated entities in financial year 2020 (“FY2020”) 

from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. The content of this report will focus on the sustainability 

performance, activities and initiatives that are under our direct control, including our Singapore 

offices and operations, our local supply chain as well as any overseas activities directly associated 

with us. This report excludes joint ventures and associate companies which are not directly under 

our control. Material issues and topics described in this report have been selected according to their 

level of significance within the company boundaries, the sustainability context and the expectations 

of stakeholders which are reflective of our core business in a consistent manner for comparability of 

our performance indicators across time. In this respect, this report covers our General Construction, 

Specialised Engineering, Property Development and Green Technology business segments in our 

material operational boundaries in Singapore and Malaysia. Our corporate governance and 

sustainability approaches are drawn from the policies and practices set at Group level. 

This sustainability report focuses on the Group’s sustainability strategies and practices whilst 

highlighting the economic, environmental, and social and governance aspects of our activities and 

developments. The report aims to provide an overview of our approach, priorities and targets, as 

well as a performance review for our key sustainability areas.  

2.2 Report Methodology 

We have prepared our report in accordance with the requirements set out in the Global Reporting 

Initiative’s (GRI) Standards Sustainability Reporting Guidelines: Core Level. We have chosen the GRI 

Standards reporting guidelines for its robust guidance which offers an international reference for the 

disclosure of governance approach and of the environmental, social and economic performance and 

impacts of organizations. This report also takes into consideration the primary components of the 

report content as set out by the Singapore Exchange’s (SGX’s) “Comply or Explain” requirements for 

sustainability reporting. Our data are reported in good faith and to the best of our knowledge. We 

will continue to improve our data collection processes.  

We did not seek external assurance for this report. 

2.3 Report Structure 

This Sustainability Report is structured to reflect the interests of our key stakeholders. We have 

identified five key stakeholder groups, namely, the environment and future generations, employees, 

customers, suppliers and communities. For each stakeholder group, we lay out our management 

approaches that govern how our material issues are identified as well as how the issues are 

prioritized and managed. Further, we will present our initiatives relating to sustainability in the areas 

of environmental, social and governance issues relevant to our aspects and boundaries. Finally, we 

will provide the information of our key performance indicators, performance targets and outcomes.

3 CORPORATE PROFILE 

3.1 Vision and Mission 

We believe it is our responsibility to manage the Group successfully on a sustainable long-term basis. 

We are committed to deliver greater value and returns to our shareholders, business partners and 

employees. 

As one of Singapore’s leading construction groups with more than 20 years of industry experience. 

Our missions are to: 

 Strengthen our capabilities continuously in order to compete in the building and construction, 

civil engineering and property markets;  

 Provide our clients with innovative structural engineering solutions for green and sustainable 

buildings by leveraging on our strengths and expertise in high specification construction 

methods, Swiss parentage, strong track record, established reputation and dynamic 

management team; and 

 Enhance greater opportunities in new markets, so as to further expand our geographical 

presence and intensify all efforts to bid for both building and infrastructure projects in the 

region. 

Our employees operate according to a set of core values that guide all aspects of our business. We 

recognise that cooperation, communication and trust are essential for us to collaborate to compete, 

and that care and concern through respect, patience, empathy and consideration are essential, both 

between each other and among the communities in which we operate. 

3.2 Governance 

Our Board of Directors (the Board) has oversight over all corporate governance and operational 

matters relating to our business. For corporate sustainability, the Board is supported by the 

Corporate Sustainability Committee (CSC) which is chaired by our Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 

and includes designated senior executives. CSC provides leadership and approval over corporate 

sustainability matters such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plan, community investment and 

environmental initiatives. Supported by CSC, our Corporate Sustainability Champion (Champion) is 

our Subject Matter Expert (SME) in the area of corporate sustainability, and pro-actively raises 

awareness through education and training across the organization. Through the Corporate 

Sustainability Work Group (CSWG), our Champion engages businesses and functions in collectively 

executing the CSR plan, identifying and managing the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) 

Factors as well as engaging sustainability stakeholders. Businesses and functions provide back-to-

back assurance over the quality of information for sustainability reporting.

4 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS 

We believe corporate social responsibility is a key driver towards long-term sustainability. Such 

responsibility is pragmatically integrated into our business practices as one of the core values in our 

corporate culture. Embedding such responsibility into our management processes across the value 

chain allows us to establish credibility among our stakeholders. Through our action today, we play a 

part in influencing the environment for our future generations. Through integrating the notion of 

sustainability in our business, we ensure that our business strategy and operations are in line with a 

long-term vision towards a conducive and sustainability future. 

The Group’s business currently comprises four core business segments spanning across General 

Construction, Specialised Engineering, Property Development and Green Technology.

4.1 Sustainability Management Framework 

In July 2017, we took the initiative to establish our sustainability reporting framework. We 

performed an analysis on our business and operation models as the basis for our stakeholder 

mapping and materiality assessment. Through our analysis, we identified five key stakeholder groups 

within our sustainability context and their respective material issues are to be shown in this report. 

4.2 Key Stakeholders and Material Issues 

We have a regular review, assessment and feedback process in relation to Environmental, Social and 

Governance (ESG) topics. Key to this is our regular risk assessment exercise which entails the 

identification, assessment and documentation of material risks and corresponding internal controls. 

Such material risks include fraud and corruption, environmental, health and safety, and human 

capital risks which are ESG-relevant. We are continuously improving the adequacy and effectiveness 

of our Risk Assessment and Control Self-Assessment processes in response to changing business and 

operation environment.

Through regular stakeholder engagement, we identify and review material issues that are most 

relevant and significant to us and our stakeholders. For external stakeholders, priority is given to 

issues important to society and applicable to us. Then, we prioritize our sustainability efforts and 

report issues that are most material to its business and stakeholders. Considering that specific 

stakeholders and material issues are specific in countries and locations, we are reporting the 

stakeholder engagement and material issues for our Singapore and Malaysia operations in this

4.3 Alignment with International Initiatives 

4.3.1 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

Established in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations (UN), the General Assembly occupies a 

central position as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United 

Nations. Comprising all 193 Members of the United Nations, it provides a unique forum for 

multilateral discussion of the full spectrum of international issues covered by the Charter. It also 

plays a significant role in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law. 

On 25 September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable 

development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years. Although 

the SDGs are primarily aimed at governments, they represent an important opportunity for 

businesses to also act for a more sustainable world. We will use SDGs as one of the guiding principles 

for our sustainability initiatives. 

We acknowledge that our participation in reaching the SDGs has room for improvement. As we 

advance on our sustainability journey, we will continue to assess our alignment with the SDGs and, 

whenever possible, redirect our internal priorities and sustainability strategy to more effectively and 

comprehensively address the goals. 

SDGs Logo Source: http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/news/communications-material 

SDG Goal 

Relevant Targets to Our Businesses 

(Source: 

http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org) 

Our Participation 

 

13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising 

and human and institutional capacity on 

climate change mitigation, adaptation, 

impact reduction and early warning. 

We have our own internal processes and 

environmental policies to reduce electricity 

and fuel consumption. Our approach to 

mitigating climate change includes staff 

training and implementing energy-efficient 

measures. We monitor and report our GHG 

emissions and set reduction targets. 

 

15.1: By 2020, ensure the conservation, 

restoration 

and 

sustainable 

use 

of 

terrestrial 

and 

inland 

freshwater 

ecosystems and their services, in particular 

forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, 

in line with obligations under international 

agreements. 

All the paper used in our offices are either 

Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified or 

made from KHAN-NA. We actively promote 

the 

use 

of 

such 

papers 

across 

our 

organisation. Through that, the Company 

supports efforts in mitigating global warming 

and the creation of positive rural community 

engagement, job opportunity, and better 

livelihood for the farmers and members of 

the community. 

 

 

 

 

 

The following SDG goals are relevant to our 

business, operations and value chain. They are 

addressed in our various policies at group level. 

Such goals are also embedded in various 

initiatives carried out across the organization.

We do not believe these goals are relevant to our 

business or industry. They are not within our 

boundaries and scope of influence; therefore, we 

are currently unable to make noticeable 

contributions to such goals. 

 

 

 

 

 

4.3.2 

United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)  

The United Nations (UN) Global Compact is a United Nations initiative to encourage businesses 

worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies, and to report on their 

implementation. The UN Global Compact is a principle-based framework for businesses, stating ten

5 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

We believe that good Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practice goes hand-in-hand with good 

corporate management practice. We also recognize that it is vital that our management approaches 

are adaptable to the dynamics of business and operation environment in such a way that we can 

continuously assess our impacts, develop sustainability objectives and respond in a proper manner 

to meet our stakeholders’ expectations. Our CSR framework is based on our approach to 

sustainability and includes policies and measurement mechanisms to monitor the impacts made by 

our businesses and operations. 

Key to the success of our sustainability programme is regular and up-to-date communication about 

our CSR policies and activities to all our stakeholders, and the provision of appropriate feedback 

mechanisms so that we can monitor and evaluate how we are doing and explore new possibilities 

stimulated by stakeholder responses. We see our sustainability reports as being a critical component 

of this continuous cycle of communication and evaluation. The overall sustainability context of the 

stakeholder engagements is managed through our CSR plan for our sustainability governance 

oversight.

5.1 Protecting Our Environment for the Future Generations 

5.1.1 

Our Approach 

We are committed to maintaining and building on the same stringent environmental policies and 

standards as our parent company and key regional affiliates. We continually seek new and 

innovative ways to reduce the environmental impact of our products and services while maintaining 

the highest levels of quality. We recognise our responsibility to protect the environment for the 

health and wellbeing of future generations.  

5.1.2 

Reduction of Carbon Footprint 

We recognize that the effective management and monitoring of its carbon footprint can reduce 

operating costs, raise brand profile, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholder value. Our 

carbon footprint is measured in terms of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission. However, GHG emission 

is an absolute measure of how much carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is emitted. Our GHG emission, 

arising mainly from energy consumption, are from direct (Scope 1) emission and indirect (Scope 2) 

emission. We do not include the GHG emission generated by our suppliers (Scope 3).  

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our GHG emission 

efficiency index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. To this end, we have set a 

target for GHG emission efficiency improvement of 10% from our 2017 level by 2030. Our target for 

GHG emission improvement is 0.8% per year. Although various business lines and operations 

account for different percentage of GHG emissions across the organization, they all support this 

target and have aligned our environmental objectives accordingly. 

Additionally, recognising that there is basic energy consumption requirement, we also monitor 

actual consumption of electricity in kWh. Our electricity consumption in the base year FY2017 was 

1,002,470 kWh and we target an improvement of 10% from our base year level by 2030. Our target 

improvement is 0.8% per year. We will work towards achieving either of our target measured by 

GHG emission index or by actual electricity consumption in kWh. 

In FY2020, our GHG emission efficiency index stands at 41.10 in comparison to our base year FY2017 

of 19.1. The increase was due to lower level of revenue achieved in the year whilst our electricity 

consumption did not decrease proportionately as there is also basic consumption of electricity and 

fuels regardless of revenue. 

Based on our actual electricity consumption in terms of Kwh, our consumption had gone down over 

the years. We consumed 1,002,470 kWh in the base year FY2017. Our consumption went down over 

the years and 602,428 kWh was consumed in FY2020. The low electricity consumption was also 

partly due to the implementation of Circuit Breaker by the government in 2020, during which, the 

business operations were suspended.

5.1.3 

Reduction of Paper Consumption 

All our employees are urged to minimize paper wastage at work by adhering to our Internal Paper 

Usage Reduction Guidelines. For example, double-sided printing is set as a default, lower grammage 

paper is used for daily printing, and blank sides of unneeded single-sided copies are used for printing 

drafts. Paper re-use and recycling habits are also cultivated through initiatives such as our in-house 

reminders posted near the copy machines. 

All waste paper from our own offices is collected for recycling. Further, we encourage all employees 

to adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with an aim to further reduce paper 

consumption. 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our paper 

consumption index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over time. To this end, we have set 

a target for a paper consumption improvement of 10% from our 2017 level by 2030. Our target for 

paper consumption improvement is 0.8% per year. Although various business lines and operations 

account for different percentage of paper consumption across the organization, they all support this 

target and have aligned our environmental objectives accordingly.  

Additionally, recognising that there is paper consumption for non-revenue generating activities, we 

also monitor actual consumption of paper in kg. Our paper consumption in the base year FY2017 

was 8,002 kg and we target an improvement of 10% from our base year level by 2030. Our target 

improvement is 0.8% per year. We will work towards achieving either of our target measured by 

paper consumption index or by actual consumption in kg. 

In FY2020, we consumed a total of 6,961 kg of paper which was lower than the base year FY2017 as 

well as FY2019, during which 8,002 kg and 7,874 kg of paper was used respectively. 100% of our 

paper consumption are either Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified or made from KHAN-NA.  

Our paper consumption index was 61.48 in FY2020. The increase in paper consumption index from 

46.49 in base year FY2017 was due to lower level of revenue. However, comparing against FY2019, 

this is an improvement from last year’s index at 64.84.

5.1.4 

Promoting Green Practices  

We have embraced various green practices in our business and operation such as ISO 14001 and 

Green and Gracious Builders Award from Building &amp; Construction Authority (BCA). 

The ISO 14000 family of standards provides practical tools for companies and organizations of all 

kinds looking to manage their environmental responsibilities. ISO 14001:2015 sets out the criteria 

for an environmental management system and can be certified to. It maps out a framework that a 

company or organization can follow to set up an effective environmental management system. It can 

be used by any organization regardless of its activity or sector. Using ISO 14001:2015 provides 

assurance to our management and employees as well as external stakeholders that environmental 

impact is being measured and improved. 

Singapore Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd and Singa Development Pte Ltd are certified under the 

Green and Gracious Builder Scheme established by the Building and Construction Authority to. We 

have in place a Green and Gracious Policy to enhance environmental friendly workplace with 

minimum hazard and inconvenience to the public throughout the construction duration; and 

encourage all relevant stakeholders involved to execute the concept and practices through 

engagement of sub-contractors and suppliers to implement Green Products and/or advocate Green 

Concepts, and subsequently proposed to the customers to adopt such concept. 

Over the years, the Group had various green mark and construction environment including Green 

and Gracious awards and achievements as presented on Section 4.4 of this Sustainability Report. 

5.2 Caring for Our Employees 

5.2.1 

Our Approach 

Our people are our most valuable resource and investing in their professional and personal well-

being is vital to our business sustainability. Our goal is to establish work ethics among our employees, 

which are in line with our core values and code of conduct. They are the foundation upon which we 

build all our business initiatives and conduct our day-to-day activities.  

We recognise that a motivated workforce will convey a positive and powerful message to all our key 

stakeholders, such as our customers, suppliers and the members of the community. By attracting, 

nurturing, empowering and rewarding our employees, we create an environment conducive for 

innovation and inspiration flourish to further boost our competitiveness. Such commitment to our 

employees promotes a corporate culture of passion, quality, excellence and trust within the 

organization which reflect in our ability to create values to our stakeholders. 

Our Human Resource (HR) management principles and policies have been developed and 

established based on fair employment practices with the goal of attracting, supporting and 

maintaining a motivated workforce. Our HR policies cover key areas such as remuneration, benefits, 

health and safety, career development and training and are regularly reviewed by our management. 

We constantly seek feedback from our staff to ensure that our decisions are aligned as much as 

possible with their needs. 

Our business operates in an environment which comprises diverse races, cultures and geographic 

locations. With this in mind, our HR polices are implemented across the organization within the 

principles with pragmatism, taking into consideration of the prevailing laws and regulations as well 

as local culture, norms and racial sensitivity.

5.2.2 

Employment Practices 

Our employment practices focus on maximizing the strength of our employees by providing equal 

opportunities based on merits, and help our employees to develop strength through our 

comprehensive training and development programme. We regularly review the performance and 

development of our employees to effectively match their strength to their job specifications. Our 

performance based reward scheme provides guidance and motivation to our employee to perform 

to their potentials in alignment with the objectives of the company.  

5.2.2.1 

The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices  

We proactively pursue and adopt best practices in HR management. Our HR practices are guided by 

the Singapore Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. The Singapore 

Tripartite Alliance comprises the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore National Employers Federation 

and National Trades Union Congress. The Tripartite Alliance has formulated guidelines on fair 

employment practice for adoption by Singapore employers, embracing the recruitment, training, 

treatment and reward of employees.  

5.2.2.2 

Communications  

As our Company grows, effective communications across the organization are crucial to ensure 

continuous alignment of objectives of the employees and the organizational objectives. We achieve 

this through our various communication sessions customized based on target employees. 

Communication sessions for our managers are held on a regular basis. Agendas covered at these 

sessions are customized in appropriate to the target functional scope of the managers. For example, 

in monthly managers’ meeting, operational agendas such as leadership and operation issues may be 

discussed while at the quarterly sessions high level topics include strategic business directions, new 

service launches, ongoing developments and key project reviews.  

5.2.2.3 

Employee Feedback  

We value our employee’s expertise in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their feedbacks are 

important in the improvement of overall management and operation of the organization. Through 

various established processes of employee engagement, such as employee objective setting, 

performance review as well as exit interview in the case of resignations, we gather such valuable 

feedbacks for the continuous improvement of our organization. 

In addition, there are other feedback channels for areas specific to business and function, such as 

health and safety issues and compliance issues. Such feedbacks are managed by the leaders and 

managers of their specific business and function domain. We have also established reporting and 

escalation channel should the feedback requires the attention of higher management. 

5.2.2.4 

Career Development and Training 

We recognise that consistent and ongoing education is critical to maintaining a competitive, skilled, 

productive and motivated workforce. Employee career development and performance management 

established based on merits and contributing skill sets towards the organization objectives through 

objective settings and regular performance reviews. We continue to review and improve our career 

development and performance review process in light of the changing business and operation 

environment. 

Our training programme covers a variety of areas catering for employees with difference job scopes 

and skills set requirements. Our core training curriculum and contents are guided by well established 

industry and international standards such as ISO-9100, ISO-14000, OHSAS and bisSAFE. In addition, 


 

 

Sustainability Report 2020 



Page 19 of 33 

33 

 





specific training curriculums are developed based on the specific requirements of the specific 

businesses and functions. Training topics range from soft skills development in areas such as 

communications and leadership, to technical programmes covering project management and office 

productivity tools.  

In FY2020, employees each received an average of 2.8 hours of training. We recognized that the 

training requirements vary depending on the levels of management responsibilities. Each senior 

manager registered an average of 4.1 hours training while both managerial and non-managerial staff 

each received an average of 2.9 hours of training. In the light of changing business requirements and 

opportunities in variety of training methodologies, we continue to revise our training curriculum and 

programme to align with organization objectives and to strive for effectiveness and efficiency in our 

training approach.

5.2.3 

Workforce Diversity 

Our business thrives on diversity. As such, we leverage on a host of strengths and skills that can only 

come from a diverse workforce embracing employees from various ethnic groups, religion, age and 

gender.  

We have 1,073 employees in FY2020 (FY2019: 972). The information on our workforce profile is 

based on the number of employees in employment as at the end of the financial year. In FY2020, 93 

of our employees were female, comprising 9% of our workforce, while 980 (91%) employees were 

male. Given the nature of the construction business, the industry is dominated by male employees. 

In terms of management function, 4 females (14%) are senior management compared to 25 males 

(86%), 10 females (23%) held managerial positions compared to 33 males (77%), while 79 females 

(8%) and 922 males (92%) held non-managerial positions. The male to female ratio for managerial 

and non-managerial positions were 33:10 and 922:79 respectively. From age profile perspective, 

there were 390 employees below 30 years old. The number of employees between 30 and 50 years 

old was 545 as compared 138 employees above 50 years old.

In addition to the staff under our direct employment, we also have staff, such as cleaners, security 

guards and subcontract labour, under the employment of external service providers, working for us. 

The personnel not under our direct employment are excluded from our head count. 

We expect that all the contracted companies we work with will share our core principles of HR 

management practices. In our vendor selection process, we take into consideration of their HR 

management practices as one of the key selection and performance criteria. We regularly review the 

performance of our vendors based on these criteria as a key basis to determine whether to continue 

to engage the vendors with their services. 

5.2.4 

Employee Benefits 

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered by the Employment Act, which provides 

basic employment terms and working conditions including contract requirements, remuneration, 

hours of work, overtime, rest days and annual leave entitlement.  

In addition to the statutory benefits outlined in the Employment Act, we provide beyond-

compliance-level benefits to our fulltime employees. Examples of these benefits include paternity 

leave, compassionate leave, inpatient and outpatient medical insurances, dental, health screening, 

health talks. 

5.2.4.1 

Work–Life Balance  

While developing the talents of our employees and providing equal opportunities for them to excel 

are the key drivers for our company, we also recognize that well-being and contentment of our 

employees pivotal to the success and sustainability of our business and performance. Our employees 

are our most valuable asset, and we appreciate that their overall well-beings need to be well looked 

after in order for them to sustain their performance and realize their full potential.  

We understand that workplace could be at times stressful due to the competitiveness of our 

workforce and our business. To support our employees in their effort of pursuing excellence, we 

have various programmes and initiatives to balance their work with fun, and to development an 

environment and culture of mutual support.  

5.2.4.2 

Retirement and Healthcare  

Our company has presence in various geographic locations where there are various local laws and 

regulations on pension and healthcare for employees. Our HR management practices comply with 

such laws and regulations. In Singapore, we participate in the Central Provident Fund (CPF) personal 

savings scheme, which helps employees fund their retirement, home ownership, healthcare and 

education. Under this scheme, monthly deductions from employees’ gross salaries are paid into their 

CPF savings accounts. We, the company, make employer contributions to these accounts, according 

to rates stipulated in the CPF Act. In addition to CPF contributions, we provide comprehensive 

medical coverage for all employees. For more information on the CPF scheme and contribution rates,

5.2.5 

Safety and Health in the Workplace 

We are committed to achieving an overall environment, health and safety excellence and strived to 

promote an accident-free safety culture and to avoid any adverse impact to the overall well-being, 

Environment, Health and Safety (“ESH”) Performance. We have an Environment Health and Safety 

Policy in place which covers all our employees and we take every precaution to prevent occupational 

injuries among employees and to avoid any loss of life. We believe that optimum work conditions 

not only make our employees safer, but also boost morale. 

Given the high risk nature of construction activities, we place greater emphasis on health and safety 

training, awareness, procedures and general education, and aim to develop a culture whereby safety 

is ingrained into each and every employee and subcontractor working with us. Safety awareness 

starts with all new hires who are required to attend a compulsory safety induction training and they 

are equipped with the necessary personal protective equipment. 

As an essential requirement we are in compliance with the Ministry of Manpower’s Workplace 

Safety &amp; Health Act. In addition, we have attained certification for OHSAS-18001 and bizSAFE. These 

well recognized standards provide us with the frameworks to manage risks associated with safety 

and health in our workplace. 

From a supply chain perspective, all suppliers, contractors and subcontractors are required to abide 

by relevant laws and regulations, in addition to the Group’s safety policy and procedures. 

Over the years, the Group had various safety awards and achievements as presented on Section 4.4 

of this Sustainability Report. 

The health, well-being and safety of all employees, including foreign employees, is a priority for us 

during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. COVID-19 safe management measures are implemented at 

our workplace, including the construction sites. We monitor and comply with all requirements 

established by the authorities and ensure critical information is communicated to all employees. 

Employees who are able to work from home have been doing so. All employees who are unwell have 

been advised to seek medical attention at the company’s expense and infected workers are granted 

paid hospitalisation leave. We have ensured and made necessary arrangement for meals, groceries 

and basic necessities to foreign employees during their stay home notice period. Hand sanitisers, 

masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment if needed are provided to foreign employees 

at the dormitories and are made available at the workplace and construction sites. As a corporate 

citizen, we will continuously adopt the government guidelines and our safe management measures 

implemented in playing our part to manage this pandemic. 

5.2.6 

Individual Rights  

Respecting and protecting basic human rights is fundamental to all our operations and deeply 

ingrained in our Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees. Labour rights, the prohibition of 

discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, prohibition of forced and child labour, and 

workplace health and safety are all strictly observed within the work environment and 

discrimination and harassment of any kind is not tolerated at our company.  

We also respect our employees’ rights to freedom of association as well as their membership of 

trade unions and other professional bodies.  

In FY2020, none of our workforce was covered by a collective bargaining agreement; no incidents of 

forced labour, child labour or young workers were identified across the organisation, and no human 

rights-related grievances have been reported.

5.3 Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs 

5.3.1 

Our Approach 

Customer service, quality products and the highest level of product safety have always been our 

priorities, with customer satisfaction being the goal of all our corporate activities. Customer 

retention begins with trust, and we place the utmost importance on training our employees in 

customer service excellence as well as in continuously striving to improve the quality and safety of 

our products and services. 

Open and frequent communication and responsive feedback are ingrained into our daily activities 

with customer interaction. In addition to striving for excellence in product service and support, we 

attach enormous importance to data privacy. We have processes and controls in place over 

confidential and sensitive data related to our customers such as contracts. 

We have been certified under the ISO 9001 standard for quality management systems. The 

certification has helped us increase the control of our internal processes and the quality of our 

services. 

5.3.2 

Customer Feedback and Satisfaction 

We listen to our customers and take their opinions very seriously. We consolidate customer 

feedback through a range of communication channels including our website, regular customer 

survey, and our customer service personnel. Through our customer feedback system, we capture our 

customers’ comments for analysis and action. Customer compliments are also tracked so that we 

can monitor where we are getting things right and cascade positive feedback to our employees, to 

their superiors and to our CEO.  

5.3.3 

Service Quality and Safety 

Reliability and quality of our products are of paramount importance to us. We are committed to our 

Quality Policy to deliver quality products, services and maximising customer satisfaction through 

continual improvement in our Quality Management System. We strive to achieve consistent quality 

products and services, respond promptly to customers’ needs and comply with applicable legal and 

customers’ requirements. 

To ensure high standards of quality for our work done, we have in place a set of key quality 

assurance processes from the start till the completion of projects. Being certified for ISO 9001, ISO 

14001, OHSAS-18001, BizSAFE, GGBS, our Integrated Management System Manual setting out the 

processes and procedures are to be strictly adhered to in every stage of the project.  

Our quality management approach identifies our stakeholders, key aspects of the product quality 

and the impacts on our stakeholders. Our quality management processes take an end-to-end quality 

view from the areas of planning, support down to operation, performance evaluation and 

improvement. At each key aspect of the end-to-end quality management processes, we have 

leadership in place to spear head the quality improvement processes. We have mapped out the 

sequence and interaction of business processes to ensure seamless management of the quality 

management processes. 

5.3.4 

Data Safety and Privacy  

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of great priority to us. We have processes and 

controls in place for handling and communicating sensitive and confidential information of our 

customers such as contracts, customer orders and service delivery orders. Our information security 


 

 

Sustainability Report 2020 



Page 25 of 33 

33 

 





policies ensure our customers’ data are managed in accordance to the level of confidentiality. We 

strictly observe all local laws and internal regulations applicable to personal information protection. 

For the collection and disposal of wastepaper, we work with our office cleaning personnel for 

handling and reselling of wastepaper to recovery companies for pragmatic reasons. Every individual 

is responsible for the shredding all papers, including confidential documents, before disposing into 

paper recycling boxes situated near photocopiers and printers. Such practice established within our 

office provides us with the confidence that sensitive information is protected during the whole life 

cycle of our documents. 

5.4 Partnering Our Suppliers 

5.4.1 

Our Approach 

As a part of our ambition to realize sustainability throughout our value chain, we extend the 

application of responsible business practices to our local partners and suppliers. We recognise that 

we are only at the beginning of our journey to integrate sustainable business practice throughout 

our supply chain, and we commit in our pragmatic approach to continuous improvement. We aim to 

identify new opportunities for collaboration with our suppliers, gradually increase transparency and 

continue to build shared capacity to minimise our indirect environmental and social impacts. 

5.4.2 

Supplier Selection 

Our key suppliers which also include our subcontractors are carefully selected through our supplier 

selection process. When selecting our key suppliers, we examine criteria such as financial health, as 

well as competitiveness of pricing. In addition, we also take into consideration of the overall 

sustainability policies adopted by our suppliers. Our final decision on supplier selection is based on 

the overall assessment which takes a balanced view across all selection criteria. 

5.4.3 

Supplier Review  

We regularly review the performance of our key suppliers to determine whether to extend our 

partnership with them. During the key supplier review process, we engage with our key suppliers to 

communicate our expectations and mutual feedbacks. Such review process ensures alignment of our 

key suppliers’ services and products to our business requirements and sustainability objectives 

through pragmatic and continuous improvement in our partnership with our key suppliers.

5.5 Supporting Our Community 

5.5.1 

Our Approach 

At BBR, we play our part in caring for the community and lending a helping hand to those in need. 

Responsible corporate citizenry is a core pillar of our business approach and sustainability strategy. 

We recognise the importance of encouraging our employees to play an active role in the 

communities of which we are a part of, and in doing so, develop their leadership potential, 

corporate camaraderie, community spirit and environmental awareness. 

Our corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) philosophy and vision took shape in 2014 with the 

formation of BBR CARE, with the mission of “Making a Difference”. 

A Group-wide CSR platform led and championed by our Chief Executive Officer, Mr Andrew Tan 

Kheng Hwee, BBR CARE aims to foster community initiative and involvement across all levels of the 

organisation. The core thrusts of BBR CARE encompass encouraging employee volunteerism, 

empowering community engagement and enhancing the environment. To this end, our engagement 

programmes also encompass financial and practical support in carefully selected communities, 

through donation, voluntary activities and fundraising. 

5.5.2 

Our Community Initiatives Highlight 

As an organisation that believes in giving back to the community, we strongly believe in giving 

support to charities, organisations and causes to help the needy and less privileged in the society. 

Over the years, we have been actively supporting charitable organisations through donations and 

volunteer work. 

In FY2020, given the Covid-19 safe management measures that impose various restrictions on social 

interactions, we have suspended our community engagement programmes and services during the 

year.

6 PERFORMANCE TABLE 

6.1 Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions  

GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2); the underlying measures for direct and indirect CO2 

emissions calculation are electricity consumption in kilowatt hours (kWh) and fuel consumed. The 

electricity and fuel we purchase are both from non-renewable sources. 

Our business and function grow over time; the GHG emissions and electricity consumption vary. To 

ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity consumption measures 

over time, we create a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index for our performance 

monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our 

activities. We normalize the amount GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of 

our revenues which we use as a proxy for the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is 

measured in t-CO2 per SGD million and the electricity consumption index is measured in kWh per 

SGD million.  

Besides measuring performance using the above two indexes, we also tracked performance by 

actual consumption of electricity by kWh and actual consumption of paper by kg given that there are 

consumption of electricity and paper arising from basic needs and some activities that are not in 

direct proportion with revenue. 

This will allow us to better monitor our performance and we would endeavour to meet our target 

performance either by using the indexes or the actual consumption.

We have used FY2017 data as the base year for our performance tracking towards our 2030 goals. 

This year GHG Emission Index and Electricity Consumption Index stand at 41.10 and 5,321.10 

respectively. We have not achieved our target improvement of 0.8% set for FY2020 in respect of 

GHG Emission Index as revenue base had dropped but GHG emissions may not be reduced in direct 

proportion to the drop in revenue.  

For our electricity consumption, our Electricity Consumption Index was 5,321.10 which was better 

than our target of 5,639.81. In terms of actual electricity consumption in kWh, our consumption of 

602,428 kWh in FY2020 was better off than the target consumption of 970,773 kWh. This was also 

the fourth consecutive year that we continue to see our electricity consumption falling. We will 

continue our endeavour to work towards our 2030 goals.

6.2 Paper Consumption 

We capture the data for paper consumption by how many reams of paper used where one ream is 

equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across various paper 

sizes, such as A3 and A4 papers, we measure the paper consumption by the weight of paper used 

which is adjusted for the various sizes and quality of papers. 

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We devise a 

paper consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper consumption 

for the size of our activities. We normalize the amount of weights of paper consumed by the amount 

of our revenues which we use as a proxy for the size of our activities. The paper consumption index 

is measured in kilograms per million SGD.

This year Paper Consumption Index stands at 61.48. We have not achieved our target improvement 

of 0.8% set for FY2020 as the revenue base had dropped significantly compared to the base year but 

paper consumption may not reduce in direct proportion to the reduction in revenue. However, there 

was an improvement in the index as compared to FY2019. 

In terms of actual paper consumption in kg, our consumption of 6,962 kg was better than our target 

consumption. This was also lower than our base year FY2017 and FY2019 consumption of 8,002 kg 

and 7,874 kg respectively. 

We will continue our endeavour to work towards our 2030 goals.

We have not set a target for this ratio as we employ staff based on technical competency and 

capabilities. As an employer, we believe in providing equal opportunities to our employees. We do 

not discriminate against any employee or job applicant because of race, gender, religion, national 

origin, age, marital status or any other classification protected by law. In FY2020, Male:Female ratio 

in non-managerial positions stands at 11.7 to 1 which was relatively consistent with FY2019’s ratio of 

11.6 to 1. Male:Female ratio in managerial positions stands at 3.3 to 1 as compared to 2.9 to 1 last 

year due to recruitment of male staff in managerial position. 

We will monitor our employment profile every year.

We have used FY2017 data as the base year for our performance tracking towards our 2030 goals. 

This year average training hours per employee stands at 2.8. We have not achieved our target 

improvement of 0.5 hour set for FY2020 due to the Circuit Breaker and also the movement control 

of workers residing in dormitories after the Circuit Breaker. Moreover, we recruited a batch of new 

employees for one of the new projects only in the last quarter of FY2020 and the timing led to a 

reduction in the average training hours per employee. The senior management and managers had 

also focused more time on the business strategy and operation this year in the light of the current 

business environment.    

We will continue our endeavour to work towards our 2030 goals.

We have not set a target for this as whether our key suppliers have sustainability policy in place is 

one of the many criteria for supplier selection. Also whether suppliers would like to establish 

sustainability policy is not within our control. In FY2020, 7% of our key suppliers have sustainability 

policy in place, approximately the same level as prior years.  

We will continue to review our suppliers taking into consideration sustainability as one of the criteria.

We have not set a target for community contribution as we have always been committed to 

participate in local events, charitable and worthy causes year on year. In FY2020, we were not able 

to engage in any community engagement programmes and services due to the Covid-19 safe 

management measures that impose various restrictions on social interaction. 

We will monitor our community contribution every year.
