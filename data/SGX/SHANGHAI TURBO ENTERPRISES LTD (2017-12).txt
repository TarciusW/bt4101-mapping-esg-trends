1. The Board and Board STATEMENT     

 

1.1 Board Statement 

We are pleased to present our inaugural Sustainability Report of Shanghai Turbo Enterprises 

Limited (“STE” or “Group”) for the Group’s performance in the financial year 2017 ending 31 

December 2017 (Reporting period). In this first report, we have identified material ESG factors of 

our group, prepared in accordance to the GRI Standards. 

 

FY2017 proved to be very challenging, as the Group was hit by a double whammy of an ongoing 

industry restructuring and a five-month long illegal occupation of the Group’s operating subsidiary, 

Changzhou 3D Technological Compete Set Equipment Co. Ltd (“CZ3D”) in Changzhou, China, by 

trespassers, which led to significant losses. 

 

CZ3D was illegally occupied for a five-month period which was caused by the ex-CEO Mr Liu Ming 

who refused to relinquish his leadership position after being voted out at the AGM on 15th April 2017. 

Mr Liu Ming &amp; his supporters illegally occupied CZ3D and blockaded the plant and halted normal 

business operations. This caused the Group to announce on 6th June 2017 CZ3D will be temporarily 

closed for business. The Plant was eventually regained by the new management and Board on 20 

September 2017.  The new CEO and Board set quickly its goals to restore the confidence of its 

various stakeholders, including its key customers, suppliers, employees as well as to chart a new 

course for the Group,  

 

We had spent time together with our key management assessing the environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) factors that will be material, which clearly shows our deep commitment to 

sustainability. The Board has been involved in the process of determining these factors and will keep 

oversight on their governance and management in future.  

 

As the year on been quite a disruptive year for the Group, and we had just re-started our business 

after the illegal occupation, we may not have operationalised some of our plans on the ground, the 

report does not cover policies, practices and performance for the identified material topics. We will 

continue to produce sustainability reports on an annual basis and will include disclosures on the 

material topics going forward. 

 

1.2 

Board composition, its committees &amp; guidance 

 

As at end of 2017, the board comprises of the following directors: - 

 

Mr Jack Chia Seng Hee (Chairman) 

Dr Daniel Liu Dan Jun (Member) 

Mr Raymond Lim Sian Heong (Member) 

Mr Cheung Hok Fung Alexander (Member)

To assist in the execution of its responsibilities, the Board has established several Board 

Committees namely, Audit Committee (“AC”), Nominating Committee (“NC”) and Remuneration 

Committee (“RC”). These Board Committees function within clearly defined terms of reference, 

which are reviewed on a regular basis. The terms of reference of the respective committees have 

incorporated the recent changes under the Code. All Board Committees are chaired by an 

Independent Director and a majority of the members are Independent Directors. 

 

The Board recognises that while these Board Committees have the delegated power to make 

decisions, execute actions or make recommendations in their specific areas respectively, and 

will report back to the Board with their decisions and/or recommendations, the ultimate 

responsibility for the decisions and actions rests with the Board. 

 

The AC comprises of: - 

Mr Jack Chia Seng Hee (Chairman) 

Mr Raymond Lim Sian Heong (Member) 

Mr Cheung Hok Fung Alexander (Member) 

 

The RC comprises of: - 

Mr Jack Chia Seng Hee (Chairman) 

Mr Raymond Lim Sian Heong (Member) 

Mr Cheung Hok Fung Alexander (Member) 

 

The NC comprises of: - 

Mr Jack Chia Seng Hee (Chairman) 

Mr Raymond Lim Sian Heong (Member) 

Mr Cheung Hok Fung Alexander (Member) 

 

The Board possesses the relevant core competencies in areas such as accounting and finance, 

strategic planning, business and management experience. In particular, the Non-Executive 

Directors, who are mostly professionals and experts in their own fields, are able to take a 

broader view of the Group’s activities, contribute their valuable experiences and provide 

independent and objective judgement during Board deliberations or when challenging 

Management’s proposals or decisions constructively on business activities and transactions 

involving conflicts of interest and other complexities. The Non-Executive Directors also contribute 

to the Board process by monitoring and reviewing Management’s performance against goals and 

objectives. Their views and opinions provide alternate perspectives to the Group’s business. 

 

During the year, the Non-Executive Directors helped develop both the Group’s short-term and 

long-term business strategies, corporate governance compliance and played an important 

role in tightening the internal control processes risk and compliance monitoring. They also 

communicated among themselves without the presence of management as and when the need 

arises. The Company also benefited from the management’s ready access to its directors for 

guidance and exchange of views both within and outside the formal Board or committees’ meetings.

1.3 

Board’s conduct of its affairs, performance &amp; remuneration 

The Board’s conduct of its affairs are as follows: - 

 

- 

sets the overall strategy of the Group, supervises and works with the management to 

make objective decisions in the interest of the Group including establishing goals and 

priorities for the management, and reviews the management’s performance by monitoring the 

achievement of these goals; 

 

- 

establishes policies on matters such as financial control, financial performance and risk 

management procedures, thereby taking responsibility for the overall corporate governance of 

the Group; 

 

- 

sets objective performance criterion to evaluate the Board’s performance and succession 

planning process; 

 

- 

reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal 

controls framework including financial, operational, compliance and information technology 

controls and establishing risk appetite and parameters to safeguard shareholders’ interests and 

the Company’s assets; 

 

- 

reviews and approves key operational and business initiatives, major funding proposals and 

other corporate actions, significant investment and divestment proposals, including 

determining the Group’s operating and financial performance, the Group’s annual budgets 

and capital expenditure, release of the Group’s half-year and full-year financial results and 

other strategic initiatives proposed by Management; 

 

- 

approves all Board appointments/re-appointments and appointment of Key Management 

Personnel, evaluates their performance and reviews their remuneration packages; 

 

- 

identifies the key stakeholder groups and recognizes that their perceptions affect the 

Company’s reputation; 

 

- 

sets the Company’s values and standards (including ethical standards), and ensures that 

obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders are understood and met; and 

 

- 

considers sustainability issues (where applicable), e.g. environmental and social factors, as 

part of its strategic formulation. 

 

The NC is responsible for assessing the Board as a whole and also each individual 

director’s contribution. 

 

To ensure confidentiality, the evaluation forms completed by directors were submitted to the 

Company Secretary for collation and the consolidated responses were presented to the NC for 

review and discussion. The NC has reported to the Board on its review of the Board’s performance 

for the year. 


 

 

6 

 

6 

 

The NC and the Board had approved and adopted a set of new performance criteria for the 

assessment of each individual director. 

 

The Board has taken the view that the financial indicators, as set out in the Code as a guide for 

the evaluation of the board and its directors, may not be appropriate as these are more of a 

measurement of management’s performance and therefore less applicable to directors. 

 

The RC is responsible for ensuring a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy 

on executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors and 

senior management. The RC’s review will cover all aspects of remuneration including, but not 

limited to, directors’ fees, salaries, allowances, bonus, share options and benefits in kind and 

specific remuneration packages for each director. In structuring a compensation framework for 

executive directors and key executives, the RC seeks to link a proportion of executive 

compensation to the Group’s performance. The RC’s recommendation is made in consultation 

with the Chairman of the Board and submitted for endorsement by the entire Board. No 

director is involved in deciding his own remuneration. 

 

All Non-Executive Directors are paid directors’ fees that are subject to shareholders’ approval at 

the AGMs.  Executive &amp; Non-Executive Directors’ remunerations for 2017 comprise of 100% 

salary &amp; 100% directors’ fees respectively. 

 

Directors’ Fees of an amount of RMB 1,800,000 is to be proposed for 2018 which is the same 

amount approved for 2017. 

 

1.4 

Board member nomination and re-election 

The shareholders nominate the directors while the NC reviews their nominations.  

 

The Company’s Articles provide for the retirement and re-election of directors at every Annual 

General Meeting (“AGM”). 

 

Article 86(1) &amp; (2) of the Company’s Articles of Association require that every director on the 

Board shall retire at least once every three (3) years. A retiring director shall be eligible to offer 

himself for re-election. Pursuant to Article 85(6) of the Company’s Articles of Association, any 

new director appointed during the year shall retire at the next AGM of the Company and shall 

then be eligible for re- election. The NC is responsible for the nomination of retiring Directors for 

re-election. 

 

In reviewing the nomination of the retiring directors, the NC considered the composition and 

progressive renewal of the Board, and the competency, performance and contribution of each of 

the retiring directors, having regard not only to their attendance, preparedness and participation 

at Board and Board Committee meetings but also the time and effort devoted to the Group’s 

business and affairs, especially their operational and technical contributions. Where appropriate, 


 

 

7 

 

7 

the NC will also consider the director’s independence. 

1.5 

Risk management processes 

As the Company does not have a risk management committee, the Board, the AC and the 

management assume the responsibility of the risk management function. The management 

reviews regularly the Group’s business and operational activities to identify areas of significant 

risks, as well as appropriate measures to control and mitigate these risks. The management 

reviews all significant policies and procedures and highlights all significant matters to the Board 

and the AC. 

 

The Board has received written assurance from the Chief Executive Officer of Changzhou 3D 

(“CEO”) and the Financial Controller (“FC”) that: 

 

(a) 

The financial records of the Group have been properly maintained and financial statements 

for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 give a true and fair view of the Group’s 

operations and finances; and 

 

(b) 

The system of risk management and internal controls in place within the Group is adequate 

and effective in addressing the material risks in the Group in its current business 

environment including material financial, operational, compliance and information 

technology risks. Business continuity measures are in place to ensure that corporate 

functions will remain active in the event of any disruption to factory operations.

3. SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT AND APPROACH   

 

For 2017, STE had engaged the time and effort of key management and directors and had adopted 

a reporting approach based on the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards guidelines (Core 

Option) in the preparation of this report. This report is also available at STE’s website at 

www.Shanghaiturbo.com 

 

3.1 Participation of Key Management in formation of our sustainability strategy 

Key management were involved and lead the Company’s sustainability efforts. They are responsible 

for periodical meetings with the Board in determining sustainability issues in its business decisions. 

Sustainability and risk management are emphasized in the evaluation of any new orders or 

investment opportunities. 

 

The process has identified initial material ESG factors for STE and are reflected in our materiality 

matrix under material considerations. 

 

3.2 Materiality Identification Process 

 

During our materiality assessment process, we have prioritized through the following steps: 

 

1. Identify and Define important issues which might impact our business strategy 

2. Sorting out critical factors that might affect our stakeholders 

3. Prioritize selected factors and validate their severity within each business unit 

4. Embed solutions in the system and monitor regularly 

5. Adopt them to become our SOP or corporate culture when tested reliable

9 

The Committees identified the specific ESG factors which are material to the Group based on their 

collective and respective knowledge, the industry perspective and their implications to our 

operations. Besides the regular in-house meeting on operational and financial progress, the 

committee members also engaged in regular dialogue sessions with the stakeholders for feedback 

and suggestions. 

 

3.3 List of stakeholders 

Some of the stakeholders that were identified were the government, customers, suppliers, 

shareholders, banks and employees. As this is our initial report, we have not been able to do an 

assessment of the material areas of concerns of some of these stakeholders, we will discuss further 

in our next sustainability report.
