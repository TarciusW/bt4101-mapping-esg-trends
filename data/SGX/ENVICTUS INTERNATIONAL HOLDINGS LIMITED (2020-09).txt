ABOUT THIS REPORT 

 

Our sustainability report has been prepared in accordance with the SGX-ST Mainboard Listing 

Rule 711(B), and in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, Core option, 

for the financial year ended 30 September 2020, which highlights the Group’s commitment to 

undertaking business responsibly and sustainably. We have chosen to report using the GRI 

Standards because it is an internationally recognised reporting framework that covers a 

comprehensive range of sustainability disclosures. Moreover, the structured framework 

promotes reporting a full and balanced picture of the Group’s material matters and the 

management of its impact. This report represents the industry practice for tracking 

performance on a range of economic, environmental, social and governance indicators. 

 

The scope of the inaugural sustainability statement covers material issues arising from the 

daily business operations of Food Services (Texas Chicken and San Francisco Coffee), 

Trading and Frozen Food (Pok Brothers) and Food Processing (Gourmessa and De-luxe Food 

Services) Divisions in Malaysia. It does not include Dairies Division in Malaysia as the factory 

was only completed on 15 September 2020 and still awaiting for halal certification.  

 

The statement offers an overview of the sustainability approach and initiatives made by the 

Group on how it creates economic value, protects the environment and pursues social 

development in the food and beverage sector.  

 

Given that this is the Group’s sustainability statement, the data collection remains limited to 

selected economic, environment, social and governance indicators that contribute to the 

sustainable development of the Group and are of interest to its internal and external 

stakeholders. The information and data disclosed in this statement were derived from internal 

reporting processes, systems, and records. While the report has not undergone full external 

assurance, due care was taken into the disclosure of the information presented here.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

 

The Group is committed to creating long-term value for the stakeholders. The sustainability 

strategy is to assess and manage the most material economic, environmental, social and 

governance impacts, risks and opportunities arising from the business operations to support 

the sustainable growth of the business. 

 

Materiality assessment is essential to the sustainability strategy. We performed a peer 

benchmarking assessment of sustainability-related disclosures to generate a list of potential 

material matters. Subsequently, each business and department head deliberated and 

prioritised on the most material sustainability matters.  

 

The sustainability focus areas identified as integral to our business are outlined in the table on 

the next page.

ENVIRONMENT 

 

(i) 

ENERGY CONSERVATION 

 

Energy conservation plays an important role in the environment, the ways of utilisation 

of non-renewable resources would also impact the environment. Conservation of 

electrical energy can help to lessen pollution hence the Group has taken the necessary 

steps to reduce it.  

 

Pok Brothers 

 

Our Energy Conservation Management Initiative: 

 

- 

Relocation of manufacturing plant: Relocation from Glenmarie to Pulau Indah has 

contributed the energy saving approximately 830,590 KwH in energy saving in 

FY2020 compared to FY2019. However, overall energy consumption in Pulau Indah 

has slightly increase due to additional of cold rooms. 

 

- 

Replacement with LED lights: Part of the factory has been replaced with energy-

saving light such as LED to lower the heating and cooling costs.  

 

- 

Operations and maintenance: Perform preventive maintenance in plant to identify for 

any potential issues and correct it promptly for efficiently and energy saving. 

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for Financial Year (“FY”) 2020 

Continue to replace current 

lights to LED lights. Targeted to 

complete all by 2021. 

First phase completed in 2019 - Cold Room 

lights have been replaced with LED lights. 

 

Second phase – 75% completed in office areas 

 

 

Gourmessa 

 

Gourmessa has engaged in electricity conservation to reduce energy consumption. It 

has shutdown unnecessary usage of electrical appliance in the building in order to 

reduce electrical consumption. Management also provide a clear definition of energy 

efficiency to educate production employee do not operate heavy duty machines at the 

same time such as ovens and cold rooms that consume high energy to reduce energy 

by controlling on the maximum electrical charges from Tenaga Nasional Berhad.  

 

In addition, Gourmessa has also control production cooling system which is the Air 

Handling Unit (“AHU”). Prior to the implementation of the controlling process, AHU has 

been operated for 24 hours and now it decided to switch off AHU after production hour 

and switch on in the next day production. This has resulted a saving in electrical 

consumption by 10% as compared to previous FY.

accordingly to the electrical SOPs given and on 

another electrical appliance which has saved 

energy by 10% or RM113,000. 

 

 

 

Texas Chicken (Malaysia) 

 

Restaurants are energy-intensive and operate in long hours, Texas Chicken restaurants 

in Malaysia are equipped with LED lighting to reduce power consumption by 

approximately 50%. 

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for FY2020 

Continue to use LED lighting for 

the new opening outlets to reduce 

power consumption. 

 

The amount of cost saving of 74 stores is 

RM222,000 as compared to saving of 

RM195,000 for 57 stores in FY2019. 

 

 

(ii) 

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

 

We believe proper waste management is essential to develop a nationwide long-term 

strategy for environmental protection. We also believe it is our responsibility to contribute 

to this agenda and help promote Malaysia’s Green Technology Master Plan. This has 

been actively promoted and implemented by the Ministry of Energy, Science, 

Technology, Environment and Climate Change (“MESTECC”).  

 

We are determined to conduct our business in a responsible manner and aim to reduce 

the waste generated. We engage with responsible and ethical waste management 

contractors to ensure proper collection and disposal of the waste generated according 

to the Department of Energy and a recycle management contractor for all the recycle 

items. 

 

Pok Brothers 

 

In an effort to become more sustainable, we are taking appropriate measures to make 

our premises more eco-friendly with the 3”R” principles.   

 

The success of 3R program could be used to convince stakeholders involved in waste 

management about the overall benefits of recycling and its influences on social and 

environment sustainability for promoting and strengthening recycling activities within the 

organisation.

REDUCE the use of single-use Plastic Bags. 

 

Selangor Government initiatives to reduce the use of Single Use Plastic 

have created awareness among our customers. Customers are using 

reusable bag and carton boxes for their purchases. 

 

REUSE packaging materials and plastic pallets in our warehouse.  

By reusing, we can reduce solid waste disposal and the cost of purchasing 

packing materials.  

 

 

 

 

RECYCLE wooden pallets, broken pallets and other packaging materials 

to minimize solid waste. 

 

 

 

 

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for FY2020 

Reduce solid waste collection 

by separation of recycle 

packaging material 

 

Reduced solid waste collection by 189 trips (363 

trips in FY2020 compared to 174 trips in FY2019) 

Generate income to company 

through recyclables materials   

Approximately RM3,099 has been collected from the 

recycle materials  

 

 

This year, we had generated a total of 3.9 tons of waste in the form of paper, cardboard, 

metal and plastic. While we acknowledge that more than 58% of waste generated are 

carton boxes from incoming shipment. Even though the consumption of papers in the 

office are not many, we strive to reduce our paper consumption by promoting digital 

reporting of documents and reports in the near future. 

 

With the reduction in solid waste, we have a saving in waste disposal expenses. We 

have recorded a saving of RM27,000 in waste disposal services in FY2020 compared to 

FY2019.

an ongoing project. 

 

De-luxe Food Services 

 

Our Waste Management Initiatives: 

 

- 

Food waste recycling: food waste is recycled into animal feed instead of sending 

directly to the landfill. The objective is to reduce food wastage below limit line of 3%. 

 

- 

Carton waste recycling: carton waste is originated from the finished goods 

packaging from various sources, eg: damage carton from the line or the warehouse. 

The objective is to reduce carton waste recycling below limit line of 1.20%. 

 

- 

Plastic waste recycling: plastic waste is originated from production line processes. 

We aim to reduce plastic waste recycling below limit line of 1.80%.  

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for FY2020 

To reduce food wastage below 

limit line of 3% 

Food waste increased by 0.71% due to the 

Movement Control Order (“MCO”)  implemented 

from March 2020 to May 2020 which contributed 

a  lower total loss in output of approximately 202 

ton from 737 ton in the preceding year, resulted 

overall FY2020 ton contribution lower than 

FY2019.  

 

Overall, the food wastage was still below the limit

Texas Chicken (Malaysia) 

 

Our Waste Management Initiatives: 

 

- 

Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) - certified paper packaging: Our boxes and 

paper cups are made from FSC. This means that the paper has been sourced in an 

environmentally-friendly, socially responsible and economically viable manner. 

FSC-certified products go through a “chain of custody” from the forest to the 

manufacturer to the merchant and finally to the printer.  

 

It also requires a “management plan” that outlines the scale and intensity of logging 

and renewal operations, in addition to long-term objectives for maintaining the health 

of the forest. 

 

During the financial year, we have purchased 32.2 million (FY2019: 30.8million 

pieces) pieces of FSC - certified packaging for our restaurants nationwide. 

 

- 

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (“RSPO”) - certified palm oil: The palm oil that 

we use for frying at restaurants is RSPO – certified. This means that the palm oil 

producer complies with good agricultural, social and environmental practice, as 

dictated by the RSPO. During the financial year, our restaurants nationwide used 

798,000 kg (FY2019: 690,000 kg) of RSPO certified palm oil. 

 

- 

Biodegradable plastic bags: We give out biodegradable plastic bags instead of 

regular plastic bags at our restaurants in the Federal Territories. Biodegradable 

plastics are proven to be more environmentally-friendly, as they are able to 

breakdown more quickly when exposed to the elements. During the financial year, 

we have given out 1.7million (FY2019: 1.1million pieces) pieces of biodegradable 

plastic bags at our restaurants in Federal Territories. The management aims to 

extend the usage of biodegradable plastic bags to our stores in other states in the 

year 2022.

recyclable cups, recycling milk cartons, paper and plastic behind the counter.  

 

No plastics: Further elimination of plastic single-use items like stirrers and straws to 

be replaced with wooden and/or biodegradable items and paper-based materials for 

packaging items like cake boxes, sandwich boxes and takeaway boxes. 

 

No plastic straws: No plastic straws are given out in the store unless requested by 

customers started from January 2019. We target zero usage of plastic straws and 

convert them to biodegradable straws in FY2020. 

 

- 

Bring your own tumbler: RM2 discounts for customers who bring their own tumbler 

to encourage customers to cut down the usage of paper cup and plastic cups.  

 

- 

Grounds for gardening: Every store to separate and put aside coffee grounds daily. 

The grounds are packed in 2kg bags and given to interested customers for recycle 

used purposes. 

 

In FY2020:- 

 

- 

4000 pcs of new merchandise tumblers were introduced to solidify our efforts in 

encouraging tumbler use over takeaway cups, further reducing usage of paper and 

plastic cups. 

 

- 

SF Coffee app was launched with the functions of e-wallet and loyalty program. This 

is to reduce printing production of San Francisco Coffee Best Customer Card (BCC), 

a physical loyalty stamp card. By introducing the app, we will be phasing out the use
