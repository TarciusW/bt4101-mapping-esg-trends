The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present the Sustainability Report of Tiong Woon 

Corporation Holding Ltd and its Singapore subsidiaries (“Tiong Woon” or “the Group”) for the financial 

year ended 30 June 2021. With the COVID-19 pandemic still impacting the economic landscape, the 

Group remains focused on its sustainability goals and addressing the concerns of its stakeholders. 

As with the previous year, the impacts of the pandemic on its management approach and material 

economic, environmental, social and governance matters, as well as its performance for the reporting 

year, have been included in this report. The Board has assessed the current outlook and its associated 

risks on Tiong Woon’s operating and financial operations, and ensured that risk response plans are 

in place for business continuity. Prudent management of cash flows and ensuring adequate liquidity 

continue to be key priorities for the Group in this season. 

Notwithstanding COVID-19, the Board continues to ensure that Tiong Woon’s material sustainability 

matters are managed, monitored and incorporated into the Group’s business strategy. Working closely 

with management, the Board maintains oversight over the Group’s sustainability practices, performance 

and disclosures. The Board has reassessed the material matters and confirmed that they remain 

relevant for the business.

The Group strives to deliver consistent and long-term value to its key stakeholders and recognises that 

integrating sustainability is key to achieving this goal.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

Tiong Woon defines material sustainability matters as matters that have significant impact on the Group, our key 

stakeholders, and our external environment. Our material sustainability matters are reviewed on an annual basis to ensure 

their continued relevance to our business. Following FY2021’s review, there were no changes to our reporting matters. 

The Board has validated our current five material matters for their relevance to Tiong Woon and will continue to oversee 

the management and monitoring of these topics.

APPROACH


CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

Good corporate governance is essential in ensuring stakeholder value and underpins our ability to deliver strong 

economic performance in the long run. Any breach of business ethics and non-compliance to laws and regulations can 

potentially affect the Group’s reputation and can lead to the revocation of our licenses and the imposition of penalties. 

Our commitment to conduct business in a fair and ethical manner is reflected in all aspects of our operations, as we seek 

to remain accountable to our stakeholders. 

Corporate Governance Policies and Initiatives

Tiong Woon strives toward the highest standards of corporate governance and compliance with applicable laws. Over the 

years, the Group has established specific policies and procedures to guide our business activities. 

Figure 7. Corporate Governance Policies and Procedures

Policies/Procedures

Description

Whistleblowing Policy

Outlines the procedure to raise any identified cases of fraud, corruption, or other 

dishonest practices in the workplace.

Employee Code of Ethics

Provides guidelines on employees’ expected conduct in various business dealings, 

such as commitment to safeguarding confidential information, appropriate workplace 

mannerisms, avoiding or handling conflicts of interests, ethical use of company 

property and responsible social networking.

Employee Code of Conduct

Sets out the standard of conduct and performance for all employees as well as the 

appropriate corrective actions for any breaches of the standard.

The Audit Committee plays an active, vital role in ensuring good corporate governance within the Group. Our employees 

are regularly kept updated with our corporate governance policies and attend training sessions on topics such as 

Insider Trading and Interested Person Transactions. During their orientation programme, new employees are introduced 

to our business code of conduct, which they are required to declare and sign. In the annual Singapore Governance 

and Transparency Index 2021 assessment, which assesses the corporate governance practices of Singapore-listed 

companies, we substantially improved our score and ranking compared to the previous year.

Our Targets And Performance

In FY2021, we met our targets of maintaining zero confirmed incidents of corruption and zero confirmed incidents of non-

compliance with applicable environmental and socioeconomic laws and regulations.

SUSTAINABLE GROWTH


ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

Economic performance is paramount for the Group’s steady and sustainable growth. At Tiong Woon, we are constantly on 

the lookout for new opportunities to grow our business and provide positive financial returns to all our shareholders. As a 

key player contributing to the local economy, we recognise our economic footprint contributes to direct and indirect impacts 

on our operations regionally.

Economic Performance Policies and Initiatives

To stay ahead of our competitors, we emphasised on responding quickly and effectively to the ever-changing and challenging 

business environment the best that we can. As economic uncertainties continue to persist amidst the pandemic the Group 

will focus on its core competencies and leverage its strong track record as a one-stop integrated services provider in project 

management for heavy lift and haulage and as well as marine transportation. With the Group’s global network and business 

presence, Tiong Woon remains focused to drive growth, improve profitability and enhance stakeholders’ value. 

Economic Targets and Performance

In FY2021, the Group’s economic value generated1 amounted to $112.9 million, compared to $124.7 million in the previous 

year. The Group saw revenue decline across all business segments in FY2021. The decrease was primarily attributed to 

market conditions that continue to be difficult, amid the uneven, intermittent recovery in business activities hampered by the 

resurgent and successive waves of COVID-19 infections. $106.6 million of the economic value generated by Tiong Woon in 

FY2021 was distributed2 through various forms including taxes to the government, purchases from suppliers, compensation 

to employees and investments into communities. This represents a 10.81% decrease in economic value distributed from 

FY2020. 

Full details of the Group’s financial information can be found in Annual Report FY2021.

1 

Economic value generated is the revenue of the the Group’s operations in Singapore and overseas subsidiaries during the reporting period. The full list 

of our operations can be found on page 7 of Annual Report FY2021. 

2 

Economic value distributed as defined by GRI is the sum of operating costs, employee wages and benefits, payments to providers of capital, payments 

to government by country and community investments. 

COVID-19 HIGHLIGHT: CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IMPACT AND RESPONSE

With COVID-19 persisting through the year, Tiong Woon continued to ensure that government safety and workplace 

regulations were complied with throughout the organisation. In particular, we heavily promoted the use and support of 

the Government’s SafeEntry check-in process and TraceTogether app.  Through the use of the TraceTogether app, the 

Business Continuity Planning team was able to discover several cases of our colleagues identified as being in close 

contact with a COVID-19 positive personnel and take the appropriate steps to manage risk of transmission. 

For these employees, we swiftly put in place their work from home arrangement in accordance to the Ministry of 

Health‘s advised isolation period following the date of close contact, with minimal disruption to the work flow whilst 

doing contact tracing of our own to ensure our other colleagues remain well and healthy. Additionally, we took steps 

to disinfect the workstations of the employee to prevent potential spread to others. These containment measures have 

prevented having COVID-19 clusters at our workplace and maintained our business continuation and productivity.

In addition, the IT team continued to maintain the required infrastructure and measures to ensure smooth business 

operations and protection against cybersecurity threats even as employees worked from home

COVID-19 HIGHLIGHT: ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IMPACT AND RESPONSE

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted global economic activity. Majority of our customers, especially 

those in the construction sector, had to suspend their operations due to strict COVID-19 regulations imposed by the 

Singapore government as clusters of migrant workers were found to be contracted with COVID-19 virus. While our 

business operations were affected, we sought to gradually resume our business operations toward normalcy as the 

COVID-19 restrictions gradually eased with improved situation in Singapore. 

To ensure that Tiong Woon’s financial position remains strong, customers’ payment and credit terms were closely 

monitored and control over operational expenses were tightened via various measures to improve our cash flows. 

To prepare the Group for varying scenarios amid the uncertain environment, simulations were introduced. These 

simulations have provided the basis for immediate cost cutting measures and have simultaneously helped to fine-tune 

our revenue forecasts to provide more accurate and timely figures for better cash flow management. Through the 

analysis on customers’ profile and payment patterns, critical decision-making insights on customer risk profiles were 

acquired.

SUSTAINABLE GROWTH


Our core values build the foundation for the customer service excellence that Tiong Woon prides itself on. To ensure that high 

quality and safe services are delivered to the satisfaction of our customers, we have focused our efforts on implementing an 

effective quality control system, adhering to rigorous workplace health and safety standards, and developing a well-trained, 

capable workforce. 

Figure 8. Tiong Woon’s Core Values 

EFFECTIVE QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEM

Quality Control Policies and Procedures

The Group’s Quality Policy in our Quality Manual helps us ensure that processes are in place to ensure project quality and 

customer satisfaction. This policy covers all operations in the countries we operate in, and its implementation is overseen 

by the Quality Committee, which is headed by the Chief Executive Officer. The Quality Committee holds monthly meetings 

to review quality performance to ensure that all issues are addressed in a timely manner. 

We strive not only to meet, but to exceed our customers’ expectations. Upon receiving an engagement request, our technical 

sales staff will ensure that the customer is matched to the right service by conducting a thorough site visit assessment before 

presenting a formal project proposal to the customer. During this process, sales staff can leverage the integrated nature of 

our service offerings to deliver a comprehensive solution to our clients. 

During the execution of a project, we take great care to avoid equipment breakdown as this results in costly project delays. 

We also ensure that the operators and technicians working on site are competent for the job, through regular training and 

close collaboration with equipment manufacturers. Besides compulsory equipment familiarisation training, the operators 

have a direct communication channel for ongoing technical support from the head office.  

In the unfortunate event of an equipment malfunction, the technical team will be mobilised immediately for operation recovery. 

Subsequently, a root cause analysis will be conducted to guard against recurrence of the same issue. 

As a reflection of our commitment to deliver quality services to our customers, the Group’s Quality Management System is 

ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 certified.

Customer Satisfaction Targets and Performance 

Customer satisfaction is of great importance to Tiong Woon, and this commitment to constantly improve customer satisfaction 

levels is directed from the top. We have a Quality Policy and mission statement which outlines the importance of meeting 

and exceeding our customers’ satisfaction, and regularly collect customer feedback on the quality of our services via open 

channels such as email and hotline, and via an annual customer satisfaction survey sent out to randomly selected clients. 

In FY2021, we surveyed 20 randomly selected clients across various industries. The survey allowed customers to rate the 

five main services offered by the Group against varied assessment criteria such as equipment reliability, response time to 

breakdown recovery, and punctuality. The feedback was consolidated and reviewed, and appropriate courses of action were 

taken to further improve our services. The FY2021 survey results pertaining to the Group’s services are presented in Figure 9.

Overall, the Group achieved a customer satisfaction rating of 72.3% in FY2021. This was an increase of 3% from the 

customer satisfaction rating of 69.3% in FY2020. The increase in our customer satisfaction was mainly attributed to the 

cooperativeness of our crane service operators, the technical knowledge and competency of our support service employees, 

and the immediate customer service in attending to enquiries. We are humbled by the confidence that our customers have 

indicated in our services and will continue to raise our standards based on the comments we have received. Figure 10 

outlines the improvement plan that we have formulated based on feedback obtained from the customer satisfaction survey. 

Figure 10. Improvement Plan

Aspect

Improvement Plan

Equipment reliability

To improve equipment reliability and strengthen preventive maintenance 

processes, we are continually recruiting competent personnel, and have renewed 

our fleet. One of our major crane manufacturers has also stationed its technical 

service manager in Singapore for added support.

Service breakdown recovery

To improve the punctuality for our field operations support services, we will 

increase the number of external service teams so that faulty equipment can be 

attended to promptly and downtime is reduced.

Speed of response to 

customer feedback

To minimise discrepancies between billing documents such as customer delivery 

orders and invoices, communication within the internal departments will be 

improved.

A “Crane Availability” chat group has also been set up to facilitate internal 

communications on crane and resource availability to improve our customer 

service in accurately responding to orders.

COVID-19 HIGHLIGHT: CUSTOMER SATISFACTION IMPACT AND RESPONSE

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it new challenges in serving our customers and meeting their needs. To 

combat these challenges, we continue to focus on four main areas:

 

Ensuring business continuity to avoid service disruptions 

Our cross-functional, inter-department and inter-subsidiary response team has set in place a Business Continuity 

Plan to ensure that our customers’ requirements can be fulfilled in a timely manner. Our supply chain contingency 

plans, which include outsourcing equipment and manpower, and establishing strategic relationships with our upstream 

suppliers so that their services can be called on in the event of an emergency, ensure that our customers are not at risk 

of compromise in the event of sudden operational disruptions.

Supporting our customers’ recovery

We are highly committed to supporting our customers’ recovery in this difficult season, particularly those whose 

operations have been greatly disrupted by COVID-19. Where feasible, we have allowed certain concessions to payment 

timelines to help them with their immediate challenge of managing their operating costs.

Emphasising health and safety

To minimise contact and promote contact tracing and safe travel, staggered working hours have been introduced to 

selected customers’ job sites, in addition to mandated use of mobile attendance apps for our sales employees.

Building rapport and maintaining transparent communication

We see the importance of going the extra mile to build rapport with our customers to understand their needs in this 

difficult time. As such, where face-to-face meetings have not been possible, we have continued to maintain consistent 

communication over the phone or through video conferencing channels such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Skype.

CASE STUDY INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY TO ENHANCE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

In 2021, we optimised our business processes through the enterprise resource planning tool Microsoft Dynamics 

Navision. The project is currently ongoing and is expected to improve productivity and efficiency at all stages of the 

process from sales quotations to billing, and digitalise our timesheet and some manual processes, to provide higher 

levels of customer satisfaction. The targeted period for the launch of the project will be during the first half of year 2022.

RIGOROUS HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS

Health and Safety Policies and Procedures  

As an employer, we believe our employees’ and workers’ health and safety is our responsibility and have made ensuring 

their safety and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic our utmost priority. Our Health, Safety and Environment (“HSE”) 

policy is reviewed annually with the aim to minimise workplace accidents, fatalities, and other negative health impacts. 

We have also attained International Standard ISO 45001:2018 and bizSAFE Level Star certifications, which bears further 

testament to the rigour of the management systems we have in place to ensure a safe working environment. Our policies and 

systems cover all employees and workers for the operations scoped into this report.  The risk assessment, managed by our 

Occupational, Health and Safety (“OHS”) management team, is reviewed once every three years, while updated workplace 

hazards are reported through workers’ participation and consultation, and regular HSE inspection. Under our HSE policy, 

our employees are empowered to say no to working in an unsafe working environment. To implement corrective measures 

and improvement in the OHS management system, we have a set of policies and procedures included to aid us such as HSE 

policy, Incident Investigation, Nonconformity and Corrective Action procedures.

Our OHS services are provided by competent individuals with recognised qualifications and accreditations and comply 

with the legal requirements and recognized standards. Our HSE department team, consisting of a Ministry of Manpower 

registered Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) officer, is responsible for the promotion a healthy workplace environment 

via maintaining the OHS management system. Our Risk Assessment Team, who are bizSAFE trained, oversees the Hazard 

Identification, Risk Assessment and Control procedures. Our Estate department conducts regular inspection of probable 

workplace hazards through surveillance of work environment and emergency preparedness response exercise, and organise 

first aid and emergency treatment. Under our Human Resource department, all new employees are assessed for their 

fitness to work and trained on WSH knowledge through their employment, to ensure all health and safety responsibilities are 

effectively communicated. 

 

We have developed a Quality, Health, Safety and Environment (“QHSE”) Policy and QHSE Management in compliance with 

local and international maritime law to address marine safety hazards. Prior to starting any marine operations, our employees 

are required to obtain all necessary certifications such as ship firefighting and piracy mitigation to ensure that they are well 

equipped to work in risky maritime operations. 

To monitor and track HSE performance and oversee the implementation of HSE programmes, a dedicated HSE committee 

has been set up at the group-level. This committee consists of representatives from the Group’s subsidiaries and project 

teams. 

Regular safety programmes such as toolbox meetings, campaigns, and emergency fire drills are conducted throughout the 

year4. A safety training matrix has been maintained to ensure that relevant employees are equipped with essential safety 

skills and knowledge. Tiong Woon also organises bi-monthly management walkabouts to monitor and assess any safety-

related hazards. The Group organises regular free health screenings such as blood test and talks to raise awareness of health 

and safety. In line with COVID-19 regulations, a complementary virtual event was held to promote literacy on COVID-19 

vaccine for all employees. In cases where employees need to seek medical attention, medical services are provided during 

working hours and immediate transports are arranged to health clinics or services.

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we were unable to keep to the same program frequency as before the pandemic.

In FY2021, there were three cases of injuries from January to June 2021. Based on our investigations, these injuries arose 

from a working tool left on the floor which caused slip, trip and fall, falling from height due to constrained workspace, and 

cuts sustained from sharp equipment. To prevent these incidents from reoccurring, employees were briefed on safe work 

procedures. Warning stickers were also placed on potentially hazardous areas. Employees were reminded to use reliable 

extension tools for working at height and seek for assistance when in doubt.

To help our employees to better handle stress, we partnered with Association of Process Industry to 

host a free virtual webinar on Stress Management. The webinar aims to increase stress management 

awareness and introduce employees to practical strategies to build resilience in order to cope with stress 

effectively.                                                                                                                                            

To raise awareness on the COVID-19 vaccine, a free virtual session with HSBC and Raffles Medical Group was organised 

for our employees to better understand the basics of the messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine and its benefits versus 

side effects, and learn more about the immunity, eligibility and exemptions of the vaccine.

EMPLOYEES PROFILE

In FY2021, we had a total of 639 employees across our operations in Singapore. All employees were hired on a full-time basis 

and most were hired on a permanent contract. The total number of employees fell slightly by 6.2% compared to FY2020 

which can be attributed to foreign workers unable to return to base due to their hometowns’ COVID-19 restrictions. Tiong 

Woon has not had any COVID-19 related retrenchment exercises in FY2021. Tiong Woon has a notably higher proportion 

of male employees (89.7%) as compared to the female employees (10.3%) due to the nature of our business as observed 

across our industry. The detailed profile of our employees is shown in Figure 13 below.

FY2020’s direct energy consumption and corresponding emissions and intensities were revised in this report as the fuel consumption for FY2020 and 

prior years disclosed in SR2020 included MGO purchases by a Malaysian entity (Tiong Woon Offshore Sdn Bhd), which is not within the scope of this

CARING FOR

THE ENVIRONMENT

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND GREENHOUSE GAS (“GHG”) EMISSIONS

Energy efficiency plays a key role in our effort to reduce our environmental footprint. It also contributes to the profitability of 

the Group by lowering our operating costs. Tiong Woon uses a phased approach to manage our energy consumption and 

environmental impacts.

Energy Efficiency Policies and Initiatives

The Group’s energy consumption includes the usage of diesel and Marine Gas Oil (“MGO”) for fuel as well as electricity from 

the grid.

Fuel is used to operate heavy lift and haulage equipment, tugboats, barges, and other supporting vehicles. To reduce 

fuel consumption, the group optimises operational efficiency using fuel-efficient equipment, performing maintenance on 

equipment and by educating operators on fuel efficiency behaviors. 

Electricity consumption covers usage at our Singapore properties including our tenants’ activities, workshop and offices, 

workers’ dormitory and jetty. Upon observing the trend of our electricity usage since FY2020, we have installed several 

energy-saving fittings such as installing LED lamps at commonly used areas such as the stairways and workplaces with high 

human traffic like the offices progressively. In addition, we installed an air conditioning Critical Room Control controller to 

reduce electricity usage during non-peak period. Our Estate Manager will continue to monitor our electricity consumption 

regularly and introduce relevant energy-saving technologies.

Energy Targets and Performance

In FY2021, Tiong Woon consumed a total of 70,908 GJ of fuel and 1,503 MWh of electricity (5,411 GJ of electrical energy). 

This translates to an increase of 14.54% in total energy use when compared to FY202012. This increase during the reporting 

period was primarily the result of increased use of MGO for our chartered tugboats, offset by the decrease in electricity 

use in our office. Direct energy intensity increased marginally from 0.67 to 0.80 MJ per SGD, and indirect energy intensity 

decreased marginally from 0.0176 to 0.0170 KWh per SGD respectively. An overview of energy use is provided in Figure 19 

and Figure 20 below.

CARING FOR

THE ENVIRONMENT


This section explains the calculation boundaries, methodologies and assumptions used in the computation of Tiong Woon 

energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 

Reporting Scope and Period

Tiong Woon adopts the Operational Control Approach, as outlined in the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, to determine 

organisational boundaries. This attributes accountability for 100% of the GHG emissions from operations over which the 

organisation has control. Data for energy and GHG emissions consumption from the following reporting periods have been 

included in the Sustainability Report FY2021:

• FY2020: 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020

• FY2021: 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021

Energy Consumption within the Organisation

Energy consumption is consumed from purchased electricity, diesel and MGO consumption in Singapore. The total energy 

consumption is expressed in Gigajoules (Gj). 

Energy and Carbon Intensity

Electricity consumption covers usage at our Singapore properties including our tenants’ activities, workshop and offices, 

workers’ dormitory and jetty. Intensity metrics are calculated relative to revenue from Singapore operations, expressed in 

Singapore dollars (“SGD”).

GHG Emissions

Scope 1 emissions are calculated from the consumption, natural gas and MGO in Singapore, expressed in tonnes of CO2. 

Scope 2 emissions are calculated from the consumption of grid electricity in Singapore, expressed in tonnes of CO2. 

Emission Factors 

Scope 1: Emission factors for direct energy consumption are taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 

(IPCC) emission factor database (i.e. 74.1 tCO2/TJ for diesel and 56.1 tCO2/TJ for natural gas).

Scope 2: Emission factors for the calculation of electricity consumption for 2018, and 2019 and 2020 are taken from the 

Singapore Energy Statistics 2019 published by the Energy Market Authority in Singapore (0.4188 kg CO2/kWh and 0.4085 

kg CO2/kWh respectively), as well as the National Greenhouse Accounts Factors published in August 2019.
