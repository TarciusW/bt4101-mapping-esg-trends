Sustainability Statement 

Sustainability Governance and Commitment 

The Board of Directors of the Group recognises that sound corporate governance practices are 

important to the proper functioning of the group companies and is committed to enhancing 

shareholder value by maintaining high standards of integrity and complying with all applicable laws 

and regulations.  

The Board comprises six directors of which half of the Board are independent directors with strong 

financial and business background, providing the necessary experience and expertise to direct and 

lead the Group in relation to overall business management.   Our senior management team that leads 

the Group’s Sustainability Committee, is assigned the responsibility for overseeing sustainability and 

reports to the Group CEO and Board of Directors.   

The Group adopts environmentally friendly, resource-efficient and responsible practices as part of the 

core sustainability values. Sustainability forms an integral part of its corporate strategy and decision-

making process in achieving its vision of becoming a global leader in the manufacture of cleanroom 

and healthcare gloves.  The Group ensures that the concerns and opinion of the key stakeholders are 

taken into consideration in the course of achieving its vision.   

Value Chain Management  

We believe that a sustainable supply chain is important in ensuring continuing success for business.  

As such the procurement activities pertaining to supply chain across the Group is guided by our Group 

Procurement Policy to ensure the goal of cost-effective, efficient and sustainable deliverability 

procurement is attained.   The Group Procurement Policy guidelines entail the supplier selection and 

evaluation criteria like good quality products, competitive pricing, service and support reliability are 

required to minimise supply chain risk and other negative business impact.

competition on price, quality and service level between the Group’s existing and potential suppliers, 

it would also encourage the growth of diverse business and economic growth of all communities.

Materiality Assessment 

Materiality in the context of ESG is the principle of defining environmental, social and governance 

factors that matter most to our business and stakeholders.  In assessing material factors, we looked 

at the significance of economic, environmental and social impacts, interests and expectations of 

stakeholders through their feedback and internal discussions. 

We have identified 5 sustainability issues that are most relevant and material to our stakeholders and 

business, namely: 

- 

Energy and Water (Environmental) 

- 

Effluents and Scheduled Waste (Environmental) 

- 

Occupational Health and Safety (Social)

Key Stakeholders’ Engagement 

In accordance with GRI 102-42, we have conducted an exercise to identify our key stakeholders with 

a significant level of influence and interests in our business operations and ESG factors which are 

material to the Group and its key stakeholders.  

We recognise that by frequently engaging with our key stakeholders, it will help us to better 

understand their expectations and concerns.  This way, we are positioned to better respond to the 

ESG challenges as they arise.

Environmental Material Factors 

The Group carries out environmentally friendly practices to protect the environment for the well-

being of future generations.   The principal operating plant of the Group is in compliance with ISO 

14001:2015 Environmental Management and we constantly engage our ISO auditors and in-house 

engineering team to conduct on-going examination and discussion to ensure the applicable 

environmental laws and regulations are complied with.  The Group is committed to taking continuous 

effort to minimise the possible adverse impact on the environment.  

Water Conservation 

Saving water helps to preserve our environment as it is limited resource on earth and it will help to 

ensure a sustainable adequate water supply in future.   Total water consumption amounted to 940,000 

m3 in FY2017 or 0.29m3 per 1000 units of output with reference to the main plant of the Group. The 

Group strives to reuse and recycle water where applicable through innovation and water saving 

features as follows: 

1) To reduce the water consumption by developing new formulation which requires lesser 

leaching. 

 

2) To reuse the water from leaching to former cleaning. 

 

 

 

 

 

Water is recycled and reused 

Effluent Treatment Plant is in place to purify our industrial waste water for its reuse and its aim is to 

release safe water to the environment.  In addition, we will initiate a rain collection system in the 

coming year that runs the collected water through filtration at raw water treatment plant before 

release to the production plant for manufacturing use.  The Group aims to recycle 30% of water in 3 

years and to reduce excessive withdrawal from water system by 5%.

Energy Usage 

Using energy efficiently and opting for renewable energy is fundamental in fighting climate change 

and reducing our overall environmental footprint. To achieve this, we constantly seek new processes 

to improve energy efficiency, for instance, we select high-efficient industrial burner for glove curing 

and this typically reduces the natural gas consumption by 10% compared to the regular packaged 

burner.  Furthermore, we use biomass energy as a form of renewable energy source to produce 

process heat for our boilers thereby lessening the overall consumption of natural gas by 40%.  Natural 

gas usage in FY2017 totaled to 1,277,000 MMBtu or 0.39 MMBtu per 1000 units of output.    

With respect to electricity saving, we use the high efficiency motor IE2 to operate the dipping machine 

oven which should reduce the electricity consumption by 3%.  All employees are aware of the basic 

no-cost ways to save electricity, i.e. turn off unnecessary electrical equipment and facilities whenever 

not in use. Total electricity usage for FY2017 was 36,601,000 kWh or 11.2 kWh per 1000 units of 

output.  

Effluents and Scheduled Waste 

Effluents are discharged strictly according to Department of Environment (“DOE”) requirements. 

The amount of hazardous waste generated by the Group is handled with care and diligence in 

accordance with the applicable environmental laws and regulations.  Policies and work instructions in 

compliance with DOE requirements are in place to oversee the storage, treatment and disposal of 

hazardous waste generated from our manufacturing activities.  Amongst others, scheduled waste is 

stored with its movement being monitored by certified Competent Person, we then engage licensed 

and qualified contractors to collect our scheduled waste that is sent to facilities approved by DOE for 

chemical or recovery treatment.  

The waste intensity in FY2017 was 0.14 kg per 1000 units of output. 

The Group engaged in-house Competent Person with respect to management of effluents and 

scheduled waste.

Social Material Factors 

Occupational Health and Safety 

Safety and health is one of the Group’s primary concerns and we are committed to providing a safe 

work environment where employees can do their jobs without fear of injury.  This commitment is 

reflected by our Occupational Safety and Health Management System (“OHSAS”) accreditation 

ISO18001: 2017 which is subject to annual audit by professional independent consulting firm.  

To begin with, the Group has established a Safety Committee consisting of a registered competent 

Safety and Health Officer and a team of management staff to oversee the implementation of policies 

and procedures that cover safety rules, duties and responsibilities of employees to prevent accidents.  

Regular safety talks and trainings are provided to workers from time to time to ensure best safety 

practices are communicated across the entire workplace.  Safety signs and messages are put in the 

right work places.

As manufacturing plants are exposed to industrial fire risk, the Group regularly conducts fire drills 

involving our effective Emergency Response Team (ERT) to ensure all workers know how to exit safely 

as quickly as possible.  We have the right type and quantity of firefighting equipment, fire hose and 

extinguishers are in place complying with Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department.  Factory firefighting 

system is also installed by the government approved contractor, who is also engaged to service the 

firefighting equipment on a monthly basis.  

The group aims to work towards zero accidents and loss time injuries and the following are some 

health and safety highlights of FY2017:

Labour Relations – Respect Human &amp; Labour Rights and Fair Remuneration 

Globally, the Group employed over 3,500 workers and we are committed to ensuring that the rights 

of all workers are respected according to national and international laws and our commitment is 

evident by the award of Business Social Compliance Initiative (“BSCI”) for being compliant with BSCI 

Code of Conduct.   

The Group adopts code of conduct that spells out our core values in relation to employment, that we 

are committed to providing equal employment opportunity for all with a working environment that is 

free of discrimination and harassment and we do not discriminate on the basis of creed and colour, 

religion, gender, origin, age, disability, gender identity, marital status, ancestry or sexual orientation. 

Child labour is not to be used in any stage of manufacturing and no workers under the age of 16 shall 

be employed. Workers under the age of 18 shall not perform hazardous work.  Employees’ privacy is 

protected and there will be no unauthorised access to employee records. 

We have a good and attractive remuneration system in place to reward and retain our employees. 

Wages are paid at the competitive rates and compliant with the Malaysia minimum wage law.  Salary 

increment and bonus are granted annually in line with the Group’s financial performance and 

monetary incentives are given periodically to encourage productivity increase.

The Group has also constructed two hostel building blocks housing over 1,000 foreign workers with 

decent facilities like dining, gymnasium, first aid room, laundry and grocery shops.  We outsourced 

the hostel management service to a facilities management specialist to ensure the hostel facilities are 

well maintained at all times so that good living conditions and well-being of the workers are taken 

care of.  

 

 

 

 

 

Our labour policy, which is published on the Group’s website is in place reflecting the Group’s pledge 

to uphold the human rights of workers. 

Labour Relations – Training &amp; Education 

We ensure that our employees have the skills they need to do their jobs and as they build their career 

with us.  We value our employees as the human capital asset and as the backbone of our operations 

and hence, we continue to develop our human capital by having them sent for professional training 

to equip them with skills relevant to their job requirement.   Each year, our training policy requires 

heads of department to conduct Training Needs Identification (TNI) for their staff, who will participate 

the training identified on specific dates.     

Orientation briefings for new joiners and other in-house trainings are conducted on a need basis by 

our senior executives.  On average, employees of the Group requiring external training received 15 

hours of training in FY2017.
