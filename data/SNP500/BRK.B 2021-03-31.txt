BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.
and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 31, 2021
Note 1. General 
The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. 
Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, changes in the fair values of certain derivative contract liabilities, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the magnitude of asset impairment charges can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings.
The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has since adversely affected nearly all of our operations, although the effects are varying significantly. The extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition include the time to vaccinate a significant number of people in the U.S. and throughout the world as well as the long-term effect from the pandemic on the demand for certain of our products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods.
Note 2. New accounting pronouncements 
We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020. ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses, which was primarily related to our manufactured housing loans. 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Note 4. Investments in equity securities (Continued)
Our equity security investments include $10 billion in Occidental Corporation (“Occidental”) Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $10 billion and warrants to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends or is mandatorily redeemable under specified events. Dividends on the preferred stock may be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. 
Note 5. Equity method investments 
Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshire currently owns 325,442,152 shares of Kraft Heinz common stock representing 26.6% of the outstanding shares.
We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $150 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $101 million in 2020. We received dividends on the common stock of $130 million in each of the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, which were recorded as reductions to the carrying value of our investment. 
Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $13.0 billion at March 31, 2021 and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $13.4 billion at March 31, 2021 and $13.3 billion at December 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment in Kraft Heinz exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by $362 million (2.7% of carrying value).

Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $3.1 billion as of March 31, 2021 and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our equity method earnings from these entities in the first quarter were $101 million in 2021 and $199 million in 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, we received distributions from these other investees of $896 million, including a non-recurring distribution received from Pilot of $849 million. Additional information concerning these investments follows. 
We own a 50% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50% interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through commercial paper, which was $1.47 billion at March 31, 2021 and limited to $1.5 billion. Berkadia’s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. 
A Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50% interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50% interest. In 2017, we acquired a 38.6% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America through more than 950 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale distribution. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1% interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3% interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot in 2023, with the Haslam family retaining a 20% interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023.

Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the period on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the period. As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds from sales of equity securities of approximately $6.5 billion in the first three months of 2021 and $2.2 billion in the first three months of 2020. In the preceding table, investment gains/losses on equity securities sold during the period reflect the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable quarterly period or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains/losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable gains in the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 were $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
The derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. Information related to these contracts follows (dollars in millions).

Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Intrinsic value is the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Substantially all open contracts as of March 31, 2021 will expire by February 2023. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the contract expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $1.9 billion on the contract inception dates with respect to unexpired contracts as of March 31, 2021 and we have no counterparty credit risk.

We are party to an agreement with Seritage Growth Properties to provide a $2.0 billion term loan facility, which expires on July 31, 2023. The outstanding loan under the facility was approximately $1.6 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and is secured by mortgages on real estate properties. In the first quarter of 2020, we provided a loan to Lee Enterprises, Inc. in connection with its acquisition of our newspaper operations and the repayment of its then outstanding credit facilities. The loan balance was $499 million as of March 31, 2021 and $524 million at December 31, 2020. We are the sole lender to each of these entities and each of these loans is current as to payment status.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 12. Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued)
Intangible asset amortization expense in the first quarter was $319 million in 2021 and $325 million in 2020. Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $18.3 billion as of March 31, 2021 and  December 31, 2020 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. 
During 2020, we concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our reporting units for impairment due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of approximately $10 billion and pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $10 billion of these charges related to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), the largest business within Berkshire's manufacturing segment. The carrying value of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to the impairment charges was approximately $31 billion.
 
Note 13. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 14), for each of the three months ending March 31, 2021 and 2020 follows (in millions).

Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $646 million in 2021 and $200 million in 2020, which produced corresponding decreases in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.8% in 2021 and 0.3% in 2020.  
Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to primary insurance were reduced by $699 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $172 million in 2020. The decreases in each period were primarily attributable to private passenger automobile and medical professional liability claims. The decrease in 2021 also reflected lower than anticipated workers’ compensation claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to reinsurance assumed increased $53 million in 2021 and decreased $28 million in 2020.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts 
Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three months ending March 31, 2021 and 2020 follow (in millions).

In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflects when our exposure to losses begins. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter were $247 million in 2021 and $283 million in 2020, which consisted of recurring amortization of deferred changes and the effects of changes in the expected timing and amount of future loss payments. Berkshire’s subsidiary, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), is party to a contract with certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”), in which NICO’s ultimate liability is contractually limited to $20 billion. Our estimated claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $17.5 billion at March 31, 2021 and $17.7 billion at December 31, 2020.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 15. Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued) 
In the first quarter of 2021, Berkshire repaid €550 million and $1.0 billion of maturing senior notes and issued €600 million of 0.5% senior notes due in 2041. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In January 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051. 
The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€6.9 billion, £1.75 billion and ¥625.5 billion par at March 31, 2021) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $720 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $228 million in the first quarter of 2020.
In addition to BHFC borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $1.1 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at March 31, 2021. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In the first quarter of 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries repaid $476 million of term debt and increased short-term borrowings.  
BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. During the first quarter of 2021, BNSF repaid $407 million of debt. As of March 31, 2021, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries. 
As of March 31, 2021, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $9.3 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $7.9 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 16. Fair value measurements (Continued)
The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. 
Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. 
Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. 
Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. 
Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 follow (in millions).

Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in certain preferred stocks and common stock warrants that do not have readily determinable market values as defined under GAAP. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 16. Fair value measurements (Continued)
Our equity index put option derivative contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model.

Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,525,655 shares outstanding as of March 31, 2021 and 1,543,960 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020. 
Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. 
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. 
Note 18. Income taxes 
Our consolidated effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 18.5% in 2021 and 21.2% in 2020. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, the magnitude of gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions.

Note 21. Contingencies and commitments 
We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
On November 1, 2020, Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) acquired a large portion of the natural gas transmission and storage business of Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) for approximately $2.5 billion. The acquisition included a partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“Cove Point”), consisting of 100% of the general partnership interest and 25% of the limited partnership interests. We treat Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. As of the acquisition date, the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired was $13.4 billion, including residual goodwill of $1.7 billion, and the fair value of the liabilities assumed was $6.9 billion, including the assumption of approximately $5.6 billion of debt. We also recorded noncontrolling interests of $3.9 billion attributable to limited partnership interests in Cove Point that are held by third parties. BHE has also agreed to acquire certain other of Dominion’s pipeline business for approximately $1.3 billion. The closing of this second acquisition is subject to receiving necessary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2021.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
Note 22. Revenues from contracts with customers 
We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. 
The following tables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 (in millions). Other revenues included in consolidated revenues were primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customers under GAAP.

Note 23. Business segment data 
Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. Revenues and earnings before income taxes by segment for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions).

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. 
The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected most of our operating businesses beginning in March of 2020, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Revenues and earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of 2021, many of these businesses experienced significant recoveries in revenues and earnings. Consequently, revenues and earnings in the first quarter of 2021 for these businesses were considerably higher than in the first quarter of 2020, although results for certain businesses were negatively affected by major winter storms in North America during February 2021. Certain of our other operating businesses continue to suffer adverse effects from the pandemic. 
We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at our operations will completely normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. 
Insurance underwriting produced after-tax earnings of $764 million in the first quarter of 2021 and $363 million in 2020. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting losses from reinsurance assumed. Underwriting results in 2021 also reflected the effects of the pandemic, including premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program and reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile coverages. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in the first quarter of 2021 declined $178 million (12.8%) compared to 2020, primarily due to lower interest income earned on cash and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills. 
After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 5.1% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected overall higher freight volumes and lower costs due to improved productivity. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 25.3% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected increased earnings from the natural gas pipelines and real estate brokerage businesses, partially offset by lower earnings from the other energy businesses. Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 28.5% in the first quarter of 2021 versus 2020. Overall, our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, which reflected the initial adverse effects of the pandemic. 
Investment and derivative gains/losses in 2021 and 2020 included significant gains and losses on equity securities, including unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.
23

 
Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Insurance—Underwriting 
Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance businesses. 
The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses in excess of $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. 
Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $121.6 billion as of March 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings for the first quarter of 2021 continues to reflect decreases in losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to lower average claims frequencies from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were partially offset by lower premiums earned from the remaining effects of the GEICO Giveback program and higher average claims severities.
Premiums written in the first quarter of 2021 increased 3.4% compared to 2020. The premium increase was primarily attributable to higher average voluntary auto policies-in-force, partially offset by a decrease in average premiums per auto policy due to coverage changes. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 124,000 during the first quarter of 2021.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
GEICO (Continued)
The GEICO Giveback program provided a 15% premium credit to all new and renewal voluntary auto and motorcycle policies written between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Premiums earned in the first quarter of 2021 decreased by 2.0% compared to 2020, which included reductions of approximately $400 million attributable to the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback credit.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2021 decreased $303 million (4.5%) compared to 2020. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to earnings in the first quarter of 2021 was 72.4%, a decrease of 1.9 percentage points compared to 2020, reflecting declines in claims frequencies, partially offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned.
Claims frequencies in the first quarter of 2021 were lower for property damage and bodily injury coverages (fourteen to fifteen percent range), personal injury coverage (ten to eleven percent range) and collision coverage (flat to one percent range). Average claims severities in the first quarter of 2021 were higher for property damage coverage (three to four percent range), collision coverage (ten to eleven percent range) and bodily injury coverage (twelve to thirteen percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter included reductions in the ultimate claim loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $521 million in 2021 and $148 million in 2020. 
Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were $1.4 billion, an increase of $78 million (5.7%) compared to 2020, reflecting higher employee-related, advertising and technology costs partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) in the first quarter of 2021 was 16.1%, an increase of 1.2 percentage points compared to 2020, attributable to both the increase in expenses and the decline in earned premiums.

Premiums written increased $453 million (18.5%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, driven by increases at BH Specialty (40%) and MedPro Group (24%). The increase at BH Specialty was primarily attributable to increased casualty business and the increase at MedPro Group reflected increases across certain product categories. BHHC’s premiums written declined 8% from the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to lower workers’ compensation volumes. The declines in workers’ compensation premiums reflected the effects of overall lower insured payroll levels attributable to the pandemic and continuing increased price competition in the market.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (Continued)
BH Primary’s loss ratio in the first quarter of 2021 was 69.7%, a decline of 6.7 percentage points versus 2020, which reflected net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $178 million in 2021 and $24 million in 2020. Estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2021 from a major winter storm in North America (“Winter Storm Uri”) in February 2021 were approximately $150 million. There were no significant catastrophe loss events in the first quarter of 2020. Incurred losses attributable to the pandemic were not significant in the first quarter of 2021 and were approximately $170 million in the first quarter of 2020. BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. Underwriting expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were relatively unchanged compared to 2020. The expense ratio declined 2.5 percentage points, reflecting changes in business mix and the impact of pandemic-related allowances for expected credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020. 
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 
The Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also offer life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN. 
Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (in millions).

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) 
Property/casualty (Continued)
Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $287 million (13.5%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 and the loss ratio decreased 7.0 percentage points, reflecting generally lower ratios in most of BHRG’s various product categories. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2021 included estimated losses from Winter Storm Uri of approximately $310 million and a net increase in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $53 million. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2020 included $230 million attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a net reduction in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $28 million. 
Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio decreased 3.8 percentage points in the first quarter, attributable to changes in business mix and the impact of pandemic-related charges in the first quarter of 2020.

Life/health premiums written decreased $51 million (3.8%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease reflected the non-renewal in 2021 of a policy that covered U.S. health insurance risks ($164 million), partially offset by volume growth in the Asian and European life markets and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2021 were negatively affected by significant increases in mortality in the U.S., Africa and Latin America, which were partially offset by lower underwriting expenses, due mainly to lower average commission rates in the international life business. Underwriting results in the first quarter of 2020 reflected pre-tax earnings from U.S. and international life business, partially offset by pre-tax losses from the run-off of U.S. long-term care business and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects.  
Retroactive reinsurance 
There were no significant retroactive reinsurance contracts written in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each period derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency exchange effects were insignificant in the first quarter of 2021. Underwriting results in the first quarter of 2020 included foreign currency exchange gains of $205 million. Before foreign currency exchange effects, pre-tax underwriting losses in the first quarter were $243 million in 2021 and $247 million in 2020.  
Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $40.7 billion at March 31, 2021 and $41.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $12.2 billion at March 31, 2021 and $12.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization. 
Periodic payment annuity 
Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in the first quarter of 2021 decreased $15 million (9.4%) compared to 2020. Periodic payment annuity business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. 
27

 
Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) 
Periodic payment annuity (Continued)
Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include the effects of mortality, interest rate changes that may affect expected settlements under certain contracts and gains or losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results in the first quarter included foreign currency exchange losses of $10 million in 2021 and gains of $105 million in 2020.
Excluding foreign currency exchange gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses in the first quarter were $126 million in 2021 and $161 million in 2020, which primarily derived from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Pre-tax losses in the first quarter of 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and interest rates. Discounted annuity liabilities were $14.4 billion at March 31, 2021, reflecting a weighted average discount rate of approximately 4.0%. 
Variable annuity 
Variable annuity guarantee contracts produced pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of $121 million in 2021 and pre-tax losses of $234 million in 2020. The results from these contracts reflect changes in our estimated liabilities for underlying guaranteed benefits, which are affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting results from these contracts are volatile, reflecting the volatility of securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2021 were primarily attributable to the effects of interest rate changes, while the losses in 2020 reflected the impact of unfavorable changes in securities markets and interest rates.

Interest and other investment income in the first quarter of 2021 declined $245 million (60.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. We expect short-term interest rates, which are historically low, to remain low, negatively affecting our earnings from such investments for the remainder of 2021. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. Dividend income was relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. 
Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $140 billion at March 31, 2021 and $138 billion at December 31, 2020. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, and consequently, the average cost of float for each period was negative.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued)
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected the demand for our services in 2020. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing, and the full extent to which it may impact our business and financial results remain uncertain and will depend on future developments.
Railroad operating revenues decreased 0.4% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting increased volumes of 4.8%, offset by a 5.1% decrease in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings were $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 4.7% compared to 2020. The increase principally resulted from increased volume and lower operating expenses due to overall improved productivity.
Operating revenues from consumer products were $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 7.1% from 2020. The increase reflected higher volumes of 15.4%, partially offset by lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase is the result of growth in both international and domestic intermodal shipments driven by increased retail sales and inventory replenishments by retailers, along with increased e-commerce activity. Automotive shipments declined primarily attributable to production impacts from a global microchip shortage.
Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of 16.3% from 2020. The decrease was attributable to lower volumes of 13.3% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decrease was primarily driven by reduced production and demand in the energy sector, which contributed to lower petroleum products and sand volume. In addition, we experienced lower shipments of chemicals, plastics and aggregates due to the impact of winter storms in Texas and the U.S. Gulf Coast regions. 
Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 14.3% from 2020. The revenue increase reflected a volume increase of 11.6% in 2021 as compared to 2020, along with higher revenue per car/unit. Volumes increased primarily due to higher grain exports. 
Operating revenues from coal were $686 million in the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of 10.4% compared to 2020. The decrease reflected lower volume of 11.7%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decline was primarily attributable to lower utility demand in the early part of the quarter, along with severe winter storms, which impacted deliveries. 
Railroad operating expenses in the first quarter of 2021 were $3.3 billion, a decrease of $91 million (2.7%) compared to 2020. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 1.5 percentage points to 63.7% in 2021 versus 2020. Railroad operating expenses in 2021 reflected productivity improvements and lower average fuel prices.
Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $61 million (5.0%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to fewer employees as a result of improved productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $64 million (10.4%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower gross ton mile volumes and higher fuel efficiency. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $41 million (9.1%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, resulting from higher miscellaneous taxes and property taxes. 
Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) 
We currently own 91.1% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates a global energy business. BHE’s domestic regulated utility interests are comprised of PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) and NV Energy. In Great Britain, BHE subsidiaries operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid. BHE’s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility in which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of these systems were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (“BHE GT&S acquisition”). Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (“AltaLink, L.P.”) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects. BHE also operates the largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States.

Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued)
The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent such costs are not allowed in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. A summary of BHE’s net earnings follows (dollars in millions).

PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. PacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $7 million in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease reflected higher depreciation and amortization expense, lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and higher property taxes, partially offset by higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and increased income tax benefits from the impacts of ratemaking and higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. 
PacifiCorp utility margin was $818 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $29 million compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher retail revenue derived from a 0.3% increase in customer volumes, higher wholesale revenue and lower purchased power costs, partially offset by higher natural gas-fueled and coal-fueled generation costs. Retail customer volumes increased due to an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by lower customer usage.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued)
MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings decreased $6 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses, partially offset by increased income tax benefits and other income. The increase in operating expenses included costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, as well as higher electric and natural gas distribution costs. The income tax benefit increase was mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized from higher wind-powered generation, driven primarily by new wind projects placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking. 
MEC electric utility margin increased slightly to $394 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from wholesale and retail customer volumes, largely offset by higher generation and purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes in the first quarter increased 4.9%, primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather and increased usage by certain industrial customers.
NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $14 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected lower operating expenses, higher other income, lower interest expense and lower income tax expense from the impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by lower electric utility margin. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to lower plant operations and maintenance costs, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional plant placed in-service. 
NV Energy electric utility margin decreased $18 million to $305 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower operating revenue from lower base tariff general rates at Nevada Power Company, a 3.2% decrease in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers, and price impacts from changes in sales mix. The decrease in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the favorable impacts of weather.
Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings increased $17 million in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to 2020. The earnings increase reflected higher distribution revenue, mainly from increased tariff rates, and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021. 
Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $204 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The increase included earnings of $107 million from BHE GT&S, the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas. The higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas were largely due to the favorable impacts on demand from the February 2021 winter storms. 
Other energy business after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2021 decreased $74 million compared to 2020, due to lower wind tax equity investment earnings of $93 million, partially offset by higher operating revenue from renewable energy projects. Wind tax equity investment earnings decreased due to increased losses from existing tax equity investments of $138 million, primarily due to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation.
Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $74 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, attributable to significantly higher earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to higher refinance activity and the earnings increase from brokerage services was due to a comparative increase in closed transaction volumes of 35%.
Corporate interest and other after-tax losses increased $30 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020 and higher operating expenses.

Industrial products 
The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, including equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries, which are internally aggregated into sectors (or “groups”).

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Industrial products (Continued)
Revenues of the industrial products group in the first quarter of 2021 declined $686 million (9.3%) from the first quarter of 2020, while pre-tax earnings declined $164 million (12.6%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 17.1% in 2021 compared to 17.7% in 2020. Results in 2020 were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
PCC’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of $884 million (36.2%) compared to 2020. Historically, PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production in 2020. While air travel in the U.S. is increasing, we do not expect significant increases in aircraft production to occur in the near term. Consequently, we anticipate PCC’s revenues and earnings will remain relatively low in 2021.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings decreased 33.5% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. The earnings decrease reflected the decline in sales of aerospace products, partially offset by the effects of aggressive actions taken by management to resize and restructure operations to improve profitability. 
Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 5.1% compared to 2020, reflecting higher volumes and favorable sales mix. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in the first quarter of 2021 increased 4.8% from 2020, primarily due to volume increases in Engineered Materials and Additives product lines. Despite an increase in sales and volume compared to the prior year, the Additives product line was affected by severe winter storms in February 2021 which caused the temporary shut-down of several U.S. facilities and negatively impacted sales in the quarter. 
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings decreased 13.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in the first quarter of 2021 were negatively impacted by the weather-related temporary shut-down of Additives facilities in the U.S. Pre-tax earnings were reduced due to manufacturing inefficiencies, various incremental and non-recurring operating costs and lost sales margins. This was partially offset by increased pre-tax earnings from Life Sciences and Engineered Materials. 
Marmon’s revenues were $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $90 million (4.5%) over 2020. The increase reflected higher revenues in the Electrical and the Plumbing & Refrigeration business groups, primarily due to the impact of higher metals prices and higher volumes. Partially offsetting these increases were lower revenues from the Rail & Leasing group, attributable to lower leased fleet utilization and lease renewal rates and to lower railcar sales and repair services. 
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2021 decreased $17 million (5.8%) compared to 2020. Earnings in the first quarter of 2021 reflected lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups, partly offset by higher earnings in nearly all other groups, led by Medical, Retail Solutions, Electrical and Industrial Products, as well as from lower restructuring costs. 
IMC’s revenues were $885 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 5.1% compared to 2020. Revenues in the first quarter of 2021 reflected favorable foreign currency translation effects and improving business conditions in many geographic regions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 25.3% in the first quarter of 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to the favorable effects of improved manufacturing efficiencies, other operating cost savings initiatives and foreign currency translation.
Building products 
The building products group includes manufactured and site-built construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek).
34

 
Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) 
Building products (Continued)
Revenues of the building products group increased $771 million (15.9%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 and pre-tax earnings increased $203 million (35.8%) over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.7% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 11.7% in 2020. Residential housing construction demand in the U.S. was strong during 2020 and continued through the first quarter of 2021. These conditions, along with supply chain disruptions, contributed to significant cost increases for key materials and products used by our businesses, including lumber, steel, copper and fixtures, necessitating higher sales prices.
Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $544 million (30.9%) over 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues from home sales of $468 million (36%), reflecting a net increase in units sold, increased revenue per home sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 45% in the first quarter of 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 2%. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities increased 17% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.4 billion as of March 31, 2021 compared to $17.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. 
Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were $391 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $190 million (94.5%) compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and a decline of $60 million in provisions for expected credit losses. The provisions for expected credit losses in the first quarter of 2020 were unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 7.3% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes for paint and coatings, residential flooring, roofing and other building systems and favorable foreign currency translation effects. 
Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $379 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 3.4% over 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues and operating cost control efforts, partly offset by rising costs and availability of certain materials and freight services from the adverse effects of supply chain disruptions and severe storms in 2021. 
Consumer products 
The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline).
Consumer products revenues increased $793 million (28.1%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, while pre-tax earnings increased $286 million (120.2%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues increased 6.1 percentage points to 14.5%. Revenues in the first quarter of 2021 increased significantly over 2020 at nearly all of our businesses. Revenues and earnings in the first quarter of 2020 were negatively affected by the pandemic.
In the first quarter of 2021, revenues from Forest River increased 39.7% over 2020, driven by increased unit sales for recreational vehicles. Apparel and footwear sales increased 21.7% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, reflecting strong sales growth from Brooks Sports (41.6%) and increased apparel volumes attributable in part to inventory restocking by certain customers. Duracell’s revenues in the first quarter of 2021 increased 16.9% over 2020. The increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily attributable to revenue increases from Forest River, Brooks Sports, Duracell, and the apparel businesses, as well as the impact of inventory obsolescence allowances that were recorded in the first quarter of 2020.

Service 
Our service business group offers shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and the operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). 
Service group revenues increased 7.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 and pre-tax earnings increased $165 million (38.8%) versus 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 16.4% in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 3.7 percentage points compared to 2020. 
Revenues of TTI increased 26.4% in the first quarter of 2021 versus 2020, reflecting higher demand across all significant markets within the electronic components industry as customers were restocking inventories in response to supply chain disruptions and international trade disputes. Revenues from aviation services (NetJets and FlightSafety) declined 1.3%, primarily due to lower commercial and corporate training hours at FlightSafety. Aggregate flight hours at NetJets were relatively unchanged. 
The comparative increase in earnings reflected increased earnings at several of the service businesses, with the most significant increases from TTI and the aviation services businesses. The increase in earnings from NetJets and FlightSafety was primarily attributable to improved operating margins from changes in business mix, lower fuel and travel costs, increased operating efficiencies and the effects of past restructuring efforts. TTI’s earnings increase was attributable to the increase in sales and improved operating cost leverage. 
Retailing 
Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA represented about 63% of our combined retailing revenues in 2021. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics and represented about 21% of the combined retailing revenues in 2021. Other retailing businesses also include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) 
Retailing (Continued)
Retailing group revenues increased $755 million (21.0%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 and pre-tax earnings increased $215 million (161.7%). Operating results of nearly all of our retailing businesses were severely impacted by the pandemic beginning in March of 2020 and continuing through the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, revenues and pre-tax earnings of these businesses increased, and in certain instances to levels exceeding those in pre-pandemic periods, despite ongoing supply chain disruptions. 
BHA’s revenues in the first quarter of 2021 increased 17.4% from 2020, primarily due to a 21% increase in new and pre-owned vehicle sales, mainly attributable to higher volumes. Home furnishings group revenues increased $157 million (21.0%) in the first quarter of 2021 over 2020, while aggregate revenues of our other retailing operations increased 36.9%. 
BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased $67 million over 2020, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross sales margins and earnings from finance and service contract activities as well as from lower floorplan interest expense and operating cost control efforts. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $148 million compared to the first quarter of 2020.
McLane Company 
McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales typically comprise about two-thirds of McLane’s consolidated sales with foodservice comprising much of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. The grocery and foodservice businesses, in particular, operate in an intensely competitive business environment. 
Revenues decreased $199 million (1.7%) in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. Revenues from the grocery business declined 5.3%, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 4.4% and 20.2%, respectively, compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2021 increased $38 million (58.5%) versus 2020. The increase in earnings was primarily due to increased earnings from the beverage business, ongoing cost management efforts and the effects of expected credit losses and inventory losses of $17 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020 attributable to the pandemic.

Investment gains/losses 
We are required to include the unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses in the first quarter included net unrealized gains of $4.6 billion in 2021 and net unrealized losses of $68.5 billion in 2020 on securities we held at the end of the applicable period. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold in the first quarter, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $1.8 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020.

Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued)
Investment gains/losses (Continued)
We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. 
Derivative gains/losses 
Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant due to the volatility of market prices in the underlying equity markets. As of March 31, 2021, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $211 million and our recorded liability at fair value was $577 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under these contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts.

After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz for the first quarter were $135 million in 2021 and $99 million in 2020.  
After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. 
Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s outstanding Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce non-cash unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Financial Condition 
Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2021 was $448 billion, an increase of $4.8 billion since December 31, 2020. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $11.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021 and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $4.3 billion. Changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities can produce volatility in our earnings. 
At March 31, 2021, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $138.1 billion, which included $115.3 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills, and is net of payables for unsettled purchases as of March 31. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $302.1 billion.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Financial Condition (Continued)
Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at March 31, 2021 was $21.0 billion, a decrease of $1.7 billion since December 31, 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, Berkshire repaid €550 million and $1.0 billion of maturing senior notes and issued €600 million of 0.5% senior notes due in 2041. In April 2021, Berkshire issued ¥160 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. Berkshire parent company debt maturities over the next twelve months are approximately $1.1 billion.
Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were $18.6 billion at March 31, 2021, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In January 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. 
Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations in the first quarter of 2021 were $1.9 billion and we currently forecast additional capital expenditures of approximately $8.5 billion over the remainder of 2021. 
Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries. BNSF’s outstanding debt was $22.8 billion as of March 31, 2021, a decrease of $404 million from December 31, 2020. In April 2021, BNSF issued $925 million of 3.3% debentures due in 2051. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $52.2 billion at March 31, 2021, essentially unchanged since December 31, 2020. In April 2021, a BHE subsidiary issued $550 million of 3.4% term debt due in 2051. Aggregate debt maturities for BHE and BNSF over the next twelve months approximate $3.0 billion. 
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In the first quarter of 2021, Berkshire paid $6.6 billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock.
Contractual Obligations 
We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future are not currently reflected in the financial statements, which will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and amount of the payments under certain contracts, such as insurance and reinsurance contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events and the actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
In the first quarter 2021, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt. Such debt, in U.S. Dollars, approximated $1.5 billion in the aggregate. Principal and interest payments associated with these borrowings are expected as follows: in 2021 – $9.4 million; in 2022 through 2025 – $22.3 million per annum; and thereafter – $2.0 billion. In April 2021, Berkshire and certain subsidiaries issued term debt, which in U.S. Dollars aggregated $2.9 billion. Maturities for these issuances range from 2026 to 2051 and the debt has a weighted average interest rate of 1.925%.
Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2021 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Critical Accounting Policies 
Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2021 includes estimated liabilities of $121.6 billion for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. 
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2021 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.7 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. 
As of March 31, 2021, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The long-term adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our reporting units may prove to be worse than we currently estimate and we may need to record additional goodwill or indefinite-lived asset impairment charges in future periods. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units and judgments on goodwill impairments at this time are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on a reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. 
Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Forward-Looking Statements 
Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. 
Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the “Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of March 31, 2021, there were no material changes in the market risks described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect internal control over financial reporting. 
Part II Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
Item 1A. Risk Factors 
Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 to which reference is made herein. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or operations. Any adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results could result in a decline in the value of our securities and the loss of all or part of your investment.

Part II Other Information 
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities 
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Information with respect to Berkshire’s Class A and Class B common stock repurchased during the first quarter of 2021 follows.

The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $20 billion.
