MATERIAL TOPICS AND BOUNDARIES 

 

ARL, in the study and identification of the material topics, is guided by the GRI Reporting 

framework and reflects the Group’s commitments. The interests of the key stakeholders 

were considered along with the overall operations of the Company. ARL determined the 

materiality of its sustainability topics solely based on the level of ARL’s impact on the 

environmental, social and governance of its areas of operations and surroundings. The 

material topics are expanded upon in the various sections. 

 

ARL’s mining and quarrying operations have potential impacts on the land, air, water and 

ecosystems of the surrounding areas as well as significant economic, social and cultural 

impacts on the local communities in the areas that ARL operates in. Based on the above, 

ARL has identified “Environmental Topics – Energy and Water &amp; Effluents” and “Social – 

Occupational Health &amp; Safety" as its Key Material Topics.

ENVIRONMENTAL TOPICS 

 

ARL works closely with the environmental consultant to minimise any impact on the 

environment and to be in compliance with the guidelines from the Department of 

Environment, Terengganu (“DOE”).  

 

 

Energy – Diesel and Electricity 

ARL’s gold mining and granite quarrying operations are energy intensive and both utilise 

diesel and electricity (electricity supplied by Tenaga Nasional Bhd). The usage of diesel and 

electricity for the mine and quarry during FY2017 and FY2018 are shown in the charts 

below. However, as the activities of the mine and quarry are significantly different for 

FY2017 and FY2018 as shown below, a direct comparison is not practical. The differences in 

the activities of AASB and GGTM during FY2017 and FY2018 are listed in “Main Activities in 

Gold Mine (FY2017 &amp; FY2018) and “Main Activities in Granite Quarry (FY2017 &amp; FY2018)”. 

 

 

Fuel Usage in Gold Mine: AASB 

Main Activities in Gold Mine (FY2017 &amp; FY2018) 

 Production of free gold from January 2017 to May 2017 

 Addition of new equipment and modifications to existing plant; and construction of a

FY2018 performance review:  

While ARL has tried to minimise the energy consumption in FY2018, fuel and electricity 

usage has increased due to a higher scale of operations 

 

AASB 

The usage of electricity in the gold mine increased 102% from FY2017 to FY2018 as the 

processing plant was operational in FY2018 to produce gold ore concentrate, while the plant 

was under modification works from June 2017. There was a 10% increase in the usage of 

diesel. 

 

GGTM 

There was a 49% increase in electricity usage, for lighting purposes, at the new plant 

extension at the granite quarry. The usage of diesel increased 171% from FY2017 to FY2018 

with the increase in the excavation of rocks and the running of the existing and new plant 

machinery.

Target for FY2019:  

ARL did not set a target for the usage of diesel and electricity for FY2019 as there are 

planned changes to the operations of the mine and the quarry in FY2019. Hence, ARL will 

relook at the expected usage and set targets once the operations in the mine and the quarry 

have been stabilised. Please refer to the announcements dated 16 April 2018 and 16 

January 2019 for details. 

 

 

 

 

Water &amp; Effluents: 

In order not to adversely impact the environment, the gold mining and granite quarrying 

operations of ARL recycle the water that the operations utilise in closed water systems. 

Effluents from both the gold mining and the granite quarrying operations are stored within 

the mine and the quarry. 

 

Water used for the activities of AASB and GGTM are as follows: 

Lubuk Mandi Gold Mine (AASB) 

Bukit Chetai Granite Quarry (GGTM) 

 Tunnelling works to facilitate 

underground mining of hard rocks 

 Operations of processing plant to 

produce gold concentrate ore 

 Hygiene purposes 

 Excavation of granite rocks and 

production of granite blocks 

 Cutting granite blocks to granite 

strip-slabs and cutting strip-slabs  

to granite tiles  

 Hygiene purposes 

 

 

FY2018 performance review:  

AASB used 26,794 m3 of water (FY2017: 22,373 m3) supplied by Syarikat Air Terengganu Sdn. 

Bhd. while GGTM captures and utilises rainfall runoff only. ARL utilised closed water systems 

and stored the effluents within the mine and the quarry to minimise water withdrawal and 

to avoid discharging waste water or effluents into the surrounding waterways.  

 

Target for FY2019: 

ARL is committed to maintain the closed water systems and to continue to store effluents 

within the mine and the quarry so as to ensure zero discharge of any waste water or 

effluents into the surrounding waterways. ARL did not set a target for the usage of water for 

FY2019 as there are planned changes to the operations of the mine and the quarry in 

FY2019. Hence, ARL will relook at the expected usage and set targets once the operations in 

the mine and the quarry have been stabilised. Please refer to the announcements dated 16 

April 2018 and 16 January 2019 for details.

quarrying areas and/or the processing plants. Refresher briefings for the employees are also 

carried out on, at least, an annual basis. Appropriate personal protective equipment (“PPE”) 

are provided to both our employees and our visitors. Suppliers’ workers are required to be 

equipped with the appropriate PPE. ARL employs safety officers or safety supervisors to 

maintain safety measures, including putting up safety signage to remind the workers of the 

safety matters. On an annual basis, AASB and GGTM report the Safety and Health status of 

the mine and the quarry to the Department of Occupational Safety and Health.
