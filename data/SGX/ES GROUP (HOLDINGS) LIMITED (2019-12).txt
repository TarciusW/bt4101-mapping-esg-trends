Safe Working Environment 

The Group has seen a decrease in the Incident Frequency Rate from 29 cases per million man-hours in 2018, to 6 cases per 

million man-hours in 2019. This was mainly due to the decrease in number of cases of all kind of injuries namely FAI, NLTI, LTI 

and LTA. The decrease in LTA has also translated to a lower Incident Severity Rate of 27 man-days lost per million man-hours 

in 2019, from 84 man-days lost per million man-hours in 2018. The number of LTA cases decreased from 5 cases in 2018, to 1 

case in 2019. 

The Group continues to strive towards ‘Zero Accident’ goal and targets to cap the number of LTA, IFR, ISR and ODR cases in 

2020 at zero per million man-hours and zero man-days lost per million man-hours.
