1 MESSAGE FROM THE CEO / BOARD STATEMENT 

It gives me great pleasure to introduce the inaugural sustainability report of Metal Component 

Engineering Limited (the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) for the financial 

year ended 31 December (“FY”) 2017, which highlights the progress and achievements of our 

organisation in FY2017, with particular focus on our commitment to working alongside with our valued 

stakeholders to build a sustainable business based on our resilience, adaptability and innovation.  

We firmly believe that building a sustainable business is vital to our continued success and that we 

must be fully accountable for our impact on the environment, our customers, our people and our 

community as well as its financial performance.  

The delivery of sustainable results is, however, a critical aspect of our ability to remain a strong and 

financially stable company. Acknowledging this helps to put into focus our commitment to principles 

laid out in our Corporate Sustainability Policy. Our responsibility to society is to ensure that sustainable 

practices are incorporated into every link of our value chain. We must meet the needs not only of our 

customers, employees and the community we operate in, but also those of our environment and our 

future generations.  

This report provides detail about how we have met our responsibilities with our key stakeholders 

during the FY2017 and beyond.

2 ABOUT THE REPORT 

This sustainability report articulates our commitment to sustainability and transparency. This is our 

first sustainability report. This report is designed to provide a transparent and balanced view of the 

company, to reflect the interests of our key stakeholders, and to address those interests pragmatically. 

This report aims to include comprehensive and accessible information on the company’s strategy 

towards sustainability, key issues as well as data according to recognized standards.  

2.1 Report Scope 

This report covers the performance of our consolidated entities in FY2017. This report content focuses 

on the sustainability performance, activities and initiatives that are under our direct control, including 

our Singapore offices and regional operations, our local supply chain as well as any overseas activities 

directly associated with us. Material issues and topics described in this report have been selected 

according to their significance within the Company’s boundaries, the sustainability context and the 

expectations of the stakeholders. Our material operations are mainly in Singapore, Malaysia, China 

and Thailand. The scope and all material topics disclosed in this report are relevant to the activities in 

these countries. Nevertheless, our corporate governance and sustainability approaches are drawn 

from the policies and practices set at the Group level. 

This sustainability report focuses on the Group’s sustainability strategies and practices whilst 

highlighting the economic, environmental, and social and governance aspects of our activities and 

developments. This report aims to provide an overview of our approach, priorities and targets, as well 

as a performance review for our key sustainability areas.  

2.2 Report Methodology 

We have prepared our report based on the requirements of the ‘In accordance-Core’ level of the 

Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. We have chosen the 

GRI Standards reporting guidelines for its robust guidance which offers an international reference for 

the disclosure of governance approach and of the environmental, social and economic performance 

and impacts of organizations. This report also takes into consideration of the primary components of 

the report content as set out by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited’s (“SGX-ST”) 

“Comply or Explain” requirements for sustainability reporting. Our data are reported in good faith and 

to the best of our knowledge. We continue to improve our data collection processes.  

We did not seek external assurance for this report. 

2.3 Report Structure 

This sustainability report is structured to reflect the interests of our key stakeholders. We have 

identified five key stakeholder groups, namely, the environment and future generations, employees, 

customers, suppliers, and communities. For each stakeholder group, we lay out our management 

approaches that govern how our material issues are identified as well as how the issues are prioritized 

and managed. Further, we will present our initiatives relating to sustainability in the areas of 

environmental, social and economic issues relevant to our topics and boundaries. Finally, we will 

provide the information of our key performance indicators, performance targets and outcomes. 

The information regarding the basis for report boundaries and our materiality assessment is provided 

in section 4 of this report.

4 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS 

We believe that corporate social responsibility is a key driver towards long-term sustainability. Such 

responsibility is pragmatically integrated into our business practices as one of the core values in our 

corporate culture. Embedding such responsibility into our management processes across the value 

chain allows us to establish credibility among our stakeholders. Through our action today, we play a 

part in influencing the environment for our future generations. Through integrating the notion of 

sustainability in our business, we ensure that our business strategy and operations are in line with a 

long-term vision towards a conducive and sustainability future. 

4.1 Sustainability Management Framework 

In July 2017, we took the initiative to establish our sustainability reporting framework. We performed 

an analysis on our business and operation models as the basis for our stakeholder mapping and 

materiality assessment. Through our analysis, we identified five key stakeholder groups within our 

sustainability context and their respective material issues are to be shown in this report. 

4.2 Key Stakeholders and Material Issues 

We have a regular review, assessment and feedback process in relation to the ESG topics. The key to 

this is a regular risk assessment exercise which entails the identification, assessment and 

documentation of material risks and corresponding internal controls. Such material risks include fraud 

and corruption, environmental, health and safety, and human capital risks which are ESG-relevant. 

We are continuously improving the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk assessment process in 

response to the changing business and operation environment. 

Through regular stakeholder engagement, we identify and review material issues that are most 

relevant and significant to us and our stakeholders. For external stakeholders, priority is given to issues 

important to the society and applicable to us. Then, we prioritize our sustainability efforts and report 

issues that are most material to the business and the stakeholders. Considering that specific 

stakeholders and material issues are specific in countries and locations, we are reporting the 

stakeholder engagement and material issues for our Singapore operations in this report.

4.3 Alignment with International Initiatives 

4.3.1 

Sustainable Development Goals  

Established in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations (the “Charter”), the general assembly 

occupies a central position as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the 

United Nations. Comprising all 193 Members of the United Nations, it provides a unique forum for 

multilateral discussion of the full spectrum of international issues covered by the Charter. It also plays 

a significant role in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law.

On 25 September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 17 Sustainable 

Development Goals (“SDG”) to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part 

of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 

15 years. Although the SDGs are primarily aimed at governments, they represent an important 

opportunity for businesses to also act for a more sustainable world. We will use SDGs as one of the 

guiding principles for our sustainability initiatives. 

We acknowledge that our participation in reaching the SDGs has room for improvement. As we 

advance on our sustainability journey, we will continue to assess our alignment with the SDGs and, 

whenever possible, redirect our internal priorities and sustainability strategy to more effectively and 

comprehensively address the goals.

SDG Goal 

Relevant Targets to Our Businesses 

(Source: 

http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org) 

Our Participation 

 

13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising, 

and human and institutional capacity on 

climate change mitigation, adaptation, 

impact reduction and early warning. 

We have our own internal processes and 

environmental policies to reduce electricity 

and fuel consumption. Our approach to 

mitigating climate change includes staff 

training and implementing energy-efficient 

measures. We monitor and report our 

Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions and set 

reduction targets. 

 

15.1: By 2020, ensure the conservation, 

restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial 

and inland freshwater ecosystems and their 

services, in particular forests, wetlands, 

mountains and drylands, in line with 

obligations under international agreements. 

All the paper used in our offices is Forest 

Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certified. We 

actively promote the use of FSC paper across 

our organization. 

 

 

 

 

 

The following SDG goals are relevant to our 

business, operations and value chain. They are 

addressed in our various policies at the Group 

level. Such goals are also embedded in various 

initiatives carried out across the organization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We do not believe these goals are relevant to our 

business or industry. They are not within our 

boundaries and scope of influence, and therefore, 

we are currently unable to make noticeable 

contributions to such goals.

5 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

We believe that good CSR practice goes hand-in-hand with good corporate management practice. We 

also recognize that it is vital that our management approaches are adaptable to the dynamics of 

business and operation environment in such a way that we can continuously assess our impacts, 

develop sustainability objectives and respond in a proper manner to meet our stakeholders’ 

expectations. Our CSR framework is based on our approach to sustainability and includes policies and 

measurement mechanisms to monitor the impacts made by our businesses and operations. 

Key to the success of our sustainability programme is through regular and up-to-date communication 

about our CSR policies and activities to all our stakeholders, and the provision of appropriate feedback 

mechanisms so that we can monitor and evaluate how we are doing and explore new possibilities 

stimulated by the stakeholder responses. We see our sustainability report as being a critical 

component of this continuous cycle of communication and evaluation. The overall sustainability 

context of the stakeholder engagements is managed through our CSR plan for our sustainability 

governance oversight.

5.1 Protecting Our Environment for the Future Generations 

5.1.1 

Our Approach 

We are committed to maintaining and building on the same stringent environmental policies and 

standards in our Singapore office and key regional operations. We continually seek new and innovative 

ways to reduce the environmental impact of our products and services while maintaining the highest 


 

 

 

Metal Component Engineering Limited  

Sustainability Report

Sustainability Report  





Page 14 of 31 

levels of quality. We recognise our responsibility to protect the environment for the health and 

wellbeing of the future generations.  

5.1.2 

Reduction of Carbon Footprint 

We recognize that effective management and monitoring of carbon footprint can reduce operating 

costs, raise brand profile, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholder value. Our carbon 

footprint is measured in terms of GHG emission. However, GHG emission is an absolute measure of 

how much carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is emitted. Our GHG emission is predominantly indirect 

(Scope 2). We have insignificant direct (Scope 1), and we do not include the GHG emissions generated 

by our suppliers (Scope 3). 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our GHG emission 

efficiency index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. To this end, we have set a target 

for GHG emission efficiency improvement of 10% from our 2017 level by 2030. Our target for GHG 

emission improvement is 0.8% per year. Although various business lines and operations account for 

different percentage of GHG emissions across the organization, they all support this target and have 

aligned our environmental objectives accordingly.  

FY2017 is our first year of sustainability reporting. FY2017 will be used as reference against which the 

performance will be measured in subsequent years.  

5.1.3 

Reduction of Paper Consumption 

All our employees are urged to minimize paper wastage at work by adhering to our Internal Paper 

Usage Reduction Guidelines. For example, double-sided printing is set as a default, lower grammage 

paper is used for daily printing, and blank sides of unneeded single-sided copies are used for printing 

drafts. Paper re-use and recycling habits are also cultivated through initiatives such as our in-house 

reminders posted near the photocopy machines. 

All waste paper from our own offices is collected for recycling. Further, we encourage all employees 

to adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with an aim to further reduce paper 

consumption. 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our paper 

consumption index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over time. To this end, we have set 

a target for a paper consumption improvement of 10% from our 2017 level by 2030. Our target for 

paper consumption improvement is 0.8% per year. Although various business lines and operations 

account for different percentage of paper consumption across the organization, they all support this 

target and have aligned our environmental objectives accordingly.  

In FY2017, we consumed total of 5,275 kg of paper, 100% of which are either Forest Stewardship 

Council (FSC) certified or made from KHAN-NA. Our paper consumption index stands at 69.4 

(kg/million SGD) 

FY2017 is our first year of sustainability reporting. FY2017 will be used as reference against which the 

performance will be measured in subsequent years.  

5.1.4 

Promoting Green Practices  

We have embraced various green practices in our business and operation such as ISO 14001. 

The ISO 14000 family of standards provides practical tools for companies and organizations of all kinds 

looking to manage their environmental responsibilities. ISO 14001 sets out the criteria for an 

environmental management system and can be certified to. It maps out a framework that a company 


 

 

 

Metal Component Engineering Limited  

Sustainability Report  



Page 15 of 31 





Sustainability Report  





Page 15 of 31 

or organization can follow to set up an effective environmental management system. It can be used 

by any organization regardless of its activity or sector. Using ISO 14001 provides assurance to our 

management and employees as well as external stakeholders that environmental impact is being 

measured and improved.

5.2 Caring for Our Employees 

5.2.1 

Our Approach 

Our people are our most valuable resource and investing in their professional and development is vital 

to our business sustainability. Our goal is to establish work ethics among our employees, which are in 

line with our core values and code of conduct. They are the foundation upon which we build all our 

business initiatives and conduct our day-to-day activities.   

We recognise that a motivated workforce will convey a positive and powerful message to all our key 

stakeholders, such as our customers, suppliers and the members of the community. By attracting, 

nurturing, empowering and rewarding our employees, we create an environment conducive for 

innovation and inspiration flourish to further boost our competitiveness. Such commitment to our 

employees promotes a corporate culture of passion, quality, excellence and trust within the 

organization which reflect in our ability to create values to our stakeholders. 

Our human resource (“HR”) management principles and policies have been developed and established 

based on fair employment practices with the goal of attracting, developing and retaining a robust 

motivated workforce. Our HR policies cover key areas such as remuneration, benefits, staff selection, 

career development and training. Such policies are communicated to all employees through our 

comprehensive Employee Handbook which is regularly reviewed by our management and we 

constantly seek feedback from our staff to ensure that our decisions are aligned as much as possible 

with their needs. 

Our business operates in an environment which comprises diverse races, cultures and geographic 

locations. With this in mind, our HR polices are implemented across the organization within the 

principles with pragmatism, taking into consideration of the prevailing laws and regulations as well as 

local culture, norms and racial sensitivity. 

5.2.2 

Employment Practices 

Our employment practices focus on maximizing the strength of our employees by providing equal 

opportunities based on merits, and help our employees to develop strength through our 

comprehensive training and development programme. We regularly review the competency gap and 

development of our employees to effectively match their strength to their job specifications. Our 

performance based reward scheme provides guidance and motivation to our employees to perform 

to their potentials in alignment with the objectives of the Company.  

5.2.2.1 

The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices  

We proactively pursue and adopt best practices in HR management. Our HR practices are guided by 

the Singapore Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. The Singapore 

Tripartite Alliance comprises the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore National Employers Federation and 

National Trades Union Congress. The Tripartite Alliance has formulated guidelines on fair employment 

practice for adoption by Singapore employers, embracing the recruitment, training, treatment and 

reward of employees.  

5.2.2.2 

Communications  

As our Company grows, effective communications across the organization are crucial to ensure 

continuous alignment of objectives of the employees and the organizational objectives. We achieve 

this through our various communication sessions customized based on the target employees. 

Communication sessions for our managers are held on a regular basis. Agendas covered at these 

sessions are customized in appropriate to the target functional scope of the managers. For example, 


 

 

 

Metal Component Engineering Limited  

Sustainability Report  



Page 17 of 31 





Sustainability Report  





Page 17 of 31 

in monthly managers’ meeting, operational agendas such as leadership and operation issues may be 

discussed while at the quarterly sessions, high level topics include strategic business directions, new 

service launches, ongoing developments and key project reviews.  

5.2.2.3 

Employee feedback  

We value our employees’ expertise in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their feedbacks are 

important in the improvement of overall management and operation of the organization. Through 

various established processes of employee engagement, such as employee objective setting, 

performance review as well as exit interview in case of resignations, we gather such valuable 

feedbacks for the continuous improvement of our organization. 

In addition, there are other feedback channels for areas specific to business and function, such as 

whistle-blowing policy on control and compliance issues. Such feedbacks are managed by the leaders 

and managers of their specific business and function domain. We have also established reporting and 

escalation channel should the feedback requires the attention of higher management. 

5.2.2.4 

Career Development and Training 

We recognise that consistent and ongoing education is critical to maintaining a competitive, skilled, 

productive and motivated workforce. Employee career development and performance management 

are established based on merits and contributing skill sets towards the organization objectives 

through objective settings and regular performance reviews. We continue to review and improve our 

people development and learning process in light of the changing business and operation environment. 

Our training programme covers a variety of areas catering for employees with different job scopes 

and skills set requirements. Our core training curriculum and contents are developed and guided by 

well-established industry and international standards such as ISO 9100, ISO 14000 and IATF 16949. In 

addition, specific training curriculums are developed based on the specific requirements of the specific 

businesses and functions. Training topics range from soft skills development in areas such as 

communication and leadership, to technical programmes covering project management and office 

productivity tools.  

In FY2017, each employee received an average of 3 hours of training. We recognized that the training 

requirements vary depending on the levels of management responsibilities. Each senior manager 

registered an average of 1 hour of training while managerial and non-managerial staffs received an 

average of 10 hours and 5 hours of training respectively. In light of the changing business requirements 

and opportunities in variety of training methodologies, we continue to revise our training curriculum 

and programme to align with the organization objectives and to strive for effectiveness and efficiency 

in our training approach.

come from a diverse workforce embracing employees from various ethnic groups, religion, age and 

gender.  

In FY2017, 247 of our employees were female, comprising (33%) of our workforce, while 494 (67%) 

employees were male. In terms of management function, 14 females (2%) held managerial positions 

compared to 30 males (4%), while 233 females (31%) and 464 males (63%) held non-managerial 

positions. The male to female ratio managerial and non-managerial positions were 20:14 and 464:233, 

respectively. From age profile perspective, there were 332 employees below 30 years old. The number 

of employees between 30 and 50 years old was 371, and 38 employees were above 50 years old. All 

members of our senior management team, including general managers, directors and unit heads, are 

Singaporeans and Malaysian.

In FY2017, we hired a total of 127 new employees, while 791 employees resigned or were retrenched  

during the same period. As a result, we have a net decrease of 664 in our workforce. Out of the new 

hires, 51% of the new hires were below the age of 30, 44% were between 30 and 50 years old while 

5% were above 50 years old. The gender ratio of new hires was 92 males to 35 females. For the 

employees who resigned or were retrenched, 62% were below the age of 30, 36% were between 30 

and 50 years old while 2% were above 50 years old. The gender ratio of employees who resigned or 

were retrenched was 576 males to 215 females. 

 

In addition to the human resources we managed under our payroll internally, we also engage external 

contracted companies as our outsourced vendors which provide outsourced personnel, such as 

cleaners and security guards who might work within our premises. Although we supervise these 










 

 

 

Metal Component Engineering Limited

Sustainability Report  





Page 21 of 31 

people, they are employed by the contracted companies and are not included in our head count. We 

do not employ other types of un-contracted workers. 

We expect that all the contracted companies we work with will share our core principles of HR 

management practices. In our vendor selection process, we take into consideration of their HR 

management practices as one of the key selections and performance criteria. We regularly review the 

performance of our vendors based on these criteria as a key basis to determine whether to continue 

to engage the services of such vendors. 

5.2.4 

Employee Benefits 

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered by the Employment Act, which provides basic 

employment terms and working conditions including contract requirements, remuneration, hours of 

work, overtime, rest days and annual leave entitlement.  

In addition to the statutory benefits outlined in the Employment Act, we provide beyond-compliance-

level benefits to our fulltime employees. Examples of these benefits include vacation, marriage and 

compassionate leaves. 

5.2.4.1 

Work–Life Balance  

While developing the talents of our employees and providing equal opportunities for them to excel 

are the key drivers for our company, we also recognize that the well-being and contentment of our 

employees are pivotal to the success and sustainability of our business and performance. Our 

employees are our most valuable asset, and we appreciate that their overall well-beings need to be 

well looked after in order for them to sustain their performance and realize their full potential.  

To support our employees to strike a work-life balance, we aim to create an environment that allows 

our employees to achieve harmony in their personal and professional life. We intend to adopt a 

flexible approach to work arrangements and offering programmes to support health and wellness.  

We understand that workplace could be at times stressful due to the competitiveness of our workforce 

and our business. To support our employees in their effort of pursuing excellence, we will launch 

various programmes and initiatives to balance their work with fun, and to develop an environment 

and culture of mutual support. 

5.2.4.2 

Retirement and Healthcare  

Our Company has presence in various geographic locations where there are various local laws and 

regulations on pension and healthcare for employees. Our HR management practices comply with 

such laws and regulations. In Singapore, we participate in the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) personal 

savings scheme, which helps employees to fund their retirement, home ownership, healthcare and 

education. Under this scheme, monthly deductions from the employees’ gross salaries are paid into 

their CPF savings accounts. The Company make employer contributions to these accounts, according 

to the rates stipulated in the CPF Act. In addition to CPF contributions, we provide comprehensive 

medical coverage for all employees. For more information on the CPF scheme and the contribution 

rates, please go to www.cpf.gov.sg.  

5.2.5 

Safety and Health in the Workplace 

We are committed to workplace safety and health and take every precaution to prevent occupational 

injuries among employees. We believe that optimum work conditions not only make our employees 

safer, but also boost morale.

5.2.6 

Individual Rights  

Respecting and protecting basic human rights is fundamental to all our operations and deeply 

ingrained in our Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees. Labour rights, the prohibition of 

discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, prohibition of forced and child labour, and 

workplace health and safety are all strictly observed within the work environment and discrimination 

and harassment of any kind is not tolerated at our Company.  

We also respect our employees’ rights to freedom of association as well as their membership of trade 

unions and other professional bodies.  

In FY2017, 0% of our workforce was covered by a collective bargaining agreement; no incidents of 

forced labour, child labour or young workers were identified across the organisation, and no human 

rights-related grievances have been reported. 

 

5.2.7 

Data Safety and Privacy  

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of great priority to us. We have processes and 

controls in place for handling and communicating sensitive and confidential information of our 

customers such as contracts, customer orders and product delivery orders. Our information security

5.3 Partnering Our Suppliers 

5.3.1 

Our Approach 

As part of our ambition to realize sustainability throughout our value chain, we extend the application 

of responsible business practices to our local partners and suppliers. We recognise that we are only at 

the beginning of our journey to integrate sustainable business practice throughout our supply chain, 

and we commit in our pragmatic approach to continuous improvement. We aim to identify new 

opportunities for collaboration with our suppliers, gradually increase transparency and continue to 

build shared capacity to minimise our indirect environmental and social impacts. 

5.3.2 

Supplier Selection 

Our key suppliers are carefully selected through our supplier selection process. When selecting our 

key suppliers, we examine criteria such as financial health, quality of products and services, 

competiveness of pricing. In addition, we also take into consideration of the overall sustainability 

policies adopted by our suppliers. Our final decision on supplier selection is based on the overall 

assessment which takes a balanced view across all selection criteria. 

5.3.3 

Supplier Review  

We regularly review the performance of our key suppliers to determine whether to extend our 

partnership with them. During the key supplier review process, we engage with our key suppliers to 

communicate our expectations and mutual feedbacks. Such review process ensures alignment of our 

key suppliers’ services and products to our business requirements and sustainability objectives 

through pragmatic and continuous improvement in our partnership with our key suppliers.

5.4 Supporting for Our Community 

5.4.1 

Our Approach 

We will be providing support to the communities. The key motivation driving all our community 

engagement initiatives is to enable and empower young people. By supporting young people today 

and helping to educate them about the world they are to inherit, our goal is to benefit not only the 

current generation, but also the next.  

We also recognize that meeting the needs of today’s youth goes beyond their own education, security 

and well-being, extending to that of their families, homes and neighbourhoods as well. To this end, 

our engagement programmes also encompass financial and practical support in carefully selected 

communities, through fundraising and voluntary activities.  

Our community initiatives are selected according to how closely they are aligned with our own 

community engagement goals of “enabling and empowering young people”, the anticipated staff 

participation rate, and the tangible impact on the beneficiary. Separately, we will also engage on other 

community initiatives on an ad hoc basis. All our business units and some of our channel partners are 

involved in our community engagement programmes.  

The culture and spirit of giving back to our society are ingrained into our business visions, and reflected 

our commitments under our various brands.

6 PERFORMANCE TABLE 

6.1 Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions  

Direct and indirect CO2 emissions in GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2) and kilowatt hours 

(kWh), from electricity and fuel consumed. The electricity and fuel we purchase are both from non-

renewable sources. 

Our business and function grow over time, and the GHG emissions and electricity consumption vary. 

To ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity consumption measures 

over time, we create a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index for our performance 

monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the size of our 

activities. We normalize the amount of GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of 

our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is measured 

in t-CO2 per SGD million and the electricity consumption index is measured in kWh per SGD million.

6.2 Paper Consumption 

We capture the data for paper consumption by how many reams of paper used where one ream is 

equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across various paper sizes, 

such as A3 and A4 papers, we measures the paper consumption by the weight of paper used which is 

adjusted for the various sizes and quality of papers. 

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We devise a 

paper consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper consumption 

for the size of our activities. We normalize the amount of weights of paper consumed by the amount 

of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The paper consumption index is 

measured in kilograms per SGD million.
