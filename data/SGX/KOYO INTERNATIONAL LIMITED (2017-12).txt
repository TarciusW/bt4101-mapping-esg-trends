ORGANISATIONAL PROFILE 

 

Koyo International Limited (the “Company”) was listed on the SGX Catalist in 2009. 

Currently, the principal activities of the Koyo and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Koyo 

Group” or the “Group”) can be broadly categorised into four core business segments. 

These include the 1) provision of mechanical and electrical (M&amp;E) engineering services; 

2) the supply of renewable energy products for building services; 3) property 

development and construction; and 4) the supply of construction materials and ancillary 

services related to it. 

 

ABOUT THIS REPORT 

 

This report is guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 reporting guidelines, at 

core level. Corresponding to G4’s emphasis on materiality, the report highlights the key 

environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) related factors identified for the financial 

year ended 31 December 2017 (“FY2017”) and the initiatives during the period. For 

FY2017, the report is focused on the Group’s M&amp;E engineering services as other activities 

were not significant in FY2017, but we intend to expand our scope of this report to include 

the Group’s other businesses in the future. This is the Group’s inaugural report and in line 

with the Group’s continued commitment to address issues relating to sustainability across 

the various ESG-related factors. we hope to share more in our subsequent reports. 

 

Given that this is our inaugural report, we do not have sufficient performance data to 

form a trend for the purpose of setting targets. Accordingly, the process of target setting 

is deferred till a time when adequate data is available to set reasonable targets. 

 

BOARD’S STATEMENT 

 

Recognising the importance of sustainability, the Board of Directors (“Board”) leads the 

sustainability efforts at Company. The Board has considered sustainability issues, 

determined the material ESG factors and overseen the management and monitoring of 

these factors.

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with regards to our sustainability efforts as 

this enables us to improve our policies, systems and results. Please send your comments

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

 

An important starting point in our sustainability journey is to identify our stakeholders and 

material aspects relevant to our business. The interests and requirements of key 

stakeholders are also taken into account when formulating corporate strategies. These 

key stakeholders include, but are not limited to employees, suppliers &amp; service providers, 

investors &amp; shareholders, customers, and regulators. 

 

We adopt both formal and informal channels of communication to understand the 

needs of key stakeholders, and incorporate these into our corporate strategies to 

achieve mutually beneficial relationships. The following sets out our engagement

MATERIAL ASPECTS ASSESSMENT 

 

We made a materiality assessment during the year. Going forward, materiality review will 

be conducted annually, incorporating inputs from the stakeholder engagements. 

 

To determine if an aspect is material, we assessed its potential impact on the 

economy, environment and society and the influence on the stakeholders and 

the Company. Aspects were identified and prioritised through senior 

management evaluations. Applying the guidance from GRI, we have identified 

the following material aspects: 

 

 

 

MATERIAL ASPECTS

aim to maximise returns for long-term profitability, thereby creating sustainable 

shareholder value.  The Group’s basic principle is that long-term profitability and

ENVIRONMENT 

 

At Koyo, we strive to carry out our business operations in a socially responsible 

manner and are committed towards protecting the environment.  

 

GREENMARK PROJECTS 

 

As an M&amp;E engineering services provider, the Group implements BCA Green Mark 

projects and we are committed to working with our valued business partners to 

construct high quality and energy efficient developments for the community. The 

BCA Green Mark scheme promotes greater energy efficiency, water efficiency, 

environment protection, indoor environmental quality and other green/ 

innovative features in infrastructure and building interiors. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECT AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT 

 

Our two main subsidiaries namely, Koyo Engineering (S.E. Asia) Pte Ltd and Koyo 

M&amp;E Pte Ltd are ISO 14001:2015 certified. The ISO 14001:2015 Environmental 

Management System provides for a framework that our subsidiaries can follow to 

manage environmental aspects, fulfil environmental compliance obligations and 

address environmental risks and opportunities. As such, we carry out 

environmental aspect and impact assessments for our work.   

 

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

 

The Group adopts the Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (3Rs) methodology to manage our 

waste. We believe that by practising the 3Rs, we can help to protect the environment 

and conserve limited resources. The Group believes that every small effort counts and 


8 

 

goes a long way in contributing to the conservation and protection of the earth’s natural 

resources. 

 

Our waste management efforts are focused mainly on paper. We are constantly working 

to reduce waste from our operations, as well as finding efficient ways to recycle. 

Measures were communicated to all the new and existing employees through induction 

and informal meetings to reduce, reuse or recycle whenever possible.  

 

REDUCE 

REUSE 

RECYCLE 

Employees are educated to 

print double-sided documents. 

Employees are encouraged to 

reuse paper for note taking 

during meetings. 

Waste cardboard and paper 

are sent for recycling. 

Paperless work flow system is 

being considered to store 

documents electronically. 

Employees are also 

encouraged to use waste 

paper as draft paper. 

 

 

Employees are encouraged not 

to print documents for 

discussion purposes and 

display them on screens 

instead. 

 

 

SOCIAL 

 

DIVERSITY AND FAIR EMPLOYMENT 

 

We embrace diversity, and at the same time expect employees to be aligned with 

Group’s vision and strategic initiatives of enhancing overall business performance and to 

deliver sustainable growth. The age of our staff ranges from 20s to 70s. The ratio of male 

to female staff is approximately 3:1. The higher ratio of male to female employees is not 

uncommon in construction industry due to the nature of the work. Our staff consists of 

people coming from different nationalities and academic qualifications. We strive for fair 

treatment of all our employees, regardless of nationalities, age, gender and educational 

levels.

We put the SAFETY of everyone above all in whatever we do. This has since become the 

overriding principle that guides us in our work. We also believe that safety is everyone’s 

responsibility and we are committed to building a strong and positive safety oriented 

culture in our workplace to promote safety and create a safe working environment for

Our Health and Safety Policy is one key way in which we implement the safety principle 


11 

 

in our work.  We will continuously strive to improve the way we carry out our work safely 

together with our business partners to achieve our goal of zero incident. 

 

We achieve our goal by managing risk at work, equipping our work crew with competent 

skills, providing SHE training and conducting campaigns to raise safety awareness at 

work. 

 

SAFETY TRAINING 

 

We strongly believe that to equip our workforce with competent skill and knowledge to 

carry out the work safely is one of the cornerstones of success for the Group. Selected 

staff are trained on risk management to build on their fundamentals of hazard 

identification and risk assessment at the workplace.  

 

SAFETY CAMPAIGN 

 

From time to time, we hold safety campaigns at our various work sites to heighten 

awareness on Health and Safety matters and promote positive behaviour amongst the 

work crew. An effective campaign may help to eliminate any doubts that the work crew 

might have, boost the morale of the workforce, reduces costly mistakes and prevent 

injury. 

 

MANAGING RISKS 

 

We manage risk at work through preparing risk assessment for every job, communicate 

hazards and risks at pre-task discussions (i.e. tool box meetings), intervene unsafe 

observations, carry out safety inspections and conduct management walkabouts to 

support and ensure safety compliance.
