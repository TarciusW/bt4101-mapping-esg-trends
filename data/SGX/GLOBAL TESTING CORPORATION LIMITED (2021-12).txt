Dear Esteemed Stakeholders, 

We, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of GTCL, are pleased to present our sustainability report for 

FY2021, which will be published through SGXNet.

business strategy. Embedding the sustainability approach in our business operation aims to reduce the 

negative impacts to both environmental and social aspects. We are fully committed to driving changes 

to advance our sustainable journey with the objective of developing sustainable business for the future. 

Identifying and engaging with our group of stakeholders is one of our approaches to understanding 

and gauging feedback on how our business operation might have an impact and on which areas we 

can improve further in our sustainability journey. We build lasting relationships with our stakeholders 

by initiating regular dialogues. 

GTCL will continually improve its sustainability performance as we recognise the impact of

commitment from the top. GTCL’s dedication to customer satisfaction, environmental, health and 

safety management, as well as fostering safe working conditions for employees to thrive in are evident 

as we continue to align goals towards that direction.

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT 

 

OUR APPROACH  

GTCL is committed to ensuring the protection of the environment, as well as occupational health and 

safety (“OHS”) of all our employees. Our Environmental, Safety and Health (“ESH”) Policy is in place 

complying with relevant laws and regulations at where we operate. Our ESH management systems are 

certified with various international standards namely ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety 

Management Systems, OHSAS 18001:2007 Occupational Health and Safety, and ISO 14001:2015 

Environmetnal Management Systems. We also gained a Green Partner Certification issued by one of 

our core customers – Sony.  GTCL’s management approach in OHS matters illustrated as below: 

 

Figure 7: GTCL's Management Approach to Occupational Health and Safety 

At working level, complementing our EHS management system is an Excellent Health Care Plan with 

annual free yearly health check-ups and consultations arranged for employees. Our employees are 

also covered by Labor insurance, national health insurance, and free group insurance. Our Human 

Resources Department, together with Industrial Safety Health Team, have also arranged internal and 

external training based on an annual training plan for all employees to understand relevant workplace 

hazards. New hires are mandate to attend OHS training and programme. Along with, safety reminders 

are issued to remind employees about the potential risks and protection measures in place. We also 

arrange regular fire alarm tests, fire and earthquake safety drills along with response plan. 

When an incident occurs, employees should report to the OHS officer and supervisor to investigate its 

root cause, followed by drafting corrective action plans to prevent its reoccurance. In-house nurses 

are also stationed on-site to serve as an emergency medical respondent and liaise with medical 

facilities when accident happens. 

To ensure our business's long-term success, OHS-related policies, guidelines and practices are 

reviewed regulary in accordance with the international standards and environmental management 

systems requirements. With our continuous efforts, no warnings and penalties were issued by the 

government to the Group in FY2021.

FY2021 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY PERFORMANCE 

It is imperative to the Group that we actively track and improve efficiency and safety standards in the 

workplace. In 2021, there were no fatalities due to work-related injuries and no high-consequences 

work-related injury. However, there was an increase in recordable work-related injuries due to car 

accidents during travelling to or from the company. As part of its action plan to mitigate the hazards 

that have caused to high-consequence injuries, GTCL has taken propaganda and conduct half-year 

EHS event during the reporting year. 

Moving along, GTCL will continue to go beyond compliance, through collaborating with external parties 

to implement our prevention plan in eliminating work-related hazards, as well as heighten awareness 

among employees about OHS.
