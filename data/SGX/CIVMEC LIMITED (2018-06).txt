ABOUT THIS 

REPORT

The purpose of this report is to enable 

key stakeholders to understand Civmec’s 

sustainability approach, actions, performance 

and key material issues for the financial year 

ended 30 June 2018 (FY18). This report was 

approved by the Civmec Board of Directors 

(the ‘Board’) on 31 May 2019. 

Civmec Limited (Company Registration 

Number 201011837H) is the ultimate holding 

company of the Civmec group of companies.  

In this report, unless otherwise stated, 

Scope

references to ‘Civmec’, the ‘company’  

and the ‘group’ refer to Civmec Limited 

and its controlled entities. The information 

in this report covers all operational activities 

undertaken by Civmec. Our share of operations 

from joint venture projects is reported on a 

proportionately consolidated basis, unless 

otherwise stated.

Civmec’s Sustainability Report 2018 links our 

sustainability principles to our mission, vision 

and values. The report has been prepared in 

accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards 

2016 core-level reporting, which focuses on 

identifying and reporting on topics that are 

material to our business and key stakeholders, 

in relation to environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) performance.

The GRI Standards create a common language 

for organisations and stakeholders, with which 

the economic, environmental, and social 

impacts of organisations can be communicated 

and understood. The Standards are designed 

to enhance the global comparability and 

quality of information on these impacts, 

thereby enabling greater transparency and 

accountability of organisations.1

Reporting Approach

This document represents Civmec’s inaugural 

Sustainability Report. Going forward, we 

will continue to report our sustainability 

performance annually. To support this 

commitment, we will evolve and refine how 

we collect information to ensure quality data 

and insights are available in order to drive 

improvement in our sustainability performance. 

This process will include undertaking an internal 

audit of this report and the reporting process.

For ease of reference, a GRI Standard Content 

Index is located on page 47 of this report.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  2018  I  MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD

MESSAGE FROM 

THE BOARD

Central to Civmec’s approach to sustainability is 

its Never Assume philosophy, which underpins 

the company’s culture and drives behaviour, 

attitudes, decisions and actions.

The sustainability of our business is intrinsically 

linked to the successful management of 

our environmental, social and governance 

(ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. 

Proactively identifying and understanding the 

current material risks faced by the business 

and adopting sustainable practices to 

mitigate these, and capitalising on identified 

opportunities, will further strengthen Civmec’s 

position in the market and generate better long-

term outcomes for all stakeholders. 

This report outlines Civmec’s management 

approach and performance across the key 

material risk areas identified, as a fundamental 

component of future strategy to drive 

sustainable growth. As part of its strategic 

formulation, the Board has carefully considered 

the material ESG factors that present the 

greatest risk and opportunity to the business 

and oversees the management and monitoring 

of these factors.

Ultimately, Civmec’s sustainability agenda  

is focused on: 

• continuing to operate with integrity;

•  actively contributing to the success and 

welfare of our people and the communities 

in which we operate;

•  ensuring our operations have minimal 

environmental impact, and

• achieving our people, health, safety,  

 

environment, and financial targets.

Overwhelmingly, the company’s success  

relies on its ability to foster positive, meaningful 

and productive relationships with its key 

stakeholders, including employees, clients  

and partners, all of which play an integral role  

in our future success.

Yours sincerely 

The Board 

Civmec Limited

The primary role of the Board is to deliver mutually beneficial 

outcomes to all stakeholders and to ensure that the company 

is managed in accordance with best international corporate 

governance practices, meeting all obligations of the Singapore 

Exchange (SGX) and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).

MARINE &amp; DEFENCE

Our substantial investment in the construction 

of a state-of-the-art shipbuilding and 

maintenance facility in Henderson, designed 

to be one of the most efficient and innovative 

in the world, will deliver a new world-class 

resource to the Australian maritime landscape 

and significantly enhance the capability 

available at the Australian Marine Complex in 

Western Australia. The 53,000sqm (usable 

floor area), 18-storey high, purpose-built facility 

will be the largest undercover modularisation 

and maintenance facility in Australia. It will 

be large enough to house complete Air 

Warfare Destroyers or Frigates and OPVs, 

for construction or maintenance, as well as 

large integrated modules for the Oil &amp; Gas and 

Metals &amp; Minerals sectors. We commenced 

construction in April 2017, with completion 

expected by the end of 2019.

Civmec has partnered with Luerssen to  

form a new company, Australian Maritime 

Shipbuilding and Export Group (AMSEG).  

It combines our specialist steel manufacturing 

capability and infrastructure with the 

shipbuilding and design expertise of Luerssen, 

to develop a new world-class sovereign 

shipbuilding capability for Australia. The new 

company is chaired by former Chief of the 

Royal Australian Navy and former Chairman  

of major shipbuilder ASC Shipbuilding,  

Vice Admiral (retired) Chris Ritchie.

Our Operating Sectors

Award of the Royal Australian Navy’s Offshore  

Patrol Vessel (OPV) program, in contract with 

Luerssen Australia, will enable us to unlock the 

value of local steel shipbuilding, investing in skills 

and transfer of knowledge with local subcontractors 

and suppliers to support the establishment of a 

competitive Australian shipbuilding industry and 

supply chain that can eventually export to the  

global market.

STAKEHOLDER 

ENGAGEMENT &amp; 

MATERIALITY 

The material issues addressed in this  

report reflect the priorities identified by  

our key stakeholders. 

A materiality assessment was undertaken 

consistent with Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI) Standards requirements and included 

an extensive consultation process with key 

stakeholders via group workshops, written 

surveys and face-to-face meetings.

In agreeing the material environmental, social 

and governance (ESG) factors selected, 

their relevance to the business, including our 

strategy, business model and key stakeholders, 

was considered.

In 2015, the United Nations agreed on 17 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

as part of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development. The interrelated SDGs are 

a blueprint to achieve a better and more 

sustainable future for everyone across the 

planet. They address the global challenges 

we face, including those related to poverty, 

inequality, climate, environmental degradation, 

prosperity, and peace and justice. As a 

supporter of the SDGs Civmec understands it 

can positively contribute towards these goals 

through its own sustainable business practices.

OUR PEOPLE

Our people underpin our success. Offering 

sustainable career pathways is critical in enabling  

us to retain and grow capability across our 

specialised disciplines. 

Our focus is on developing and enhancing employee skills and capability, fostering the organic 

growth of talent across the business, right up to the senior management level. Continuing to 

build expertise in our key areas of operation and diversifying into new markets provides ongoing 

opportunities to attract and retain the best available talent. The retention of talent is a key identified 

risk, particularly given the sometimes cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate.

Data included in this section has been captured 

through the COINS payroll and HR system. 

Early in 2018, the decision was made to 

implement new recruitment/human resources 

software, Success Factors, in order to facilitate 

a streamlined approach. Success Factors went 

live in June 2018, with the system providing an 

interface that simplifies processes and reduces 

administrative and manual paperwork, enabling 

improved efficiency in people management. 

The benefits derived from this new system will 

flow through during FY19 and beyond, as we 

continue to evolve and refine its function and 

capability to meet the specific demands of  

our business.

chain. This includes in regional areas where our 

projects are delivered, with local employment 

providing direct economic benefits to these 

regional communities.  

Civmec had 2,551 employees located across 

Australia at financial year end 2018. Temporary 

personnel are not included in this statistic.  

Our drive towards success in project delivery can 

only be achieved through high productivity; the 

ability to deliver to exacting quality standards; 

strong leadership and innovative management; 

and a highly proficient, multi-skilled workforce. 

Multi-skilling our workforce provides a significant 

competitive advantage, with employees 

adaptable and able to be mobile across jobs, 

sites and locations.  

The attraction and retention of skilled employees is a critical focus, and also an identified risk, for 

our business. The tables below illustrate new employee hires and employee turnover during FY18, 

by age group and gender. The statistical pattern illustrated is typical of our industry, where cyclical/

short-term project contracts are awarded, and therefore these numbers represent the on-hire/off-

hire process.

Our core value of Collaboration means we work in partnership with our people to identify their 

individual training and development needs. We recognise the importance of continually investing 

in the training and development of our people, providing progressive career pathways, as a 

fundamental component of our retention strategy.

Registered Training Organisation

We have invested in facilities and training 

programmes and are a recognised Registered 

Training Organisation (RTO code 52645).  

Our RTO is registered nationally with the 

Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) and 

delivers skills and competency-based training 

in every state across Australia. At financial year 

end 2018, 4,471 enrolments were processed 

for training courses delivered by the Civmec 

RTO. The role of the RTO is to create a skilled 

and diverse workforce that drives our high-

performance culture and supports the growth 

and retention of our people. 

The RTO currently offers 29 units of 

competency, specialising in high risk training 

including crane operations, rigging, scaffolding, 

forklift and elevated work platform operations. 

It has expertise in mobile plant operations such 

as excavator, backhoe and roller operations, 

and offers specialised training for tilt up panel 

works. It has also developed a program of 

management training for supervisors that 

covers leadership, team management, project 

management and health and safety.

We partner with local high schools to provide 

outreach programs to mentor high school 

students to take science and engineering 

pathways, and to further support this we are  

an industry partner in the P-TECH and Subs  

in School programs.

Civmec was recognised in 2016 for its 

investment in training and workforce 

development, winning the Western Australian 

Employer of the Year category of the WA State 

Training Awards.

Isiah’s Story

I have been employed by Civmec 

since January 2016 as an electrical 

apprentice. I’m currently two years into my 

apprenticeship and have been involved 

in projects that have given me the 

opportunity to work FIFO, including on  

the Gruyere Gold project in the Goldfields.

I have learned a variety of skills and 

knowledge during my apprenticeship, 

including cable pulls, cable dressing, 

electrical equipment, reading various 

drawings, cable terminations and  

much more.

Along the way I have met great work 

colleagues and supervisors that have  

been easily approachable with any 

questions I’ve asked to help further my 

understanding. I have two years left in  

my apprenticeship and cannot wait to see 

the future opportunities Civmec has to  

offer me.

Apprentices &amp; Trainees (continued)

We also offer a comprehensive traineeship 

program that provides trainees with insight 

across all operational aspects of our business. 

Trainees are guided and mentored by our 

highly experienced team of technical and 

management specialists, making Civmec 

traineeships an excellent way to start a career.

Traineeship qualifications offered include:

• 

Human Resources

• 

Business Administration

• 

Logistics / Warehousing

• 

Non-certified construction skills such as 

concreting and steel-fixing

Civmec apprenticeships and traineeships are 

recognised nationally and are highly regarded 

in the industry. We encourage applications from 

people with diverse backgrounds including 

women, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait 

Islanders.

Civmec supports the Southern Perth  

P-TECH pilot program with Cecil Andrews 

College, Seville Grove. A P-TECH styled 

learning program involves an introductory 

phase to enable young people to connect and 

engage with the school’s industry partners and 

build the foundation skills students will need to 

succeed in the increasingly rigorous latter years 

of their study. Following the introductory phase, 

and with support from an industry mentor 

and the school’s industry partners, secondary 

students undertake more formal STEM 

training as part of a nationally recognised VET 

qualification. These certificates put students 

on a pathway to post-school studies that will 

further strengthen their prospects  

for employment.

As a Year 12 Cert III Engineering – 

Technical student at Cecil Andrews 

College, Kayla Roemer-Hanisch undertook 

work experience with Civmec in 2018,  

as part of the P-TECH program. 

With the award of the contract to build 

Offshore Patrol Vessels for the Royal 

Australian Navy, Civmec has partnered 

with Luerssen Australia and ASC to 

launch the Shipbuilding Education 

and Apprenticeship (SEA) program, 

which will help build the skills needed 

for Australia’s multibillion-dollar naval 

shipbuilding industry. Having enjoyed 

her work experience with Civmec, Kayla 

successfully applied for one of ten 

inaugural scholarships under the SEA 

program. She was also chosen as one of 

three to be involved in an internship under 

the program, with Civmec selecting her  

as their intern. 

As a student who in Year 10 thought 

she would go into primary school 

teaching, Kayla has been shown a world 

of opportunity in the Defence industry 

through her experience with Civmec and 

she will no doubt make a fantastic Design 

Engineer one day.

Performance &amp; Career Development

In addition to encouraging regular, informal, performance discussions between employees  

and their managers, a formal Performance and Career Appraisal process in undertaken annually 

at the beginning of each year. This process requires employees to review their previous year’s 

performance, meet with their manager to discuss this assessment, and set goals and targets for 

the coming 12 months. Learning, development and career opportunities are identified through this 

process and monitored and progressed throughout the year. 

Through the process, a number of employees were identified and encouraged to expand their 

current skillset to support the further development of our shipbuilding capacity and capability, with 

the delivery of the Offshore Patrol Vessel program for the Royal Australian Navy.

Brendan’s Story

I joined Civmec in June 2016 as a 

Graduate Engineer to work in the 

remeasure department. I immediately 

felt part of the team and received a lot of 

support from management and staff. I also 

worked closely with Civmec’s proposals 

department and learned to estimate 

tenders of a structural and piping nature.

In January 2017, I was part of the  

Civmec and Luerssen team that 

successfully bid for the construction of 

12 OPVs as part of the Royal Australian 

Navy’s SEA 1180 project.

In May 2018, I was given the opportunity  

to further develop my career by moving  

to the OPV project as a Project Engineer.  

Here I have been able to contribute to 

creating new procedures and processes 

to ensure the OPV project is delivered 

effectively. I feel proud to be part of the 

team helping to build Civmec’s  

capabilities in the shipbuilding sector  

and I look forward to continuing to grow 

with the company in this new and  

exciting chapter.

David’s Story

I joined Civmec in February 2011 as a 

Boilermaker. Through the performance 

and development process, I was able 

to articulate my career aspirations 

and longer-term goals, which lead 

to the opportunity to move into the 

management side of the business, with  

a role as Junior Project Engineer. 

For the next few years I learnt many 

aspects of Civmec’s business, from 

fabrication through to mechanical 

assembly, being involved in a number 

of successful projects including the Rio 

Tinto Cape Lambert Car Dumpers and 

Positioners and TKISA and Sandvik 

Stackers, Reclaimers and Ship Loaders, 

as well as Civmec workshop upgrades 

and installations.

In September 2018, my career with 

Civmec took another exciting turn, 

joining the OPV team as a Senior Project 

Engineer. I am very proud to be part 

of the business’ expansion into the 

shipbuilding sector and it is very exciting 

to come to work every day seeing the 

progress on our new facility. It is a great 

achievement to be part of a project which 

will help protect our great country.

Civmec is committed to driving gender  

diversity in the workplace and facilitating an 

environment that is fair and inclusive for all 

employees. We believe the benefits provided 

by a balanced workforce, including in relation 

to culture and management style, make us a 

more attractive place to work for all employees.

As we continue to strive for a supportive and 

inclusive workplace for all people, we are 

focused on actively capitalising on the diversity 

of skills, talents and perspectives of our people 

to harness an organisation where everyone 

works better together and feels valued and able 

to contribute. 

Across our entire operations, 5% of all 

employees are female. As is typical of 

organisations in our industry, the ability to 

achieve a diverse workforce in the corporate 

environment is much easier than achieving 

this balance in operations and project delivery, 

particularly given our vast self-performance 

capability in traditionally male-dominated 

disciplines. From a head office perspective, 

we have a much higher female participation 

rate, at 42%. Therefore, our focus over the 

past 12 months has been at the grass-roots 

level, encouraging female apprentices to grow 

their career with us. This strategy has been 

successful, with three female apprentices now 

in the business. Going forward, we will continue 

to identify and support suitable candidates to 

join us in trade and operations roles onsite and 

in our manufacturing facilities. Earlier this year, 

a Civmec apprentice, Candace Smith, was 

awarded the ‘Women in Trades’ Scholarship.

Gender Diversity

Candace’s Story 

When I first started my apprenticeship with another employer, I was told so many times 

that women don’t belong in this environment that I eventually gave it up.

However my passion for my trade was stronger than one person’s opinion, and I went on 

to continue my apprenticeship with Civmec and feel really valued here.

Note: Apprentices are not included in the above statistics.

The company is committed to ensuring women and men receive equal pay for equal work 

and this is reinforced within our remuneration principles. A future focus is to ensure we 

undertake an annual review of pay discrepancies by gender. If there are any apparent gaps, 

they will be analysed to ensure that such gaps can be explained with reference to market 

forces which may include, for example, different rates of pay in different industries; location 

and the relative supply and demand for different qualifications; individual performance; 

experience; and capacity of hours able to work.

The company lodges its compliance reports with the Workplace Gender Equality Agency 

(WGEA) annually. A copy of these reports may be obtained via the WGEA website.

Aboriginal Engagement 

In November 2017, we launched our inaugural 

Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP), developed 

in partnership with Reconciliation Australia. 

Endorsement of the RAP represents a 

significant step towards building positive, 

sustainable relationships with Aboriginal and 

Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) people and their 

communities. During the year, 3% of total 

employees were of ATSI heritage.

The RAP identifies practical actions based 

on the three pillars of Relationships, Respect 

and Opportunities. Its intent is to provide 

employment, training and commercial 

partnership opportunities for Aboriginal and 

Torres Strait Islander people, businesses and 

community organisations and to develop 

a better understanding of cross-cultural 

sensitivities to improve relationships across the 

organisation, through participation in events 

including National Reconciliation Week and 

NAIDOC Week.

As a testament to our commitment to the  

RAP, approximately 15% of our current 

apprentices, including two females, are of 

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent. 

Furthermore, we have engaged Aboriginal 

subcontractors during the year on projects in 

Western Australia, including the Pilgangoora 

Lithium project in the Pilbara and the Gruyere 

Gold project in the Goldfields.

Civmec became a member of Supply Nation 

during the year, to further develop our supplier 

diversity footprint and incorporate Aboriginal 

and Torres Strait Islander businesses into 

our supply chain. Supply Nation connects 

Australian buyers with verified Indigenous 

businesses to build a prosperous, vibrant and 

sustainable Indigenous enterprise sector.

OUR COMMUNITY

Our value of Make a Difference empowers our people to positively impact the communities  

in which we live and work. In addition to providing local employment opportunities, Civmec is  

also committed to making a difference through our various partnerships, sponsorships and 

donations. 

Our support during FY18 saw us work with numerous charities and community  

groups, including:

Cancer Council

Sadly, in 2017, we lost one of our own to a 

rare form of cervical cancer. During October, 

we hosted a morning tea fundraiser across 

the company, to donate funds on behalf of 

our employee and her family. We presented a 

cheque for A$10,000 to the Cancer Council 

in support of their mission to work with the 

community to reduce the incidence and  

impact of cancer.

Clean Up Australia Day

In February 2018, teams of Civmec staff 

took to the streets near their facility or site to 

help clean up the nation, as part of Clean Up 

Australia Day. 

2018 PCNT Bluewater Classic

Civmec sponsored several employees from the 

Ichthys CCPP project to participate in the 2018 

Petroleum Club, Northern Territory (PCNT) 

Bluewater Classic in March. The Bluewater 

Classic provides a unique opportunity to enjoy 

some friendly competition among colleagues 

and peers and is a significant community event 

on the Oil &amp; Gas calendar in the Territory.

Morning Tea for a Cause

Our participation in the International Women’s 

Day Morning Tea in March raised funds for 

the Women’s Council for Domestic &amp; Family 

Violence Services and our support of Australia’s 

Biggest Morning Tea in May raised funds for  

the Cancer Council.

CEO Sleepout

In June 2018, our CEO Pat Tallon braved 

the cold to help the homeless, raising over 

A$16,000 as part of the Vinnies CEO  

Sleepout, providing much needed funds for 

those around the nation finding themselves 

without a home. According to St Vincent de 

Paul, the A$16,000 raised is equivalent to 

providing 52 individual support programs,  

138 beds and 553 meals.

Step Up For MSWA 

Continuing our ongoing support of MSWA,  

on a Sunday morning in June, some of our 

people took to one of Perth’s tallest buildings, 

Central Park, to climb the 1,103 steps to the 

building’s peak. The team raised much needed 

funds for Western Australians living with 

neurological conditions.

Variety Club

We continued our support of Variety Club during 

the year, providing funding for their 2018 Variety 

Heart Scholarships, designed to help special 

needs children with unique talent to reach their 

full potential in their chosen field of sport, the 

arts or education.

OUR FUTURE FOCUS 

The enthusiasm of our people in supporting the community is an  

enduring quality we are very proud of. It says a lot about Civmec and the 

company we are. Going forward, we will continue to support our people 

to make a difference in the communities in which we operate. 

Our future focus includes:

•  continuing to grow employee participation in community  

engagement initiatives, by providing them with the vehicles and 

opportunities to contribute (year on year increase); and

•  continuing to maximise relevant opportunities for community 

engagement.

Civmec operates in a number of different 

geographical regions and in differing market 

sectors. This involves dealing with customers, 

competitors, suppliers, and various other 

stakeholders. It is integral to Civmec’s business 

operations that we capture and report on 

Civmec’s significant positive influences at the 

macro socio-economic level in the regions in 

which we operate through to the direct impacts 

of our business activities in the communities 

which surround our operations.

Socio-economic compliance is a precondition 

for successful operations. Known legal 

requirements shall always be met. Legislative 

compliance is critical for Civmec since it 

ensures our business legitimacy.

We also continuously identify the ways in  

which we have responded to issues of 

concern raised through engagement with 

our stakeholders and which influence their 

assessment of the company. These include 

initiatives, both within and outside the 

company, including the continuous review of 

our Code of Conduct, policies and procedures, 

in relation to human rights issues, ethical 

supply chain relations, our contribution to the 

local economies and capacity development at 

community level.

We try at all times to understand and respond 

to our stakeholders’ interests. Doing so helps 

us be a good neighbour, an effective partner 

and a sustainable operator.

Civmec is committed to conducting its 

operations with integrity and in a manner, 

that is consistent with laws and business 

practices that are aimed at fostering an open, 

competitive and fair market environment and 

which will best serve the long-term interests  

of our customers, our stakeholders and the  

wider community.

Civmec impacts a wide range of  

stakeholders in the countries in which it 

operates, both in the local communities  

and wider national economies. 

We engage with communities, employees, 

stakeholders and clients and seek to 

understand the social, cultural, environmental 

and economic implications of our activities 

so that we can respond to concerns, reduce 

negative impacts and optimise benefits for the 

local community and the overall economy.

Civmec has not received any significant fines or major  

non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws 

and/or regulations in the social and economic area within 

Civmec Construction &amp; Engineering during 2018.

As an evolving and diversified business, we strive for best practice health and safety systems, 

sharing learnings and ideas across projects and throughout the organisation. Our company 

operates under a continuous improvement model and an increased focus on HSE and field 

leadership across the business has led to improvements in our risk management approach in a 

dynamic and constantly changing environment. 

FY18 was a busy year for Civmec, having worked just over 5,300,000 hours (including contractors) 

with the majority of hours accumulated in environments of work considered to be of higher risk. 

With consideration to the number of exposure hours, we had a reduction in our total recordable 

injury frequency rate (TRIFR), which was reduced by 26% to 4.91, based on one million hours 

worked. We also noted a slight reduction in our lost time injury frequency rate  

(LTIFR) to 0.38, also based on one million hours worked.  

Over the reporting period for all injuries, the 

most common injured body parts were hand/

fingers which equated to 28% of all injuries, 

followed by leg/hip at 13.7%, arms/shoulders 

at 13%, eye injuries at 12.7% and back injuries 

at 11.5%. 

Our business believes that a strong focus 

on proactive leading indicators such as 

hazard reporting, workplace inspections and 

behavioural safety observations, lead by strong 

field leadership, will have a direct positive 

impact on reducing injury rates and other 

lagging indicators. This is a major focus for 

the business and this approach will assist with 

a continued reduction in recordable injuries 

across the business.  

Whilst we acknowledge the positive progress 

made to date, it is noted that in April 2018,  

we were devastated by the loss of an alliance 

team member through an industrial accident 

at one of our joint venture projects in Western 

Australia. This incident has further reinforced 

our absolute commitment to managing critical 

risks in the workplace and further developing 

our strong leadership and safety culture 

through our Never Assume program.

The principal area of recordable injuries were strains/sprains which is consistent with industry 

trends for predominantly manual and physical work undertaken in the engineering and construction 

environment. We are continuing to review trends and implement proactive initiatives aimed at 

reducing the incident and severity of these types of injuries.

The severity rate metric (lost days per million hours worked) has been calculated by gender and 

based on our Australian work locations. The gender comparison in the number of total recordable 

injuries and severity rate is significantly higher for males than it is for females within our workforce. 

This is consistent with the type of work more typically performed by these workers and the higher 

percentage of employment of males in the workforce. It should be noted that 12% of recordable 

injuries were from contractor employees. The severity rate metric has been impacted by the fatality 

of an alliance team member on one of our joint venture projects, resulting in 220 lost days being 

assigned to this event for statistical purposes.

There were no fines or prosecutions reported during FY18.

Health and wellbeing have a significant  

impact on an employee’s safety at work.  

We understand injury prevention is a critical part 

of improving overall wellbeing. Given the nature 

of the work we do, many employees engage 

in manual or repetitive tasks, and as such 

these people may be at risk of degenerative 

injuries over time. The development of a 

strategy for the pre-emptive management of 

musculoskeletal injuries will set a target of a 

25% reduction in recorded incidences over  

the next two years.

The health and wellbeing of our employees is 

supported in various ways across the business, 

with key initiatives including:

•  an onsite medical facility, promoting 

active lifestyle programs on a range of 

contemporary public health topics;

•  an injury management service to assist 

employees with both work-related and  

non-work-related injuries and illnesses to 

enable their return to work;

•  prevention programs including health 

assessments and pre-employment 

screening;

•  an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) 

available to employees and their families, 

providing confidential counselling as 

well as access to dieticians and financial 

counselling specialists;

•  access to education programs specifically 

developed to support those with 

supervisory, or leadership responsibilities;

•  early intervention programs such as drug 

and alcohol testing, and a zero tolerance to 

the presence of these substances at work;

•  participation in health promotion events 

such as Movember and R U OK? Day;

•  provision of comfortable amenities to take 

a break, including an onsite café now 

available at our Henderson facility; and

•  benefits such as discounts on gym 

membership, health insurance, financial 

advisory services and travel.

OUR FUTURE FOCUS 

Building on the improvements achieved in FY18, we will continue to adopt a strong,  

proactive approach in FY19, driving our Safety Management System towards a  

best-practice model. In order to achieve this, we will focus on the following key areas:

•  build on solid safety leadership foundations by ensuring all leaders have completed an 

advanced HSE Culture and Leadership Training Program;

•  utilise advanced modern technological platforms for recording of hazards, behavioural  

safety observations and workplace inspections; and

• develop a strategy for the pre-emptive management of musculoskeletal injuries.

Civmec will continue to maintain a strong focus on safety as part of an ongoing business 

improvement model being applied throughout the business.

By delivering a strong environmental performance we in turn benefit our clients, the communities 

we operate in and the environment. Our environmental commitments are articulated in our 

Environmental Policy.

Strong environmental performance is fundamental 

to the ongoing success, growth and sustainability of 

our company. Part of our key business strategy and 

operating method is to promote an environmentally 

aware culture through training and communication; 

demonstrate leadership and commitment; and 

continually improve our environmental performance 

and efficiency across the business.

Environmental Policy



Operating within our industry, we are required to adhere to a wide variety of local, state and  

federal rules and regulations along with relevant Australian and international standards which  

have been developed over time to protect and respect the environment and the communities  

we operate and live in.

Civmec has in place a robust Health Safety and Environmental Management System (HSEMS)  

that is certified by Lloyds Register in accordance with ISO 14001:2015 Environmental 

Management System. Our management system provides a sound platform to drive conformity  

in the way we identify, understand and manage environmental issues across the various 

jurisdictions and operational environments we operate in.

To maintain legal compliance, all of our facilities and projects sites are required to identify, document 

and monitor all legal and other requirements that are relevant to the works being conducted. 

Project and facility legal compliance, along with our internal standards and expectations, is further 

measured as part of our scheduled corporate auditing program. 



Heavy engineering and construction requires 

high energy inputs and therefore it is imperative  

we have access to a reliable, affordable and 

efficient energy supply.

Civmec recognises the scientific consensus 

on climate change and accepts it has a 

part in contributing to reducing Greenhouse 

Gas (GHG) emissions in line with the Paris 

Agreement, as signed by Australia and its 

fellow signatories.

Climate uncertainty presents many known, 

and many still unknown, challenges to the 

global environment, its communities and our 

business, which need to be identified and 

understood. We will continue to include these 

factors in our risk profile, ensuring any material 

impacts and opportunities are continually 

assessed and mitigated accordingly. For our 

industry, a changing climate may also present 

opportunities, such as the likely investment 

required to improve and build climate change 

related infrastructure around the world. 

Our Energy

At present 100% of our electricity consumption 

at our manufacturing/production facilities is 

sourced from local electricity networks in WA 

and NSW. Energy consumed at our projects 

is difficult to accurately measure due to the 

various project arrangements in often remote 

locations, and therefore it is not included in this 

report.

Most of the energy usage at our facilities is 

attributed to electricity consumed through 

the fabrication process, comprising; handling, 

cutting, bending, welding, drilling, assembling 

and coating our products. In addition to this, 

electricity is consumed to heat, cool, light and

provide general power to our corporate and 

manufacturing facilities. We also consume fuels 

and gases to power machinery and equipment, 

with some gases consumed through the 

welding and cutting processes. 

To allow us to measure and compare the 

energy intensity of our fabrication facilities over 

time, we measure our total energy input in 

Terajoules (TJ) per million dollars of turnover 

($M AUD). During FY18, Civmec facilities 

consumed a total of 47.26 TJ, which is an 

increase of 17% when compared to 2017 

levels, this is primarily due to increased steel 

processing by weight of 20%.  

Our main driver has always been to focus on 

efficiency through innovation. With reduced 

manual and material handling, materials 

tracking and traceability, advanced automation, 

increased in-house modularisation and 

commissioning and with an ongoing focus on 

training our local workforce, we believe we can 

further improve our efficiency over time.  

In the coming years we look forward to 

reporting on the successful implementation and 

outcomes of our energy efficiency initiatives, 

delivering continuous improvement. With 

continued focus on innovation, and by applying 

our core values, we believe we can achieve 

excellent outcomes. 

Our Emissions  

During FY18, Civmec facilities had an increase 

in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of 27% and 

17% respectively, due to the increase in steel 

processing by weight, as noted previously.  

To allow us to measure and compare the 

emissions intensity of our facilities over time, we 

measure the CO2 emitted in tonnes (tCO2e) per 

million dollars of turnover ($M AUD).  In FY18 

Civmec emissions intensity decreased by 18% 

when compared to 2017 levels.    

We have continued to invest in and develop 

both our Henderson and Newcastle facilities. 

Once the development of these facilities is 

complete and they are fully operational, we 

will collect energy data for at least 12 months 

to understand what our energy profile looks 

like. This data will then guide us in determining 

the most suitable renewable energy system to 

invest in to meet our future requirements. 

Civmec’s ongoing strategy with respect to 

reducing our overall GHG emissions and 

emissions intensity shall be delivered through 

our investment in and implementation of our 

efficiency programs.  

The table below illustrates our facilities’ 

energy and emissions data (Henderson and 

Newcastle), including:

• energy data which includes diesel, petrol, 

electricity, LPG and welding gas;

• Scope 1 emissions comprising diesel, 

petrol, LPG and acetylene;

• Scope 2 emissions comprising our 

purchased electricity; and 

• emissions intensity comprising Scope 1 and 

Scope 2 against turnover.

CASE STUDY



New Facility –  

Sustainability in Design 

Our substantial investment in the 

construction of a state-of-the-art 

shipbuilding, production and maintenance 

facility in Henderson, designed to be 

one of the most efficient and innovative 

in the world, will deliver a new world-

class resource to the Australian maritime 

landscape and significantly enhance 

the capability available nationally. When 

complete in late 2019, the 53,000 

sqm (usable floor area), 18-storey 

high, purpose-built facility will be the 

largest undercover modularisation and 

maintenance facility in Australia.

Working closely with our design partner, 

GHDWoodhead, a number of opportunities 

to integrate sustainable design principles 

were identified, to reduce life-cycle costs 

and drive operational efficiency.

To this end, materials and fittings have 

been selected based on adopting a 

sustainable approach, with a focus on 

energy and water efficiency, robustness, 

low VOC and good Indoor Environment 

Quality (IEQ). 

Materials and Equipment 

The mechanical services design and 

control philosophy aims to balance 

the comfort of occupants with energy 

efficiency, with careful consideration of 

equipment used providing significant life-

cycle cost savings in the longer-term. Key 

considerations included:

•  Building fabric – affects mechanical 

services thermal modelling and 

insulation finishes of the building and 

services in general.

•  Glass and glazing type – more efficient 

glass and higher glazing reduces the 

load on the mechanical plant, reduces 

the capacity of the mechanical plant 

required up front and saves energy in 

the long-term.

•  Building sealing – a well-sealed building 

reduces air infiltration and reduces the 

load on the mechanical plant.

Planting Design and Selection

Our design applies water sensitive and 

sustainable landscape principles that 

promote water conservation and local 

habitat diversity. Locally native plants will 

be used in all planting designs to promote 

water conservation, local vernacular 

character and local habitat.

Planting design incorporates hydrozoning 

techniques to group plants with similar 

water needs together in an effort to be 

more water efficient. These hydrozones 

inform the irrigation design, creating 

different stations with different watering 

requirements.

The design also incorporates use of 

planting to create screens to protect 

against prevailing winds and dust, a 

significant issue for our exposed location 

on Cockburn Sound. Given the harsh 

environment, the design will incorporate 

use of planting to maximise shading to 

walls, windows and external areas.

Lighting

LED luminaires will be installed throughout 

the buildings to ensure a sustainable 

and energy efficient lighting system, 

incorporating the  

following energy efficient lighting controls:

• motion detection;

• dimming;

• time switch switching; and

• photoelectric cell control.

Mobility

A fundamental design element of the new 

facilities was to enable optimum operating 

efficiency in functionally separate areas. 

To achieve this, the design concentrated 

on the centralisation and communal use 

of like amenities wherever feasible. The 

efficient movement of Assembly Hall 

employees to and from the work front was 

a key consideration, from accessing the 

building from the carpark, shift sign in, tea 

breaks and lunch, through to sign out. The 

outcome of applying these considerations 

to the facility design is that employees 

will be able to park their car, and using 

strategically located access escalators 

and lifts, be at their work front in just five 

minutes.

Global waste pollution has become a major 

environmental problem, and as an automatic 

waste producer as a function of the industry in 

which we operate, we accept that we have a 

role to play in addressing this issue. Our waste 

management strategy consists of the following:

•  to continually raise awareness across the 

business and improve the culture of how 

we view waste management and recycling;

•  to reduce our own waste and waste within 

the supply chain with a focus on packaging; 

and

•  to capture all recyclable materials and 

reduce waste going to landfill. 

The waste data included in the table below 

relates to our two manufacturing facilities in 

Henderson and Newcastle. Obtaining accurate 

waste management data for projects is 

currently difficult due to some projects having 

their waste managed by the client or owner. 

Civmec facilities do not discharge any waste 

materials to the environment. All waste 

materials are contained and removed from site 

for further processing.

All waste data included in this report has 

been provided by the relevant waste service 

providers.

Trade Waste License  

We utilise a trade waste license to discharge quantities of treated wash water into the sewerage 

network from the Henderson maintenance and logistics workshop. Wastewater is created from 

the washing down of equipment using a high-pressure washer that may contain oils and grease. 

This water is passed through an oily water separator and then discharged into the sewage network 

for further treatment. As per the license conditions, treated wastewater is tested annually for Total 

Petroleum Hydrocarbons, with results for FY18 below the acceptance criteria.  

Spills   

Due to the nature of our work and the type of equipment we operate, occasionally minor 

hydrocarbon and chemical spills do occur.

Hydrocarbon and chemical spills affect the environment in different ways depending on the type 

and volume of material spilt and the receiving environment. If a spill clean-up is managed effectively, 

the exposure to personnel and environmental damage is minimised.

We believe the best form of spill management is spill prevention and it is the responsibility of 

all Civmec personnel to ensure they are aware of and comply with all company and regulatory 

requirements.  

We have not had any reportable and significant spills to land 

or water to date.

To minimise the risk of impacting the surrounding environment we shall continue to implement our 

operational controls, with a particular focus on waste management and hazardous materials spill 

management and prevention.  

An example of our proactive approach is the regular spill training sessions we undertake at our 

Newcastle facility in NSW. Due to this facility being located adjacent to the Hunter River, it is 

imperative we train our people in spill response regularly.

OUR FUTURE 

FOCUS 

To drive continual improvement in our performance, we shall continue to implement  

our environmental programs across the business, focusing on the following key areas:

•  continue to promote an environmentally aware culture through ongoing training and 

communication to all levels of the business;

•  continually improve the Civmec Environmental Management systems and achieve ongoing 

compliance with our legal and other commitments across all Civmec facilities and projects 

sites, to be verified through our scheduled corporate auditing program; 

•  continue to focus on improving efficiency through innovation, this shall be measured via 

efficiency indicators such as energy intensity (TJ/$m AUD) and emissions intensity  

(tCO2-e/$m AUD); and

•  further develop and implement our waste management strategy, with the aim of increasing 

year on year the proportion of co-mingled and wood recyclable waste streams compared  

to the general waste stream. 

We believe that by delivering on the above key focus areas, Civmec will achieve its long-term 

sustainability goals, delivering valuable outcomes for the environment, and our stakeholders.

In FY18 there were no formal allegations in relation to bribery, 

corruption, and kickbacks brought forward. There were also no 

legal proceedings against Civmec or its employees for alleged 

corruption during FY18.

Assessment Processes  

All of the company’s legal entities have been assessed by their management teams regarding the 

implementation of anti-corruption practices and incidents of corruption.  

All new major suppliers are required to comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct, committing to 

respect our zero-tolerance policy concerning bribery and corruption. Suppliers must have systems 

in place to ensure the proper instruction, training, and auditing of personnel and subcontractors 

to ensure compliance. Civmec performs supplier audits and evaluations to monitor and assess 

compliance with the company’s requirements and the Code of Conduct. Suppliers are obliged to 

immediately inform us of any known violations of the Code of Conduct.

Corruption risks are investigated as part of the ongoing internal auditing of the company.  

If corruption is suspected, the HR Business Unit together with Executive Management and 

possibly other business units, will carry out an investigation, with the help of specialised third 

parties, if necessary. The Risks and Conflicts Committee assesses the findings of the investigation 

and orders disciplinary or other measures against culpable employees, which may also lead to the 

termination of employment and/or the termination of contracts with business partners, or to such 

contracts not being extended or changed for precautionary reasons. To prevent corruption risks, 

we undertake business reviews of high-risk business in high-risk environments with  

high-risk customers.

Communication &amp; Training  

Our approach to anti-corruption is based on the Code of Conduct, which clearly prohibits bribery 

and corruption. Compliance with the Code of Conduct, as an integral part of the employment 

contract and the onboarding program, is the personal responsibility of each Civmec employee.  

In addition, employees are trained at least once a year. Corporate Legal, Internal Audit and 

Corporate Compliance teams regularly conduct training sessions and audits. Executive General 

Managers and Business Unit Managers are responsible for the compliance of their departments 

with applicable laws, internal regulation, including the Code of Conduct, and for the information 

and training of their staff.

In FY18 we have continued training, in proactive avoidance of possible violations against the  

Code of Conduct, both with e-learnings and with classroom-based (face-to-face) courses.  

Training is group-specific, based on cases, and modern training tools are used (multi media). 

Participation is mandatory for all employees in relevant roles. In 2018, we undertook an internal 

assessment with regards to a compliance review, which covered the areas of antitrust law,  

media law and data protection, as well as corruption risks.

Recorded Incidents  

Adoption of and compliance with the Code of Conduct by the General Managers and their 

management teams was reviewed in 2018. 

Our employees are the most effective channel to detect violation, underlining transparency as  

a key value at Civmec which must be supported and preserved.

Civmec had zero legal actions pending or completed in FY18 in 

relation to anti-competitive behaviour and violations of anti-trust 

and monopoly legislation. 

Furthermore, to date, Civmec has never received or been the 

subject of any legal action in relation to anti-competitive behaviour 

and violations of anti-trust and monopoly legislation.

Principles  

The key principles which guide our approach to anti-competitive behaviour are as follows:

1. The CCA governs anti-competitive and unfair behaviours. It is regulated by the Australian 

Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (‘ACCC’).

2. Our corporate policies prohibit entry by any person representing Civmec into any arrangements 

which are illegal under the CCA, have the purpose or (in some cases) the effect of substantially 

lessening competition, or breach the ACL.

3. We predominantly operate under the provisions of the CCA and ensure compliance with this 

Act (amongst others). This includes the prohibition of behaviours such as:

 

a)  agreements between competitors to fix, maintain or control prices;

 

b)  agreements between competitors to split up a market or customers agreements between 

competitors not to deal with particular suppliers, customers or other competitors;

 

c)  conduct that is prohibited if it has the purpose or effect of substantially lessening competition 

as defined under the CCA, which may include, depending on circumstances, exclusive 

dealing and other restrictive arrangements;

 

d)  the supply of goods or services on condition that the customer purchases goods or services 

from a third party; and

 

e)  inducing resellers to not sell products below a specified price.

4.  We also prohibit agreements, arrangements or understandings that have the purpose, effect or 

likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a market.

Purpose  

We operate in a number of different 

geographical regions and in differing market 

sectors. This involves dealing with customers, 

competitors, suppliers, and various other 

stakeholders. It is critical for our ongoing 

sustainability that the company conducts 

its operations in compliance with laws and 

business practices including but not limited to 

those related to anti-competitive behaviours. 

We are committed to conducting our 

operations with integrity and in a manner 

that is consistent with laws and business 

practices that are aimed at fostering an open, 

competitive and fair market environment and 

which will best serve the long-term interests  

of our customers, our stakeholders and the 

wider community.

Civmec is committed to dealing fairly and 

honestly with our customers, suppliers, 

competitors and any other business partners 

and the community (collectively ‘stakeholders’), 

and observing relevant legislation, regulation, 

contractual obligations and our corporate 

policies – in particular the provisions of the 

Competition and Consumer Act (‘CCA’), and 

the Australian Consumer Law (‘ACL’).

Anti-Competitive Behaviour

Policy Compliance  

Failure to comply with the policy in relation to anti-competitive behaviour may result in substantial fines 

and penalties being imposed upon Civmec and may expose the company and/or its employees to 

civil or criminal liability or other financial or reputational damage. It may put our business licences at 

risk. Employees who breach the policy may face disciplinary action including dismissal.

The Executive General Manager Commercial &amp; Risk is responsible for implementation of Civmec’s 

competition law compliance. This is critical to the business for a number of reasons:

•  failure to comply with competition rules can have an extremely high financial cost with regards 

to fines from the Australian Government;

•  any agreement that infringes competition law may be wholly or partially invalid which means 

that the company cannot enforce it;

•  third parties who suffer loss as a result of anti-competitive behaviour may be able to claim 

damages from Civmec for their loss; 

•  investigations into the company and findings of infringements attract adverse press comment; 

and

•  investigations and possible legal proceedings resulting from infringements can take years to 

resolve, leading to high cost and taking up management time that should be devoted to more 

profitable projects.

We encourage our staff to be vigilant and proactive in circumstances where they have concerns 

about conduct that may breach the CCA, and encourage employees to escalate any such 

concerns they might have to their line manager or the Executive General Manager,  

Commercial &amp; Risk. 

Civmec provides full, fair and reasonable 

opportunity for local industry to take part in all 

its activities. This maximises participation where 

subcontractors and suppliers are capable and 

competitive on the basis of OHS, environment, 

quality, delivery and value-for-money standards.

Our Local Industry Participation (LIP) Policy 

articulates our approach to driving opportunities 

for local participation, including:

• developing project specific LIP plans;

•  providing early and fair opportunities to  

all local industries;

•  developing a communications strategy 

for local industry so that they are informed 

at the earliest opportunity of upcoming 

subcontractor/supply opportunities;

•  ensuring local capabilities are considered 

when planning work scope to optimise 

opportunities for local businesses;

•  providing training and development 

opportunities for local providers in order  

to enhance their sustainability;

•  giving preference to tenderers that use 

the greatest local content in labour and 

materials; and

•  working with government, industry  

bodies and communities to improve local 

industry participation, capability  

and competitiveness.

OUR FUTURE 

FOCUS 

Going forward we will continue to advocate good governance and high 

standards of integrity and ethics across our operations, driven by the 

actions and behaviours of our people. This is underpinned by our Code of 

Conduct, which will continue to be reviewed and evolved going forward, 

to meet the expectations of our business, our stakeholders and the 

communities in which we operate.
