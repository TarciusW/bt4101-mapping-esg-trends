ABOUT THIS REPORT 

 

The Group's Sustainability Report (“GSR”) covers the sustainability approach, initiatives, 

performance and material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors with regards 

to the Group’s upstream manufacturing operations in Balakong, Malaysia throughout the 12-

month period, from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 (“FY2021”).  

 

FRAMEWORK 

 

The GSR has been prepared with reference to the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiatives 

(“GRI”) Standards: Core option. The Group has elected to use the GRI Standards as they are 

most widely used standards for sustainability reporting. This GSR has also been prepared in 

accordance with Rule 711A and 711B of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

(“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist (the “Catalist Rules”). It also makes 

references to the guideline set out in SGX-ST’s Sustainability Reporting Guide under Practice 

Note 7F of the Catalist Rules.  

 

CONTENT AND QUALITY 

 

This GSR is prepared with reference to the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiatives 

(“GRI”) Standards – Core Option and GRI's principles of stakeholder, inclusiveness, 

sustainability context, materiality, and completeness have been applied to determine the 

content of the report.  

 

GRI's principles of accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness have 

been used to help stakeholders assess our sustainability performance. The ESG data provided 

in the report has been extracted from internal information systems and records to make 

certain that they are accurate and consistent.

BOARD STATEMENT 

 

The Group has considered sustainability as part of its strategic formulation and determined 

the material ESG factors most applicable to the Group. The Board oversees the management 

and monitoring of these factors, through internal reviews of the Group's sustainability 

performance. Sustainability and corporate social responsibility are at the core of our corporate 

strategy and adhering to these twin tenets would allow the Group to create lasting and positive 

change on the communities we operate in.  

 

We are committed to our stakeholders, particularly, our employees, business partners and 

customers who purchase our products and services. This is why one of the key strategies of 

the Group is to maintain stringent and unwavering standards of quality control for the products 

produced and sold by us, whether through our supply chain of upstream manufacturing of 

automotive parts or downstream automotive retail dealerships. 

 

Our upstream manufacturing is certified to internationally recognised standards of ISO 9001 

Quality Management and IATF 16946 Automotive Management. The intention behind starting 

upstream manufacturing and downstream retail dealership business segments concurrently 

was to be able to provide a wider range of quality products and services across different areas. 

In order to align ourselves with our initial objectives, we continue to hold our products to the 

same high standard and provide bespoke products with specialised industry applications 

through research and development and close collaboration with our technical partners. 

 

In order to support long-term value creation for our stakeholders and shareholders, the Group 

adopts the precautionary principle to minimise negative effects of conducting its business 

whenever possible. The precautionary principle is a strategy for approaching issues of 

potential harm when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking. It emphasises 

caution, pausing and review before leaping into new innovations that may prove disastrous.

SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK  

 

The Group acknowledges the importance of putting in place an effective ESG strategy and 

management across the different facets of the business operations. To this end, the Group 

has established a Sustainability Committee, led by key management executives of the Group 

and supported by representatives from various departments in the Group, with principal 

charge of the Group's ESG strategy. The Sustainability Committee reports to the Board and is 

responsible for reviewing the Group’s sustainability performance, material topics, stakeholder 

concerns, the setting of targets for material topics, and establishing systems to collect, verify, 

and monitor information required for the sustainability reports.  

 

We are aware of the risks and impact associated with the industry we operate in and 

endeavour to identify, evaluate and prevent these risks whenever possible. The Board 

approves the Group’s general policies and strategies including those relating to sustainability 

and are satisfied that the framework in place is sufficient to ensure that the Group's 

sustainability risks and issues are managed and mitigated effectively.

KEY STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGEMENT 

 

We recognise that engagement with all of our stakeholder groups (including the receiving of 

feedback) forms an integral part of our sustainability strategy and initiatives. As such the 

Group takes steps to proactively engage our stakeholders through a variety of channels. 

Through such engagement, our stakeholders are updated on the Group's developments; in 

addition, the Group is able to receive feedback which would in turn allow us to tailor our 

sustainability strategy and initiatives.  

 

We recognise that continual engagement and communication with these key stakeholders are 

vital to the longevity of our business and being open to their feedback would allow us to 

identify and prioritise the sustainability issues that matter to them the most. We have identified 

stakeholders as groups that have an impact, or have the potential to be impacted by our 

business, as well as external organisations that have expertise in aspects that we consider 

material. We would also be continually refreshing our list of key stakeholders to ensure that 

the people most crucial to our materiality assessment process will be involved.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

The Group has applied the relevant GRI Standards to identify and prioritise sustainability topics 

to tailor its approach taken in relation to sustainability centres on the management of the ESG 

impacts of its business operations on its stakeholders. MeGroup’s strategy is to manage its 

most significant sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities while keeping in mind the aim 

of creating long-term value for all its stakeholders. 

 

The Group had identified the material ESG factors using the GRI Standards for Sustainability 

reporting and through internal sessions with internal stakeholders to understand their 

concerns and emerging priorities. Each material issue was discussed in detail, taking into 

account both the internal and external perspectives in relation to our sustainable development 

performance. Such discussions would allow us to constantly evolve and provides us with the 

opportunity to collaborate with these different stakeholders in order to resolve or facilitate the 

resolution of any problem efficiently. We will, from time to time, be updating our materiality 

analysis to ensure that the material issues stay relevant.  

 

The Group undertook the following steps to arrive at the list of material factors for reporting:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 

The Group recognises the importance of observing a high standard of corporate governance 

and transparency in ensuring the sustainability of our businesses and safeguarding our 

stakeholders’ interests and value for the long term. We are committed to complying with all 

industry requirements and legislation relating to trading, accounting, financial reporting, 

internal controls and auditing.  

 

We are committed to upholding best practices in corporate transparency and disclosures, and 

have in place a set of procedures and policies to ensure adherence to our risk management

Anti-Corruption Commission (Amendment) Act 2018. If any of our employees are found to be 

non-compliant with anti-corruption and anti-bribery principles, they may face disciplinary 

action or termination. We regularly apprise our employees on the need to conduct business 

at the highest ethical standards and the need to exhibit honesty, integrity and respect in our 

dealings and interactions within and outside the Group. The Group had set a target of zero 

incident of regulatory non-compliance by all employees, officers and directors of the Group 

for this reporting period.

Our Board has established stringent standards for employees, officers and directors. In 

carrying out one of the principal functions of the Board, which is to oversee the formulation 

of and approve the Group's overall long-term strategic objectives and direction, the Board 

would consider issues of sustainability, review the management of the Group's business 

affairs, performance, resource allocation and also establish a framework to manage risks and 

prioritise shareholder's interests and the Group's assets. We continue to comply with the 

principles and guidelines set out in the Code of Corporate Governance 2018, where

relevant legislation). We have various systems and procedures in place to protect information 

related to our employees and customers. Customers can trust that their personal data is being 

collected, handled, and protected in a responsible and secure manner.  

 

Moving forward, we will continue to stay vigilant and observe compliance with all applicable

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

 

The Group's economic performance is crucial for shareholders and employees as it is 

considered a material issue at MeGroup and is one of the primary ways we create value for 

all stakeholders. Our business growth and economic performance would have a positive 

impact our employees and stakeholders as this would allow us to generate economic value 

and provide continued stable employment for our employees.  

 

On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organisation (“WHO”) declared the outbreak of Covid-

19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The WHO had subsequently 

recognised the spread of Covid-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. 

 

 


MEGROUP LTD - SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 

10 

 

The outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected many businesses where the 

Government of Malaysia had imposed various stages of movement control order since 18 

March 2020. The Government of Malaysia had put a lot of efforts in fighting the pandemic but 

unfortunately the numbers of confirmed cases are still rising significantly and reaching a 

dangerous level. However, with the economic recovery plan advocated by the Government of 

Malaysia, the entire economic activity system has resumed operations in stages. The Group 

has strictly complied with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry Covid 19 Standard 

Operating Procedure (SOP) to commence the business and operation to ensure the business 

activity can resume smoothly to minimise the impact on economic performance. 

 

The Group’s earnings and operating cash flows are expected to be affected by the challenging 

operating environment due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Group has prepared plans and 

strategies to minimise the impact should it be adversely affected particularly on capital and 

cash flows management, including cost-cutting measures and actively seeking to enhance its 

financing facilities and government assistance programs. These are expected to equip the 

Group with sufficient cash flows, and financial resources to meet its obligations as and when 

they fall due. 

 

As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to progress and evolve, it is extremely challenging to 

predict the full extent and duration of its impact on the Group’s businesses and the countries 

where the reporting entity operates. The Group had taken and will continue to take myriad 

actions to deal with the Covid-19 crisis. 

 

Nevertheless, the Group targets to achieve sustainable growth in the coming years through 

strengthening our two core business segments:  

a) 

upstream manufacturing, and  

b) 

downstream retail dealerships.  

 

while the Group continues to raise market awareness for our broad range of products under 

distinguished proprietary brand names, particularly in its downstream retail dealerships with 

a total of 11 dealerships under 7 brand names i.e. Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mitsubishi, 

Peugeot and Proton. 

 

The Group’s brand partners supply the vehicles and automotive parts sold in its downstream 

retail dealerships business while the upstream manufacturing business significant purchases 

from suppliers mainly raw materials are sourced locally and internationally to ensure 

procurement efficiency and nurturing a reliable supply chain. 

 

The Group’s policy is to conduct its business with integrity and by adhering to ethical business 

principles. The Group maintains zero tolerance for bribery, fraud and corruption. There was 

no incident of corruption, bribery or fraud in the reported period.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 

As a responsible employer, the Group aims to address and prevent the variety of health and 

safety risks that employees are exposed to, wherever possible. Health and safety hazards can 

arise over the use of unsafe equipment, machinery, processes and practices. They can also 

arise with the use of dangerous substances such as chemical. Therefore, we are continuously 

working towards the minimisation of the risk of accidents, injuries and illnesses to our 

employees, contractors and place health and safety as top priority in our operations. 

 

MeGroup is committed to achieving Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) excellence 

through: 

 compliance with applicable WSH legislations and regulations as well as other requirements 

to which we subscribe; 

 consistently establishing and maintaining WSH management performance; 

 operating and maintaining our facilities to prevent and minimise risks to the health and 

safety of our employees and surrounding communities; and 

 ongoing communication of our WSH policy to all parties. 

 

The Group constantly monitors the working conditions of its employees to ensure that they 

comply with national standards issued by government agencies or associations such as 

Department of Occupational Safety and Health (“DOSH”). The Management is wholly 

committed to complying with the local occupational health and safety and all other relevant 

regulations. The Group implements a comprehensive safety management system to ensure 

the health, safety and welfare of all its employees and people in the community who may be 

affected by its operations. 

 

The Group prioritises process safety, especially in relation to the Group's upstream 

manufacturing, and is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy workforce. Management 

actively ensures that the Group's Standard Operating Procedures are complied with, including 

the provision of Personal Protection Equipment, as may be necessary, to its employees. Our 

Employee Health and Safety and Fire Safety Committees, which comprise staff from each 

relevant department of the Group and which are advised by the Group's registered safety 

officers, oversee the implementation of the WSH management plan, and reviews such WSH 

management plans on a monthly basis. 

 

 


MEGROUP LTD - SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 

12 

 

Due in part to the Group's prioritising safety and the health of our workers, the Group is 

pleased to report that it has achieved its goal of zero cases of WSH complaints in FY2021, and 

fully complied with WSH and environmental inspections conducted by the authorities. The 

Group also recorded no cases of work-related ill health. However, we have recorded one (1) 

case of industrial accident, a minor injury, at the machinery area of our Balakong Production 

Plant 1. Countermeasure of risk control is taken place to mitigate the risk of accident in 

machine area such as safety operating procedure, training and daily briefing to all members 

of operations team. 

 

For FY2022, the Group has set the following goals: 

 

Objectives 

FY2022 Goal 

Workplace Safety and Health Complaint 

 

Zero (0) Cases 

Industrial Accident 

 

Zero (0) Cases 

 

In respect of workplace safety and insurances, certain of our employees fall under the ambit 

of the Social Security Organisation (“SOCSO”) of Malaysia. SOCSO oversees the 

administration, implementation and enforcement of the Employees' Social Security Act 1969 

and the Employees' Social Security (General) Regulations 1971 in Malaysia, and provides 

employees with security protection social insurance through various schemes, including the 

Employment Injury Scheme and the Invalidity Scheme. The Employment Injury Scheme 

provides coverage to employees who are victims of industrial accidents, commuting accidents, 

accidents during emergency and occupational diseases. The Invalidity Scheme provides 24-

hour protection to employees against invalidity or death which is caused outside working 

hours, even if the cause is not related to their employment. Both schemes provide cash 

benefits to employees and their dependants in the event of unforeseen incidents.  

 

STAFF WELLBEING AND COVID-19 

 

One of the Group’s key priorities is to keep our employees safe from the Covid-19 pandemic. 

The Group had conducted regular voluntary Covid-19 mass testing to ensure our employees 

are not infected and fit to work at our plants and offices. For the employees working from 

home due to the government-imposed movement control orders and work from home 

directives, we provided all necessary resources such as laptops and secure email connections 

to enable our employees to work from home. The Group has also implemented split teams’ 

arrangements among our employees as part of the risk mitigation plan to combat Covid-19 

infections. In addition, we ensured that our employees stay connected through frequent virtual 

meetings and phone calls to function effectively as a team.

As of 31 March 2021, the Group has about 101 employees in its upstream manufacturing 

operations and corporate office. In the assessment of people's performance within the Group, 

the Group practises meritocracy and believe in providing due recognition for their excellence. 

The Group also implements remuneration packages that are competitive within the market 

and are internally fair in order to attract external talents.  

 

The Group also provides learning and development resources so as to make available ample 

opportunities for its people to better themselves through internal courses or on-the-job 

training in the areas of technical and functional competencies. The Group targets to increase 

the competence of our employees through the internal training programs such as leadership 

and personality training so that they are able to contribute effectively to the Group. 

 

Performance and career development review of employees are performed during the 

performance appraisal process. This process is conducted on an annual basis whereby there 

will be two-way communication and engagement between supervisors and subordinates to 

assess the performance of the employee. Upon completion of the appraisal process, 

consideration of career advancement such as promotion, quantum of salary adjustments, and 

annual performance bonus will be determined based on the appraisal results. Employees are 

assessed and remunerated fairly based on their experience, qualifications and performance. 

All employees (those with more than one year service) had received their performance and 

career development review in FY2021. 

 

ENVIRONMENT 

 

The minimisation of our environmental footprint impact is one of the key objectives of the 

Group in relation to the environment. By minimising our environmental footprint, this would 

achieve a twofold benefit where we would be conducting our business in a socially responsible 

manner and benefit from reducing operational costs for example, through the reduction in the 

use of electricity by utilising more energy efficient appliances. The Group is pleased to report 

that it had achieved more than 10% reduction in electricity consumption in FY2021. The Group 

is in the midst of installing the solar power system and target to uitlise it in the third quarter 

of FY2022. The Group has set the objective and goal to be achieved in FY2022 as follows: 

 

Objectives 

FY2022 Goal 

Reduction in electricity consumption 

 

10% 

 

 

 


MEGROUP LTD - SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021 

15 

 

The Group’s carbon dioxide (“CO₂”) emissions are from the use of electricity and motor fuel. 

As good practise, the Group remains committed to minimise its emissions by adopting energy-

saving measures where possible. 

 

In addition to this, the Group is expecting the power of solar energy to generate green 

electricity within the manufacturing plant to reduce carbon print and become more 

environmentally friendly. 

 

There were no incidents of non-compliance and penalties pertaining to environmental-related 

issues in this reporting period under review. The Board and Management continue to review 

and improve current environmental management system and practices and ensure that all our 

activities and operations comply with regulatory and customers’ requirements. Target for 

FY2022 is as follow: 

 

Objectives
