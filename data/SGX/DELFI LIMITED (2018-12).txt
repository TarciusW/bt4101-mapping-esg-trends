The Board is pleased to present Delfi Limited’s second 

Sustainability Report, which illustrates Delfi’s commitment 

towards sustainability to all our stakeholders. At Delfi, we 

firmly support the UN’s view that “Sustainable development 

is ‘development that meets the needs of the present 

without compromising the ability of future generations 

to meet their own needs’.” Businesses play a key role in 

advancing global sustainable development. As such, we 

are committed to our corporate social responsibility and 

sustainability mission, as we seek to embrace the needs 

of both the communities we work in and our customers, 

whilst at the same time caring for the environment and 

acting in the interests of our stakeholders.

The Board considers sustainability as part of Delfi’s strategy 

and works closely with Management in determining the 

material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

concerns as embodied in our Sustainability Foundation. 

It also plays a crucial role in overseeing the management 

and monitoring of the material ESG concerns.

In complementing Delfi’s customary and regulatory 

financial and corporate governance disclosures in our 

Annual Report, our Sustainability Report focuses on the 

ESG aspects of Delfi’s organisational performance in 

accordance with the SGX Listing Rules 711A and 711B for 

Sustainability Reporting. Sustainability Reporting enables 

Delfi to strategically review our business in the context 

of our material sustainability impact, alongside a phased 

disclosure of our performance with insights into the 

opportunities and challenges ahead.

Our Sustainability Pillars and Material 

Sustainability Matters

&lt;102-46&gt; &lt;102-49&gt;

We believe that our Four Sustainability Pillars are 

the themes of social, environmental, economic 

and governance issues that affect and shape our 

sustainability mission. Over the course of the past 

year, an exercise was conducted to identify and 

prioritise the sustainability matters that are material 

to the Group and our key stakeholders within 

each of these Four Sustainability Pillars. Our Board 

identified two additional matters, namely, managing 

responsible water use and employee well-being 

that are relevant for reporting in 2018 and beyond. 

Our material sustainability matters embodied in the 

Four Sustainability Pillars comprises all goals and 

initiatives necessary to consolidate our sustainability 

foundation (“Sustainability Foundation”). This is

About Delfi 

&lt;102-2&gt; &lt;102-3&gt; &lt;102-4&gt; &lt;102-5&gt; &lt;102-6&gt; &lt;102-7&gt;

Delfi is one of South East Asia’s leading players in branded chocolate confectionery. 

Headquartered in Singapore and listed on the Mainboard of the SGX-ST since 2004, 

our principal activities are marketing and distribution of our own brands of chocolate 

confectionery products in our core markets namely Indonesia, the Philippines, 

Singapore and Malaysia.

Our business is supported by two manufacturing facilities located in Indonesia and 

the Philippines. In addition to our own products we also market and distribute a broad 

portfolio of reputable agency brands to leverage on our multi-layered distribution 

networks. Our network comprises third-party distributors, sub-distributors and 

wholesalers and extends across a wide range of traditional and modern trade retail 

channels – from corner shops and mini-marts, to supermarkets and hypermarkets. 

Our Brands

 &lt;102-2&gt; &lt;102-7&gt;

Our main product categories are moulded chocolate, dragées, enrobed wafers, 

wafers and biscuits. We have a portfolio of over 10 master brands and more 

than 40 sub-brands that extend across a broad spectrum of categories in the 

chocolate confectionery market.

Our established portfolio of brands in Indonesia includes “SilverQueen”, “Ceres” 

and “Selamat”, which were introduced in the 1950’s and “Delfi” in the 1980’s. In 

the Philippines, our flagship brands are “Goya” and “KnickKnacks”, which were 

introduced in the 1950’s and the 1980’s respectively. With our longstanding 

presence and legacy in these markets, our chocolates have delighted many 

generations of Indonesians and Filipinos. To complement our current portfolio 

of brands, in 2018, we  acquired the exclusive and perpetual trademark rights to 

the “Van Houten” brand name for consumer chocolate products for markets in 

Asia, excluding India, Korea and the Middle East.

Sustainability at Delfi 

Sustainable development is “development that

meets 

the 

needs 

of 

the 

present 

without 

compromising the ability of future generations 

to meet their own needs”.1 At Delfi, we believe in 

doing our part in contributing towards sustainable 

development. At the bedrock of our organisation, 

our roots anchor us in the sustainability domains of 

social, environmental, economic and governance.

With 

the 

conviction 

of 

growing 

with 

our 

communities and the world, the overarching 

concept of sustainable value creation underpins 

all that we do. Akin to the cocoa tree, sustainable 

growth can be achieved when both our internal and 

external environment offers an optimal condition 

for us to thrive. With careful and tenacious 

management of our material sustainability matters, 

we are able to better assess our sustainability 

impact on our stakeholders – cultivating the 

positive and weeding out the negative. Our key 

stakeholders are the identified people and groups 

that can significantly affect or be significantly 

affected by our organisation. As we flourish, our 

influence and impact on our stakeholders widens as 

well. The challenge therein, is for us to consistently 

propagate the fruits of our labor through value 

creation, meeting their needs and expectations.

Goals for our Stakeholders 

&lt;102-40&gt; &lt;102-42&gt; &lt;102-43&gt; &lt;102-44&gt;

At Delfi, passion for people has always been at the heart of what we do. Focusing our connections with all our stakeholders is vital for us to constantly bring delight 

and deliver value. Our conversations with our stakeholders allow us to understand their key concerns and respond effectively. Our sustainability approach draws upon 

these outcomes. We connect with our stakeholders through various modes of regular engagement including meetings, briefings, phone calls and other forms of 

communication.

INTRODUCTION

Consumers

We are committed to going the extra mile to 

consistently provide superior quality for our 

consumers – many of whom have been with 

us across generations – with a superior Delfi 

experience. 

We emphasise continuous product development 

and quality enhancement in our journey to meet 

the needs of our broad range of consumers.

Employees 

Our aspiration is to create a workplace that all our 

employees are proud of – a true Delfi family.  

Our focus is on treating our employees fairly, 

fostering close labour union relations and 

advocating excellence in occupational health and 

safety.

Customers

At Delfi, we see distributors, wholesalers and 

retailers as our customers as well as our partners 

in expanding our reach to our consumers, and 

ultimately driving sales for the company. 

Our goal is to create a fair and mutually 

beneficial arrangement, through clear and open 

communication lines on expectations. 

Suppliers

As we view our suppliers as business partners, our 

objective is for mutual growth through fair and 

transparent dealings in compliance with relevant 

laws and regulations. 

We are also increasingly seeking out and working 

with suppliers that subscribe to our sustainability 

agenda. We audit our original product manufacturers 

and key suppliers for sustainable value creation.

Local Communities 

We respect the communities we operate in, and 

are keen to advance the interests of the company 

and the community in lockstep. 

As a good corporate citizen, we aim to achieve our 

goals through actively shaping and participating in 

community programs and initiatives. 

Governments &amp; Regulators

We have the utmost respect for the rule of law, 

and continually extend our cooperation with 

governments and regulators. 

It is our priority to ensure compliance with the 

relevant laws and regulations in the jurisdictions 

that we do business.

Trade &amp; Industry Associations

Our goal is to play an active role in the trade and 

industry associations of which we are members, to 

help further the interests of the group. 

We hope to lend our support and contribute to the 

various initiatives.

Non-profit Organisations

We seek to constructively engage with non-profit 

organisations, align on common social causes 

and explore models for further partnership where 

feasible.

Investors

We aim to promote investors’ understanding 

of Delfi’s strategy and performance through 

timely, appropriate and accurate dissemination of 

corporate information. 

In the long-term, we seek to build trust-

based relationships with our investors through 

our emphasis on governance structures and 

collaborative dialogue.

Materiality Assessment

 &lt;102-46&gt; &lt;102-47&gt; &lt;102-49&gt;

At Delfi, we believe that our Sustainability Mission is built on the four intertwined themes of social, environmental, economic and governance factors which we call our 

“Sustainability Foundation”. In 2017, we formalised our way of engaging with stakeholders to identify and prioritise our material sustainability matters. The outcomes 

derived were taken into consideration during the review of Delfi’s sustainability matters for 2018. We have two additional matters that are relevant for reporting this 

year – Employee Well-being and Responsible Water Use.

Our material sustainability matters have been divided into the Four Sustainability Foundation as follows:

• Determine the process principles 

of our materiality assessment

• Cross-functional focus group 

discussions and interviews 

were conducted to consider 

sustainablity from both internal 

and external stakeholders’ 

perspectives

• Based on our stakeholder  

engagement and drawing 

from insights on our internal 

and external value drivers, a 

comprehensive universe of 30 

potential material sustainability 

matters was identified

• Facilitated by independent  

consultants, a materiality 

assessment workshop was 

conducted in FY2017

• In FY2018, we reviewed our 

materiality matrix. In our review, 

we identified 2 additional 

matters

• The revised materiality matrix 

was presented to and validated 

by our Board of Directors for our 

second Sustainability Report

Delfi’s Code of Conduct provides a framework for 

ethical decision making and good conduct for the 

Group. The Code contains important core values and 

principles of the Company’s professional conduct and 

governance. The Board of Directors, Management 

and all employees are dedicated to upholding the 

Code. 

Code of Conduct

&lt;102-17&gt;

Delfi has an Ethics Code, within our Code of Conduct, 

to which advice on matters of ethical concerns 

and grievances may be sought by our internal and 

external stakeholders. These matters will be handled 

objectively and subject to further investigation, 

disciplinary action/s or legal process, where 

justified and necessary. A link to the Code 

may be found at http://www.delfilimited.

In addition, Delfi has a whistle 

blowing 

mechanism 

and 

policy that seeks to encourage 

reporting in good faith, of 

matters which may comprise 

misdemeanours, misconduct, 

fraud, corruption, illegal acts, 

etc. The mechanism and policy 

seeks to provide for reporting 

in confidence that stakeholders 

are treated fairly and shielded 

from any reprisal.

In regard to issues relating to our 

ESG concerns, external stakeholders 

can also file their feedback, concerns or 

grievances through our general corporate 

GOVERNANCE

Our Values

 &lt;102-16&gt;

Integrity, excellence and commitment, are values 

that guide all of us at Delfi as we seek to enhance 

our 

organisation’s 

development, 

performance 

and growth. These core values are embedded 

within our concept of corporate governance and 

form an integral part of Delfi’s ethos, business, 

systems, processes and operations. Our mission is 

to delight customers and consumers with superior 

chocolate confectionery products and services. As 

an organisation, we are imbued with the following 

values:

relations channels. Internal stakeholders can do so 

through human resources / union-management 

channels. We seek to investigate, address and 

resolve all confirmed cases as soon as practicable. 

All grievance proceedings and records will be kept in 

confidence.

Corporate Governance 

&lt;102-18&gt; 

The Board of Delfi comprises a healthy well-balanced 

mix of entrepreneurs, professionals and corporate 

expertise. Out of a total of 8 Directors, our Board 

comprises 3 executive Directors, 4 non-executive 

independent Directors and 1 non-executive non-

independent Director. There is a clear separation of the 

role of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman. 

One of our 3 executive Directors serves as CEO and 

Managing Director. The Board meets regularly and 

is provided with timely updates and information. 

As and when there are urgent commercial or other 

corporate matters, Board meetings are convened to 

seek guidance from the Board or to elicit a decision. 

All Directors are expected to act in good faith, and to 

act in the interests of Delfi. The Board is supported 

by the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, 

the Remuneration Committee, the Nominating 

Committee, the Risk Management Committee and the 

Market Sustainability and Strategy Committee. These 

committees (with the exception of the Executive 

Committee) provide guidance and regularly review 

matters within their purview.

Corporate Social Responsibility

Beyond our customers, consumers and business partners, Delfi recognises the importance 

of enriching lives and building sustainable relationships with the many communities we 

serve.

Delfi Limited Bursary

The Delfi Group believes that no person should be left behind for want of financial means 

to benefit from a good education, and in that vein Delfi believes in the importance of 

nurturing and grooming the next generation as strong ethical leaders. Through the 

bursaries awarded to students of Singapore Management University (SMU), Delfi hopes 

to empower exceptional students to strive for excellence. There are 3 students on this 

programme for the academic year 2019/2020.

Delfi’s Milk Drinking Movement

Delfi partnered with an elementary school, Andir 01 Elementary School, in Bandung, 

Indonesia in September 2018 to bring the Milk Drinking Movement (Gerakan Minum Susu) 

to life. The Milk Drinking Movement is expected to benefit the students in helping them 

meet their nutritional needs for growth. Our work under this movement is expected to be 

carried out monthly over a 3-year continuous period. To supplement our contribution to 

the children under this initiative,  we try to liven the spirits of these children by providing 

them with additional chocolate treats to reward them for their efforts at school. 

The initiative is in keeping with Delfi’s regulatory commitment with Indonesia’s Ministry 

of Agriculture, to help energise and contribute to the development of the domestic fresh 

milk industry locally. To spread the joy that Delfi’s Milk Drinking Movement brings, we 

have expanded our reach to include other schools in Bandung, Indonesia, namely, SDN 

Dayeuhkolot 01 which is planned for next year.

Profile of our workforce

&lt;102-7&gt; &lt;102-8&gt;

As of 31 December 2018, we had a total number of 4,260 

employees across Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and 

Malaysia, of which 66% are hired on a permanent contract basis. 

People are at the heart of our organisation. We hire based on merit 

and are committed to upholding fair employment practices. Any 

form of discrimination has no place in our organisation and we 

believe strongly in providing our people with equal opportunities 

and benefits for them to reach their full potential. We are 

compliant with all relevant labour laws and regulations in the 

countries we operate. Due to the nature of the manufacturing 

industry, a large number of roles tend to be more physical, which 

explains the higher percentage of males within our workforce.

&lt;103-1&gt;

Having sound human resource policies and practices are critical 

to our organisation as it allows Delfi to attract and retain the 

right talent to foster growth, development, creativity and value 

creation for the Group. We understand that having the right 

individual in the right position can have a profound impact 

on the performance of the Group and generate shareholder 

value. We acknowledge that our continued success is based on 

the commitment and joint effort of our employees. Similarly, 

we recognise that the provision of equitable opportunities 

for personal development and career advancement on top of 

tailored training to allow our employees to effectively discharge 

their duties in a safe manner are of equal importance in ensuring 

the well-being of our employees and further, helping them to 

fulfil their potential.

New Hires and Turnover2 

&lt;401-1&gt;

The total number of employees within the Group between 2017 

and 2018 was relatively constant. There was sufficient manpower 

to meet our core operational needs during the year. However, 

to meet anticipated surges in demand during yearly festive 

periods such as Ramadan and Christmas, temporary workers 

are recruited which often include rehiring those familiar with 

Delfi’s operations and those with a preference for such short-

term contracts, thereby accounting for the overall turnover rate 

and correspondingly, new hire rate of 31%. Our permanent staff 

turnover rate was at about 7% for 2018.

Employee benefits

&lt;401-2&gt;

Delfi cares about its people. Beyond rewarding employees 

with remuneration that is commensurate with the efforts 

and performance delivered in helping the business achieve 

its goals, Delfi is invested in the well-being and morale of our 

employees. In our belief that happy employees will in turn raise 

productivity and efficiency, Delfi offers an extensive suite of 

employment benefits tailored for our full-time employees. Apart 

from the provision of baseline benefits mandated by respective 

local labour regulations, the HR team works closely with the 

country units in reviewing the non-monetary performance-

based rewards and programs offered. Our benefits package may 

include life insurance, medical care benefits, disability coverage, 

parental leave and retirement provisions. We only partner with 

globally-recognised and reputable third party medical and 

financial organisations, with the aim to provide quality healthcare 

services and a holistic coverage for our employees.

At Delfi, a safety culture is deeply rooted in our organisation and everything we do. As such we 

place great emphasis on Occupational Health and Safety (OHS). We are fully aware that in our 

workplace we are responsible for the health and safety of our employees. We therefore carefully 

and constantly consider employee safety to prioritise what more can be done to avoid accidents. 

This includes proper training and identification of workplace hazards to ensure our employees 

acquire the necessary knowledge for the safe and hygienic performance of their duties. Another 

key issue is to provide our employees with appropriate protective measures, and enforce their use, 

so as to minimise risk of accidents and reduce their possible consequences.

Practices and performance

&lt;103-3&gt; &lt;403-2&gt;

As an employer, Delfi recognises that with 

optimisation of the work environment, we 

inevitably promote the mental and physical 

well-being of all people. In our ongoing pursuit 

to achieve an accident-free workplace, we 

commit ourselves to internal and external audits 

that enables us to identify violations and areas 

for improvement. We constantly encourage our 

people to flag any unsafe working conditions and 

practices across our operations. Comprehensive 

training 

and 

education 

programmes 

are 

conducted at facilities to increase awareness 

and set expectations of our safety culture. 

Further to that, all employees are required to 

maintain a strict adherence to procedures when 

operating specific machineries and equipment 

to safeguard them from any unexpected issues 

that may arise.

In FY2018, Delfi maintained its achievement of 

zero work-related fatalities as well as a reduction 

of work-related injuries rate by 19%. There were 

14 recordable work-related injuries. At Delfi, we 

regard all cases as important. Documentation 

of the incident is detailed in a corrective action 

report post-investigation and subject to further 

review and approval by a Safety and Health 

Coordinator. Subsequent follow-up is conducted 

to ensure the implementation of corrective and 

preventive measures, such as activity-based 

audits, 

enhancement 

of 

Lock-out/Tag-out 

(LOTO) procedures and risk assessment training.

Case Study:

Keeping up with the best workplace safety practices

In enhancing the conformance to Standard Operating 

Procedures to prevent and reduce work-related mishaps 

at facilities, beginning July 2018, Delfi focused on activity-

based audits as a more effective approach in assessing the 

knowledge and capabilities of employees in executing 

their daily operational activities. 

Delfi regularly conducts internal training sessions to 

equip all employees with the relevant expertise to carry 

out the audit. The process involves the observation of a 

work activity by a co-worker who accordingly, has the 

authority to cease the activity when an unsafe action or 

incorrect step is undertaken up until it has been rectified. 

Through these activity-based audits, it not only facilities 

an awareness creation process but also encourages 

mutual on-the-job learning between peers.

Significance of impact 

&lt;103-1&gt;

The food and beverage industry landscape continues to advance 

at a rapid pace. Fuelled by increasing stakeholder expectations, 

government regulations and innovation, the realities call for Delfi 

to sharpen its focus and awareness on consumer health and 

safety as a key sustainability matter as it directly impacts human 

lives. Consumers today are calling for greater transparency 

in disclosure of food safety programs and processes. A 

sizeable group of consumers are now looking beyond the 

traditional concerns of food safety – the effects of food-borne 

contamination or immediate physical affliction. These individuals 

are increasingly mapping their buying decisions to potential 

long-term health and wellness impacts as well.

 

In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) has released its 

intention to eliminate the use of artificial trans fats, otherwise 

known as partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), from global food 

supply. An estimated of more than 500,000 deaths yearly are 

attributed to cardiovascular diseases in which trans fat intake plays 

a huge role in9. As an established chocolate and confectionery 

company, Delfi strongly believes in having the social responsibility 

to promote mindful consumption of our products – especially 

in our young consumers. We continually allocate resources in 

food science research and product innovation to design a wider 

range of healthier treats for the world to enjoy. In light of the 

adverse impact caused by artificial trans fat, Delfi has voluntarily 

prioritised and committed to the removal of artificial trans fat 

across the full range of our manufactured products by end 2019.

Delfi’s Quality Management System

As part of our overall Quality Management System, we have made significant 

investments in quality assurance systems in order to consistently achieve high 

manufacturing standards. The manufacturing standards which the Group 

follows include:

Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”)

GMP was established by the Food and Drug Administration in the USA in 1967 

under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The GMP is 

based on international hygiene standards, and promotes a quality approach to 

manufacturing.  GMP guidelines provide minimum requirements that a food 

product manufacturer must meet to assure that the products are of high quality 

and do not pose any risk to the consumer or public. The regulations are relatively 

general and allow the Group to decide individually how to best implement the 

necessary controls to achieve goals such as cleanliness, equipment verification 

and process validation. In doing this, the Group takes into account the specific 

needs of its consumers.

Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (“HACCP”)

HACCP was adopted by the Group as a comprehensive step-by-step food 

safety program for its production process. Assessments of hazards applicable 

to microbiological, chemical, physical, food safety and quality standard risks 

are made. Subsequent to such hazard assessment, the critical control points 

are determined within the production process to control identified hazards. 

Procedures for monitoring and taking corrective actions are established for each 

control point. Therefore any problem is traceable to the specific point in the 

production process and/or the specific raw material utilised.

The Group conducts process testing to ensure the quality and specifications of 

our products are consistent and meet the exacting standards of our consumers. 

Such in-process testing involves performing tests on samples of products 

to determine if there are any quality defects. In addition, the Group conducts 

microbiological tests on samples to ensure that its strict specifications regarding 

microbiological content are adhered to so that its products are always safe for 

human consumption.

Each delivery of products is given a unique lot identification code printed on the 

individual packing and accompanying documents which incorporates the date of 

manufacture. It can be used to trace the complete production history of the product 

starting from the source of raw materials. Any delivery breaching the Group’s quality 

standards can thus be identified and stopped before it is delivered to its customers 

and consumers subsequently.

FSSC 22000 Food Safety System Certification

FSSC 22000 provides a framework for effectively managing the Group’s food safety 

responsibilities. FSSC 22000 is fully recognised by the Global Food Safety Initiatives 

(GFSI) and is based on existing ISO Standards. It demonstrates that the Group 

has a robust Food Safety Management System in place. The FSSC 22000 system 

uses a management systems approach to food safety, using ISO 22000 for the 

management system requirement and ISO Technical Standards or Public Available 

Specifications (PAS) for prerequisite program requirements. 

BRC Global Standard for Food Safety

First published in 1998, the Standard is now in its eighth issue and is well-established 

globally. It has evolved with input from many leading global specifiers and is 

recognised by the GFSI. It was also the first Food Safety Standard to be benchmarked 

by the GFSI. It provides a framework to manage product safety, integrity, legality 

and quality, and the operational controls for these criteria in the food and food 

ingredient manufacturing, processing and packing industry.

The BRC Global Standard focuses on:

• 

The importance of management commitment

• 

HACCP-based food safety programmes

• 

Quality management systems

• 

Auditing good manufacturing processes

• 

Auditing areas which often have the highest rate of product recalls and

 

withdrawals, such as labelling and packing

• 

Developing systems to reduce exposure to food fraud

• 

Ensuring consistency of the audit process

• 

Promoting greater resilience, transparency and traceability in the supply chain

High hygiene standards

Delfi observes high hygiene standards. Regular training and checks are conducted 

on our personnel at our facilities. These includes stringent requirements on attire, 

footwear and personal hygiene.

Innovation and technology

We draw on innovation and technology to improve our food safety standards. For 

example, we have made significant strides in improving our packaging materials 

to strengthen protection against the external environment. We have also rolled-

out X-ray machines to enhance our foreign material detection systems across our 

facilities.

Labelling and communication

The display and provision of information for our products is important to our 

consumers as well as subject to many regulations. To that end, we strive to provide 

transparent access to reliable and accurate information of our products through 

responsible labelling. Our labels advise on the expiry, recommended storage 

conditions, allergen declaration, ingredients, nutritional value, etc. We continuously 

seek to improve the contents of our product labels with greater emphasis on the 

sustainability impact of our products.

Customer care portal

We value feedback from our customers. We ensure that all customers, and 

consumers alike are heard through the launch of our customer care and feedback 

portal. We are making positive progress in the implementation of updated labels 

across our products manufactured in Indonesia and the Philippines which bears the 

address of the portal. The portal aims to provide a direct avenue for all customers 

to reach out to Delfi and is also a central system for the business to maintain an 

overview of the quality of the products, service delivery and feedback received.

In 2018, we have met our target of no incidents of material non-compliance with 

applicable laws and regulations for consumer health and safety, and product 

information and labelling.

Case Study:

Transitioning towards being artificial trans fat-free

During the year, we embarked on our journey to eliminate the 

use of artificial trans fat in our products. The initiative arose due 

to a rising number of scientific studies which have found a strong 

correlation between the intake of artificial trans fat and proliferated 

risk of developing coronary heart diseases, stroke, as well as, type 2 

diabetes.

Although regulations have not yet been enforced in some of the 

countries in which we operate in, such as Indonesia where our 

factory and biggest market share is, we have nonetheless voluntarily 

begun the process of reviewing ingredients used in our manufactured 

products. With the health and well-being of consumers as a priority 

for Delfi, we have additionally committed to phase out the use of 

artificial trans fat across the full range of our products in all markets 

and we aim to achieve this by the end of 2019.

Delfi’s Prescribed Standards, Requirements &amp; Practices for the Environment, 

Social &amp; Working Conditions (“Delfi Prescribed Standards”)

We recognise that our business has an impact on people and the environment 

locally, globally and especially in the countries in which we operate and do business 

in. We believe that we are empowered to choose to act responsibly, with integrity 

and to do good while fulfilling our intent of being good business partners. Upholding 

this principle is a pre-condition to our future growth; a growth that will be achieved 

along with other like-minded responsible business partners and suppliers who 

share and identify with our vision, mission and approach to doing business.

In that vein, Delfi requires business partners and suppliers to acknowledge and 

agree to our Delfi Prescribed Standards, for the Environment, Social &amp; Working 

Conditions for the management of businesses, the purchase, and/or acquisition 

of products, materials and/or the delivery of services. Ultimately, it is the spirit of 

the Delfi Prescribed Standards that is important to us, and it is with this spirit that 

we consistently urge our business partners and suppliers to stand shoulder to 

shoulder with us in upholding the Delfi Prescribed Standards. 

The following table summarises the elements covered in the Delfi Prescribed 

Standards.

Launch of Supplier Self-Assessment (“SSA”) Program

Aside from Delfi’s Prescribed Standards, Requirements &amp; Practices that our 

suppliers are encouraged to adhere to, we are currently in the early stages of 

rolling out a SSA program which incorporates social and environmental criterion 

as part of our evaluation matrix used to assess new potential suppliers, as well as 

our existing suppliers in a phased-approach on their compliance and competence 

in managing ESG-related aspects across their value chain. The SSA questions are 

based on internationally-recognised standards such as but not limited to ISO14001 

Environment Management Systems, SEDEX membership and OSHAS, whilst taking 

into consideration the respective countries’ environmental conservation laws to 

assess suppliers on their environmental and social responsibility.

Sustainability Projects and Initiatives

Delfi believes in collaborating with businesses, communities, governments 

and non-governmental organisations (‘NGOs’) to tackle systemic sustainability 

concerns that may be prevalent in business including some sectors, like the 

chocolate industry and the cocoa ingredients industry, so it is imperative that 

we do our part in helping to address these concerns and working against known 

ills such as child labour, forced labour, human rights violations, cruelty against 

animals,  deforestation, and pollution, while we also focus on promoting good 

policies and practices in employment, health, safety and governance.

RESPONSIBLE WATER USE

Significance of impact 

&lt;103-1&gt;

As a responsible guardian and steward of the 

environment, Delfi practices responsible water usage. 

Water is precious in every sense of the word, for human 

life, the well-being of individuals and the health of the 

community as a whole. With this in mind, we in Delfi 

exercise utmost care in managing our access to and 

usage of water. We are  conscious of using only what 

the Group needs and engage in recycling at every 

available opportunity so as not to strain the water supply 

or unnecessarily tap into the water-table. Delfi is careful 

in looking after the availability of this precious resource, 

at every step of the value-chain, so that this ‘balance’ 

in the ecosystem is preserved, soothed and allowed to 

perform its functions for the people in the community 

and the environment at large. We are of the view that 

management of our water access and usage plays a 

significant role in our role as a good corporate citizen.

Management approach 

&lt;103-2&gt; &lt;103-3&gt; 

Policy

Commitments

&amp; Targets

We believe in investing in good environmental housekeeping practices and 

technologies designed to enable sustainable water security for both the 

business and people who depend on water availability in the long-term. 

Our water management policies seek to fully comply with relevant laws and 

regulations.

We are committed to responsible water use across all operations. We seek to 

be fully compliant with all relevant laws and regulations.

In addition, we have the following group-level and facility-level targets:

Practices and performance

&lt;103-3&gt; &lt;303-1&gt;

We seek to ensure that our operations use water responsibly and efficiently. We rely 

on both water supply and groundwater for our needs. When there is a surplus in 

our water storage, we would share this with some of the local community and our 

neighbours.

In 2018, total water used by our units amounted to 246,151m3. On a per metric ton 

basis, the total volume of water used for 2018 was 5.22m3/MT, which was a reduction 

of 32% from prior year. This achievement was largely due to conservation efforts 

and control procedures established to limit unnecessary water use during production 

at our facilities. More notably, our commitment to increase the use of recycled 

wastewater treated by our water treatment plant continues to play a significant part 

in reducing our reliance on natural sources. 

Case Study:

Working towards zero-discharge 

One of our key initiatives included the installation of a 

filter press at our Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) 

which was completed for our Indonesian facility, in July 

2018. With the filter press installed, it helped to enhance 

the effectiveness of removing sediment, oil sludge and 

bacteria. We are continuing to explore various measures 

and technology investment opportunities to improve 

our existing treatment process, so as to increase the 

percentage of wastewater being recycled as well as 

solidify the foundation needed for us to achieve our 

long-term goal of zero water discharge.

TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF 

WASTE AND EFFLUENTS

Significance of impact 

&lt;103-1&gt; 

Waste and effluents management is critical for global 

sustainable development. Proper sanitation, clean 

water and air is important for human health. As part 

of the food processing sector, we understand the 

importance in managing and reducing the waste 

and effluents generated throughout our operations. 

For our communities to prosper and enjoy a high 

quality of life, we have to conscientiously monitor 

our discharge into the environment and seek to 

reduce our ecological impact. It is thus vital to 

prioritise waste disposal methods, such as reusing, 

recycling and recovery that minimise residual 

effects. Treatment of our effluents is also crucial in 

ensuring that hazardous substances do not leach 

into ecosystems and undergo bioamplification along 

the food chain. Managing waste also brings about 

potential cost-savings to our organisation. Looking 

into resource efficiency in our production will enable 

us to create more with less and deliver greater value 

to our stakeholders.

In line with GRI Standards Disclosure 306-1, disclosure of water discharges in this Sustainability Report excludes discharge of collected 

rainwater and domestic sewage

12 

Generally acceptable ranges of our water quality indicators includes Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) below 100 mg/litre, Biochemical 

Oxygen Demand (BOD) below 50 mg/litre, Total Suspended Solids (TSS) below 70 mg/litre, pH of 6.5 to 9.0

Practices and performance

&lt;103-3&gt; &lt;306-1&gt; &lt;306-2&gt;

Effluents

&lt;306-1&gt;

We closely monitor our water discharge11 in both our manufacturing facilities in Indonesia and the 

Philippines. The wastewater from our facilities are biologically treated before being discharged into 

the river. We utilise wastewater quality indicators to measure and ensure that these indicators are in 

generally acceptable ranges12 before discharge into the natural environment.

In 2018, a total volume of 64,824 m3 water was discharged in Indonesia and the Philippines. On a 

per metric ton basis, the total volume of water discharged for 2018 was 1.37 m3/MT, which was a 

16% reduction from prior year. This achievement in the reduction during the year was a result of 

our conscientious and ongoing efforts to use recycled water that has undergone treatment by our 

wastewater treatment plant at our facilities.

Waste

&lt;306-2&gt;

At Delfi, we ensure that our waste is safely disposed to ensure that we do not contaminate our 

environment. All of our waste are managed by authorised waste contractors, which is in line with 

regulatory requirements. These terms, hazardous and non-hazardous waste, are terms used in 

accordance with GRI Standards.

In 2018, the volume of overall waste amounted to 1,486,582 kg in Indonesia and the Philippines. 

On a per metric ton basis, the volume of overall waste for 2018 was 31.50 kg/MT, which was a 29% 

reduction from prior year. This was achieved through close monitoring and a maintenance regime, 

to ensure optimal operating conditions

Non-hazardous waste consisted of typical packaging and production peripherals comprising of 

paper, plastic, and metallic materials. In respect of our non-hazardous waste which made up 95.8% 

of our total waste, 92% was recycled, 4% was accounted for through recovery, 3% was reused and 

the remaining 1% was disposed by contractors in compliance with local regulations.

Hazardous waste relates to waste from our analytical laboratory (e.g. laboratory chemicals) and 

maintenance activities (e.g transformer oil). Our hazardous waste which amounted to 4.2% of our 

total waste, was managed and disposed of in compliance with local regulations by authorised 

waste contractors.

Significance of impact

 &lt;103-1&gt; 

Delfi is a responsible organisation – Through our 

value chain, our resources, materials and products 

move across borders from country to country, on 

a daily basis. Any lapses or failures in compliance 

with import, export and trade regulations would 

directly impact our organisation and may lead to 

socioeconomic, civil or even criminal penalties. 

Non-compliance could also cause significant 

business disruption such as loss of business 

opportunities, custom clearance and shipment 

delays, container abandonment or government 

sequestration. Such disruptions would ripple 

across our organisation – affecting our production 

and delivery schedules, greatly impacting our 

stakeholders across the value chain and our 

brand reputation. On a financial level, these costs 

collectively would have a significant bearing on 

our financial bottom line.

Management approach 

&lt;103-2&gt; &lt;103-3&gt; 

Practices and performance 

 &lt;103-3&gt; 

Our cross-functional teams support one another in ensuring that our approach towards being fully compliant remains robust. We conduct regular internal meetings to 

update each other on any changes to the relevant laws and regulations at the local, national and international level. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic 

and require close monitoring. 

In 2018, there were zero material incidents of non-compliance with applicable import, export and trade regulations.
