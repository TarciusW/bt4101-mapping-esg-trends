Foreword

I am proud of how, through 

our strong and clear sense 

of purpose, we have made 

a positive impact in 2020.

Mike Wells Group Chief Executive, Prudential plc



Our purpose is to help people get the most out 

of life. We deliver on that purpose by making 

healthcare affordable and accessible, helping 

people accumulate wealth through growing their 

assets, and empowering our customers to save 

for their goals. Our ESG strategy is also integral 

to how we fulfil that purpose. 

Throughout 2020 we continued to improve 

the way we work in the interests of all our 

stakeholders, whether they be customers, 

investors, employees, governments, regulators, 

civil society, media or suppliers. We also adopted 

a new ESG strategy, which distils the many ways 

in which we help our stakeholders into three core 

themes, all of which are closely linked to our 

Group strategy and business model:

Making health and financial security 

accessible: Working at scale, we give people 

greater access to good health and financial 

security. Covid-19, the rise in non-communicable 

conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, 

and ageing populations threaten to widen further 

the existing health, protection and savings gaps. 

Behind these megatrends lie countless individual 

stories of people who are anxious and struggling 

because of a lack of access to health and finance. 

We are committed to enabling as many individuals 

as possible in the markets in which we operate to 

make the most of their lives. In particular, we are 

increasing our focus on underserved communities 

and moving beyond our traditional role of financial 

protection to provide services that also prevent 

and postpone ill-health. Pulse, our health and 

wealth super-app now live in 15 markets, is a key 

tool for us in meeting that ambition. Essential, too, 

are the tireless efforts of our colleagues, agents 

and other partners in developing product offerings 

that meet the needs of our diverse customer base. 

Our community investment programmes, focusing 

on education and financial literacy, also have an 

important role to play in building understanding of 

the benefits of financial products, and in building 

financial capabilities to ensure people can make 

informed financial decisions.

Stewarding the human impacts of climate 

change: We are a responsible steward in 

managing the human impact of climate change. 

We are a signatory to the recommendations of 

the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on 

Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), 

and as a significant asset manager and asset owner 

in regions forecast to be severely impacted by 

global warming, Prudential has a distinctive role 

to play in the transition to a low-carbon economy. 

We are decarbonising our investment portfolio and 

actively engaging with policymakers and investee 

businesses to encourage sustainable development. 

The economies of East Asia, where our businesses 

are concentrated, have a greater reliance on 

manufacturing and primary industries than more 

developed markets, where services account for 

a higher proportion of GDP. This means that the 

energy transition across the region is starting from 

a higher carbon intensity level and is likely to 

proceed at a slower pace than for more advanced 

economies. Recognising this, as we support the 

move to a lower-carbon economy in these 

emerging markets, we strive to ensure that the 

transition is an inclusive one for all of society – one 

that supports sustainable growth and economic 

health within our local markets and communities. 

We also recognise the importance of reducing 

the direct impact of our own operations on the 

environment, and we continue to increase our 

level of ambition in relation to our own emissions 

footprint. This year we have set new and stretching 

targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse 

gas emissions, with the aim of becoming net 

carbon neutral across these two scopes by the end 

of 2030. We are in the process of assessing similar 

suitable targets in respect of the carbon emissions 

from our investments. We also seek to apply ESG 

considerations more broadly in our investment 

process and our fiduciary and stewardship duties, 

to ensure that our investment decisions are aligned 

with our values and support our primary focus 

on healthy lives.

Building social capital: We are committed 

to building both our own human capital and 

our social capital with our broader stakeholders. 

We seek to empower people and unlock their 

potential. We do this by promoting diversity 

in representation and thought, and fostering 

a culture of inclusion and a sense of belonging 

within our organisation. Just as Prudential 

depends on the trust of our people, it also needs 

the trust of the external world. As we develop 

our digital capabilities, we need also to prioritise 

digital responsibility throughout our organisation. 

We must always keep in mind that our purpose 

to help people get the most out of life is the reason 

why we are investing purposefully in artificial 

intelligence, big data and other technologies, 

and that focus on the needs and interests of our 

users has to guide us in how we interact with 

them and handle their personal data as our 

capabilities develop.

This report shows how we are fulfilling our 

purpose and delivering on our ESG strategy. 

It shows how, across our business we are working 

to become a more responsible and sustainable 

business. I am proud of how, through our strong 

and clear sense of purpose, we have made a 

positive impact in 2020.

Our purpose is to help people get the most out 

of life. We make healthcare affordable and 

accessible and promote financial inclusion across 

our markets. We protect people’s wealth and 

help them grow their assets, and we empower 

our customers to save for their goals. 

We have a pan-Asian footprint, with our largest 

life and protection operations in Hong Kong, 

Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia as well as 

our joint venture in China. We also operate in 

Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, 

Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar and have a 

successful partnership in India. Since 2014 

we have built a rapidly growing multi-product, 

multi-distribution business in Africa, with 

operations now in eight countries across the 

continent. Starting in 2021 the regional office 

for Africa will be based in Nairobi, making 

East Africa our hub for the continued success 

of operating on the continent.

Our differentiated product portfolio in Asia 

and Africa is well positioned to meet the health, 

protection and savings needs of the region, 

where insurance penetration is low and demand 

for savings solutions is rapidly developing. 

Our trusted brands, digitally enabled multi-

channel distribution and efficient and agile 

infrastructure enable us to meet the growing 

needs of our customers for long-term savings 

and financial security. We will accelerate our 

development of digitally enabled products and 

services to help prevent, postpone and protect 

our customers from threats to their health and 

wellbeing, as well as supporting them to achieve 

their savings goals.

In January 2021, the Board announced that it 

had decided to pursue the separation of Jackson 

from the Group in the first half of 2021 through 

a demerger, whereby shares in Jackson would be 

distributed to Prudential shareholders. The result 

of this separation will be two separately listed 

companies with distinct investment propositions, 

which the Group’s Board believes will lead to 

improved strategic outcomes for both businesses. 

Jackson will continue to help Americans grow 

and protect their retirement savings and income 

to enable them to pursue financial freedom 

for life through its differentiated products, 

well-known brand and industry-leading 

distribution network.

This report provides a summary of 

Prudential plc’s ESG performance. The contents 

meet the ESG ‘comply or explain’ requirements 

under the Rules Governing Listing of Securities 

on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. 

More information on key topics, such as our 

tax strategy, can be found in our regular financial 

reports and standalone reports, available on our 

website. We aim to disclose our ESG management 

and performance as transparently as possible. The 

Board of Prudential plc has approved this report.

Scope of the ESG report 

Information included in this report covers our 

activities in the 2020 calendar year, both at Group 

level and within our various operations globally, 

including Jackson. It does not include our joint 

venture partnerships, unless otherwise stated. 

Content of the ESG report 

We have continued to evaluate which ESG matters 

are most material to the Group, with a focus 

on those that matter most to our stakeholders. 

In 2020, as part of our ESG strategic review 

exercise, we considered and refreshed the 

material ESG issues. This included identifying 

emerging ESG trends, risks and opportunities 

directly applicable to the Group and our 

stakeholders. This informed the development 

of the ESG Strategic Framework. Our 2020 ESG 

report is structured in line with this framework 

and provides an update on our progress in the 

year across each of the pillars and enablers.

This report includes all mandatory ESG reporting 

requirements outlined within the Hong Kong 

Stock Exchange Listing Rules and all ESG general 

disclosures and KPIs in the guidance determined 

to be material, with the exception of A1.3 (Total 

hazardous waste produced and intensity) and 

A2.5 (Total packaging materials used for finished 

products produced), which are not relevant to 

Prudential plc given the nature of the business. 

Where there are laws and regulations in respect 

of matters deemed as material which may have 

a significant impact on Prudential, these are noted 

within the relevant section of this report. For 

example, regulatory and legislative developments 

are increasingly including references to 

climate-related risks and incorporating reporting 

recommendations such as those outlined in 

the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 

Disclosures (TCFD) framework. The Group’s 

governance processes require all businesses 

and functions to demonstrate compliance 

with Group-wide and local regulatory and legal 

requirements as part of the annual controls 

attestation. Further detail on the supervision 

and regulation of the Group is set out in 

Prudential plc’s Form 20-F report for 2020 which 

will be published on Prudential plc’s website.

Selected indicators are assured by Deloitte LLP 

and Deloitte’s assurance statement can be found 

on the Prudential plc website.

STRATEGIC ENABLERS

Our ESG 

Strategic 

Framework

Following our ESG review, we have developed a 

new ESG Strategic Framework (the ‘framework’). 

This framework is fully aligned to our business 

strategy and our purpose of helping people to 

get the most out of life by making healthcare 

accessible and affordable, helping people 

accumulate wealth through growing their assets, 

and empowering our customers to save for 

their goals.

The key features of our ESG framework are its 

three strategic pillars which have clear alignment 

with our business strategy. Within each of these, 

specific differentiating focus areas have been 

identified where it is believed there is an 

opportunity for Prudential to make a meaningful 

impact, and as such greater focus will be placed 

on these differentiators.

Our ESG Strategic Framework / continued

The pillars and differentiators are:

The following strategic enablers support these pillars:

1  Making health and financial 

security accessible

 

— Digital health innovation

 

— Inclusive offerings

 

— Digitally enabled financial literacy

 

— Good governance and 

responsible business practices

2  Stewarding the human impacts 

of climate change 

 

— Decarbonising our 

investment portfolio 

 

— Supporting an inclusive transition

 

— Responsible investment

3  Building social capital

 

— Digital responsibility 

 

— Diversity, inclusion 

and belonging

 

— Community engagement 

and investment

Our 2020 ESG report is structured in line with this framework and provides an update 

on our progress in the year across each of the pillars and enablers.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, 

protect the planet and ensure all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. They are universally recognised and have been globally adopted by corporates 

as a means of articulating and measuring impact. They therefore provide a transparent and standardised mechanism of illustrating our intended outcomes. 

The focus areas of the strategic framework have been aligned to the SDGs. The alignment process focused on those SDGs where the Group can seek, 

over time, to make a meaningful impact because of the close relationship with our purpose and business strategy.

We have aligned with the SDGs at a target-level for the following goals and intended outcomes

SDG

SDG target

Intended outcome

1 No poverty

 1.4, 1.5

Increased access to quality healthcare services, and financial services for the poor and the underserved,

Our ESG Strategic Framework / continued

Development of the ESG Strategic Framework

In line with good practice, the framework was 

developed following a rigorous analysis process, 

which identified key ESG stakeholder 

expectations from investors, rating agencies, 

government and regulators, stock exchanges, 

NGOs, industry and independent organisations, 

media and employees. This approach was taken to 

ensure that the framework ascertained the most 

material issues, considered as broad a spectrum of 

stakeholders as possible, and was tested robustly 

from their perspectives. The process also 

considered upcoming regulation to shape a view 

of expectations, emerging policy and peer themes 

to direction of travel, noting that this is a rapidly 

evolving area. This comprehensive internal and 

external stakeholder engagement informed the 

materiality assessment for the purposes of our 

2020 ESG reporting. The Section 172 Statement 

below provides information on stakeholder 

engagement throughout the year, which was 

considered within the development of the 

ESG Strategic Framework where relevant.

Through this analysis, the three strategic pillars, 

plus the differentiators and enablers, were 

identified and defined at a high level. These 

proposals were discussed with a number of 

stakeholders across the Group in order to ensure 

our ESG strategy was fully integrated into 

the business, and to test and validate the proposed 

framework. This stakeholder group included 

those responsible for ESG and responsible 

investment-related activities within the business 

units, along with function leads (eg HR, Digital, 

Risk), business unit CEOs, the Group Executive 

Committee, and Board members.

The Strategic Framework was formally 

reviewed by the Group ESG Committee and 

then considered by the Group Nomination &amp; 

Governance Committee, which recommended 

it to the Group Board, which formally approved 

it in December 2020. 

Oversight of ESG

ESG is overseen by the Board, which is responsible 

for determining strategy and prioritisation of 

key focus areas. In order to provide greater senior 

executive involvement and holistic oversight 

of ESG matters material to the Group, in 2020 

a Group ESG Committee was established, 

superseding the previous ESG Executive 

Committee. The Committee is chaired by the 

Group Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating 

Officer, in his role as ESG sponsor. Membership 

of the Committee includes the Group Chief Risk 

and Compliance Officer, the Group HR Director, 

and senior representatives from the Group’s asset 

owner and asset management business units, 

including, from 1 January 2021, the Chief 

Executives of Eastspring and PACS (Prudential’s 

Singapore business). One of the Group ESG 

Committee’s responsibilities is to oversee the 

Group’s progress towards fulfilling 

our commitment to report against the 

recommendations of the Financial Stability 

Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial 

Disclosures (TCFD). 

In 2020, the Group ESG Committee reported 

to the Board through the Group Nomination &amp; 

Governance Committee. The Board recognises 

that the next 12 to 18 months will be critical for 

the embedding of the ESG Strategic Framework 

within the Group, as well as for the progress of 

related matters such as the development and 

embedding of the Group’s purpose and values, 

progressing diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) 

priorities, and building upon employee 

engagement activities. Therefore, in early 

2021 the Board established a Responsibility 

&amp; Sustainability Working Group, to be chaired 

by Alice Schroeder and comprising four 

Non-executive Directors, in order to ensure 

an appropriate level of Board engagement in, 

and oversight of, these matters during this 

critical period. 

Our Group Governance Manual (GGM) sets out 

the policies and procedures by which the Group 

operates. It establishes standards for managing 

possible ESG issues across the Group. The GGM 

is subject to a formal content review each year, 

taking into consideration both internal and 

external factors.

As part of the Governance, Risk Management 

&amp; Internal Control – Annual Statement of 

Compliance certification, all businesses across 

the Group assess their compliance position 

against each of the requirements set out in the 

Group Code of Business Conduct, Policies and 

Delegated Authorities. Any instances of GGM 

non-compliance identified by the businesses 

through their annual attestation are assessed 

by the Group policy owners and reported to 

the Group Audit Committee.

To ensure we treat our customers fairly, management of conduct risks is key. Prudential mitigates 

conduct risk with robust controls, which are identified and assessed through the Group’s conduct risk 

assessment framework, and regularly tested within its monitoring programmes. The Group Customer 

Conduct Risk Policy provides this framework and includes our Customer Conduct Standards, which set 

out the core values and standards that the Group expects all employees and persons acting on behalf of 

it to observe, and which further support our ESG strategy. These values and standards include specific 

requirements regarding customers. In particular, the Group has committed to:

 

— Treat customers fairly;

 

— Provide and promote products and services that meet customer needs, are clearly  

explained and deliver real value;

 

— Maintain the confidentiality of our customer information;

 

— Provide and promote high standards of customer service; and 

 

— Act fairly and in a timely way to address customer complaints and any errors we find.

Asset management businesses and insurance businesses (as asset owners) have distinct risks, including 

investing in different markets and asset classes; therefore, each business manages ESG-related matters 

through the pursuit of business-specific responsible investment policies. This is supported by our Group 

Code of Business Conduct and is underpinned by our Group-wide Responsible Investment Standards.

Our Environment Policy outlines our approach to understanding and managing the direct environmental 

impact of the Group. This covers our measurement, monitoring, review and reporting of issues 

associated with our environmental performance.

Our Diversity and Inclusion Policy reflects our aspiration and aims to promote employee diversity and 

provide equal opportunities to all who apply for and those who perform work at every level of our 

organisation. The policy promotes diversity irrespective of sex, race, age, ethnic origin, social and 

cultural background, marital or civil partnership status, pregnancy, maternity and paternity, any gender 

reassignment, religion or belief, sexual orientation, disability, or part-time/fixed-term working 

arrangements, and seeks to ensure appropriate diversity of experience, skill sets and professional 

backgrounds. Further information on the diversity of our Board, our policy in respect of this, how this 

is implemented and the associated results in 2020 can be found in the Governance Statement in our 

2020 Annual Report.

Our Employee Relations Policy outlines the way we engage with our employees and motivate them 

to achieve success for the Group: promoting positive relationships with employees, representative 

organisations and trade unions.

Our Performance and Learning Policy sets out the importance of our people and frames how we 

invest in their development to deliver against our strategy and the future success of the organisation. 

This includes our Performance Management Framework.

Our Remuneration Policy outlines our effective approach to appropriately rewarding our employees in a 

way that aligns incentives to business objectives and performance, and enables the recruitment, retention 

and incentivisation of high-calibre employees in line with our risk appetite and Group Reward Principles.

Our Talent Policy demonstrates how we attract, select and develop the best people for roles that will 

ensure high performance in the short term and future-proof leadership capability through building 

business-relevant longer-term succession and talent pipelines. It sets out our fair and effective approach 

to pursuing this.

Our Privacy Policy governs the protection of data and complies with the General Data Protection 

Regulation. Our Global Information Security Policy supports our global approach to security and 

our commitment to protecting the data entrusted to us by customers.

The Group Code of Business Conduct sits at the heart of our Group Governance Manual, and highlights 

the ethical standards that the Board expects of itself, our employees, our agents and others working 

on behalf of the Group. The Code is supported by a set of Group-wide principles and values that define 

how the Group expects business to be conducted in order to achieve its strategic objectives. 

Our Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy covers our values for reputation, ethical behaviour 

and reliability. As an organisation we are focused on financial practices that align to those values 

and we prohibit corruption or bribery within our working practices.

Our Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Policy outlines how we prohibit money laundering 

or terrorist financing in our working practices, setting out how we establish parameters to prevent 

this taking place across the organisation and the commitment we have to comply with sanctions, 

laws and regulations by screening, prohibiting or restricting business activity, and following up 

through investigation.

Our Security Policy outlines our commitment to ensuring that security aligns to industry-recommended 

practice for managing our regulatory and legal obligations. This includes how we manage incidents 

under the Speak Out programme, our whistleblowing process.

Our Tax Risk Policy includes our processes to manage tax-related risk, by identifying, measuring, 

controlling and reporting on issues considered an operational, reputational or regulatory risk.

Our Political Donations Policy outlines our position that as an organisation we do not donate to political 

parties. This is defined as covering any political party or candidate or any other organisation that 

attempts to affect support for any political party. It is defined as covering any payment or gift or 

contribution, direct or indirect, as defined by the UK’s Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act

Engaging with 

our stakeholders 

During 2020 we engaged with our various 

stakeholder groups closely, as set out below.

Customers

The Group’s purpose is to help people get the 

most out of life. We do this by making health and 

financial security accessible and affordable, 

protecting people’s wealth and growing their 

assets. The needs of our customers are therefore 

central to what we do.

We engage directly with our customers through 

contact centres, dedicated account managers, sales 

support units, business processing and servicing, 

face-to-face advice (where possible), mobile phone 

apps and telephone technical support teams. The 

development of our digital proposition, specifically 

our digital health app, Pulse by Prudential, has 

enabled us to give our customers a greater range 

of services, including through partnerships with 

others. We are attracting a younger demographic 

and are able to respond quickly to emerging 

needs. For example, we responded to the 

pandemic by providing free, limited-time Covid-19 

cover for new or existing customers or Pulse users 

in a number of markets. The Board has actively 

discussed and supported the evolution of the 

digital strategy throughout 2020.

Investors

The Group has continued to maintain an open 

dialogue with investors to ensure that investors’ 

perspectives and concerns are considered in 

the Board’s decision-making. During 2020, 

Executive Directors attended over 150 meetings, 

conferences and events with investors, discussing 

topics including the Group’s strategy, financial 

performance and future development. In addition, 

the former Chair, Paul Manduca, carried out 10 

meetings with investors. The current Chair, in her 

then capacity as Chair-elect and Non-executive 

Director, has attended over 25 meetings with 

international and UK-based investors both during 

her introduction to the business and as part of 

ongoing investor engagement. These investors 

included large current investors as well as previous 

holders, but also included smaller institutional 

groups with specific matters to discuss, such as the 

Group’s engagement with ESG and technology. 

The Board receives regular updates from the 

Group Investor Relations team on the Group’s 

continuing wider engagement with investors.

The scope of discussions focused on the Group’s 

strategy, in particular shareholder views on the 

question of whether and when to pursue the 

separation of Jackson and focus on the Asian and 

African businesses, and Board succession. The 

perspectives gained from these meetings, and the 

need for broad investor support, were considered 

by the Board when making key strategic decisions 

and communicating those decisions to the market.

Our people

Ongoing employee engagement is one of the 

critical factors to ensure successful delivery of the 

Group’s strategic objectives and the Board is keen 

to increase its focus in this important area. In 2019, 

the Board expanded the role of two Non-executive 

Directors to include responsibility for employee 

engagement: Kai Nargolwala covers our businesses 

in Asia and Africa, and Tom Watjen is responsible 

for our UK and US workforce. Kai Nargolwala and 

Tom Watjen discharged their duties through a 

range of interactions with staff during 2020.

Culture

 

— During 2020, the Group reaffirmed our culture and articulated a renewed purpose, which is to help people get the most out 

of life. We aspire to a culture that is purpose-led, customer-focused and digitally-savvy. Living the culture around this purpose 

contributes to our success, sustainable growth, and ability to do the right thing for all stakeholders, including customers, 

colleagues, shareholders, regulators and society at large. The Board discussed progress in this area in February, April and 

July 2020.

 

— Our people bring our culture to life by living the Company’s values. The May 2020 employee survey found that employees 

are strongly positive about these values, with 83 per cent of respondents identifying favourably with being empathetic, nimble, 

courageous, curious and ambitious. In September 2020, we hosted a three-day virtual Collaboration Jam that saw our people 

come together to define the mindsets and behaviours that embody each value. The values will serve as the basis for peer 

feedback, which will be incorporated into annual appraisals

Covid-19 and wellbeing

 

— While the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded at different times and with varying levels of impact across the footprint of the Group, 

all parts of the business were devoted to ensuring the physical, emotional and social health and safety of our people, taking into 

account employee preferences during this time. Our response to the pandemic and the ways in which we have protected our 

people have been a theme across the Board’s discussions during 2020. The Remuneration Committee also received an update 

on this topic in September 2020.

 

— All of our businesses have run regular sessions to support the physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing of our people. 

Mental health provision has been strengthened in a number of our insurer benefit arrangements.

 

— The Collaboration Jam and employee survey earlier in the year highlighted the challenges of remote working and work-life 

balance during the Covid-19 pandemic. To coincide with World Mental Health Day, we held our first global wellbeing day 

in October. This consisted of a series of online sessions across all time-zones, including a session in which our leaders shared 

their own stories about the mental health challenges that they have faced. Jackson and our London office have offered regular 

sessions on different aspects of wellbeing and stress management. 

Organisational change

 

— The last 12 months have seen tremendous external challenges and significant changes within the organisation.  

Board members have received regular briefings about the planned changes and what they mean for our people.

 

— While this has naturally been a time of some uncertainty and strain for our people, the Group has supported employees 

through both the pandemic and the restructuring activity taking place in Jackson and London head office, communicating 

regularly and clearly and prioritising the fair treatment of all our employees.

Regulators

Since the demerger of M&amp;G plc, the Group has 

been subject to the consolidated supervision 

of the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (IA) as 

Prudential’s Group-wide supervisor. We have 

engaged with the Hong Kong IA on a regular basis, 

with the Directors meeting with the regulator on 

a periodic basis and sharing an agreed range of 

management information. In September 2020 

Mike Wells, Mark FitzPatrick, James Turner and 

Nic Nicandrou presented to the Regulatory 

College of Supervisors on the Group’s strategy 

and key business initiatives. The Board also 

considered and responded to feedback received 

from the College following its conclusion. 

The Hong Kong IA applies principles and 

standards to the Group through existing 

requirements to ensure that we are a fit and 

proper controller of regulated insurance 

companies. The Hong Kong IA’s principles include 

financial integrity, effective corporate governance 

and sound risk management. We undertook a 

gap analysis of the Group’s policies and processes 

against Hong Kong IA requirements for the 

proposed GWS framework.

Governments and wider society

During 2020, a number of key points emerged 

from our engagements with governments and 

legislatures, but the most pressing concern has 

been how we cooperate with our governmental 

stakeholders in response to the global health 

crisis. Covid-19 has underlined the importance 

of working together with governments and our 

communities to increase life and health insurance 

penetration to protect individuals and families. 

We continue to work with governments, 

regulators and politicians on ways to close this 

gap. With the roll-out of Pulse, we have increased 

our engagement with policymakers on health 

systems, health financing and the role of 

technology across our markets. In Hong Kong, 

we have been actively advocating for a digital 

health strategy framework to the city’s top 

policymaker in collaboration with the local 

business community. Our vision is to establish 

a digital health ecosystem for the city and the 

Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay 

Area. During 2020, we have also engaged with 

policy, regulatory and political stakeholders on 

COP26 and related themes such as inclusion, the 

need for a just and inclusive energy transition and 

the role of private finance in improving responsible 

investment frameworks.

We respond to ad hoc requests from NGOs and 

hold meetings with them throughout the year. 

During 2020, many of our stakeholders were 

concerned with the impact of Covid-19 on the 

communities in which we operate. In response 

to the pandemic, we launched a $2.5 million 

Covid-19 relief fund to help support vulnerable 

communities and provide medical equipment 

to hospitals and clinics in Asia. The Prudence 

Foundation partnered with the IFRC and NatGeo 

to rapidly develop a Safe Steps Covid-19 campaign 

in response to the pandemic earlier this year. 

The campaign was distributed across networks 

in Asia and Africa. 

Suppliers

Each of our critical suppliers has a nominated 

contact within Prudential, and we meet those 

suppliers on a regular basis to address concerns 

on both sides. We wish to treat our suppliers fairly 

so we both mutually benefit from our relationship. 

As an example, at the Group’s head office in 

London, to support our supply chain through the 

difficult trading circumstances triggered by the 

global pandemic, we provided payment assistance 

from March 2020. We immediately switched to 

10-day payment terms for all our London head 

office small suppliers with under 100 employees. 

This has so far benefited 136 suppliers with a total 

of £6 million of accelerated payments made to 

assist their cash flow. On an annual basis, the 

Board reviews our approach to addressing 

Modern Slavery in our supply chain.

1  Strategic Pillar:  

Making health and  

financial security accessible

We pursue with ambition the closure of the health, 

protection and savings gaps in Asia and Africa. 

We see this as core to our purpose to help people 

to get the most out of life – by making people 

healthier and wealthier. We are committed to 

closing these gaps by improving the health and 

financial wellbeing of those who interact with us, 

generating positive behavioural change towards 

healthier lives, and increasing access to healthcare 

for all. 

To do this we focus on: digital health innovation – 

to promote inclusion through affordability and 

accessibility, and healthier outcomes for those 

we interact with; inclusive offerings – to increase 

penetration in underserved populations, and 

bring diversity to our product offering, reflective 

of our customer base; and digitally enabled 

financial literacy – to build trust and understanding 

of protection benefits and options, and wider 

savings and digital capabilities. In doing this 

we support our customers to prevent, postpone 

and protect against ill-health. 

Digital health innovation

As a leading health insurer in Asia, we are evolving 

from providing protection to playing a role in 

the prevention and postponement of ill-health. 

To make this happen, we believe that the adoption 

of digital technology at scale is vital. 

Pulse by Prudential, our health and wealth 

super-app, is a core part of our strategy to make 

health and wellness accessible and affordable. 

Using AI-powered tools and personalised 

services, Pulse, which is free to download, 

empowers people to take control of their personal 

health, anytime and anywhere. The app has been 

downloaded around 20 million times in Asia and 

Africa, as of February 2021.

Initially launched in Malaysia in 2019, Pulse is 

now available across 15 markets in Asia and Africa, 

with relevant services available in local languages. 

Across our markets, the Pulse offering continues 

to evolve as we grow our local health and 

technology partners. Covid-19 has accelerated 

the impact of Pulse by Prudential, increasing the 

demand for digital health tools and for healthcare 

services that can be accessed remotely. 

More information on the roll-out of Pulse and 

our digital health response to Covid-19 is available 

on page 19.

We are committed to developing Pulse into 

an end-to-end health and wellness platform 

integrating primary care, wellness and chronic 

disease management. We work collaboratively 

with a range of partners to provide value-added 

services and subscription plans across the health 

and wellness spectrum to all users. To date, 

Pulse has integrated 32 local and regional 

partners. Our partnership with Halodoc in 

Indonesia enables us to provide a range of 

telemedicine services through Pulse, including 

consulting with doctors online and purchasing 

and arranging the delivery of prescriptions. 

We are also partnering with Naluri, a Malaysian 

health tech start-up, to enhance our food 

journaling user experience within Pulse. 

This partnership will enable users in the region 

to access dieticians, helping users plan a healthy 

and balanced diet, contributing to their 

wellness goals.

We recognise the importance of building trust in 

the markets where we operate. We have worked 

with health ministries and insurance regulators 

to understand the local health and financial 

landscape and the challenges we can help to 

address. We have also used local epidemiology 

to understand common health concerns in the 

region. For example, in Thailand, specific prompts 

and questions have been built into our symptom 

checker in recognition of the fact that many 

common diseases are related to poor water quality 

or source contamination. We have also worked 

with public hospitals and doctors to gain insights, 

which helps us to triage Pulse users appropriately.

Our Pulse app was awarded ‘Technology Initiative 

of the Year’ at the Asia Insurance Industry Awards 

2020. Pulse was also recognised by the UK 

government for its positive impact in South-east 

Asia. The Foreign, Commonwealth and 

Development Office has included Pulse in its 

‘Great for Partnership’ initiative, a campaign 

to promote the best of the UK overseas.

As we continue to develop Pulse, we have 

embraced agile ways of working, exemplified 

by the use of ‘hot houses’. During these intense 

workshops, a wide range of employees from 

across the Group with different skills and expertise 

collaborate to explore new ideas, design and 

implement solutions to deploy into our Pulse app 

within days, providing immediate benefits to 

Pulse users. 

Supporting the development of mobile health 

The successful adoption of digital health tools 

like Pulse is dependent upon the accessibility 

and acceptance of mobile and digital health tools. 

We therefore work with a range of stakeholders in 

the markets where we operate to understand the 

challenges and opportunities associated with the 

development of mobile health in local markets.

Our recent report, The Health of Asia Barometer, 

underscores the unprecedented opportunity 

offered by digital health technologies to improve 

access to healthcare in Asia. The report, published 

by The Economist Intelligence Unit, explores 

attitudes to healthcare in Asia, highlighting the 

demand for tools and services to help people 

in the region better navigate the healthcare 

system. The report, which surveyed 5,000 adults 

across 13 markets, highlighted consumer appetite 

towards the digitisation of health.

— 54 per cent believe that medical care is 

accessible and affordable;

 

— 81 per cent say technology has already 

improved their access to health services; and

 

— 71 per cent will rely on technology even 

more heavily to improve personal health 

and wellbeing.

To fulfil the potential of digital healthcare, 

the report recommends greater public-private 

collaboration, suggesting that governments 

partner with private companies to deliver digitally 

innovative ways to promote and manage health 

and wellness among citizens.

In 2020, we expanded our Singapore-based 

PRUFintegrate initiative to include our global 

and regional teams and seven other Prudential 

business units. The PRUFintegrate initiative is a 

partner network of fintech, insurtech, healthtech 

and medtech companies. We received a total of 

99 entries, and evaluated solutions from fintech 

companies based in Asia, Europe and Africa. 

Our focus in 2020 was on artificial intelligence, 

as well as the health, wealth and SME ecosystems 

on Pulse. This global outreach was made possible 

through the APIX platform that was set up by the 

Monetary Authority of Singapore, the ASEAN 

Bankers Association and the World Bank Group’s 

International Finance Corporation. 

In the Philippines, we continue to support the 

development of mobile digital health solutions. 

Following our 2019 white paper exploring 

the current legal and regulatory framework for 

mobile health in the Philippines, we launched the 

‘Healthscape Dialogue Series’ during 2020. This 

seeks to build a multi-stakeholder platform to discuss 

the most pressing topics in Philippine healthcare, 

providing an important forum for industry players 

across sectors to come together and discuss how to 

improve the access of more Filipinos to affordable 

and quality healthcare services. Webinars over 

the course of 2020 have covered the use of AI 

and mobile technology, preventative healthcare 

and telemedicine. We also partnered with the 

Analytics Association of the Philippines to provide 

a webinar on digital transformation in life insurance 

and the role of big data in achieving financial 

inclusion and better health for more Filipinos.

Inclusive offerings

As part of our commitment to making health 

and financial security accessible, we recognise 

the importance of increasing penetration in the 

markets where we operate, providing products 

and services to previously underserved 

populations. By bringing diversity to our product 

offering, we will be able to better reflect the needs 

of our customer base, and integrate any lifestyle 

impacts from emerging social risks associated with 

major public health and demographic trends into 

our product offering. This will include, but not 

be limited to, lower-income groups, ageing 

populations, small and medium-sized enterprises 

and sharia offerings.

Demographics are changing in a number of our 

markets. In response to Thailand’s rapidly ageing 

population, Prudential Thailand has launched 

PRUTriple Eight (PRU888), a life insurance plan 

that allows for effective financial planning at 

every stage of a person’s life. Based on the latest 

projections by the United Nations Population 

Fund, Thailand will fully transition into an aged 

society by 2021, with the number of senior citizens 

aged 60 and above expected to make up 

20 per cent of the total population. As a result, 

the country will face emergent issues concerning 

social security, healthcare costs and 

intergenerational equity in a far shorter time 

than developed nations. This rapid speed of 

ageing calls for appropriate response, policies 

and programmes to help resolve the issues. 

The PRU888 plan provides financial security to 

customers including death benefits as well as 

accidental death coverage where we will pay 

eight times the normal death benefit up to age 88 

while providing annual cashback and a maturity 

benefit at age 88.

Prudential Indonesia continues to innovate 

to provide affordable financial protection for 

Indonesians by launching Asuransi Jiwa Kumpulan 

Syariah PRUTect Care (PRUTect Care), Prudential 

Indonesia’s first digital product available on 

our health and wealth super-app, Pulse. As a 

sharia-based offering, PRUTect Care provides 

basic natural death benefit coverage, as well 

as various optional benefits, for a monthly 

contribution as low as Rp8,000 (US$0.50). 

To protect more Indonesians, Prudential 

collaborated with digital partners Gadjian 

and Kitabisa.com to offer PRUTect Care. 

In 2020, Prudential Indonesia launched Asuransi 

Jiwa Ayariah PRUCinta (PRUCinta), its first 

sharia-based traditional life insurance product. 

A simple and affordable product, PRUCinta 

provides optimised death compensation benefits 

covering a period of 20 years. PRUCinta shows 

Prudential Indonesia’s aspirations to become 

a leading contributor to the Indonesian sharia 

industry and to expand life insurance coverage 

to a broader segment of the population.

In response to outbreaks of dengue fever, 

a mosquito-borne viral disease, across South-east 

Asia, our businesses in Thailand, Cambodia and 

Singapore have all launched affordable insurance 

plans to provide customers with cover for dengue 

fever. Prudential Thailand launched its first digital 

insurance plan, ‘PRUDengue’, in partnership 

with AIS, a leading telecom operator in Thailand’s 

mobile network. AIS customers can purchase 

PRUDengue via Pulse, launched by Prudential 

Thailand in June. Dengue fever has impacted 

nearly one million people in Thailand over the 

last 10 years. PRUDengue is an all-round and 

affordable insurance plan to support the insured 

with a lump-sum payout. PRUDengue’s basic 

package, with an annual premium at THB249 

(US$8), provides total benefits of up to THB70,000 

(US$2,332). Applicants are not required to 

complete any health or income check for this plan.

Prudential Cambodia has also launched an 

affordable insurance solution for dengue fever 

and malaria. With an annual premium of US$4, 

the product is Prudential Cambodia’s first 

micro-insurance offering and demonstrates 

Prudential Cambodia’s ambition to making 

insurance accessible to all Cambodians. With over 

34,000 cases of dengue fever in Singapore during 

2020, Prudential Singapore launched its affordable 

insurance plan, PRUSafe Dengue, on Pulse. 

For a premium of S$5, PRUSafe Dengue provides 

a number of benefits over a three-month period. 

In the Philippines, we have also begun to develop 

bite-sized offerings to help increase insurance 

penetration and to target specific protection needs 

of the market. Initial offerings include dengue 

cover and a breast cancer product. 

In December, Prudential Singapore introduced 

the  Spark Kindness Movement. The movement 

aims to narrow the protection gap by providing 

underprivileged families with financial support 

in the event of accidental death. For every 

PRUActive Protect or PRUCancer 360 policy 

sold in December, we provided a complimentary 

two-year Accidental Death Insurance Coverage 

of S$10,000 to a parent of a low-income family 

supported by our community partner, AMKFSC 

Community Services Limited. This coverage 

provides hope to the children of these families 

by giving them the means to continue their 

education. A total of 3,022 individuals from 

these families received complimentary coverage 

through the Spark Kindness Movement 

and Prudential Singapore plans to extend this 

programme in the future to benefit more 

underserved populations.

In Taiwan, we offer a micro-insurance policy 

to a non-profit, the Taiwan Fund for Children 

and Families, to support disadvantaged families 

and children. During 2020 this policy has helped 

support 284 families. Our Taiwan life business, 

PCA Life Assurance, continues to address child 

protection issues and in November launched its 

Child Health white paper, to advocate for child 

health and protection in Taiwan. PCA Life worked 

with the Research Centre of Big Data at Taipei 

Medical University to conduct research and 

analysis into the factors that affect child growth.

In Malaysia, our CSR initiative, PRUKasih, provides 

free temporary financial relief to urban low-income 

families coping with a sudden loss of income due 

to illness, accident or death. Since this programme 

started in 2014, more than RM10 million 

(∼US$2.5 million) has been paid out in claims, and 

during 2020, we supported 40,429 households 

across 35 communities with PRUKasih. To help 

PRUKasih communities mitigate the effects of the 

pandemic, we provided free Covid-19 coverage 

whereby a cash payment would be made in the 

event of hospitalisation and/or death. 

Also in Malaysia, PruBSN Microtakaful Jariyah 

provided basic microtakaful coverage to 25,000 

underprivileged families during the year. This 

initiative is the first of its kind in Malaysia and 

provides complimentary basic takaful coverage 

for a 12-month term to selected heads of the 

household from low-income groups. Beneficiaries 

receive RM10,000 (∼US$2,500) in the event that 

their family breadwinner passes away.

In Ghana, we have collaborated with leading 

industry partners to deliver an innovative mobile 

insurance plan, SafeNet, to new customers. 

The partnership between Prudential Ghana, 

Vodafone, MicroEnsure and Enterprise will offer 

Ghanaians key insurance benefits, including cover 

for hospital cash compensation, accidental injuries 

or disabilities, and general life insurance. We have 

teamed up with Enterprise as co-underwriters for 

SafeNet, a new mobile insurance product that 

offers an easy way of buying flexible insurance. 

Vodafone, Ghana’s second-largest mobile 

network operator, is using a platform developed 

by MicroEnsure to distribute SafeNet to Vodafone 

subscribers. In line with our commitment to help 

limit the economic impact on customers of 

Covid-19, SafeNet will be offered to more than 

nine million Vodafone subscribers as free 

insurance cover in the first half of 2021.

Helping to upskill small businesses 

In November 2020, Prudential Singapore brought 

together 80 small and medium-sized enterprises 

(SMEs) across 50 industries and a government 

agency – SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) – to 

co-create the SME Skills Accelerator programme. 

This one-year programme is part of Prudential 

Singapore’s value-added services for SMEs 

to help them upskill and support them in their 

innovation efforts. SMEs are entitled to curated 

training programmes that are subsidised by SSG 

on topics such as design thinking, digital 

transformation and workplace learning. As part 

of the programme, SMEs get to join a network of 

like-minded people to share best practices and 

improve processes. SMEs are also connected to 

a dedicated skills manager who advises on the 

SMEs’ upskilling needs. 

Recognising the significant impact of the Covid-19 

pandemic on micro, small and medium enterprises 

(MSMEs), Prudential Indonesia has supported 

MSMEs across Indonesia by holding a series of 

financial literacy training webinars, in partnership 

with AKUMANDIRI, SMESCO and the Tangan 

di Atas Community. The initiative includes 

a series of webinar sessions delivered by experts 

from Prudential Indonesia, covering key financial 

literacy topics including the importance of 

financial management, business capital, 

developing business strategies, and cash flow 

management for business entities.

Promoting financial literacy 

The promotion of financial literacy is a priority for 

Prudential and we actively seek to build trust and 

improve understanding of protection benefits and 

options. In doing this we support our customers to 

prevent, postpone and protect against ill-health. 

Financial literacy is a key focus area for Prudence 

Foundation. More information on the broader

Cha-Ching – a global financial 

education programme

Developed by Prudential to address the gap in 

financial literacy for children, Cha-Ching is a global 

financial education and responsibility programme 

aimed at children aged seven to 12. Now in its 

10th year, the programme continues to grow and 

expand across our markets and is well received 

by educators, parents, children and government 

stakeholders. We continue to develop a blended 

learning approach to financial literacy, leveraging 

digital tools and platforms as well as the school 

environment. Our aim is to ensure that Cha-Ching 

is accessible and available to millions of children, 

parents and teachers across the world for free, 

providing them with the right foundations in 

financial literacy.

The Cha-Ching Curriculum was developed in 

partnership with Junior Achievement (JA), and 

has been successfully implemented in Asia for 

five years through strong partnerships with 

NGOs and governments in eight markets: 

the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, 

Taiwan, Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand. 

To date, more than 15,000 teachers have been 

trained to deliver the Cha-Ching Curriculum 

in schools, with over 600,000 primary school 

students having been taught the lessons of earn, 

save, spend and donate. 

The Cha-Ching Curriculum school 

implementation programme has also expanded 

into Africa, and in 2020 Prudence Foundation 

extended its partnership with JA in Africa, to teach 

the Cha-Ching Curriculum to primary school 

students across six countries: Kenya, Ghana, 

Zambia, Nigeria, Uganda and Côte d’Ivoire over 

the next three years. By adopting the proven 

teacher-led model for Cha-Ching, which has seen 

success in Asia, we will similarly work to improve 

financial literacy in Africa, in a sustainable and 

scalable way. 

In Asia, the Cha-Ching cartoons continue to be 

broadcast on Cartoon Network, reaching over 

31 million households every day. Cha-Ching 

content is also accessed online via the website and 

through digital channels including social media, 

with over 86 million views to date.

In an effort to increase the reach and impact 

of Cha-Ching, we also introduced several new 

digital initiatives in 2020. These have supported 

the broader reach of Cha-Ching, particularly 

in the Covid-19 environment, which has limited 

in-person teaching, and these are intended to 

continue into 2021:

 

—  The Cha-Ching Kid$ At Home programme, 

aimed at parents, was launched amidst the 

backdrop of Covid-19. Available for free 

online, this consists of guides and at-home 

activities providing families with an engaging 

and interactive way to teach financial literacy 

at home. A digital media campaign was 

launched to raise awareness, reaching more 

than 3.7 million people via social media. 

The educational resources have been actively 

promoted by Prudential businesses through 

social media campaigns and public webinars 

and have been viewed or downloaded over 

25,000 times via the Cha-Ching website. 

In Singapore, Indonesia and Myanmar, 

employee volunteers have also been trained 

to deliver the Cha-Ching Curriculum online 

through webinars. 

 

— In September 2020, Prudence Foundation 

introduced the online Cha-Ching Financial 

Accreditation (CCFA), to acknowledge and 

support the teacher community working to 

deliver the Cha-Ching Curriculum in schools 

across Asia. The CCFA platform was launched 

in the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam 

and will expand to further markets in 2021. 

This online assessment is endorsed by 

education authorities and was developed in 

alignment with the OECD Core Competencies 

Framework on Financial Literacy for Youth 

and the ASEAN Teachers Competency 

Framework. To date, over 4,000 teachers 

have registered and 2,400 have completed 

the CCFA online course. 

 

— In the Philippines, Prudence Foundation and 

JA have worked closely with the Department 

of Education (DepEd) to incorporate 

Cha-Ching into the national distance learning 

approach implemented in response to 

Covid-19. Cha-Ching printed materials will be 

distributed to over 157,000 students at home, 

supplemented by online teaching where 

possible. Cha-Ching lessons will also be 

broadcast via TV and radio as part of DepEd’s 

implementation, expected to reach over 

56,000 students.

 

— Cha-Ching videos and parent resources have 

been made available for free on the Pulse by 

Prudential app in Singapore with expansion 

into other markets expected in 2021.

In the US, the Jackson Charitable Foundation has 

reached more than eight million students since 

2017 by partnering with Discovery Education and 

Junior Achievement USA. We provide free music 

videos and classroom and at-home activities with 

Cha-Ching Money Smart Kids to teach elementary 

school students how to earn, save, spend and 

donate. The demand for virtual financial education 

continues to increase, with Cha-Ching Money 

Smart Kids seeing record engagement in 2020. 

The Jackson Charitable Foundation has also 

sponsored 500 high schools to use Ramsey 

Education’s Foundations in Personal Finance 

curriculum for the 2020-21 school year, at no cost 

to the schools. Since this partnership began in 

2018, the Foundation has committed $2.7 million 

toward financial education for high school 

students across the country, reaching 100,000 

students in total.

In Malaysia, in line with our commitment to uplift 

PRUKasih communities and build their financial 

resilience, we introduced education programmes 

focused on financial planning. We also rolled out 

the PRUKasih Entrepreneurship Programme 

to equip participants with entrepreneurial skills 

and knowledge. To foster greater collaboration 

between the public and private sectors on 

financial empowerment through education, 

we launched a five-part webinar series, featuring 

a range of panellists, including Malaysia’s Central 

Bank, Bank Negara Malaysia. The webinar series 

included topics such as the state of financial 

education in the country and the creation of 

a unified financial literacy curriculum.

#MoneyParenting

During 2020, our Asian asset manager, Eastspring, 

launched its #MoneyParenting initiative. 

Following a survey of 10,000 parents across nine 

Asian markets, we found that 51 per cent of 

parents in Asia do not know if they have been 

successful teachers and role models for their 

children. Recognising that parents pass on their 

attitudes and beliefs about finance to children, 

Eastspring is aiming to help parents become 

better role models and to provide them with the 

knowledge, skills and tools to effectively teach 

their children about money and plan for their 

future. When asked what help they wanted 

in order to teach their child how to use and 

manage money better, 43 per cent of parents 

across Asia said they wanted to learn more about 

financial management themselves. In response 

to the survey and its findings, Eastspring has 

launched a dedicated microsite on its website, 

providing tools and resources for parents to 

empower them as they are teaching their children 

about the financial and social responsibilities that 

come with money.

Pulse roll-out  

and digital 

health initiatives 

We have provided some examples 

to illustrate how we have begun to 

roll-out Pulse across our businesses. 

Our Pulse offering continues to 

develop as we work collaboratively 

with a range of partners to provide 

value-added services and subscription 

plans across the health and wellness 

spectrum to all users. As we design 

these services, we consider emerging 

population risks and public health 

trends, such as rising levels of  

obesity, increasing urbanisation 

and ageing populations.

Hong Kong

The launch of Pulse in Hong Kong made us the 

first in the market to offer an AI-powered chatbot 

to provide clinically validated information and 

recommendations for symptoms. Recognising 

the specific needs of its customers, Pulse users in 

Hong Kong can access a digital Chinese Medicine 

Body Constitution Test. Useful information, 

including hospital listings is now available on 

Pulse to make information easily accessible 

for customers.

Indonesia

Following the release of Pulse in Indonesia, 

the #SehatBarengPulse (Get Healthy with Pulse) 

movement was launched. The campaign 

encouraged users to lead a healthier lifestyle 

through a series of challenges, including 

lowering sugar intake and cholesterol levels. 

Vietnam

The launch of Pulse in Vietnam enabled users 

to access features including Health Checkup, 

Symptom Check, Body Mass Index Measurement 

and Wrinkle Index Measurement. The app also 

includes hundreds of articles equipping users 

with medical information on healthy lifestyles, 

symptoms and treatments. Prudential Vietnam 

also introduced an online cancer insurance 

product, iProtect, on Pulse in September. 

Malaysia

In October 2020, we launched our Step Up 

Against Cancer Challenge in Malaysia 

through Pulse to increase cancer awareness 

and to highlight the importance of financial 

protection against cancer. Users are challenged 

to take at least 5,000 steps a day in order to earn 

free cancer coverage. Users can connect their 

fitness device to the Pulse app, allowing them 

to earn different levels of cancer coverage, 

depending on the number of steps they take.

Cambodia

Prudential Cambodia was the first to bring 

AI-based preventative healthcare to Cambodia, 

through the launch of Pulse. Health infrastructure 

in Cambodia in both the public and private 

sectors is underdeveloped, and convenient 

access to quality healthcare is difficult for most 

Cambodians. The initial Pulse roll-out included 

a ‘hospital locator’ feature for users to access all 

hospitals and clinics covered under the National 

Social Security Fund, which is a social health 

safety net for two million people employed 

in the formal sector.

Malaysia

Prudential was the first insurer in Malaysia 

to introduce Covid-19 coverage for our 

customers and this was subsequently extended 

to non-customers at no additional cost. In the 

initial stages of the pandemic, we launched public 

service announcements and content on Pulse 

and various media channels to educate the public 

about the virus and how to stay safe. We also 

supported the Ministry of Health’s efforts to 

conduct more Covid-19 tests by reimbursing 

our customers for taking the test. Customers 

facing financial difficulties were able to apply 

to our premium deferment relief programme.

Laos

Prudential Laos extended the grace period 

for premium payments from 30 days to 60 days. 

Free Covid-19 coverage was also provided for all 

existing policyholders, as well as for new policies 

purchased between 1 May and 31 August 2020. 

Free Covid-19 cover was offered to the staff of 

hotels providing quarantine services. In May, 

Prudential Laos donated 3,000 face shields 

to the Ministry of Health to protect frontline 

workers against Covid-19.

Singapore

Pulse was launched in Singapore in April 2020, 

and was a key part of our response in supporting 

the community in the fight against the virus. Users 

of the app were entitled to a daily hospitalisation 

allowance if they were hospitalised for Covid-19. 

Prudential Singapore also subsidised part of the 

consultation costs for users until 30 June 2020, so 

it cost only S$15 per consultation. Non-customers 

were eligible to receive a S$100 daily allowance 

(for up to three months of hospitalisation) if they 

were hospitalised between the date of their Pulse 

app registration and 31 May 2020. 

Hong Kong

Prudential was the first in the market to launch free 

Covid-19 coverage to over 300,000 Hong Kong 

residents. Following rapid take-up, we offered 

free protection to a further 200,000 Hong Kong 

residents. During the fourth wave of the Covid-19 

outbreak, Prudential Hong Kong announced 

that it would allocate HK$5 million to its Covid-19 

Caring Fund, which provides additional financial 

support for individuals affected by Covid-19. 

Eligible applicants can apply through the Pulse app 

to receive a subsidy of HK$10,000 to relieve their 

financial burden caused by the pandemic.

Covid-19 pandemic

Africa

Across our eight markets in Africa, 

we provided customers, staff and agents 

with a range of additional Covid-19 

insurance cover at no cost to themselves. 

Prudential Africa also simplified its claims 

procedures and enabled claims to be made 

via WhatsApp. Additional training was 

provided to our agents and we enabled 

customers to buy insurance without the 

need to meet face-to-face with an agent. 

Thailand

To encourage social distancing during the 

pandemic, Prudential Thailand partnered with 

10 hospitals in Thailand to offer customers access 

to specialist healthcare services and medication 

via telemedicine. Customers could choose to 

schedule a consultation with a doctor via video 

conference, purchase and arrange for delivery 

of prescription medicine to their homes or 

arrange for a home visit by a doctor if necessary. 

The Philippines

Pulse launched in the Philippines in February 2020 

and at the onset of the pandemic, was used to 

provide free Covid-19 protection and personal 

accident coverage – a one-time, 45-day insurance 

product to protect the insured against death from 

Covid-19 or accident. It was the first insurer in the 

country to offer extra protection against Covid-19.

Indonesia

In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Prudential 

Indonesia provided free Covid-19 coverage 

and was the first in the market to offer additional 

protection for Covid-19. Prudential Indonesia also 

extended the grace period for premium payments, 

simplified its claims procedure and established a 

dedicated team for Covid-19 claims. Leveraging 

Pulse, Prudential Indonesia and Halodoc provided 

premium-free Covid-19 rapid tests for members 

of the public in Jakarta and Surabaya. Prudential 

Indonesia also launched PRUCekatan to enable 

customers to consult with their agents and access 

comprehensive protection solutions virtually, 

rather than through face-to-face meetings.

2  Strategic Pillar:  

Stewarding the human  

impacts of climate change 

We recognise that climate change presents a 

serious global challenge, with significant potential 

economic consequences and direct and indirect 

impacts on people’s health and livelihoods, 

and we are proactive in enabling the transition 

to a low-carbon economy. We do this by 

decarbonising our investment portfolio and 

working towards sustainable development and 

energy transition in all our markets. Reflecting 

the stage of their development, the economies in 

which we operate tend have a greater reliance on 

fossil fuels and more exposure to carbon intensive 

industries than in more developed markets. For 

example, for the five largest South-east Asian 

economies of Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the 

Philippines and Vietnam (plus China) an average 

of 36.2 per cent of GDP was derived from mining, 

manufacturing and other industrial activities 

in 2018. This compared to 18.6 per cent and 

17.5 per cent for the US and UK respectively in the 

same year. This means that the energy transition 

across the region is likely to proceed at a different 

pace than for more advanced economies. 

Recognising this, as we support the move to 

a lower-carbon economy in these emerging 

markets, we strive to ensure that the transition 

is an inclusive one for all of society – one that 

supports sustainable growth and economic 

health within our local markets and communities.

Decarbonising our investment portfolio

Our strategic focus on stewarding the 

human impacts of climate change through 

decarbonisation of our investment portfolio over 

time recognises that climate change presents 

long-term risks to the sustainability of our 

business. It also acknowledges that, as a 

responsible corporate citizen, Prudential needs 

to play its part in the transition to a lower carbon 

global economy and the collective efforts to 

limit the rise in global warming that can lead to 

catastrophic climate change. As a significant 

investor and an asset owner with long-term 

investment horizons and liabilities, the Group 

is vulnerable to climate-related transition risks, 

and in a position to invest in, and develop, 

products linked to climate resilience. Our 

approach to reducing the carbon footprint 

of our investment portfolio is one which supports 

sustainable growth and takes into consideration 

the impact on the economies, businesses and 

customers in the markets in which we operate 

and invest.

Approach to climate-related risk

Prudential is a signatory to the recommendations 

of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on 

Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 

Our approach to climate change and climate-

related risk is covered below. To show how we are 

meeting TCFD requirements, we have mapped 

our disclosures to each of its pillars. This is shown 

in a table at the end of this section of the report. 

Initially categorised as emerging risks, the ESG 

risks associated with our business, which include 

climate risk, have more recently been upgraded 

to Group Principal Risk status. Recently, we have 

engaged a dedicated climate risk consultancy 

to further refine our understanding of the nature 

and materiality of the risks posed by climate 

change to the business.

The table below lists the key climate risks facing Prudential. The sections that follow provide further detail on the activities 

undertaken to assess, manage and mitigate these risks.

Risk category

Description

Response

Assets

The Group has financial exposure to assets in 

carbon-intensive and carbon-reliant sectors that 

may fail to adapt, innovate or pivot to a lower-

carbon business model. These assets are at risk of 

taxation, regulation and/or reduced demand, 

leading to impairments or downgrades and/or 

stranding. Physical climate impacts can also lower 

the value of assets held.

 

— Development of metrics to measure the 

potential financial impacts from climate-related 

transition risk in the asset book.

 

— Use of scenario analysis to model the exposure 

assuming different pathways and different 

temperature scenario.

Insurance 

Given the complex interactions with other 

environmental, demographic and social changes, 

the impact of climate change on mortality and/or 

morbidity can be difficult to reliably estimate on a 

standalone basis.

 

— Qualitative assessment of the potential 

impacts from climate risk on our insurance 

liabilities.

Data and model 

limitations

Methods for assessing and quantifying the 

financial impact of climate risks continue to evolve 

in the industry and also within the Group. The 

limitations in data and asset and liability modelling 

make it more difficult to accurately assess the 

financial impact on the Group, particularly for 

longer-term time horizons. 

 

— Participation in industry groups and 

collaboration with data and risk modelling 

providers to help drive improvements 

in climate data quality and risk modelling tools.

Regulatory and 

legislative compliance

The pace and volume of new climate-related 

regulation across all markets could pose 

compliance and operational challenges that may 

necessitate multi-jurisdictional coordination.

 

— Regulatory change teams are in place to assist 

the business in proactively adapting and 

complying with regulatory developments.

 

— Constructive engagement with policymakers 

and NGOs.

Operational resilience

Operational impacts from physical risk events 

challenge operational resilience, including impacts 

to third parties and the servicing of our customers.

 

— Regular updating and testing of elements of 

disaster-recovery plans and the Critical 

Incident Procedure process.

 

— The use of scenario analysis using data sources 

(including IPCC data) to identify additional 

vulnerabilities to physical risk.

The risks are also influenced by the broader 

political, economic and societal backdrop in 

which the Group operates. These factors interact 

with, and can amplify and shape, the impacts 

of climate-related risks. Examples of risk factors 

that could exacerbate climate risks include 

geopolitical issues, political processes, such as 

negotiations to curb emissions, or the unfolding 

Covid-19 pandemic, which is reshaping global 

economic activity.

Activity throughout 2020

Work to quantify and model the nature of our 

climate risk exposure has continued throughout 

2020, consistent with our strategic focus on 

climate change risk and in alignment with the 

TCFD recommendations. The Group Risk and 

Group Actuarial functions have led efforts to 

deepen understanding of the exposure to 

climate-related risks in our asset management 

and asset owner businesses across the Group. 

Activity has included the identification of metrics 

to measure exposure to greenhouse emissions, 

measuring the carbon footprint of our asset book, 

the selection of scenarios for stress testing assets, 

and investment in new tools to support carbon 

footprinting and scenario analysis.

A key activity has been the use of scenario analysis 

to model the Group’s exposure to climate-related 

risk, assuming different transition pathways 

and temperature scenarios (see case study). 

The modelling has helped to further our 

understanding of the nature of the climate risk 

the Group faces. This has reinforced that the main 

financial risk is to the asset side of the balance 

sheet. This finding is consistent with our business 

model: as a major asset owner and manager, 

we rely on investment returns to meet the 

longer-term obligations of our liabilities and thus 

are vulnerable to risks that interrupt or impair 

those returns. The finding also reinforces the case 

for the strategic objective to decarbonise the 

investment portfolio, which is both a way in which 

Prudential can limit its exposure to potential 

transition risks, as well as contribute to global 

efforts to decarbonise the global economy.

The potential impact from climate risk on our 

insurance liabilities has also been investigated. 

To better understand the potential impact to our 

insurance liabilities, a qualitative assessment of 

the impact of climate-related risk on insurance risk 

was carried out by Group Actuarial during the 

year. This established that over the short term, 

such as over the three years of the current 

business plan cycle, climate change is not 

expected to materially increase or decrease claims 

for our life and health business. Over the longer 

term, the financial impacts from climate-related 

risks on our insurance liabilities could be more 

significant, for example on reserving implications, 

if there is a step change in long-term morbidity 

and/or mortality expectations, and medical 

inflation. However, the overall financial impact 

will be mitigated by our ability to reprice contracts 

and develop new products.

Response to climate-related risks

We believe that the new strategic ESG framework 

and the long-term goals to decarbonise the 

investment portfolio and support an inclusive 

transition are an important way in which we can 

meet to meet stakeholder expectations and fulfil 

our fiduciary obligations. It will reduce the Group’s 

exposure to asset risk – which includes transition 

risk – over time, while also contributing to efforts 

to decarbonise the global economy.

Recognising that transition risk represents the 

nearest-term and most impactful financial risk to 

the Group, the Group Risk function undertook an 

initial transition risk analysis on insurance assets 

managed in segregated portfolios by the Group’s 

asset managers. This focused on investments 

where Prudential both maintains direct control 

of the mandate and exerts some influence over 

the investment process. Provisional reports were 

produced using climate-related data and metrics 

provided through a proprietary vendor tool. 

This facilitates a breakdown of the contributions 

of different sectors to the overall carbon footprint 

metrics of the asset book and highlights the most 

carbon-intensive sectors, including those most 

at risk of being stranded. It also enables the most 

carbon-intensive companies held in the asset 

book – and thus the largest issuer contributors 

to the overall metrics – to be determined and 

monitored. We have also determined the initial 

weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of the 

listed equity and corporate bond asset classes 

of our insurance investment portfolio.



Case study

Modelling climate 

change risk: The role 

of scenario testing 

During 2020, the Group undertook a stress testing exercise 

based on the three scenarios laid out within the PRA 

Insurance Stress Tests: orderly transition (temperature 

increases kept below 2°C , meeting the Paris Agreement); 

disorderly transition (temperature increases kept below 2°C 

but with delayed and sudden policies); and failure to meet the 

Paris Agreement (specifically, reaching a temperature increase 

in excess of 4°C assuming no transition and a continuation 

of current policy trends), with a time horizon up to 2100. 

The Group’s entire asset portfolio was included, and the 

testing included the impact of physical and transition risk on 

the asset portfolio for the chosen scenarios. The impacts of 

climate change on insurance liabilities was also investigated. 

These stress tests have informed discussions on how to 

assess the Group’s business objectives and strategy and 

have provided further insight into the capabilities and data 

required for future stress modelling. These analyses have 

also been complemented by reviewing alternative scenario 

testing methodologies using tools provided by specialist 

vendors or open solutions.

The Group is continuing to explore and develop its scenario 

analysis approach, including investigating the use of the 

Group’s economic capital model, and ultimately formalise the 

process for conducting sophisticated climate scenario analysis 

as part of the Group’s risk management frameworks.

Building on this work, we are continuing to 

develop metrics that are appropriate for our 

business, to support an enhanced management 

and reporting process for climate risk. As well 

as WACI, other potential metrics under 

consideration include the percentage of the 

portfolio in carbon-intensive sectors, stranded 

asset exposure as a percentage of assets under 

management, and portfolio exposure to clean 

technology solutions. These metrics were 

considered at a Board Risk Committee workshop 

held to discuss the potential business impacts 

of transition and physical climate risks. Work to 

enhance the management and reporting of climate 

risk will continue in collaboration with our asset 

management and asset owner business units, 

with the aim of integrating climate risk metrics 

and monitoring into broader investment processes 

and aligning with the responsible investment 

framework.

We also continue to develop our scenario testing 

capabilities and have engaged with a climate risk 

consultancy to perform a focused exercise using 

their scenario modelling capability. Investigating 

different methodologies supports the Group’s 

ability to determine climate scenarios appropriate 

to its nature, scale and complexity. The potential 

impacts of different scenarios on the balance 

sheet were discussed in 2020 with the Technical 

Actuarial Committee (TAC), which sets the 

methodology for the economic capital model. 

To date, the impacts have been indirectly 

incorporated into the economic capital model 

via the market risk calibrations. No additional 

adjustment is considered necessary at this time 

and this will be kept under regular review.

Our existing business continuity management 

programmes are assessing the risk of natural 

disasters, including those caused by significantly 

altered climatic conditions, such as increased 

frequency and severity of tropical storms or 

increased flooding. The Group remains focused 

on its operational resilience and is supplementing 

existing activities with scenario analysis to identify 

additional areas of vulnerability that may arise due 

to climate change, including assets, operations, 

third party supply chains and customers. 

Group Risk has trialled a number of dedicated 

risk management platforms and has shared the 

outputs with local business continuity teams to 

help inform assessment and management of 

physical risks to operations in territories for which 

they are responsible. 

Transparency and engagement

As well as the work to enhance internal 

management and reporting of climate-related 

information, we participate in external 

benchmarks to provide additional visibility to 

stakeholders on our climate-related activity. 

We aim continually to improve the transparency 

and utility of our reporting.

In 2020, we continued to participate in CDP 

(formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and 

maintained our score with a B grading (2019: B). 

We continue to participate in ClimateWise 

and received an improved score of 68 per cent 

(2019: 51 per cent), which we believe reflects 

the progress we have made over the year in our 

management and reporting of climate issues.

To help address industry issues, such as the 

limitation of climate-related disclosures and 

evolution of data availability and climate risk 

modelling for financial market participants, 

we participate in industry bodies that can help 

drive improvements in risk management 

processes and lobby for improved standards.

We also seek to collaborate with peers and other 

investors to amplify the impacts of our activity 

in this area. These activities are described in more 

detail in the Responsible Investment section on 

page 34.

As noted in the list of material risks, the pace and 

volume of regulatory and legislative compliance 

developments poses a challenge to the Group. As 

part of our ongoing government relations activity, 

we regularly engage with regulators and monitor 

evolving climate risk-related initiatives that could 

develop into new regulation in the markets in 

which we operate. In a similar manner, we also 

engage constructively with policymakers and 

NGOs to shape the evolution of regulation and 

standards relating to climate risk. For example, 

during 2020 Prudential Hong Kong joined an 

industry-wide task force established by the 

Hong Kong Insurance Authority and Hong Kong 

Federation of Insurers to work on several areas 

within ‘green insurance’. More information on 

our engagement and regulatory interactions, 

including those related to climate risks and 

opportunities, can be found in the Responsible 

Investment section on page 34. 

Supporting an inclusive transition 

Our Asian markets include highly developed 

economies such as Hong Kong and Singapore 

that have diversified, service-led economies 

and mature financial markets, and emerging 

markets that are more dependent on primary 

and energy-intensive industries. These emerging 

markets have a greater reliance on fossil fuels 

in their generation mix, and less developed 

financial systems.

This means that the energy transition across the 

region is likely to proceed at a slower pace than for 

advanced economies as reflected in the countries’ 

Nationally Determined Contributions, as required 

by the Paris Agreement. This point was 

highlighted by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing 

Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore 

(MAS). Speaking at a Financial Times Investing 

for Good Asia Digital Conference on 13 October 

2020, Mr Menon noted that ‘Asia is at a different 

stage of development, with millions of people still 

lacking access to electricity, modern sanitation, 

and drinking water. While demand for affordable 

energy will continue to grow strongly, most Asian 

economies are still heavily dependent on fossil 

fuels for their energy needs and it is unrealistic 

to suddenly replace fossil fuels with 

renewable energy.’ 

For Prudential, this means that, while we are 

committed to an objective to decarbonise our 

investment portfolio, we are mindful of the 

need to implement the strategy in a way that 

acknowledges the nature of the markets in which 

we operate and seeks to share the financial and 

social burden of the transition in a fair manner. 

Our support for an inclusive transition aims to 

balance our responsibilities and obligations 

to all our stakeholders. 

We recognise the importance of coalition building 

in delivering an inclusive transition. As a member 

of the Sustainable Development Investment 

Partnership (SDIP), coordinated by the World 

Economic Forum with support from the OECD, 

we work with public and private sector institutions 

in emerging markets, particularly in South-east 

Asia, to scale domestic and international 

investment in sustainable infrastructure and 

promote energy transition. The SDIP’s ASEAN 

Hub, whose Steering Group Prudential has 

co-chaired since 2017, launched a Sustainable 

Investment Innovation Roundtable in 2020, 

a monthly forum to catalyse new ideas for 

scaling up investments to further the SDGs.

Capturing opportunities

We also recognise that the implementation of 

our strategic ESG framework can generate 

opportunities for the Group. Some of these 

opportunities will come through our efforts to take 

early mitigating action against the climate risks we 

identify, including incorporating transition risk into 

investment decisions to reduce the risk of being 

exposed to stranded assets. 

Others will come through supporting an inclusive 

transition. The infrastructure and capital 

expenditure required to enable the transition 

represents attractive investment opportunities 

in many cases. For example, there is a role for 

institutions to both develop new products and 

invest in structures and mechanisms that enable 

a managed withdrawal from reliance on coal- 

powered electricity within developing economies.

In response to this, we have developed several 

responsible investment products that channel 

our customers’ savings towards ESG-themed 

investments, such as the Asia Sustainable Bond 

Fund recently launched by Eastspring. More 

information on our ESG-related investment 

activity is available in the Responsible Investment 

section on page 34.

Climate change is also likely to drive demand for 

new health products, given the linkage of climate 

change to human health through changes in the 

incidence of diseases and the emergence of 

new diseases. We have launched a dengue alert 

service to customers in some Asian markets 

through our Pulse super-app. The decision to offer 

the application reflects the increasing incidence 

of dengue fever in the region, driven by warmer 

temperatures and higher humidity. This alert 

service is complemented by the provision of 

affordable insurance plans for the markets 

in which dengue is prevalent – see Inclusive 

offerings within Making health and financial 

security accessible for more information.

Next steps

Over the next three years, we will work to 

strengthen management of climate risk across 

the Group. We will approach this as a Group-wide 

cross-functional initiative, with participation from 

our asset owner and asset manager businesses, 

risk, actuarial, and government relations 

colleagues.

Scenario analysis will be an important area of focus 

as we plan to move it into our mainstream risk 

management processes during 2021 and to begin 

internally reporting findings within Group and 

business unit level management information. 

As we further investigate how climate risk impacts 

our business in the long term, we aim to 

operationalise and to continue to increase the 

use of scenario testing. We plan to voluntarily run 

scenario tests emerging from regulators, such as 

the Bank of England’s exploratory climate risk 

scenario for banks and insurers in 2021.

We are aware that many companies have set 

targets in alignment with the Paris Agreement. 

We are in the process of assessing similar suitable 

targets in respect of the carbon emissions from 

our investments, given their importance within 

our overall emissions profile, and our overarching 

strategic commitment to decarbonising our 

investment portfolio.

In the interim, we continue to increase our level 

of ambition in relation to our own emissions 

footprint. This year we have set new and 

stretching targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 

greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of 

becoming net carbon neutral across these two 

scopes by the end of 2030. More information on 

the environmental impact of our direct operations 

is available on page 46.

During 2021 we will continue to scale up 

our engagement strategy with key policy and 

political stakeholders around the COP26 

conference in November with a focus on financial 

sector issues to support the just transition and 

sustainable finance priorities in particular for 

emerging markets.



Case study

Helping Asia exit from coal: 

The Energy Transition Mechanism

Writing for the World Economic Forum as part of the Great Reset series in 

May 2020, Don Kanak, then chairman of Eastspring, outlined a proposal 

for a ‘Coal Retirement Mechanism’, which would accelerate the transition 

to renewables in developing countries where coal use is high and poised 

to grow. An investment fund would be established in collaboration with 

national authorities consistent with climate commitments to purchase and 

retire coal fired power plants over 10 to 15 years, cutting short their 

expected lifetimes of 30 to 40 years or more. Investors in the fund would 

include developed country governments and multilateral banks with 

access to low-cost capital. The proposal is an example of how we are 

seeking to support the markets and communities in which we operate to 

manage the challenge of the energy transition.

Since then, the proposal has been updated and renamed as the Energy 

Transition Mechanism (ETM) and was published on the World Economic 

Forum as part of the 2021 Davos Agenda series. The ETM would 

accelerate the retirement of carbon-intensive power assets, dramatically 

expand demand for renewables, and provide time and resources for a 

just transition.

Building social capital

We are committed to building both our own 

human capital and our social capital with our 

broader stakeholders. We do this by promoting 

diversity in representation and thought, and 

fostering a culture of inclusion and a sense of 

belonging within our organisation. As an 

organisation, we depend not only on the trust of 

our people, but also the trust of the external world. 

As we develop our digital capabilities, we prioritise 

digital responsibility throughout our organisation. 

Our focus on the needs and interests of our users 

is central to our investment in new technologies, 

shaping how we interact with them and handle 

their personal data as our capabilities progress.

Diversity, inclusion and belonging 

We are committed to building our human capital, 

seeking to empower our people and unlock their 

potential. We do this by striving for diversity in 

representation and thought, and fostering a 

culture of inclusion and belonging within our 

organisation. During 2020, we launched a new 

inclusive purpose statement: We help people get 

the most out of life. 

Diversity and inclusion strategy

In 2020, we established a Global Diversity &amp; 

Inclusion (D&amp;I) Council, co-chaired by our Group 

Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer 

and Group HR Director, with representation from 

colleagues across the Group. The Council replaces 

regional advisory committees and groups. During 

2020, we also appointed our first Group Diversity 

&amp; Inclusion Director to help support our ambition 

in this area. The D&amp;I Council is responsible for 

defining our global D&amp;I strategy and supporting 

programmes, promoting and championing 

D&amp;I initiatives in respective business units and 

challenging the organisation when progress is 

limited. The Council reports to the Nomination 

&amp; Governance Committee twice a year.

Our previous Group-wide D&amp;I focus placed 

emphasis on attributes of diversity such as gender, 

ethnicity, nationality and experience. During 

2020, the Group has also focused on inclusion, 

which represents the extent to which employees 

feel valued, respected, encouraged to fully 

participate, and able to be their authentic selves.

The Council has established a global D&amp;I Charter 

with the goal to empower employees and create a 

sense of belonging by respecting and appreciating 

differences. The Charter is aligned to our purpose 

and states that the Council will deliver our 

purpose by creating a culture in which diversity 

is celebrated and inclusion assured, for our 

colleagues, customers and partners.

The D&amp;I Charter makes the following 

commitments:

 

— D&amp;I approach to be clear and public;

 

— Establish inclusive leadership at all levels, 

role modelled from the top;

 

— Illustrate how inclusive leadership 

drives innovation and supports greater 

connectivity;

 

— Inclusion to be integral in the Prudential 

values which guide behaviours;

 

— Reshape our recruitment, reward and 

recognition programmes to eliminate bias;

 

— Engage suppliers and corporate partners 

committed to inclusive practices; and

 

— Product offerings which address the 

diversity of our customer needs.

The D&amp;I Charter also outlines our Group D&amp;I 

Policy, which aims to actively promote employee 

diversity and provide equal opportunities to all 

who apply for and those who perform work within 

our organisation, including our Directors. The 

policy applies to all of our business units and 

promotes diversity irrespective of sex, race, age, 

ethnic origin, social and cultural background, 

marital or civil partnership status, pregnancy, 

maternity and paternity, any gender reassignment, 

religion or belief, sexual orientation, disability, 

or part-time/fixed-term working arrangements. 

The policy also promotes diversity of experience, 

skill sets and professional backgrounds and is 

reviewed annually by our Group HR Director. 

We give full and fair consideration to applications 

for employment made by disabled persons and 

make appropriate arrangements for continuing 

the employment of, and arranging training for, 

employees who have become disabled. We seek 

to promote the training, career development 

and progression of disabled persons, making 

appropriate adaptations where required. Chief 

Human Resource Officers across our business 

units are responsible for the implementation, 

monitoring and review of the policy locally and, 

as part of the management of the Group 

Governance Manual, each business unit confirms 

to Group HR that it has complied with all of our 

HR policies, including the D&amp;I Policy. 

In line with our new D&amp;I Charter, a number of 

initiatives have taken place during 2020 to improve 

inclusivity at Prudential. We have conducted a 

review of recruitment processes, with a new 

Group Recruitment Policy embedding D&amp;I 

measures to be introduced in 2021. We are 

working to mitigate bias in recruitment practices 

by reviewing the language used in job descriptions 

and by using more objective selection tools. 

During 2020, Jackson doubled the period of paid 

parental leave available to all new parents and 

quadrupled the benefit to cover adoption 

expenses. Parental leave arrangements in Asia 

were also reviewed, with changes including an 

increase in the period of paid leave by a third and 

the introduction of paid leave when an employee 

becomes a parent through adoption or surrogacy. 

Our HR function has formed a working group 

with our Risk function to more visibly encourage 

‘speaking up’ and to find constructive ways to call 

out non-inclusive behaviour. This complements 

our new Consensual Relationship Policy and 

Discrimination and Harassment Policy, both of 

which apply from January 2021. These policies 

reflect our continuing commitment to a 

professional and supportive working 

environment, where everybody is treated fairly, 

has equal opportunities, and is respected and 

valued for their contributions to our Company.

D&amp;I performance

As a signatory to the HM Treasury Women in 

Finance Charter since 2016, we have a target of 

30 per cent women in senior management by the 

end of 2021. At 31 December 2020 this figure was 

32 per cent. The Hampton-Alexander Review 

set recommendations in 2016 for FTSE 350 

companies to achieve a minimum 33 per cent 

target for women on boards and in the two layers 

of leadership below the board by the end of 2020. 

At the end of 2020, 29 per cent of our Board was 

made up of women. 

While we did not meet recommendations of the 

Hampton-Alexander Review as at 31 December 

2020, Shriti Vadera replaced Paul Manduca as 

Chair on 1 January 2021 and Chua Sock Koong 

and Ming Lu will be joining the Board in May 2021. 

With these changes, following the retirement of 

Kai Nargolwala at the AGM, the representation of 

women on the Board will increase to 36 per cent. 

We have met the recommendation of the Parker 

Review to have at least one director from an ethnic 

group background on the Board. While our 

diversity figures have improved year-on-year, 

we recognise that we have more to do in this area. 

As such, during 2021 we will establish new diversity 

targets and our local business units will define their 

own targets and plans to meet these objectives. 

During 2020 we again submitted responses to the 

ShareAction Workforce Disclosure Initiative and 

the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, being 

listed on the 2021 index for the first time.

Case study

Defining inclusive leadership behaviours 

During 2020, as part of its commitment to establish inclusive leadership at all levels, the Global 

D&amp;I Council held a workshop with representatives from across our businesses in order to define 

our inclusive leadership behaviours. The workshop concluded with a panel session with external 

speakers, entitled, ‘Leaders make change happen’. Our inclusive leadership behaviours are to:

 

— Nurture inclusion – seek out and embrace diverse perspectives;

 

— Cultivate transparency – provide visibility and display authenticity and vulnerability;

 

— Actively sponsor – recognise, develop and support talent;

 

— Drive accountability – take personal responsibility for behaviours and outcomes; and

 

— Demonstrate care – demonstrate genuine care and interest in others.

These behaviours have been embedded into our leadership development frameworks and senior 

leadership recruitment processes, as well as into our new values. During 2021 we will continue to 

reinforce inclusive leadership and behaviours in development and training interventions to help our 

leaders and people to understand and embed the behaviours we wish to promote. We will also focus 

on embedding inclusive leadership traits into performance management objectives to reward the 

behaviours that strengthen belonging and enhance inclusion. Inclusive leadership behaviours will 

also form a part of our assessment of candidates during the recruitment process.

some key events did take place. Across various 

locations, Prudential Corporation Asia’s PruPride 

network once again hosted a Pink Day in October, 

with active participation in Hong Kong, Vietnam, 

Taiwan, Cambodia and Thailand. A women’s 

network event with a virtual panel session in 

September, attended by 185 colleagues on the 

topic ‘Leaders make change happen’, was hosted 

by Group Human Resources Director Jolene Chen 

and Non-executive Director Alice Schroeder. 

Our new Board Chair, Shriti Vadera, hosted an 

in-person networking event in November with 

Eastspring colleagues in Singapore. Jackson’s 

business resource and affinity groups (BRAGs), 

each supported by one or more executive 

sponsors, continued their activities through 

the year: Pride (LGBT+); VIBE (Vision in Black 

Excellence); Jackson Young Professionals; 

Empower (women’s network); Enable (for 

disabled people); and Associates-in-motion 

(for pre-retirees). A focus for 2021 is to enhance 

our governance procedures and structures for 

affinity networks to support them through a global 

engagement programme to enhance employee 

engagement globally, regionally and locally.

Racial justice – Jackson’s response to the killing 

of George Floyd

In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 

late May, the US experienced protests that raised 

awareness and heightened discussion of issues 

related to racial bias, structural racism and social 

justice. The ramifications of these events have 

broadly impacted society, including the business 

community and Jackson directly. Jackson’s 

leadership has actively engaged with associates on 

these issues and continues to engage on this issue. 

In the week following the killing of George Floyd, 

Jackson’s D&amp;I Advisory Council held meetings 

with the Visions in Black Excellence (VIBE) affinity 

group and senior leaders to discuss the impact on 

associates and Jackson’s response. Jackson-wide 

communications from Jackson’s CEO reinforced 

the message of ‘One Jackson’ and encouraged 

associates to support each other. Jackson hosted 

a series of all-associate panels and training 

opportunities, including a ‘Listening to our Peers’ 

panel to hear associates’ experiences with racism. 

Jackson and VIBE also held a celebration for 

Juneteenth and the PRIDE affinity network 

hosted a discussion with Liliana Reyes, a Latinx, 

transgender woman and civil rights activist.

Jackson also introduced two training courses 

that were mandatory for all associates. The first 

addressed the stereotype threat that exists when 

actions, conscious or not, contribute to persistent 

racial segregation. The second addressed the 

impact of affinity biases that influence workplace 

choices, based on perceived similarities 

and differences.

Jackson also made charitable contributions of 

$250,000 to NAACP Lansing Chapter, $100,000 

to Urban League of Middle Tennessee, and 

$100,000 to Facing History and Ourselves in 

Chicago. This investment signals Jackson’s 

commitment to local philanthropy, which presents 

an opportunity to further engage Jackson’s affinity 

groups as partners in equitable community 

involvement. 

Employee engagement

Engagement with our people is a key priority 

for Prudential and the Board. Two of our 

Non-executive Directors, Kai Nargolwala for 

Asia and Africa and Tom Watjen for the US and the 

UK, were appointed to represent the interests of 

our people, a duty which they discharged through 

a range of interactions with staff during 2020. 

While the Covid-19 pandemic limited 

opportunities for our Non-executive Directors 

to interact with our people, a number of 

face-to-face meetings in small groups took place. 

Non-executive Director engagement was 

supplemented with virtual events and our 

Non-executive Directors also met colleagues 

through an array of remote events, including the 

Asia Virtual Regional Conference, staff town halls 

and meetings of the Jackson Diversity &amp; Inclusion 

Council and the Global D&amp;I Council.

Following Kai Nargolwala’s retirement as a 

Non-executive Director at the conclusion of the 

2021 Annual General Meeting and the planned 

separation of the Jackson business, the Board 

intends to transfer responsibility for workforce 

engagement activities to its newly established 

Responsibility &amp; Sustainability Working Group, 

which is expected to operate until the 2022 

Annual General Meeting. As part of this, it will 

also consider the best method for employee 



Case study

Supporting our people 

through Covid-19 

While the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded at different 

times and with varying levels of impact across our 

markets, all parts of the business were devoted 

to ensuring the physical, emotional and social health 

and safety of our people, taking into account employee 

preferences during this time. Almost all employees 

spent at least part of 2020 working remotely, in line 

with local restrictions and guidance. Asia has 

established a mental health strategy, emphasising 

virtual connections, as well as community engagement 

as part of our commitment to diversity and inclusion. 

Jackson and our London office have offered regular 

sessions on different aspects of wellbeing and stress 

management. To coincide with World Mental Health 

day, we held our first global wellbeing day in October. 

This consisted of a series of online sessions across all 

time zones, including a session in which our leaders 

shared their own stories about mental health 

challenges they have faced. The Board has received 

regular updates from management on how our people 

have been supported. Beyond this, it is essential 

that the Group reacts to the trends in workforce 

expectations that have been intensified and 

accelerated by the pandemic, particularly around new 

and more flexible ways of working. Each business is 

exploring how we can meet the expectations of 

existing and future staff about flexibility around 

schedules and location.

engagement in the longer term, to ensure this 

is tailored to the culture and strategic priorities 

of the refocused Group following the planned 

separation of the Jackson business, and make a 

recommendation to the Board for implementation 

following the 2022 Annual General Meeting.

Global employee survey 

We are committed to building a culture that 

is purpose-led, customer-focused, and 

digitally-savvy. In May 2020, we conducted 

an engagement survey to establish a baseline 

of cultural health and validate our proposed 

purpose and values in a bottom-up manner.

The survey was conducted using an industry-

leading employee engagement platform that 

provides a range of surveys and broad global 

benchmarks across industries. More than 

11,400 employees from Asia, Africa and the UK 

participated in the survey, producing a 95 per cent 

response rate. In the US, Jackson carries out its 

own employee survey and was therefore not 

included in this survey.

The engagement survey covered topics including 

leadership, communication, innovation, career 

and work-life balance. The survey design was 

based on academic research and good practice 

among organisational psychologists. The survey 

found that 85 per cent of colleagues are proud 

to work for Prudential. Areas for improvement 

include communication, collaboration, feedback 

and work-life balance.

Following the survey, briefings were conducted 

for the Group Executive Committee as well as the 

two Non-executive Directors responsible for 

workforce engagement. The Board received an 

update on the survey results in July 2020 and 

summary briefings were provided to stakeholder 

groups across the Company. Each local business 

unit has now undertaken detailed action planning 

in response to its results. Group-wide actions 

include the launch of a science-based mental 

health and wellbeing app, the Collaboration Jam 

(see case study) and the strengthening of Speak 

Out, our Group-wide whistleblowing programme. 

Another global employee survey was undertaken 

in January 2021 to help assess the effectiveness 

of actions taken during the year and to highlight 

our focus areas for 2021. We have made notable 

progress in many areas, including learning, 

feedback and recognition, and diversity and 

inclusion. Collaboration and communication 

was our most improved factor, up by 7 

percentage points.

Leadership and talent development

To ensure appropriately targeted leadership and 

talent development initiatives, we define various 

leadership and talent segments across our Group. 

Our senior leaders continue to play a critical role 

in driving strategic initiatives, which advance the 

Group’s strategy and culture across our markets, 

business units and functions. To future-proof our 

success in an increasingly digital environment, we 

have redefined the leadership capabilities that we 

need to drive the business, focusing on inspiring 

followership when teams work both remotely and 

from an office; fostering innovation by enabling 

disruption while ensuring psychological safety; 

delivering at pace and scale through digital and 

agile practices; and developing sustainable 

commercial strategies to deliver aggressive 

business growth with social responsibility.

Within the leadership community, we focus on the 

Executive Council and the Senior Management 

Teams (SMTs). The Executive Council is a small 

group of individuals holding pivotal Group roles 

and with key capabilities for our future success. 

During 2020, we held virtual workshops with 

this group on positive resilience, creating 

psychological safety and sustaining team 

engagement in a remote setting. For the SMTs, 

we held culture workshops to mobilise teams 

around our shared purpose and to deepen trust 

and collaboration. We also provided a new 

performance coaching programme for 120 

of these leaders to specifically develop their 

coaching skills for remote settings, to help them 

better engage and empower their teams.

We have focused on capability building within 

our key talent pools. We conduct an annual talent 

review and identify successors for executive and 

senior leadership roles. To support this, during 

2020 we defined critical success profiles for senior 

leader roles. These were used to design our 

new Executive Development Centre, which will 

specifically target the business unit CEO pipeline. 

The critical success profiles have also been used 

to adapt our existing assessment centres across 

our talent pipeline.

For those identified as our most strategic talent 

pool, typically those who are currently SMT 

and have potential to grow to larger roles and 

be successors to our Group Executive Committee 

roles within five years, we have focused on 

ensuring they have exposure to Group strategic 

projects and expanded role responsibilities, and 

are provided with specific, tailored development 

interventions, where appropriate. 

In January 2021, we launched a three-year 

Sponsorship Programme matching our most 

senior leaders to protégés, identified through our 

talent review process, enabling a more diverse 

talent pipeline to gain visibility and be considered 

for stretch opportunities and roles. During 2021, 

we also plan to provide an experiential culture 

leadership journey to around 200 of our senior 

leaders, with the aim of developing the behaviours 

needed to help build an inclusive culture and to 

create a space where our values can be actively 

demonstrated by everyone. 

We have also taken steps to deepen our functional 

talent pipeline and to accelerate the development 

of potential successors. Actions taken include the 

creation of a CFO development programme to 

accelerate identified business unit CFO successors 

and the provision of role expansion and 

enrichment opportunities for senior leaders in 

Group Digital. Jackson has focused on ongoing 

leadership capability assessments for its identified 

successors and high-potential population.



Case study

Collaboration Jam

Our global employee survey highlighted employee communication and 

collaboration as an area for improvement. To further engage our people 

in defining our values as well as to signal our intent to foster open, honest 

and two-way dialogue across the Company, we hosted a Collaboration 

Jam in September 2020. A three-day inclusive online conversation, 

the Collaboration Jam provided a platform for colleagues to connect 

and co-create solutions for the issues that matter most to employees. 

More than 5,400 colleagues participated, resulting in nearly 30,000 

comments and posts. The most popular discussion threads were ‘Open 

Conversations’, ‘Listening to Others’ and ‘Change and Agility’. Building 

on this activity and the progress made to date, we will commence a 

three-year journey to embed the desired culture and position Prudential 

as a place where people can connect, grow and succeed.

Strategic Enablers 


Where internal successors are not apparent, 

we aim to attract and retain the best talent across 

industries, irrespective of generation, culture or 

gender. We have further adapted our hiring 

practices to minimise unintentional systematic 

bias. Practices such as artificial intelligence-

assisted job description/advertisements, 

use of psychometrics to evaluate fit to purpose 

and values, criterion-based interview methods 

with diverse panels, and a diverse candidate slate 

have all been introduced in key markets with 

wider roll-out through the introduction of our 

Recruitment Policy in early 2021.

We have continued to support and encourage 

mobility in our organisation to facilitate the sharing 

of knowledge and experience. Notwithstanding 

challenges from Covid-19, more than 100 people 

moved between our businesses in 2020. 

Specifically in our insurance growth markets, 

where this is a strategic priority, we held a virtual 

talent expo to introduce each business and its 

job opportunities.

In 2021, we will focus on continuing to broaden 

our talent pipeline and on building an environment 

where talent can most easily access the 

opportunities that match their aspirations. With 

increasing digitalisation and the need for digital 

skill sets and capabilities, we are providing our 

people with comprehensive training and learning 

opportunities to help them upskill, cross skill, and 

even reskill themselves to maximise their potential.

Performance and reward 

We structure our reward arrangements 

to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre 

people. Our people contribute to the success 

of the Group and are rewarded accordingly. 

We recognise and reward high performance 

and are committed to a fair and transparent 

system of reward. Among our benefits, we offer 

employees competitive pension arrangements. 

Our UK business, Prudential Services Limited, 

has recently reported its 2020 UK Gender Pay 

Gap data and details can be found on the Group’s 

website. Three of the four gender pay gap figures 

have increased in 2020, largely driven by the 

demerger of M&amp;G plc, which saw a number of 

women in senior roles transfer to M&amp;G. The pay 

gap remains volatile year-on-year due to the small 

number of colleagues employed by Prudential 

Services Limited, which makes the calculation 

sensitive to any changes in roles. While female 

representation in our leadership roles has 

increased from 25 per cent in 2017 to 33 per cent 

in 2020 in our London Head Office, the continuing 

pay gap reflects the fact that we have more men 

than women in leadership roles.

Remuneration is linked to the delivery of business 

goals, our values and expected behaviours. 

We ensure that our rewards for our people do not 

incentivise inappropriate risk-taking by assessing 

employees on ‘what’ they have achieved, and on 

‘how’ they have done so. 

The Jackson High Five Recognition Program 

enables individuals to recognise their colleagues 

in areas of creativity, empowerment, execution, 

impact, investment in relationships and respect. 

In our London office, Angel Court, the Prudential 

Stars awards enable individuals to nominate 

colleagues, recognising examples of exceptional 

contributions, specifically in the areas of delivering 

synergy, adding value, fostering innovation, 

demonstrating stakeholder focus and maintaining 

risk awareness.

We are committed to paying the London Living 

Wage to permanent and temporary employees, 

and to contractors who regularly work at our 

premises in the UK. We also believe in the 

importance of giving employees the opportunity 

to benefit from the Group’s success through 

share ownership, and operate share plans for 

employees in the UK and Asia. This includes the 

award-winning PruSharePlus plan, which enables 

employees in Asia to share in the longer-term 

success of the business and actively encourages 

share ownership and engagement. Similar 

all-employee share plans operate in the UK. 

Executive remuneration

The Group’s executive remuneration 

arrangements reward the achievement of Group, 

business, functional and personal targets, 

provided that performance is aligned to the 

Group’s risk framework and appetite and that our 

conduct expectations, as well as those of our 

regulators and other stakeholders, are met. 

Extensive information on executive remuneration 

is provided into the Directors’ remuneration report 

within the Annual Report.

In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Executive 

Directors agreed to voluntarily forgo their 2020 

salary increases. On 1 April 2020, Executive 

Directors’ salaries were reduced to their December 

2019 level. In May 2020, Executive Directors’ 

pension benefits were reduced from 25 per cent of 

salary to 13 per cent of salary, aligning Executive 

Directors with the employer pension contribution 

available to the UK-based workforce.

As part of the three-year cycle, we presented an 

updated Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the 

2020 Annual General Meeting and received the 

support of 95.8 per cent of shareholders in a 

binding vote.

In order to strengthen the community of interest 

between executives and other shareholders, 

remuneration is linked to sustained performance 

over the longer term. For example, 40 per cent of 

Executive Directors’ bonus is deferred in shares 

for three years. Executive Directors are required 

to meet shareholding guidelines and a two-year 

holding period applies to long-term incentive 

awards in addition to the three-year performance 

period. The 2020 Directors’ Remuneration Policy 

requires departing Executive Directors to retain 

a substantial interest in the Company’s shares for 

two years after they leave the Board.

To further increase transparency of executive 

remuneration and its alignment with the pay of 

other employees, we published our CEO pay 

ratio one year in advance of the disclosure 

becoming a requirement under the UK Companies 

(Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 

in the 2018 Directors’ remuneration report. 

Further information on our CEO pay ratio is 

detailed in the Directors’ remuneration report 

within the Annual Report.

Digital responsibility 

Digital innovation is central to our aim of helping 

our customers to be healthier and wealthier. 

We are ambitious and we act with integrity with 

regards to digital responsibility. We are resolute 

in our commitment to fairness, safety and 

transparency in the design, governance and 

operation of our digital ecosystem.

Digital responsibility and Pulse 

We are committed to providing robust security 

protection over both our Pulse app and customer 

data. Using the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s 

regulations as a leading standard, we have 

developed a master set of security controls, 

from which the core security features have been 

integrated into our Pulse app. These include 

multi-factor authentication as part of the device 

registration process, mandating minimum mobile 

device operating systems versions, prevention 

of jailbroken and rooted devices from using Pulse, 

and the secure transmission and storage of 

data. Our Pulse ecosystem relies on partnerships 

with a range of third parties. All business partners 

we engage go through a detailed due diligence 

process to ensure that they meet our high 

standards on data security and protection 

requirements. We conduct information security 

and privacy impact assessments as part of the 

third-party management process to ensure that 

robust security and privacy controls are in place 

for all of our ecosystem partnership engagements.

To align the range of regulatory expectations 

and requirements across our businesses relating 

to customer privacy, we have developed the 

OnePulse Privacy Framework (OPF) to standardise 

the implementation of privacy controls. 

Referencing the General Data Protection 

Regulation (GDPR) requirements, the OPF 

outlines the mandatory and configurable controls 

to be built into our Pulse app, covering data 

subject rights, customer consent and privacy 

notices. More information about our approach 

to privacy is available below.

Data within our digital ecosystem is treated 

the same as all data in our organisation and is 

governed by the Group-wide Information 

Security Policy and Group-wide Privacy Policy. 

Pulse collects information about users in order 

to provide relevant services to them, which 

includes contact details, facial recognition 

information for log-in and fitness information 

from the user’s wearable devices. Health-related 

information is collected by our health partners 

(such as Babylon) directly and Prudential will

only receive a user’s health information from our 

health partners with the user’s explicit consent. 

All information collected is transparent to the user 

through the Privacy Notice provided to them 

before user registration.

Information security 

Information security is rated as a principal risk 

in our business, demonstrating our continued 

commitment to securely managing the information 

our customers entrust to us. 

During 2020 we embedded a single Group-wide 

information security team leveraging skills, 

experience and resource globally via a ‘centres 

of excellence’ model. This new model supported 

increased collaboration and sharing of skills across 

the whole Group.

The global model has allowed us to consolidate 

and rationalise information security technologies 

and processes across the Group, enabling security 

services to become more consistent and effective. 

This is critical to our business as it ensures the 

appropriate assessment, management and 

assurance of all third parties with the potential 

to manage or impact Prudential Group data 

or systems. 

A refreshed Global Information Security Policy 

came into effect in 2020 and was applied to all 

Group business units to ensure consistency in 

processes. The policy is mapped to numerous 

international and local standards including:

 

— ISO27002;

 

— NIST Cyber Security Framework;

 

— The New York Department of Financial 

Services Cybersecurity Regulation;

 

— The Monetary Authority of Singapore 

Guidelines on Technology Risk Management;

 

— The Hong Kong Insurance Authority 

Guideline on Cybersecurity; and

 

— The Bank Negara Malaysia Risk Management 

in Technology Standard.

This supports our global approach to security and 

our commitment to protecting the data entrusted 

to us by customers across our global footprint. 

The policy is also supported by a suite of technical 

standards. Our Security function retains its 

overarching commitment to protect the business, 

comply with all applicable laws and regulations, 

and support the growth of the Group securely.

Oversight and governance 

of information security 

The Group-wide Information Security and Privacy 

Committee defines and provides governance and 

the risk management framework for information 

security risks across the Group. This Committee 

meets at least quarterly and is a sub-committee 

of the Group Executive Risk Committee (GERC), 

chaired by the Group Chief Risk and 

Compliance Officer. 

As a standing member of the GERC, the Group 

Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) provides 

regular updates to the GERC and the Group Risk 

Committee on the cyber threats facing Prudential 

and the progress of Prudential’s security 

programme. On a half-yearly basis, the Group 

CISO also holds a dedicated session with the 

Group Risk Committee to enable a more in-depth 

discussion on the cyber risk facing Prudential.

Our Group-wide framework 

for information security

The Group-wide framework for information 

security rests on four key tenets to defend 

and protect the Group, our information and 

our customers’ data. These are 1) automation, 

2) Global Security Operations Centre, 

3) accelerate development of people skills 

and 4) continuous improvement.

1 Automation

Automation allows us to increase the speed and 

scale of our defences and reduce the need for 

human interaction in a number of incident types. 

This frees our team to focus on more challenging 

initiatives and on continuously maturing our 

security and privacy disciplines. 

Throughout 2020 we have continued to focus 

on automating security services to increase 

effectiveness and consistency and create 

efficiencies. As part of our approach to 

continuously integrate and deploy new tools 

into our Pulse ecosystem, we have introduced 

automated security testing toolsets. These help 

to ensure that security is integrated into the 

development life cycle from the beginning 

of the process, providing early feedback about 

any vulnerabilities.

2 Global Security Operations Centre (SOC)

A global SOC is in place to provide 24-hour threat 

and incident management and provides consistent, 

appropriate 24-hour support to our global 

businesses in the case of any suspicious event.

We retain membership of various intelligence-

sharing networks, such as the Financial Services 

Information Sharing and Analysis Centre, 

and maintain industry relationships to support 

intelligence-sharing through our network of 

connections. The function of the Cyber 

Threat Intelligence team is to assist our teams 

and businesses in understanding the cyber threats 

we face and to focus on providing actionable 

intelligence. The ultimate goal of the intelligence 

provided is to guide our decisions to ensure the 

most relevant and impactful risks for our business 

are addressed. 

3 Accelerate development of people skills

Our staff are critical to protecting the information 

entrusted to us by our customers. Consequently, 

information security awareness training is 

an integral component in ensuring that our 

information and systems remain safe. All members 

of staff, including temporary staff, across all our 

businesses are mandated to complete this training 

at least annually. Training is provided locally to 

support local languages and reflect any local 

regulatory and legal requirements, and completion 

is tracked within each business. The artificial 

intelligence skills of our digital security team are 

assessed and further development opportunities 

are provided to them.

We have rolled out a programme across the Group 

to support information security staff through 

Certified Information Systems Security 

Professional (CISSP) training and accreditation. 

The CISSP is one of the most highly regarded 

professional accreditations for information 

security worldwide and covers a broad scope 

of security domains. The programme began in 

Jackson and has now been extended across the 

Group-wide Information Security team, with over 

40 members of the full-time security team across 

the Group holding the CISSP certification.

Throughout the year our Non-executive Directors 

have access to one-to-one training, often 

delivered by the Group CISO, on topics including 

cyber threats and privacy. This ensures that 

they can not only protect themselves and the 

information they handle on a daily basis, but also 

engage in Board-level oversight of information 

security risks from a more informed and confident 

position, something we consider to be essential to 

the oversight of our strategy and risk management. 

4 Continuous improvement

Given the rapid evolution of threats, the security 

and privacy disciplines need to be in a state of 

continuous improvement across the three 

dimensions of people, process and technology. 

The model to measure the maturity of our security 

and privacy programme has been completed, with 

progress being made on rationalisation and 

optimisation of technology solutions. 

The success of our information security 

programme is measured from both an internal and 

external perspective. Externally, benchmarking is 

conducted regularly to ensure that Prudential’s 

cyber security maturity level is above the industry, 

and internally we assess the organisation’s 

compliance level against the defined security 

controls as per our Group Information Security 

Policy and Group Privacy Policy and relevant 

standards. Security metrics, which measure 

the level of robustness of our security controls, 

are generated on a monthly basis to enable the 

organisation to respond and adapt to any potential 

adverse changes in our security position. 

Incident response and resilience

While our aim at Prudential is always to prevent 

incidents wherever possible, we must ensure 

that we are prepared to respond to any incident in 

a timely and effective manner. Incident response 

plans are developed, maintained and tested 

regularly, and the Group Information Security 

&amp; Privacy team maintains a close working 

relationship with the business continuity and 

disaster recovery teams to ensure alignment of 

plans and support in the event of an incident. 

Regular scenario-based testing of these processes 

serves both to confirm the effectiveness of the 

plans and provide assurance that staff, including 

senior executives, are prepared for such an event. 

Privacy 

In 2020, a key focus was on driving consistency 

of approach to the management of data privacy 

issues in order to embed high standards across

the Group and ensure compliance with the Group 

Privacy Policy. This was supported by the roll-out 

of a global privacy management platform across 

the Group to assist with management of privacy 

activities and to automate privacy control 

assessments where possible. Activities also took 

place to enhance and embed processes to ensure 

compliance with regional and local privacy 

requirements, including the California Consumer 

Privacy Act, which took effect on 1 January 2020.

Our Group Privacy Office continues to maintain 

oversight of privacy compliance. The office 

works with our businesses across Asia, Africa 

and the US to support and advise on ongoing 

privacy compliance as well as to provide a point 

of escalation for resolving data privacy issues. 

Privacy is integrated within the Group-wide 

Information Security &amp; Privacy team, which 

reports to the Group CISO, giving coverage of 

each region and the different countries in which 

Prudential operates.

AI ethics and governance

While the use of artificial intelligence (AI) could 

bring tremendous benefits, we are aware of the 

potential risks in deploying AI. Our Global AI 

Council, chaired by the Group Chief Digital 

Officer, is responsible for oversight of AI tools and 

their implementation in our business. The Global 

AI Council meets quarterly and includes a number 

of working groups, which review all projects 

incorporating AI and machine learning across 

our business units before they receive approval. 

During 2020, we developed a set of AI Ethics 

Principles, reviewed by the Global AI Council. 

The principles were approved by the Group Risk 

Committee, on behalf of the Board, which retains 

ultimate responsibility for setting the Group’s 

ethical standards. These principles sit alongside 

our Group Code of Business Conduct and set 

out the standards expected of our colleagues 

responsible for designing, developing and 

operating complex applications.

The principles are:

 

— Effectiveness and value – we design tools 

with a clearly defined purpose to deliver value 

for our stakeholders;

 

— Explainability and transparency – we are 

transparent that AI tools are used as part of our 

products and services and explain this simply;

 

— Bias and fairness – we ensure that AI treats 

people fairly to avoid bias and unfair 

discrimination;

 

— Robustness – we design AI tools that are highly 

reliable and robust;

 

— Compliance – we comply and respect relevant 

regulations, including human rights laws;

 

— Accountability and responsibility – we accept 

accountability and responsibility for the 

outcome of the use of AI tools;

 

— Privacy and security – we respect user privacy 

and security; and

 

— Assurance – we continuously review and 

monitor our AI deployment and outcomes 

to ensure that these principles are met.

The Global AI Council is supported by six 

working groups: 

1.  Products and pricing – to drive the automation 

of actuarial work;

2.  People – to upskill and certify the AI 

capabilities of all Prudential employees;

3.  Data – to align with Prudential’s data 

governance and management;

4.  Technology and platform – to review and 

approve AI technology and supplier choices;

5.  IP – to safeguard Prudential’s AI 

intellectual property; and

6.  Ethics – to approve AI prototypes for 

compliance with Prudential’s AI Ethics 

Principles.

As we invest in AI, big data and other technologies 

to deliver on our purpose, we are providing 

everyone in the organisation, regardless of their 

roles, with opportunities to learn more about these 

technologies, so that they can participate and 

contribute to helping our customers. For those 

who want to advance further, we have created an 

AI Bootcamp, consisting of a five-level certification 

process, which covers advanced AI, machine 

learning, data analytics, as well as AI use in 

healthcare and finance. An overarching theme 

of the bootcamp is AI for good and helping families 

and communities in need.



Case study

Response to challenges 

posed by Covid-19

The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a large-scale move 

to remote working, significantly changing the working culture 

for staff and agents, as well as the way we engage with 

customers. In response to these new ways of working, we 

scaled up secure remote access, including VPN services, 

in the early stages of the pandemic. Additionally, Prudential 

has leveraged existing collaboration toolsets and capabilities, 

which have been integrated with security services to enable 

more secure and efficient team working.

As part of the change to remote working practices, Prudential 

undertook a reassessment of all employee laptops to ensure 

that secure remote working software had been correctly 

deployed and configured. In addition, the assessment 

reviewed and ensured that all laptops are protected against 

known vulnerabilities, and a more stringent approach for 

remote access has been adopted. During 2020, phishing 

campaign frequency was increased to monthly. Simulated 

phishing emails are tailored within regions and the 

sophistication of the techniques varies to ensure that staff 

are continually challenged to learn. The results of these 

campaigns and training completion rates are tracked across 

the Group to ensure that this remains an area of focus.

Responsible investment

As a significant allocator of capital in financial 

markets, our commitment to responsible 

investment encompasses our role as both asset 

owner and asset manager. In that capacity, we play 

a vital role in the transition to a lower carbon 

economy. We seek to apply ESG considerations 

more broadly in our investment decisions and 

our fiduciary and stewardship duties, including 

ensuring that our investment decisions are aligned 

with our values around diversity and support our 

primary focus on healthy lives. 

Governance 

As with other ESG matters, responsible 

investment activity is overseen by the Group ESG 

Committee. More information on the Group ESG 

Committee is provided in the report introduction. 

Operational responsibility for responsible 

investment activity is delegated to the Group 

Responsible Investment Advisory Committee 

(GRIAC). The GRIAC is constituted as a 

sub-committee of the Group ESG Committee 

and provides a forum for Group and business units 

to consider responsible investment approaches.  

 

The GRIAC is co-chaired by Prudential 

Corporation Asia’s Chief Investment Officer, 

Insurance Investment and Co-CIO, Eastspring, 

respectively senior executives within our main 

asset owner and asset management businesses. 

Other permanent members include the CIOs of 

the major life businesses and the President, CEO 

and CIO of PPM, as well as representatives from 

the Group Finance and Group Risk functions.

Asset owner/asset manager relationship

Historically, Prudential has adopted a principles-

based approach to coordinate responsible 

investment activity across the Group. These 

principles have been codified into standards, 

which are set out in the Group Responsible 

Investment Standards (GRIS) and govern the 

conduct of responsible investment activity across 

the Group.

These principles set the tone and parameters 

under which the Group’s asset owner and asset 

manager businesses develop responsible 

investment policies appropriate to the markets 

in which they operate.

During 2021, we will seek further to develop 

our asset owner Responsible Investment Policy 

and align expectations across our asset manager 

mandates, including how ESG considerations 

will be monitored and measured over time.

Our approach to responsible investment reflects 

our belief that the quality of corporate governance 

practices, and how companies manage the 

environmental and social aspects of their 

operations, are material to reducing risk and 

delivering superior financial returns and, 

ultimately, longer-term shareholder value. It also 

recognises that responsible investment requires 

a patient approach and an understanding that 

changes in corporate behaviour should support 

shareholder value over time.

Asset owner level

Direction

Activity/implementation

ESG integration

We seek to integrate ESG factors into our 

investment decisions, alongside traditional financial 

analysis, to better manage risk and generate 

sustainable, long-term returns for our customers. 

Within Eastspring, the Singapore-based equity 

team focuses on exploiting opportunities where 

risk perceptions and expectations have become 

misaligned. ESG issues are incorporated into 

the fundamental analysis and decision-making 

process to the extent that the team believe they 

could have a material impact on a company’s 

valuation and financial performance. Similarly, 

for the fixed income team, only ESG issues that 

are material to the issuer’s credit fundamentals 

and the valuation of the bond are factored into 

the analysis. For both equity and fixed income, 

companies are not excluded solely on perceived 

ESG issues.

This approach to integrate only material ESG 

factors into investment decision making does not 

preclude investment in sustainable investment 

opportunities. For example, in August 2020 

Eastspring invested THB 1 billion ($30 million) 

in the Thai government’s inaugural THB 30 billion 

sustainability bond. The bond carries a 15-year 

maturity, with proceeds divided between a project 

to expand the Mass Rail Transit System and to 

support various expenditures under the 

government’s Covid-19 Rehabilitation Package.

PPM follows a broadly similar approach to 

Eastspring. ESG factors are incorporated into 

the investment process where it is believed they 

may have a material impact on the financial 

performance of the investment. Investments 

are not automatically excluded at strategy or fund 

level on ESG grounds. Rather, the manager works 

with clients, who will specify exclusion lists unique 

to their ESG values and requirements.

Stewardship and engagement

As custodians of our customers’ assets, it is 

important that we act in ways consistent with our 

stewardship responsibilities. This means seeking 

to maximise the long-term capital growth of 

the assets entrusted to us, while remaining 

accountable to our customers for our actions and 

being aware of our duty to uphold their best 

interests when carrying out investment activities. 

We aim to meet these requirements in several 

ways, including:

 

— Pursuing an active investment policy that 

aligns engagement activity with the long-term 

investment thesis to hold the asset 

in the portfolio;

 

— Treating shareholder voting rights as a valuable 

asset and seeking to vote all holdings;

 

— Developing and adhering to principles of 

conduct governing our stewardship activities, 

including the fiduciary relationship with 

customers; and 

 

— Ensuring that our approach to stewardship is 

aligned to best practice. Notably, Eastspring is 

a member of International Corporate 

Governance Network (ICGN) and its 

stewardship approach is aligned with the ICGN 

Global Stewardship Principles and ICGN 

Global Governance Principles. It is also a 

member of the Asian Corporate Governance 

Network, which seeks to promote high 

standards of corporate governance across the 

Asia-Pacific region.

Engagement

Engagement is a core part of providing effective 

stewardship and an important means of 

generating long-term value. We seek to 

encourage business and management practices 

that support sustainable financial performance 

through constructive interaction, based on our 

in-depth knowledge of the companies and their 

business environment. 

Our approaches to engagement vary across our 

asset owner and asset manager businesses, 

reflecting differences in local investment practices 

and norms, and consistent with the Group’s 

principles-based framework to coordinate its 

responsible investment activities. However, within 

this broad framework, some common principles 

and practices apply. These include: that 

engagement is an important way to identify 

material risks and opportunities to investment; 

that maintaining a continuing and open dialogue 

with management is key to building relationships, 

and thus effective influence; and, that 

collaboration with other investors (through bodies 

such as Climate Action 100+ or the Asia Investor 

Group on Climate Change (AIGCC)) is a helpful 

way to amplify the effectiveness of our 

engagement activity on ESG issues. The use of 

voting rights is also an important means to signal 

investor preferences to company management 

and it is the Group’s policy to vote on their 

holdings (see Proxy voting below).

The level of conviction to hold a particular 

investment can be impacted by the results of 

engagement. Where conviction levels fall below 

an appropriate level, the position may be divested. 

This was the case, for example, with a recent 

engagement by Eastspring with a company 

providing education services. During our 

engagements, the company did respond with 

some improvement to their initial proposed 

corporate governance reforms. However we did 

not have a sufficient level of confidence in the 

standard of governance or controls in place to 

avoid future contentious proposals. Given the 

lower level of conviction around the range of 

potential outcomes we felt there was insufficient 

valuation support to compensate for observed 

risks and Eastspring exited the position. 

Both Eastspring and PPM undertake company 

engagements focused on both financial and 

non-financial matters on an annual basis. 

With respect to specific engagements related 

to material ESG issues, Eastspring’s equity and 

fixed income teams have conducted over 300 

unique engagements in 2020, in addition to 

engagement on financial issues with companies.



Case study

ESG integration case study: Multinational car 

company challenged to meet new regulations 

ESG consideration

During the review of a multinational automotive corporation headquartered in Europe, PPM’s 

research analyst noted concerns about the company’s ability to meet European carbon dioxide 

emission standards, which could lead to meaningful regulatory fines and negative consumer views 

given the increasingly environmentally conscious consumer. Despite what PPM believed was 

a solid company balance sheet (strong net industrial cash position and significant gross liquidity), 

its analyst viewed the company as behind other automotive corporations in its investment in and 

development of electric vehicles.

PPM analysis

Electric vehicle penetration gained momentum in early 2020 at the onset of Europe’s tougher 

emissions rules. Effective 1 January 2020, the rules imposed more stringent targets for passenger 

cars and vans – based upon average fleet-wide carbon dioxide emissions (g/km).

PPM’s research team discussed the issue in detail during an investment grade review of the 

automotive industry that assessed the company’s positioning among its peers. The research 

revealed that the company had one of the largest percentage gaps in reducing its year-on-year 

average fleet-wide carbon dioxide emissions versus its peers and was at the most risk of not meeting 

standards. While the potential monetary fines were viewed as manageable, the company would 

be required to undertake significant investment in research and development to catch up with the 

leaders in the industry, or risk losing meaningful market share.

Outcome

Considering all factors related to the risk and return of the company, the changes to regulations, 

and the company’s progress in developing electric vehicles and increasing its mix to meet emissions 

standards, PPM downgraded its internal rating. Its analysts will continue to monitor the company’s 

improvements toward emissions goals alongside company fundamentals.

Proxy voting

Alongside engagement, voting is considered 

part of the investment process and the pathway 

to value realisation. It is therefore integral to our 

stewardship responsibilities. By exercising our 

votes, we seek both to add value and to protect 

our interests as shareholders. We consider the 

issues, meet company management if necessary 

and vote accordingly. Where possible, we seek to 

discuss any contentious resolutions with investee 

companies before casting our votes in order to 

ensure that our objectives are understood, and 

our votes will be cast in the best interests of our 

investors and clients.

Where appropriate, we use third-party investment 

advisers to aid the process of making proxy voting 

decisions. Both Eastspring and PPM engage 

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a fellow 

signatory to the United Nations-supported 

Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), 

to provide administrative assistance in connection 

with voting proxies. 

The policies and guidelines of the proxy advisers 

are periodically reviewed to understand the 

nature of their recommendations and test their 

compatibility with our requirements. However, 

specific policies and advice from the proxy adviser 

are not applied mechanically. We always apply 

our judgement and decide how to vote on each 

resolution on its merits in the context of the 

principles of our proxy policy.

In Asian and emerging markets, proxy voting 

activity is commonly focused on governance 

matters, with fewer shareholder resolutions 

focused on environmental or social matters. 

However, our equity team actively vote and 

take any material ESG issues that have been 

identified into consideration. 

While our equity teams are typically supportive 

of company management, where applicable we 

use proxy voting actively to signal to management 

our expectations for improvement in behaviours. 

In 2020, Eastspring voted on 99.63 per cent of the 

total number of proxy votes in which it was eligible 

to vote. Eastspring voted with management 

recommendations 90.33 per cent of the time and 

voted against management recommendations 

9.67 per cent of the time. Please refer to 

Eastspring’s website for more information on 

its proxy voting record.

Engagement activity through 2020: 

Notable examples

In order to highlight the breadth of topics and 

engagements that have taken place, we provide 

a selection of recent engagement case studies 

under the ‘Environmental’, ‘Social’ and 

‘Governance’ headers. Often, the engagements 

span more than one ESG dimension, and where 

this is the situation, the case study is allocated 

to the ESG category on the basis of a judgement 

as to which dimension is more material. 

Environmental 

 Case studies

Global Emerging Markets Equity Team, Singapore:  

Environmental engagement 

Company A, a Korean power company, is a valuation outlier and 

has been a long-term holding, with which we have maintained 

ongoing engagement. 

Objective: Our engagement is aimed at understanding its long-term 

strategy around transition to a low-carbon economy, to enable us to 

perform our fiduciary duties and decisions around proxy voting from 

a well-informed position.

Scope: In 2020, we engaged with Company A in a discussion about  

the company’s long-term strategy for dealing with carbon emissions. 

It shared that it has a long-term plan to increase renewable energy and 

to reduce dependence on coal-fired power generation. We discussed 

the future of the power company’s overseas coal power projects and its 

commitment in October 2020 to not build any overseas coal plants going 

forward, but only energy-efficient, renewable-type plants. This is aligned 

with its commitments to grow renewable energy domestically, add no 

new coal power plants, start to close coal-fired capacity, and to invest 

in technology to reduce carbon emissions. Notably, the company’s 

overseas coal project plants in South Africa and the Philippines are 

being converted to liquefied natural gas (LNG) or terminated.

Subsequently, we engaged with the company on its anti-corruption 

policies. In response to corruption issues, it has responded by putting 

in place governance structures that include enhanced processes, 

training and monitoring.

Outcomes: Demonstrating a response through restructuring and 

capital allocation towards renewable energy, and improvement to 

governance structures.

Japan Equity Team, Singapore 

Company B is one of the world’s largest steel producers.

Objective: Our ongoing engagement since 2017 is aimed at 

understanding the company’s position on three key issues: 

carbon emissions and energy usage (including disclosure policies), 

board governance and structure, and workplace safety.

Process: In 2020, our three engagement meetings focused on potential 

structural change in the industry and the need to reduce capacity, 

and progress in implementing new (hydrogen-based) steel-making 

technologies. The team also discussed the potential impact of recent 

regulation by the Japanese government aimed at reducing coal-fired 

power generation capacity. The engagement was also undertaken in 

fulfilment of our obligations as a member of the Climate Action 100+.

Outcome: We observed that management was making good progress 

towards finalising specific medium and long-term climate change targets, 

as part of the ultimate target of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050. 

In terms of board governance and structure, the company sought and 

received approval from shareholders in June 2020 to transition its 

governance model. The dialogue has supported the case for continued 

investment in the company.

Social (labour rights, health and safety) 

 Case study

Malaysian Equity Team, Malaysia 

Company C is a large global glove manufacturer. 

Objective: To determine whether the company was putting processes 

in place to improve labour practices.

Process: In June, we engaged with Company C following allegations of 

forced labour practices from a UK Channel 4 report. We noted that these 

allegations, which were brought up in December 2018, had resurfaced 

and that the company had made progress in rectifying these claims.

In July, we sought further clarification from management when 

the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) placed a detention 

order on disposable gloves manufactured by some of the company’s 

subsidiaries. Management shared that they had remedied some of the 

key issues, such as retention of identification documents, and were 

looking into the reimbursement of recruitment fees. 

We engaged again in November, following an accident that  

resulted in the amputation of a worker’s arm. The purpose of this 

engagement was to remind the company to take remedial actions  

to keep workers safe and close gaps that may contribute to accidents. 

Subsequently, it was uncovered that the worker had not followed the 

company’s standard operating procedure, which the company will 

investigate remedying with extensive education. It has continued to 

improve its training programmes by adding training in native languages, 

revamping on-site training to include accident-prone areas, and 

increasing training hours. 

Outcome: While we recognised that the company had made significant 

improvement in labour market practices, we continue to stress to 

management that, as one of the largest glove manufacturers in the world, 

it needs to set better standards and be vigilant about ESG issues, and we 

will continue to engage with it on labour issues into 2021. 

Governance (Board composition and diversity) 

 Case studies

Japan Equity Team, Singapore 

Company D is a Japanese international chemical manufacturing company.

Objective: Gain a better understanding of the corporate governance 

structure and practices to perform our fiduciary duties and decisions 

around proxy voting from a well-informed position.

Process: In January, we conducted a discussion with the company 

on its broad ESG approach and its specific positioning for meeting 

environmental product demands (eg bioplastics). We also highlighted 

the need for improvements in board structure and function and the 

nominations and succession process.

We continued our engagement in July, when we conducted a discussion 

of the ongoing evolution of its governance structure and approach and 

its oversight and management ownership of ESG-related matters. In our 

ongoing engagements, we have noted that the company’s board and 

broader governance structures have shown a significant step forward 

(eg improving board independence, voluntary committee structure). 

The company has noted that these changes are, partially, in response 

to our ongoing engagement. It also detailed its increased focus on ESG 

with a new ESG committee that reports directly to the board. We were 

satisfied that ESG governance and management ownership appear to 

be improving. 

Beyond this progress, however, we have also discussed that we would 

like to see continued progress in terms of board independence, diversity, 

and change to an independent committee system.

Outcome: Gained clarity on timeline for implementing PRI framework 

and the company’s efforts on ESG.

Japan Equity Team, Singapore 

Company E is a credit card issuer and transaction processing company.

Proxy Voting Objective: Proxy vote signals the accountability of 

chairman and CEO for the delivery of poor longer-term returns.

Process: The current chairman has been both chairman and CEO since 

2000. Over this period return on equity (ROE) has been weak and has 

further deteriorated over the past three years. Although the company’s 

management did seek to buy back some shares, we did not feel this 

was sufficient to address the issue. We felt a clear strategy needed to 

be articulated to grow the business, amid fierce competition from other 

traditional credit card players and new cashless players. 

A vote was due to be held at the company AGM to re-elect the chairman 

(and other directors). While our proxy adviser recommendation, and 

company management vote was ’For’ the re-election of the Chairman, 

we decided to vote ‘Against’ re-election on the basis of his accountability 

for the poor historic performance of the company. 

Outcome: In addition to acknowledging the company’s historic delivery 

of poor trend returns, our analysis suggests the company has a good 

platform and there is sufficient valuation upside to support our level 

of conviction around the overall governance of the company. However, 

our vote ‘Against’ the re-election of the chairman signals our position 

in relation to accountability for historic performance and the need for 

a change in leadership to support a clear strategy for growth.

Capacity building, collaboration and industry  

and regulatory engagement

We continue to seek opportunities to build 

capacity and enhance capabilities within our 

responsible investment practices. In August 2020, 

Eastspring participated in a sustainability 

benchmarking process and capacity-building 

exercise with the World Wide Fund for Nature 

(WWF), one of the world’s largest independent 

environmental organisations. WWF works with 

industry associations, regulators, stock exchanges 

and investors in Asia to support ESG risk analysis 

and opportunity identification. The benchmarking 

process is being used as an enabler to further 

embed sustainability into the business and is 

aligned with the Group’s strategic focus areas. 

As part of an ongoing focus on continuous 

improvement to meet our sustainability ambitions, 

Eastspring has incorporated actions from the 

benchmarking exercise into four sustainability 

work streams focused around purpose, 

governance, climate strategy and responsible 

investment. Eastspring also participated in the 

Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC) 

Climate Change Training Project Advisory 

Committee, the region’s first accredited climate 

change training.

Collaboration 

We continue to view collaboration with investors 

through collective initiatives and industry bodies 

as another way to build capacity and to amplify 

the effectiveness of our engagement activity. 

Two examples of collective bodies in which we 

participate are Climate Action 100+ and the 

AIGCC. Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led 

initiative to engage systemically important 

greenhouse gas emitters across the global 

economy. The AIGCC aims to raise awareness 

and encourage action among Asia’s asset owners 

and financial institutions about the risks and 

opportunities associated with climate change 

and low-carbon investing. Where appropriate, 

some of our engagements are coordinated 

through these bodies. 

We have aligned our responsible investment 

approach to industry best practice through our 

support for the United Nations Principles 

of Responsible Investment. Ninety-nine per cent 

of Prudential Hong Kong’s investment portfolio 

is managed by asset managers that are PRI 

signatories. Prudential supports PPM’s and 

Eastspring’s membership as PRI signatories. 

Eastspring has been a PRI signatory since 

February 2018. In 2020, it submitted its first 

official PRI Report and achieved A+ scores 

across two categories and A scores across four 

categories, well above the median scores for the 

PRI’s asset management signatories. An A+ score 

was achieved for Strategy and Governance and 

ESG Integration in Listed Equities modules; and 

an A rating was awarded for Listed Equities – 

Active Ownership, Fixed Income – SSA, Fixed 

Income – Corporate (Financial), and Fixed 

Income – Corporate (Non-Financial). 

PPM became a signatory in October 2018 and 

received an A score for its approach to Strategy 

and Governance, placing it among the top tier 

of asset managers in this category.

Regulatory and industry engagement

It is important that our strategic approach to 

responsible investment develops in line with 

broader thinking around the issue. Therefore, 

we seek to engage with policy bodies and 

regulators in the markets in which we operate 

to both shape the debate and to align our 

approach to evolving best practice on the topic. 

Some examples of notable industry engagements and collaboration undertaken during 2020 are:

Product development and client engagement

We are continuing to expand our ESG offering 

to clients to meet the growing demand for 

responsible investment products in our markets. 

In December 2019, Eastspring launched the 

Asia Sustainable Bond Fund, which supports 

sustainable objectives, as well as meeting client 

needs for an ESG-themed investment product. 

Our Singapore and Hong Kong-based life 

businesses are anchor investors into the fund. 

While the fund’s AUM remains modest at 

$73 million, during 2020 Eastspring continued 

to engage with interested gatekeepers from 

both retail and institutional investors on the Asia 

Sustainable Bond Fund strategy, as it builds its 

performance track record with a view to increasing 

third-party investment. The fund follows an 

absolute-return targeting strategy and does not 

target a specific benchmark. Notwithstanding this, 

recent performance compares well with broadly 

similar indices, such as the JPMorgan Asia Credit 

– ESG Index.

In November 2020, Prudential Hong Kong, 

through its participating life fund, provided the 

cornerstone funding for a new ESG ETF provided 

by BlackRock through its iShares unit. The fund 

tracks the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ESG 

Reduced Carbon Target Index, which reduces 

greenhouse gas emission intensity by 63 per cent 

and exposure to fossil fuel reserves by 95 per cent, 

relative to the parent benchmark.

Other significant ESG-themed asset owner 

initiatives through 2020 include the adoption 

by Prudential Assurance Malaysia Berhad of 

sustainable investing strategies for local equity 

investment within its PRULink Strategic Fund, 

and the initiation of a project by PT Prudential Life 

Assurance (PLAI) to publish ESG scores for all 

its investment-linked product (ILP) funds. PLAI is 

also in the process of changing the benchmark for 

one of its existing ILP funds to a new ESG index 

(the IDX ESG Leaders) developed by the Indonesia 

Stock Exchange.

Outlook for 2021 and next steps

Prudential recognises that strengthening our 

approach to responsible investment is an ongoing 

and long-term process that we expect will evolve 

over time. 

For 2021, as an asset owner, we expect to take 

further steps to expand and make more explicit 

our expectations of asset managers in the areas 

of ESG integration and engagement. The recent 

establishment of Eastspring Portfolio Advisers 

(EPA) will help to facilitate and implement our 

asset owner requirements with asset managers. 

EPA is our investment centre of excellence 

for tactical asset allocation, model portfolio 

construction, manager selection, liability-driven 

investments and solutions and derivative 

expertise. From an asset owner perspective, 

EPA will integrate ESG in all relevant processes 

within its remit. EPA’s complete view of the asset 

owner portfolio will contribute to a holistic and 

coherent approach on ESG. The establishment 

of EPA has also created a platform where the 

asset owner and the asset manager can discuss, 

monitor and advance the ESG initiatives.

As well as these steps to improve the alignment 

of asset owner and asset manager objectives, 

we will continue to develop our overall approach 

by identifying and aligning with selected global 

standards and initiatives that help to frame and 

inform our principles-based approach to the 

impacts and opportunities of ESG. In this context, 

our Asian business is investigating becoming 

a PRI signatory as an asset owner in 2021.

By taking ESG issues into account, we can meet 

our clients’ financial expectations, serve their 

other long-term interests and meet the 

expectations of society.

Community engagement  

and investment 

Our approach to community investment

Our community investment strategy is closely 

aligned with our business purpose and with our 

stakeholders’ concerns and interests. Our strategy 

is focused around health and resilience issues 

relevant to the communities in which we operate, 

education (particularly financial education) and 

building resilience across communities. This is 

underscored by a desire for strong employee 

engagement in the work we do. Our strong 

contribution continues to improve lives and 

build communities, wherever we work. 

Our relationships with our charity partners 

are long term, involving support through both 

funding and skills-based employee volunteering.

Governance of community investment

Our businesses are guided by the framework 

for investing in the community, as laid out in our 

Group-wide Community Investment Policy and 

the Group’s ESG strategy. Within that framework 

they have the autonomy to manage their own 

community investment programmes. For business 

units in Asia and Africa, Prudence Foundation, 

 

 a unified charitable organisation governed by 

a statutory board of directors, provides regular 

review of strategy and spending for community 

investment, which maximises the impact in these 

regions. In the US, a governance committee of 

Jackson and the Jackson Charitable Foundation 

board of directors regularly reviews community 

investment activity, strategy and spend. Going 

forward, the Responsibility &amp; Sustainability 

Working Group will oversee our community 

engagement and investment activities on behalf 

of the Board.

Our Group-wide Community Investment Policy 

sets minimum standards, as well as prohibiting 

political funding and contributions to religious 

organisations that have a clear aim to propagate 

a set faith. It is the Group’s policy neither to make 

donations to political parties nor to incur political 

expenditure, within the meaning of those 

expressions as defined in the UK Political Parties, 

Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The Group 

did not make any such donations or incur any such 

expenditure in 2020. 

Monitoring and measuring 

community investment

Our community investment performance metrics 

are aligned to the Business for Societal Impact 

(B4SI) Framework (formerly known as London 

Benchmarking Group), which is used to monitor 

progress and guide the valuation of both cash 

and in-kind contributions, employee volunteering 

and management costs.

In 2020, the Group spent $33.2 million (2019: 

$29.1 million) supporting community activities. 

Direct cash donations to charitable organisations 

amounted to $25 million (2019: $20.6 million). 

The balance includes in-kind donations, as set out 

on the Group website, calculated in accordance 

with Business for Societal Impact (B4SI) 

framework. The in-kind total includes 112,000 

hours of colleague volunteer service for our 

local communities. Our primary focus areas 

for community investment in 2020 were health, 

social and welfare issues, which together 

accounted for 46 per cent of investment in 2020; 

followed by education (20 per cent), environment 

(15 per cent) and emergency relief (7 per cent). 

In 2020, 63 per cent of our community investment 

activity was in Asia and Africa, and 35 per cent 

in the US. The remaining 2 per cent, attributed 

to London head office, includes both UK and 

global activity.

Our 2020 community investment reporting 

is assured by Deloitte LLP. Further information 

and Deloitte’s assurance statement can be 

found at www.prudentialplc.com/esg.

Covid-19 Relief Fund 

Prudential’s flagship international volunteering 

programme, the Chairman’s Challenge, has been 

bringing people together across the Group to 

help their communities since 2006. In 2020, 

the Chairman’s Challenge joined forces with 

Prudential Corporation Asia to create 

a $2.5 million Group-wide Covid-19 Relief Fund. 

The fund was administered by Prudence 

Foundation, Prudential’s community investment 

arm in Asia and Africa, and distributed to 

Prudential’s markets around the world, allowing 

them flexibility to allocate funding based on local 

knowledge of community needs. Funds were used 

to support approved charitable and community 

projects tackling the immediate impact of the 

pandemic, and its social and economic 

consequences. Local businesses’ programmes 

included supporting vulnerable communities 

with Covid-19 messaging, hygiene and sanitation, 

nutrition and educational programmes. 

For example: 

 

—  Prudential Thailand and Eastspring Thailand 

donated THB4.9 million (US$155,000) 

to four hospitals in November. The donation 

will contribute to the construction of airborne 

infectious isolation rooms and acute 

respiratory infection clinics in the four 

hospitals. Prudential Thailand also donated 

2,500 face shields made by its employees 

to help protect medical professionals and 

frontline health workers.

 

— In the Philippines, the Covid-19 Relief Fund 

donated PhP5 million (US$100,000) to the 

Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Medical 

Foundation Inc to support the University of the 

Philippines (UP)-PGH Covid-19 programme. 

PGH serves as one of the primary Covid-19 

referral hospitals in the Philippines and its 

Covid-19 programme seeks to equip its 

healthcare workers with personal protective 

equipment, including N95 masks, goggles, 

face shields, and cover-all suits. It also provides 

medical equipment for cardiac and respiratory 

care to Covid-19 patients. 

 

— Our Covid-19 Relief Fund was used in 

Côte d’Ivoire to provide food to vulnerable 

communities and to deliver a three-month 

awareness and training programme with AGIS, 

an NGO, to at-risk areas. In Ghana the fund 

supported three programmes, including 

School for Languages, to provide Covid-19 

materials and guidance in local Ghanaian 

languages, as much of the information on 

Covid-19 is provided in English. In Nigeria 

the Covid-19 Relief Fund supported a project 

with Slum2School, to engage 3,000 nursery, 

primary and secondary school learners 

between May and December across 

20 vulnerable communities. 

 

— Jackson used the fund to support immediate 

community needs resulting from Covid-19. 

Jackson awarded $150,000 to non-profits 

across Chicago, Lansing and Nashville, 

providing direct financial assistance in 

tandem with long-term financial coaching and 

education to individuals and families impacted 

by the pandemic. This strategic approach 

provided immediate support for the most 

vulnerable while working toward a more 

secure financial future, core to both Jackson’s 

philanthropic and business purposes.

In addition to the Covid-19 Relief fund, Prudential 

supported communities through other initiatives:

 

— With elderly people facing a higher risk from 

Covid-19 than the general population, 

Prudence Foundation partnered with HelpAge 

International. Prudence Foundation supported 

the production of two Safe Steps Elderly Care 

videos, which provided simple and clear 

guidelines to care-givers on how to protect older 

people in care homes, prevent infection and 

ensure appropriate measures for care-givers’ 

health and safety. HelpAge is working with its 

network members in Asia alongside the care 

homes and local governments to disseminate 

these guidelines to over 1,200 recipients 

directly. The videos have been translated into 

five languages and a dedicated website was 

created to host the information and videos. 

The videos were available on YouTube, 

Facebook and Twitter during August 2020, 

reaching over 42,000 people.

 

— Jackson has also provided a total of 

$1.34 million in community grants to support 

non-profits, which are facing reduced 

fundraising revenue.

— Since April, Jackson wholesalers have 

conducted webinars where, for each adviser 

in attendance, a donation is made to the 

Feeding America Food Bank in the adviser’s 

local community. Donations totalling $350,100 

have been made to more than 100 different 

food banks across the country, meaning 

Jackson has helped to provide over 3.5 million 

meals. Jackson has also partnered with 

the Nashville Food Project, preparing 6,075 

meals for at-risk youth in the underused 

corporate dining centre.

Financial education

Developed by Prudential to address the gap 

in financial literacy for children, Cha-Ching is 

a global financial education and responsibility 

programme catering for children aged seven to 

12 years old. Now in its 10th year, the programme 

continues to grow and expand across all our 

markets and is well received by educators, 

parents, children and government stakeholders. 

For more information on our approach to 

promoting financial literacy and how it supports 

making health and financial security more 

accessible, please see page 16. 

Safety 

Safe Steps

Safe Steps is a campaign designed to provide 

key messaging and raise awareness on life-saving 

issues across our markets. It now covers disasters, 

road safety, first aid and Covid-19. Developed 

in partnership with the International Federation 

of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) 

and NatGeo, it continues to reach millions of 

people in Asia and Africa via numerous media 

and government partnerships. The Safe Steps 

programmes have also been made available 

and shared on Prudential’s Pulse super-app in 

Hong Kong and the Philippines, and through local 

television and media partnerships and government 

partnerships in Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia, 

the Philippines and Vietnam over the years. 

A new Safe Steps Covid-19 campaign was also 

developed in partnership with the IFRC and 

NatGeo and launched in March 2020, providing 

key educational messages and awareness on 

Covid-19. The campaign has been distributed 

throughout the year across Asia and Africa, 

leveraging the Safe Steps network. 

Building on the success of Safe Steps, in 2019 

Prudence Foundation launched Safe Steps Kids, 

a partnership with the IFRC and Cartoon Network. 

This initiative uses popular cartoon characters 

to equip millions of children with actionable 

information to protect themselves and others 

in the event of emergencies or disaster situations. 

The programme has been leveraged by 

local national Red Cross societies in Malaysia, 

Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines 

through school activities, reaching more than 

2,500 students directly. In 2020, in view of the 

pandemic, Safe Steps Kids online activities have 

been organised by the Malaysia Red Crescent 

Society and Indonesian Red Cross Society. 

Safe Steps continues to have significant reach. 

For example:

 

— Safe Steps programmes continue to reach 

over 250 million people a day in Asia and 

80 million people a month in Africa via 

media partnerships;

 

— Safe Steps Kids has a TV reach of 31 million 

households every day; and

 

— On social media, Safe Steps Kids has 

reached over 11 million viewers, and its videos 

have been viewed 3.1 million times across 

all digital platforms. 

Safe Steps Road Safety Africa was launched in 

Côte d’Ivoire at the end of 2019 and continues to 

be promoted across the continent via multimedia 

distribution on both regional and national TV 

networks. In December 2020, the campaign was 

launched in Zambia in partnership with the Road 

Traffic Safety Agency, the Red Cross and several 

media partners. 

Safe Steps D-Tech Awards

In addition to providing life-saving information, 

Prudence Foundation launched the Disaster Tech 

(D-Tech) Innovation Programme in 2019. 

The objective of the programme is to find, fund 

and support innovative disaster tech solutions that 

could save lives in natural disaster events, and to 

catalyse innovation and increase investment and 

non-financial support through partnerships. The 

programme has been unified with the Safe Steps 

programme and relaunched as the Safe Steps 

D-Tech Awards. Efforts in 2020 have focused on 

preparing for the next competition to be held in 

2021. The second edition of the awards launched 

in December 2020, inviting applicants across both 

profit and non-profit sectors. Finalists will be 

announced in June 2021 and will have the 

opportunity to receive grants from a pool of 

$200,000, as well as mentorship, technology 

support and access to investor networks. 

Our network of partners supporting the D-Tech 

Awards has grown to include humanitarian 

partner IFRC, technology partner Lenovo and 

strategic partners Antler, AVPN, National 

Geographic, e27, Give2Asia, Hatcher+, Jubilee 

Capital Management and Tech for Impact 

among others.

Disaster risk reduction in schools

The Comprehensive Safe Schools Framework 

(CSSF) is a globally recognised framework to 

ensure that all children are educated in a safe 

environment. At its core, the framework focuses 

on three key pillars – school infrastructure, school 

disaster management and disaster risk education, 

with an emphasis on disasters to which schools 

and communities may be exposed. Since 2013, 

Prudence Foundation has been supporting the 

implementation of Safe Schools in partnership 

with Save the Children and Plan International, 

which aims to address the objectives of the CSSF, 

as well as the objectives of the Sendai Framework 

for Disaster Risk Reduction.

Strategic Enablers 


To date, Safe Schools has been implemented in 

Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and the 

Philippines, with 90,000 students directly trained 

in capacity building, training and planning, 

together with 42,000 adults across five countries. 

In 2019 Prudence Foundation renewed its 

partnership with Plan International to roll out 

the programme across Thailand, Cambodia and 

the Philippines between 2019 and 2022, aiming 

to reach a further 20,000 children and adults 

by the end of 2022. 

In the Philippines, Prudence Foundation has 

partnered with Save the Children and the 

Philippines’ Department of Education on a 

strategic initiative to develop a management 

information system for schools designed to reduce 

disaster risk, together with training and capacity 

building for teachers and local government 

officials. As of 2020, the project has successfully 

completed the build of a comprehensive Disaster 

Risk Reduction Management Information System 

(DRRMIS). The system is now being piloted in 

selected regions, with the eventual aim for a 

nationwide roll-out once the pilot is completed 

at the end of 2021, potentially benefiting over 

20 million students and almost 47,000 schools 

nationwide. External consultants have also been 

engaged to conduct an independent evaluation 

of the programme, with the intent to share 

evidence-based impacts and build a case study 

for other governments to reduce disaster risk 

and replicate this approach across other countries.

Health 

A key area of focus for Prudence Foundation 

has been early childhood care and development. 

In 2020, Prudence Foundation entered a new 

partnership with UNICEF to implement a regional 

Early Childhood Development (ECD) programme. 

The programme focuses on developing a regional 

strategy to advance ECD aligned with the 

Nurturing Care Framework, and implementing 

an effective communication strategy to raise 

awareness around holistic nurturing care for 

children aged up to three years old. The 

communication strategy seeks to raise awareness 

and to provide essential knowledge and skills to 

parents and care-givers around holistic nurturing 

care for children aged from birth to three years 

old, which is of particular importance during 

the Covid-19 pandemic, which has adversely 

impacted young children. The programme will 

be piloted in Indonesia to reach 90,000 children 

and their parents or care-givers by the end 

of 2021. 

Prudence Foundation has become a founding 

member of The China Children Development 

Fund, which aims to promote healthy and 

comprehensive child development in poor areas 

in China by supporting cross-disciplinary empirical 

research and translating the results into policies 

and practices. We also support two three-year 

ECD programmes in rural China under the China 

Development Research Foundation. REACH 

(Rural Education and Child Health) is a programme 

aimed at enhancing parental capabilities and 

behaviours as well as improving children’s health 

with nutritional support. Under this programme 

over 1,500 children will be impacted. The second 

programme is a nutrition improvement 

programme, which focuses on improving the 

quality and standards of school nutrition in 

poverty-stricken areas.

Jackson’s community investment approach

Jackson engages its colleagues and strengthens 

its links with local communities by providing 

grants, community sponsorships, donation 

matching and volunteering hours across Lansing, 

Chicago and Nashville, and nationally through 

the Jackson Charitable Foundation to increase 

financial education across the country. 

 

— Lansing: In June, Jackson announced a 

$750,000 partnership with the Greater 

Lansing Food Bank to expand the food bank’s 

warehouse. This campaign engaged more 

than 430 colleagues who personally donated 

to the project. The new warehouse doubled 

the square footage, allowing the campaign 

to increase overall distribution of food from 

9 million meals annually to 18 million meals 

by 2025 and increase daily volunteers by 

100 per cent.

 

— Nashville: On 3 March 2020, tornadoes caused 

devastation in communities across Greater 

Nashville, leaving 25 people dead and 309 

injured, and destroying many homes and 

businesses. Jackson colleagues supported 

tornado relief efforts with supply collections, 

volunteer opportunities and matched funding 

donations to the Community Foundation of 

Middle Tennessee’s (CFMT) Emergency 

Response Fund. Colleagues contributed 

$19,620 and volunteered 181 hours towards 

relief efforts.

 

— Volunteering: In 2020, 848 Jackson associates 

volunteered, with the company contributing 

over 29,000 volunteer hours nationally. 

For the sixth time, Jackson was awarded the 

US President’s Volunteer Service Award. This 

year, the recognition was elevated to the Gold 

level in recognition of completing 15,000 hours 

of volunteering with Junior Achievement 

during the 2018-2019 school year teaching 

financial education and work readiness.

London community investment activity 

Prudential RideLondon first took place in 2013, 

and has become the world’s greatest festival of 

cycling, inspiring tens of thousands of people to 

take up the sport and raising over £77 million for 

charity from 2013 to 2019. In 2020, the final year of 

Prudential’s sponsorship, the event was replaced 

with a virtual event, My Prudential RideLondon, 

due to the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 10,000 

people signed up to take on a range of challenges 

both in the UK and across the world, with 

participants riding as far afield as the US, Brazil, 

Kenya, Japan and Australia, and £3 million was 

raised for charity.

In 2020, Prudential’s London Head Office 

agreed new three-year partnerships with four 

local charities supporting projects tackling 

homelessness, isolation and loneliness, mental 

health and social inclusion. Partnerships were 

established with The Connection at St Martin’s; 

The Cares Family; Mind in the City, Hackney and 

Waltham Forest; and The Amos Bursary. The four 

charities were chosen by a panel of colleague 

volunteers and the projects are all closely aligned 

with our overall ESG strategy in helping to make 

health and financial security available to 

underserved communities.

6  Strategic Enabler:  

Good governance and 

responsible business practices

Strong governance processes are the foundation 

of our business and critical to maintaining trust 

with stakeholders, particularly in the highly 

regulated financial markets within which we 

operate. Our governance framework is clear about 

our standards of behaviour and those standards 

flow into every part of what we do, including our 

financial performance and tax practices, as well as 

operating to mitigate financial crime and informing 

how we deal with our customers and suppliers. 

We also recognise the importance of reducing 

the direct impact of our own operations on the 

environment and see this as a non-negotiable 

responsible business practice.

Standards of conduct

Our Group Code of Business Conduct sits at 

the heart of the Group Governance Manual, 

our internal governance framework that sets out 

the principles by which we conduct our business 

and ourselves. The Code highlights the ethical 

standards that the Board expects of itself, our 

employees, our agents and others working on 

behalf of the Group, and is supported by a set 

of Group-wide principles and values that define 

how the Group expects business to be conducted 

in order to achieve its strategic objectives. 

Our Group Governance Manual presents our 

Group-wide approach to governance, risk 

management and internal control, and is subject 

to regular review to ensure that we meet the 

expectations of our stakeholders. In 2020 the 

Group Governance Manual was updated to align 

with our post-demerger structure and revised 

operating model, and now serves as the single 

governance data source for all colleagues across 

the Group. Each business must certify annual 

compliance with the requirements set out in 

the Manual, including the Code, Delegated 

Authorities and Group-wide policies. 

Tax strategy and reporting

The responsible and sustainable management 

of our tax affairs helps us to maintain constructive 

relations with our stakeholders and play a positive 

role in the economy and the wider communities 

in which we operate. In 2020 we made a total tax 

contribution of $2,114 million. This significant 

contribution plays an important part in helping 

the communities in which we operate to provide 

valuable public services and build infrastructure 

for the benefit of the wider community and 

the economy.

We understand the importance of paying the 

right amount of tax on time. We manage our tax 

affairs transparently and seek to build constructive 

relationships with tax authorities in all the 

countries in which we operate. Our Tax Risk 

Policy outlines our processes to identify, measure, 

control and report on tax risk, and is regularly 

reviewed and refreshed.

Our tax strategy is published annually and 

complies with the mandatory requirements 

under the UK 2016 Finance Act, focusing on:

 

— Acting responsibly and taking an objective 

view in all our tax matters;

 

— Managing tax in line with our Group 

governance and risk management 

procedures; and 

 

— Ensuring transparency and engagement 

with all our stakeholders.

In addition, our tax strategy document includes 

a number of additional disclosures, including 

a country-by-country disclosure of revenues, 

profits, average employee numbers and taxes for 

countries where more than $5 million tax was paid. 

Furthermore, we provide a breakdown of the 

types and amount of taxes we pay globally. This 

includes taxes borne and collected on employee 

income, such as social security. Our tax strategy 

document also provides more detail on what 

drives our tax payments and demonstrates 

that our tax footprint (ie where we pay taxes) 

remains consistent with our business and 

employee footprint. 

We actively monitor developments in the tax 

transparency agenda and look to further develop 

the disclosure of meaningful tax information to 

help our various stakeholders’ understanding

updated tax strategy, which will include more 

information on the tax we paid in 2020, how we 

manage our tax affairs and the governance and 

management of tax risk, by 31 May 2021.

Fighting financial crime

We take the fight against money laundering, 

terrorist financing, bribery, corruption and fraud 

seriously and are committed to implementing 

and maintaining industry-leading policies 

and standards. 

Our Group-wide financial crime policies were 

updated in 2020 to integrate Group and business 

unit policy requirements, reflecting a streamlined 

governance structure across the Group following 

the demerger of M&amp;G plc. 

All our Group-level financial crime policies are 

cascaded down to local business units through 

regional compliance teams, which ensure 

adherence to the Group requirements and 

applicable local laws and regulations. These 

policies form part of the Group Governance 

Framework, with business units attesting their 

compliance to the requirements each year. During 

the year, the Group and business units undertake 

a range of monitoring activities to ensure that 

business units are complying with Group policies 

and the legal and regulatory framework by which 

we are governed. This includes quarterly 

reporting, annual risk assessments, compliance 

monitoring reviews and reporting to Board-level 

committees, as set out below. Specifically, our 

Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions and 

Anti-Bribery and Corruption policies provide clear 

standards and guidance to our diverse businesses 

and highlight the importance of effective due 

diligence when dealing with customers, vendors 

and other third parties. 

We complete annual risk assessments across 

all our businesses to assess and monitor their 

risk profile. The residual financial crime risk 

is managed through the continuous enhancement 

of the control environment and is implemented at 

local level. In recent years we have implemented 

an automated transaction monitoring system in 

Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines 

and Vietnam to profile transactions and identify 

suspicious activities for reporting to law 

enforcement agencies. 

We are committed to complying with international 

sanctions requirements and continue to monitor 

international sanctions closely, integrating 

updated lists into our regular customer and vendor 

screening processes. During the course of 2020, 

we have focused in particular on the US-China 

sanctions that have been issued in order to assess 

their impact on our business activities. We have 

upgraded our screening capabilities across all of 

our Asian businesses, ensuring compliance with 

regulatory requirements and improving 

operational efficiency. 

The Group Risk Committee continues to review 

the effectiveness of the financial crime programme 

and the Group Compliance team regularly updates 

the Committee on risks, issues, the effectiveness 

of controls and the improvements made to 

processes in the financial crime framework. 

The Group Risk Committee regularly reviews a 

number of risk indicators in relation to financial 

crime, including the numbers and percentages 

of high-risk customers and politically exposed 

persons, and seeks investigation of movements.

It also reviews trends in automated transaction 

activity alerts and employee-generated suspicious 

transaction reports. The Committee also reviews 

gifts and hospitality received and offered to 

ensure that they comply with our policy. All 

material matters on financial crime are reported 

to the Committee. 

The financial crime teams remain committed 

to professional development and regularly 

participate in conferences and seminars in the UK, 

the US, Hong Kong and Singapore to build 

colleagues’ skills and knowledge in specialist 

areas. Best practices are cascaded through 

training and communications, as well as the 

implementation of enhancements to operational 

systems. These ensure that our colleagues are 

fully prepared to recognise any form of economic 

crime and take adequate steps to combat it. 

We provide training to our staff to ensure that 

they are familiar with international standards and 

best practice, as well as being well equipped to 

implement our policies in their respective markets. 

Training completion levels are monitored 

throughout the year. 

Whistleblowing 

Our Group-wide whistleblowing procedures 

apply to all our colleagues and are supported by 

Speak Out, our Group-wide whistleblowing 

programme. Speak Out is available both internally 

and externally to staff, contractors, vendors, 

agents, customers and the public, enabling 

reporters to raise concerns in a choice of 

languages through web and hotline channels. 

Reporters are able to log concerns covering a 

range of issues, including but not limited to 

anti-bribery and corruption, compliance breaches, 

discrimination and harassment and health and 

safety. Concerns are recorded by an independent 

third party and investigated by internal 

appropriately trained and skilled investigators 

that are independent of the businesses they 

investigate. On an annual basis, all colleagues 

are required to complete a Speak Out computer-

based training module. The programme is 

also supported by communications and 

awareness materials. 

Whistleblowing reporting is overseen by the 

Group Audit Committee and business unit audit 

committees through quarterly reporting and 

through frequent discussion with the Group 

Resilience Director, with any material issues 

reported to the Board. On an annual basis, 

emerging trends and an assessment of the 

effectiveness of our whistleblowing approach 

are reported to the Group Audit Committee.

The Speak Out programme is widely used 

throughout the Group, and during 2020 cases 

were reported across 24 jurisdictions, including 

the US, the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore and the 

Philippines. The number of cases reported across 

our Asian business units represented 87 per cent 

of Speak Out cases, which is a reflection of our 

business footprint. During 2020, the top three 

issues reported through our whistleblowing 

channels related to discrimination, harassment 

or unfair treatment, compliance breaches and 

misconduct. HR-related cases accounted for 

43 per cent of the total cases reported. This figure 

is in line with the external benchmarks that we 

use to monitor our Speak Out programme. 

The percentage of cases being reported openly, 

rather than anonymously, increased by 3 per cent 

year-on-year from 2019, which is considered an 

indicator of growing trust and confidence in the 

programme. Our Group Security Policy outlines 

our zero-tolerance approach to retaliation against 

reporters of any concerns raised via Speak Out.

Supply chain

Our Group Code of Business Conduct outlines 

the values and standards that are required of each 

of our suppliers. Our Group Third Party Supply 

Policy is core to our supply chain governance 

and specifies our position on supply chain 

management, setting out our approach to 

due diligence, selection criteria, contractual 

requirements and ongoing monitoring 

of relationships. 

Business units conduct due diligence before 

engaging with, and ultimately selecting, a new 

supplier. We perform regular due diligence, 

including daily anti-money laundering checks on 

our supplier payments, supplier review meetings 

and audits where required, and our policies and 

procedures are supported by regular employee 

training exercises.

Our due diligence requires our suppliers to pass 

financial stability tests and demonstrate a track 

record of high performance. We also review the 

controls the supplier has in place to prevent data 

leakage and look for any personal data protection 

issues. Additional due diligence is enacted for any 

problem categories where we are exposed to 

potential labour malpractice issues. Our Speak 

Out whistleblowing service enables employees 

to raise any concerns they may have in relation 

to our third-party relationships, and our 

contractors and third-party suppliers are also 

able to use this service.

In Asia, we have continued to progress our roll-out 

of the Coupa procurement management platform 

across our business units. By improving visibility 

across all third party spend, the system will 

facilitate cost savings, procurement and expense 

controls and process efficiencies. The system has 

now been implemented across our businesses 

in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, 

Indonesia and the Philippines. Our business units 

in Vietnam and Taiwan and our asset management 

business, Eastspring, are expected to roll-out 

Coupa over the course of 2021, ensuring that 

more than 80 per cent of our third-party 

expenditure in Asia is processed and approved 

on one common platform.

We are also rolling out a dedicated third-party risk 

management system module and accompanying 

processes that will digitise and automate our 

vendor governance procedures, enabling us to 

complete all necessary risk assessments as part 

of our vendor and contract onboarding processes. 

This system module, Coupa Risk Assess, 

integrates into our Coupa procurement 

management platform and will provide us with 

detailed visibility of third-party risks across all our 

key risk domains, in particular information and 

technology security, data privacy, anti-bribery and 

corruption and business continuity and resiliency 

risks. This will improve our ability to mitigate risks 

and strengthen preventative risk management 

controls, thereby improving the resilience of our 

supply chain collaboratively with our vendors, 

providing greater assurance on our operating 

business environment. Coupa Risk Assess will 

also enable us to generate detailed insights into 

the level of commitment to ESG issues across 

our supplier footprint. The implementation is 

expected to be completed across all our markets 

in Asia during 2021.

To ensure that ESG is embedded in our end-to-

end procurement processes, we have developed 

a specific ESG question set and scoring matrix. 

This is now incorporated in all our Global RFPs 

(request for pricing) issued to suppliers during the 

tender stage and requires a formal response by 

the potential supplier in respect of the following:

 

— Their commitment to ESG globally;

 

— Governance of ESG within their organisation;

 

— The leadership structure they have within their 

own organisation on ESG matters;

 

— ESG transparency on reporting and how that 

is executed;

 

— The responsible sourcing practices they use 

for their own supply chain buying;

 

— The use of management systems to track 

their own ESG compliance;

 

— Ethics and policy documents with their 

organisation to formally mandate ESG topics;

 

— Labour practice documents (to confirm ethical 

behaviour/modern slavery controls);

 

— Health and Safety best practices are confirmed 

as embedded for employee wellbeing; and 

 

— Initiatives the supplier is launching to enhance 

their own ESG agenda.

Upholding our commitments to human rights 

Being a responsible business requires 

organisations to ensure that they meet and strive 

to surpass commitments to the UN’s Declaration 

of Human Rights. We are committed to ensuring 

that modern slavery, human trafficking, child 

labour or any other issue that subjugates human 

rights is eradicated from our supply chain. For 

more information around how we are identifying 

and managing our risks in relation to modern 

slavery, human trafficking, and child and 

forced labour, please read our Modern Slavery 

Statement on the Prudential plc website.

Across Asia, we apply the Third Party Risk 

Management policy, which ensures compliance to 

the Group’s Third Party Supply policy. All third-

party agreements across all countries in Asia are 

required to undergo due diligence activities, 

which include human trafficking, anti-money 

laundering and anti-bribery and corruption 

checks on the third parties that we deal with. 

As in 2019, we reviewed our UK supplier spend to 

examine and reconfirm that, against the Walk Free 

Foundation’s Global Slavery Index, we are not 

exposed to modern slavery issues in our supply 

chain. Our repeat review of this exercise has 

identified that, across the top 100 countries in the 

index, 2.5 per cent of UK procurement spend is 

exposed to these territories. This compares to 

2.8 per cent in 2019. Our spend in these countries 

is in categories that are typically considered to be 

low-risk, such as property rental and professional 

services. Full supplier due diligence is maintained 

in these areas to avoid any potential issues and an 

expert panel meets each week to review both new 

contracts and renewals to ensure that we remain 

vigilant on potential modern slavery exposure and 

ESG topics. In the UK, we require our suppliers 

to pay their employees the London or UK Living 

Wage, as set by the Greater London Authority and 

Centre for Research in Social Policy respectively.

Responsible working practices and health 

and safety procedures

Prudential recognises the importance of health, 

safety and wellbeing to help staff get the most 

out of life and meet our business objectives. 

By providing a safe and healthy workplace and 

preventing work-related injury and ill-health 

through the implementation of appropriate 

policy and standards, we are able to provide an 

environment that helps employees to connect, 

grow and succeed in their work. In 2020 the 

Group-level policy and standards were revised 

and aligned with ISO 45001:2018, the 

international standard for Occupational Health 

and Safety. The policy and standards apply to 

all our companies, locations and activities. 

For the year ending 31 December 2020, no 

work-related fatalities were recorded (2019: zero). 

There were 30 health and safety incidents, 

resulting in 422 days of lost time (2019: 74 

incidents resulting in 203 days of lost time). 

The increase in lost time is accounted for by 

two incidents in the United States: a road traffic 

accident (164 lost days), and a manual handling 

case (198 lost days). 

Health and safety programmes across the 

Group have this year primarily focused on the 

response to Covid-19, ensuring that appropriate 

precautions are implemented in the workplace. 

We have also focused on providing training and 

awareness on prevention measures and health 

and safety best practices for the home. 

Communications are regularly sent to staff 

reminding them of the behaviours and protocols 

needed to protect themselves and the wider 

community from Covid-19. Our communications 

have focused on local regulatory changes, 

maintaining high standards of hygiene, protocols 

around health monitoring and attendance at the 

office, and sensible social distancing. Where staff 

have returned to the office, masks are encouraged 

to be worn by staff in common areas of the office 

and in some jurisdictions this is mandated due to 

local regulations. The Group has also provided 

intranet resource centres where staff can seek 

information concerning Covid-19 precautions 

and best practices, travel restrictions and 

Covid-related news. 

Health and safety teams across the Group have 

provided online seminars for staff and are available 

to staff should they have any questions or 

concerns. We have also implemented PRUThrive, 

a holistic wellbeing programme to support the 

mental, physical, financial, family and social 

wellbeing of employees. We also provide 

a 24-hour Employee Assistance Programme, 

offering support and advice through an external 

provider, and in 2020 launched a science-based 

mental health and wellbeing app.



Case study

Supporting smaller 

suppliers during 

Covid-19

In our commitment to supporting our 

supply chain through the difficult trading 

circumstances triggered by the global 

pandemic, we provided payment assistance 

from March 2020. We immediately 

switched to 10-day payment terms for 

all our London head office small suppliers 

with under 100 employees. This has so far 

benefited 136 suppliers with a total of 

£6 million of accelerated payments made 

to assist their cash flow.

Treating customers fairly and responsible 

product design 

The value that products are likely to bring to our 

customers and the quality of product materials 

and ongoing communications are given the utmost 

consideration in our businesses. Although many of 

the financial needs and objectives of our customers 

are simple, the products we design may seem 

complex from a customer’s perspective. This 

complexity may make it difficult for a customer to 

understand the costs and value of the product, and 

how best to utilise the product to meet their needs. 

Prudential’s products are designed in accordance 

with customer conduct standards of treating 

customers fairly and of providing products and 

services that meet customer needs, are easy to 

understand and deliver real value. We design 

products with a deep understanding of the target 

customers’ protection and savings needs across 

their life stages. Our development process 

includes the assessment of policyholders’ 

reasonable expectations created by the product 

and determines how those expectations are met 

and managed throughout the product life cycle.

We aim to simplify our insurance products and 

how they are explained in product documentation 

and by salespersons, so that customers can easily 

understand the features, benefits and associated 

terms and conditions and are able to clearly assess 

how products fit with their needs. To protect 

vulnerable customers, our product development 

process identifies customer segments for 

whom the product is not suitable and/or where 

assistance and further protection might be 

needed during the sales journey (eg additional 

point of sales controls, welcome calls). Identifying 

and treating vulnerable customers with extra care 

is a core component of training for our sales force. 

New products are approved by business unit 

product committees that comprise of participants 

from relevant business functions to ensure there 

is a complete understanding of product risks, 

including financial, capital and regulatory 

considerations, as well as a focus on the potential 

customer experience. 

Through Pulse, our health and wealth super-app, 

we are increasingly focused on making insurance 

more inclusive to underserved populations of 

society, through bite-sized digital products and 

services at little or no cost, and minimal or no 

underwriting criteria or barriers. We are also 

expanding from mortality and morbidity 

protection, to helping people prevent and 

postpone adverse health events. Accessible 

to everyone, Pulse combines healthcare and 

technology to help and incentivise people to 

prevent and postpone disease and protect 

customers by empowering them to take control 

of their health and wellbeing. We are also working 

with our distribution partners to increasingly 

design protection products with diversity and 

inclusion in mind, such as creating products for 

gender-specific needs.

We strive to ensure our claims process is simple, 

fair and transparent, and our staff and agents are 

professionally trained to support customers in 

their time of need. Each of our businesses closely 

monitors customer satisfaction using surveys at 

touchpoints throughout the customer journey, 

and also through the monitoring of complaints. 

Our businesses are required to comply with their 

local regulatory requirements and meet our 

Group-wide policies and standards, including 

our Group Code of Business Conduct and our 

Customer Conduct Risk Policy, which covers 

the fair treatment of customers. Compliance is 

achieved through the regular training of 

intermediaries to ensure that the salesforce has 

a clear understanding of our products, the target 

customers for each product, and the customer 

risks inherent in each product; and through the 

embedding of controls, including customer 

financial needs analysis and risk appetite profiling, 

to ensure the suitability of product sales. We are 

increasingly using technology, particularly 

electronic point-of-sale tools and e-submissions, 

to control the sales process and provide sufficient 

consumer safeguards. During 2020, our 

compliance controls evolved as we introduced 

virtual face-to-face selling and remote selling 

options during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Compliance monitoring is performed across the 

customer and product life cycle, and disciplinary 

frameworks reinforce compliance through actions 

up to and including termination. 

Management of direct operational 

environmental impacts

We seek to actively reduce our direct impact 

on the environment in line with our purpose of 

improving the lives of our customers and their 

communities. To understand our impact, 

we measure our environmental performance 

and take action to improve our performance. 

Our Group Environment Policy forms part of our 

Group Governance Manual and applies to our 

operational properties worldwide, guiding our 

approach to the management of the direct impacts 

of our business units. This includes compliance 

with environmental laws and regulations with 

respect to emissions, energy consumption, water 

use, waste disposal, environmental supply chain 

management and the adoption of risk 

management principles for all property-related 

matters. As with all policies, business unit 

performance is monitored against the Group 

Environment Policy and updates are provided 

to the Board. More information on our broader 

strategic approach to the management of climate 

change risks and opportunities is provided in 

the stewarding of the human impacts of climate 

change section on page 20 of this report.

The highlights of our 2020 environmental 

performance are available below. Our 2020 

reporting covers the period 1 October 2019 

to 30 September 2020, and selected indicators 

are assured by Deloitte LLP. Where relevant, 

comparatives have been restated to remove 

M&amp;G data. 

We have set a target to become net carbon 

neutral across our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 

by the end of 2030, through a combination of 

a 25 per cent reduction per full time employee 

(FTE) in our operational emissions, and the 

implementation of carbon offsetting initiatives. 

The expression of the target in terms of an 

intensity ratio, rather than as a gross emissions 

figure, allows for the future growth in the size of 

our business, while driving improvements in the 

overall efficiency of our operations. These targets 

will take effect from 2021. Further details are 

provided later in this section.

Energy and emissions data

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are broken 

down into three scopes. We have included 

full reporting for Scope 1 and 2 and selected  

Scope 3 reporting. Scope 1 emissions are our 

direct emissions from the combustion of fuel, 

fugitive emissions and company-owned vehicles. 

Scope 2 emissions cover our indirect emissions 

from the purchase of electricity, heating and 

cooling. We have stated our Scope 2 emissions 

using both the location and market-based 

methods in line with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 

Guidance. Our Scope 3 footprint includes 

UK-booked business travel, water consumption 

from the UK, US and Asia, and waste generated 

from the UK and US. Aligned with our past 

commitments, we chose to offset our 

UK-procured air travel emissions.

Across our occupied estate, our global absolute 

Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emissions 

were 48,840 tCO2e, down 13.4 per cent on 2019. 

The main driver of the decline was the widespread 

reduction in energy use within our office network 

associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.

When normalised against net lettable floor area, 

our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 96.24 kg CO2e/

m2. This represented an 8.7 per cent reduction 

over 2019. 

The magnitude of the decline across the total 

Scope 1 and 2 emissions was relatively modest, 

given the scale of the operational disruption 

caused by the pandemic. This reflects that most 

of the office estate in Asia and Africa remained 

open through the period to support a continued, 

albeit reduced, employee presence (through 

for example split team working). With social 

distancing measures in operation, the increased 

floor space required for each employee did not 

result in a proportionate reduction in energy use. 

It should also be noted that the effect of the timing 

of the reporting period for Group emissions 

(1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020) means 

that only nine months of pandemic-related 

impacts were captured in the 2020 reporting. 

With more of our employees working from home 

(and, therefore, consuming electricity) there has 

been an increase in emissions from this source, 

which has not been captured in our reporting.  

We have, however, started work to model the 

potential impact in order to understand the 

associated implications, noting that these would 

technically be categorised as Scope 3 emissions.

Total Scope 3 reported emissions fell by nearly 

two-thirds to 2,164 tCO2e. Air travel, which 

accounts for the majority of reported Scope 3 

emissions, and it fell by 67.7 per cent to 1,965 

tCO2e reflecting the impact of travel restrictions 

and other control measures related to the 

pandemic. We continue to work with our business 

units across all of our regions to extend our Scope 

3 emission reporting.

Across Scope 1, 2 and 3, emissions per square 

metre fell 14.1 per cent to 100.51 kg CO2e/m2.

In 2021, we intend to review our Scope 3 reporting 

boundaries and broaden these over time. 

Our ultimate intention is to calculate and disclose 

emissions from our wider supply chain and 

investment portfolio in line with broader 

improvements in the quality of data and breadth 

of disclosures. 

Regional emission trends

The restructuring of the Group, resulting in the 

demerger of M&amp;G, has substantially reduced the 

Group’s office footprint in the UK. The majority of 

the estate is now located in Asia and, to a lesser 

extent, in Africa. 

Asia’s Scope 2 emissions have been in decline 

since 2017, falling to 23,183 tCO2e for Scope 2 

emissions from 26,627 tCO2e in 2019 and were 

impacted by the pandemic, as noted above. 

During 2020, a total of 34 energy efficiency and 

behavioural change projects were carried out in 

Asia, with a combined estimated saving of 895 

tCO2e per year. Measures implemented included 

the installation of LED lighting, installation of 

direct current motors in fan coil units and reducing 

lighting operation hours. We also implemented 

eight waste reduction initiatives in 2020, including 

initiatives such as donating excess furniture to be 

used in an agency office rather than disposal in 

Malaysia, and providing reusable lunch bags and 

reducing the use of plastic single use water bottles 

in Indonesia.

Our occupied estate in Africa expanded by 

68 per cent in 2020, with a concurrent increase 

in headcount of 75 per cent, and we expect the 

Africa footprint to continue to grow. The gathering 

of energy data in Africa continues to become more 

reliable, leading to improvements in data quality 

and completeness.

The Jackson property portfolio represents 

26 per cent of the occupied area of Prudential 

and accounts for 49 per cent of the Scope 1 and 2 

emissions footprint. This is predominately due to 

the presence of data and disaster recovery centres 

in the portfolio, which are very energy-intensive 

and against which it is more challenging to deliver 

energy saving. However, there has been a 

12.1 per cent intensity reduction in Scope 1 and 2 

emissions in 2020, reducing them to 179 kg CO2e/

m2. These reductions can be attributed 

predominantly to lower occupancy and shutdowns 

associated with the pandemic, as the occupied area 

and overall headcount have remained consistent 

with 2019. The impact of the pandemic is also noted 

in the 35 per cent reduction in Scope 1 emissions.

Waste and recycling 

The quality of our waste and recycling reporting 

continues to improve, although some challenges 

remain. For example, where we are tenants in 

multi-tenanted buildings, the data is only provided 

to us on a consolidated basis and not broken down 

by individual tenant. 

During 2020 we generated 749 tonnes of waste in 

the UK and US included in our Scope 3 reporting. 

The Scope 3 carbon emissions associated with our 

total waste generation are calculated at 140 tCO2e, 

a minor contribution to our overall corporate 

footprint in comparison with the energy use of 

our buildings and air travel. Of the UK and the 

US total, 62 per cent was diverted from landfill 

through recycling, composting or incineration. 

The gathering of waste data in Asia has increased 

in 2020. We have developed a set of Waste 

Management Guidelines to raise awareness of 

the importance of accurate reporting of waste, 

as well as to practical advice on waste reduction 

measures for employees engaged in waste 

management activities.

Water consumption 

In 2020, absolute use of water across our 

global occupied estate (excluding Africa) was 

170,648 m3, an intensity ratio of 0.35m3/m2, 

a reduction of 26 per cent when compared with 

our like-for-like water consumption in 2019. 

As part of our site assessment programme in Asia, 

the inspection team looked at our water usage to 

identify ways in which we could reduce our water 

consumption. As we are predominately tenants in 

multi-tenanted buildings, where the landlords are 

responsible for the maintenance and management 

of the air conditioning, toilets and other common 

facilities, only limited opportunities to reduce our 

water consumption were identified.

Global environmental targets

In 2016 we developed a global environmental 

targets framework to drive improvements in 

environmental operational performance. 

As reported in our 2019 report, this framework 

was based on the operational footprint of the 

pre-demerger Prudential Group and, as such, 

several targets are no longer relevant to the 

demerged Group. 

Our Asian operations have completed four of their 

five targets, and partially completed the fifth target. 

Through the programmes implemented as part of 

this process, we have gained a greater insight into 

how our sites currently consume energy and the 

opportunities to reduce this consumption. Notably, 

we have completed an environmental emission 

review for the 20 largest energy-consuming 

locations; created environmental guidelines for 

all new leasing and fit-out projects; and reviewed 

our water efficiency and waste management with 

guidelines adopted by our businesses. The energy 

management campaign was delayed to better 

leverage the data collected in the energy 

assessment, and then further delayed by 

the Covid-19 pandemic, but will be launched 

in 2021 to support our new targets.

New targets for 2030

During 2020, we reviewed our global 

environmental targets framework and have 

established new targets for the period 2021 to 

2030. Our aim is to become net carbon-neutral 

across our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 

the end of 2030, through a combination of 

a 25 per cent reduction (per FTE) in our 

operational emissions and implementing carbon 

offsetting initiatives. This commitment is aligned 

to our purpose of helping people get the most 

out of life by enabling a lower-carbon economy 

through good governance and responsible 

business practices. The new target will apply 

across all our operations and improve our ability 

to communicate a simple and clear environmental 

strategic direction to all our stakeholders.

During 2020, we engaged a global property 

services company in a multi-year contract to 

provide specialist environmental consultancy 

services to support our aim of reducing 

the intensity ratios in our Scope 1 and 2 

carbon emissions.

Our priority is to reduce our carbon emissions, 

on an intensity metric, and the site assessment 

programme has highlighted a number of initiatives 

that we can implement across the property 

portfolio to achieve this aim, as well as practical 

measures that we can take to deliver operational 

improvements. From these assessments,  

Scope 1 and 2 carbon reduction road maps are 

being developed to support the delivery against 

our target. 

We have gained a clear understanding of how 

we use energy within our property portfolio, 

and given that the majority of our office space 

is leased on relatively short-term commitments, 

we have opportunities to address operational 

improvements as leases come up for renewal 

through implementing energy-saving measures 

or selecting more energy-efficient spaces.

In parallel to these initiatives in our existing 

property portfolio, we are rolling out a campaign 

in 2021 to drive behavioural change in terms 

of energy, water and waste reduction, and 

it is anticipated that this will be vital to the 

achievement of our targets.

We are implementing a range of tools and 

initiatives that will enable further reductions 

in the Group’s energy consumption footprint 

over the longer term. Some examples include 

the development of green leasing and design 

guidelines to assist property management teams 

to select premises and design our workplaces 

that will help achieve energy efficiencies; 

the embedding of sustainability considerations 

being highlighted in our project approval process; 

and improved performance tracking through the 

use of a web-based platform, which will enable 

our businesses to track progress against targets 

at an asset level.

Enforcement actions and 

other regulatory events

No fines or regulatory actions occurred during 

the year for environmental incidents (2019: zero).

Our aim is to become net 

carbon-neutral across our 

Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 

by the end of 2030, through 

a combination of a 25 per cent 

reduction (per FTE) in our 

operational emissions 

and implementing carbon 

offsetting initiatives.
