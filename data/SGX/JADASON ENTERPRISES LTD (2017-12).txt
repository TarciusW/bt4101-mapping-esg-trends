  Dear Stakeholders, 

We are pleased to present Jadason 

Enterprises’ first annual Sustainability 

Report, subscribing to the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Standards, in accordance 

with the Core option.  

In this report, we focus on our factories in 

Dongguan, China as they generate the 

highest  revenue in the Group and have the 

widest material impact on sustainability 

issues. We undertook a comprehensive 

materiality analysis on the operation of the 

factories in Dongguan, China and identified 

the materiality issues that are deemed as 

important to our business and our 

stakeholders.  

The materiality issues that were identified 

from the material topic on corporate 

governance, environmental, economic, and 

social can be found in this report.

Both of our factories in Dongguan, China 

focus on our “Manufacturing and Support 

Services” segment. They rely greatly on 

energy, water and material usage in their 

daily operation. We are well aware that what 

we do will have an impact on the 

environment.  

We had integrated our sustainability 

practices into our business process in both 

factories. We will continue to monitor and 

improve on our sustainability practices to 

reduce the overall environmental impact that 

we had created. 

We strive to drive for continuous operational 

excellence without compromising on the 

environment.

on energy, water and materials 

for their daily operation and are 

accounted for the majority usage 

in the Group. We are well aware 

that with such usage, it will cause a great impact to the environment in a 

long run. This will in turn affect on the sustainability of our business as a 

group.  

In Dongguan, China, we have more than 500 employees being recorded 

for in 2017. With the shortage of manpower, especially in skilled workers, 

we look into ways to provide a more conducive environment for our
