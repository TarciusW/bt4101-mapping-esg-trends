Board statement 

 

We affirm our commitment to sustainability with the publication of our maiden sustainability report (“Report”) 

guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core option. For this Report, we provide insights into 

the way we do business, while highlighting our environmental, social, governance (“ESG”) factors and economic 

performance. 

 

Whilst mindful of our profit-oriented objective, we are committed to strike a balance between growth, profit, 

governance, environment, the development of our people and well-being of our communities to secure the long

6.3 

Materiality assessment 

 

Under our SR Policy, each sustainability factor is assigned a reporting priority that determines the actions 

required as illustrated in the table below: 

Reporting priority 

Description 

Criteria 

I 

High 

Factors with high reporting priority are reported on in detail. 

II 

Medium 

Factors with medium reporting priority are considered for inclusion in 

the Report. If it is decided that such factors are not material, they may 

be excluded from the Report. 

 

III 

 

 

Low 

Factors with low reporting priority may be reported to fulfil regulatory or 

other reporting requirements. They are not included in this Report if not 

material.  

 

The reporting priority is supported by a material factor matrix which considers the level of concern to external 

stakeholders and potential impact on business.   

 

6.4 

Performance tracking and reporting 

 

We track the progress of our material sustainability factors by identifying the relevant data points (i.e. the 

information source of the relevant factor) and measuring them. In addition, performance targets that are aligned 

with our strategy are set to ensure that we maintain the right course in our path to sustainability. We seek to 

constantly enhance our performance-monitoring processes and data capture systems.  

 

7 

Material factors  

 

Our materiality assessment performed for FY2019 involved the Group’s Senior Management in identifying 

sustainability factors deemed material to our businesses and our stakeholders so as to allow us to channel our 

resources judiciously to create sustainable value for our stakeholders.  

 

Presented below are a list of material sustainability factors and material factors matrix applicable to our Group:

Material factors matrix  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We will update the material factors on an annual basis to reflect changes in business operations, environment, 

stakeholder’s feedback and sustainability trends. The details of each material sustainability factor are presented 

as follows: 

 

7.1 

Customer satisfaction 

 

Our strategies towards customer satisfaction are as follows:  

 

Cultivate a long term and sustainable relationship with our partners 

With firm relationships established with our strategic partners, we are able to gain access to distribute a diverse 

range of products under the major brands of Falken, Dunlop, Continental and Toyo to meet our customers’ needs 

and requirements. In addition, our volume purchases allow us to secure competitive pricing which we can then 

offer our customers with value-for-money products.  

 

Adopt market standards for the quality and safety of our products  

For products under our proprietary brands, they are manufactured by selected contracted manufacturers (“CMS”) 

located in Asia under internationally recognised quality standards. The adoption of such standards supports our 

ability to consistently provide products that meet customers’ needs and expectation.  

 

For product safety and consistency in quality, refer to 7.5 for further details 

 

Maintain presence and proximity to our customers  

We have established an international distribution network that spans Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, South 

Africa, Indonesia, Australia, India, Vietnam, Brunei, China and Hong Kong. Our extensive network brings us close 

to the markets we serve and more importantly, to our customers.  

 

Nurture a team of highly trained and experienced employees  

We are dependent on our highly trained and experienced professional staff to serve our customers on the 

products we distribute.  Our strategy to establish a global footprint is driven by a core regional team of trained 

and experienced professional staff.  

 

On our efforts to retain our valued staff, refer to section 7.2 for further details.

7.2 

Equality and diversity in the workplace 

 

We are committed to the goals of diversity and equal opportunity in employment by providing a work environment 

for our employees that fosters fairness, equity and respect for social and cultural diversity, regardless of their 

gender, age and educational background. The total number of full-time employees within the Group as at 30 

April 2019 is 934 (FY2018: 1,021). 

 

 

 

 

On gender diversity, we view diversity on the Board level as an essential element in supporting sustainable 

development with two (FY2018: two) female Board members. The percentage of female to total permanent 

employees is 26% (FY2018: 26%) and about 36% (FY2018: 34%) of managers are females as at 30 April 2019.  

 

On age diversity, matured workers are valued for their experience knowledge and skills. As at 30 April 2019, 

40% (FY2018: 35%) of our workforce is at least 40 years old.  

 

On diversity in educational background, we seek to create an inclusive environment for our employees from 

different educational background. The distribution of staff by educational level is as follows: 

 

Education qualification

To promote equal opportunity, we have implemented various human resource measures as follows: 

 

Human resource policy and employee handbook are in 

place to recruit and promote employees based on merit and 

competency 

 

Staff assessment is performed regularly to evaluate the 

performance of staff and provides staff with sense of self-

awareness to undertake training that will improve their skills 

and abilities 

 

Staff recruitment advertisements do not state age, race, 

gender or religion preferences as requirement 

 

We play an active role in helping our employees who are 

working parents. We provide our employees, in selected 

entities, 

with 

flexible 

work 

arrangements 

wherein 

employees are given greater scheduling freedom to 

accomplish their tasks and allow them to commit both work 

and family.  In addition, we support our employees with 

breastfeeding responsibilities through providing them with 

a comfortable place to express breast milk.

7.3 

Employee retention 

 

The continual success of our business relies on a team of professional, skilled and experienced staff and 

managers. We are committed to employee retention through the following efforts: 

 

a. Performance based rewards  

We recognise employees are key to sustainability and therefore aims to reward employees that are capable and 

dedicated. Under the Group’s performance share plan for managerial level employees, rewards in the form of 

shares are granted to key employees to align their interests with that of the Group. The share plan is subject to 

the review and approval by an independent Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors.  

 

b. Systematic internal human resource processes 

Human resource processes related to employee retention 

includes: 

 

An employee handbook is in place to provide guidance 

on employee benefits and disseminate corporate culture  

 

Employees are engaged regularly via various channels 

such as the appraisal exercise which allows employees 

to gain feedback on their career progress  

 

In-house and external training courses are organised 

regularly for employees to improve their professional 

skills. For example, a systematic training program is in 

place in Thailand to equip sales staff with the needed 

product and service knowledge 

 

We believe a low turnover improves the sustainability of operations and allows us to contribute positively to the 

development of social and human capital in a wider community. As at 30 April 2019, 67% (FY2018: 63%) of the 

employees have more than 3 years of service with us.

7.4 

Safe working environment 

 

In our Group’s daily operations, the workers are required to handle heavy lifting equipment such as forklift to 

transfer inventories. For the wheel factory in Thailand, workers also operate in a high temperature environment 

and use of chemicals such as paints. Given the nature of activities and operating environment, we are 

committed to maintain a safety-conscious culture amongst our employees. 

 

The measures implemented to manage health and safety in the workplace environment are as follows:  

 

A set of safety rules and regulations is in place 

 

A safety committee is in place and safety inspections are 

performed regularly by safety officers and reported to 

senior managers 

 

All new employees are briefed on safety procedures 

during orientation 

 

Regularly track and monitor accidents at the workplace 

and corrective action plans are established to prevent 

recurrences of the accidents 

 

A dedicated first-aid room is maintained at the wheel 

factory in Thailand to provide immediate and effective 

medical treatment to workers or others who sustain 

injuries at the location 

 

The Group recorded zero workplace fatality during the reporting period and 12 (FY2018: 10) non-fatal workplace 

injuries1. Although the incident rate increased marginally, the severity of accidents decreased significantly to 80 

man-days lost (FY2018: 469 man-days) during the reporting period. The non-fatal workplace injuries mainly 

related to hand and leg injuries. We will continuously work towards reducing both the occurrence and severity 

of workplace accidents. 

 

 

7.5 

Commitment to quality products 

 

We are committed to deliver the best to our customers by 

providing them with quality and safe products for our long 

term business sustainability.  Our proprietary brands 

comprise:   

 Sumo Firenza and Sumo Tire brands for tyres which are 

produced by our CMS 

 Stamford Sport Wheels, or SSW brand for alloy wheels 

which are designed, manufactured and tested in our 

wheel factory located in Thailand 

 

The key measures on quality and safety are as follows: 

 

a. 

Adoption of market standards on product quality and 

safety 

To maintain product quality and safety, our suppliers and 

wheel factory are certified under internationally recognised 

quality standards with details as follows:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 A workplace accident is defined as one when an employee is injured in a work accident which resulted in (i) hospitalisation 

for at least 24 hours and/or (ii) medical leave of more than 3 days (regardless if the medical leave is consecutive)

b. Robust quality control processes   

To uphold a high standard on product quality and safety, we have implemented the following operational 

measures:  

 

A manufacturing management policy is in place for compliance with the production standards 

 

A procurement policy is in place to ensure procurement teams work closely with suppliers to comply with 

the Group’s requirements 

 

Strategic suppliers are regularly evaluated through measures such as annual assessments, sampling 

tests and visits to suppliers’ premises 

 

The production lines are supported by a team of experienced engineers and designers to provide quality 

assurance for the products 

 

During the reporting period, there was no safety related defect which resulted in an accident that caused injury 

to a customer (FY2018: None). 

 

 

7.6 

Ongoing community engagement 

 

We recognise that the long-term success of our 

business is closely related to the health and 

prosperity of the communities that we operate in. 

Accordingly, we strive to constantly contribute to the 

community. During the reporting period, various 

campaigns were initiated to help the community as 

follows: 

Singapore Red Cross (“SRC”) 

Under an arrangement made with SRC, we have 

supported the servicing and change of tyres of 18 

vehicles since August 2018. The vehicles typically 

make over 12,000 life-saving trips a year and are 

deployed all over Singapore.  The estimated retail 

cost of savings for the SRC will be in the region of 

SGD 15,000 per year. We are proud to partake in the 

noble mission of SRC.

7.7 

Energy conservation 

 

We are committed to responsible usage of energy to preserve the environment in which we operate in. Our 

operations consume energy mainly for the following purposes:  

 

Electricity for machineries used in the manufacturing of aluminium alloy wheels and equipment used in 

our offices  

 

Liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) for machineries used in the manufacturing of aluminium alloy wheels, 

specifically for wheel casting  

 

Fuel for operating motor vehicles such as trucks and forklifts  

 

Key statistics on energy usage during the reporting period are as follows:

During the reporting period, our electricity and fuel consumption increased slightly whilst the decrease in LPG 

consumption was mainly due to higher sales in alloy wheels.   We believe that responsible usage of energy 

resource results in lesser emissions and thus helps to preserve the environment. It also reduces our costs and 

enhances returns to shareholders. Key initiatives on this front are as follows:  

 

In April 2019, we entered into a Solar Power Purchase Agreement with Sembcorp Solar Singapore to install 

a solar photovoltaic system at our headquarters which is due to be completed by October 2019. Under 

this agreement, solar panels are installed on the rooftop of our headquarters to generate electricity which 

also help to bring down the roof surface’s temperature and cool the facility. Such an arrangement will 

generate clean energy and at the same time, reduce our utility cost  

 

A systematic maintenance program for operating equipment is in place to maintain energy efficiency  

 

Energy consumption is regularly tracked, analysed and corrective actions are taken when unusual 

consumption patterns are observed 

 

7.8 

Water conservation and wastewater treatment 

We recognise the importance to effectively 

manage water consumption as valuable 

water resources may be depleted and 

pollution may occur if water consumption and 

wastewater treatment are not managed 

properly. 

To 

achieve 

effective 

water 

management, we are committed to minimise 

consumption 

and 

manage 

wastewater 

quality. This factor is primarily applicable to 

our wheel manufacturing operations located 

in Thailand with details as follows:

Water conservation measures adopted by our wheel factory include the following: 

 

A systematic maintenance program is implemented for operating equipment to maintain water efficiency 

 

Water consumption trends are regularly tracked, analysed and corrective actions are taken when unusual 

consumption patterns are observed 

 

b. Wastewater treatment  

Wastewater comprised coolant oil and paint sludge generated from the manufacturing process as follows: 

Description 

Source 

Coolant oil 

Generated from the machining process, which is a mixture of oil, coolant chemical and 

water 

Paint sludge 

Generated from the painting process, which is a mixture of water, paint chemical, thinner, 

and other particles captured by the water curtains inside the painting booths 

 

During the reporting period, the wheel factory generated 20,223 tonnes (FY2018: 15,635 tonnes) of wastewater. 

Measures taken to manage water quality include ensuring that wastewater is processed by our own water 

treatment plants before it is released into the waterways and conducting sampling checks to inspect water 

quality. During the reporting period, 100% (FY2018: 100%) of wastewater generated from our wheel factory was 

treated by our own water treatment plant. 

 

 

7.9 

Waste optimisation 

 

We are committed to environmental preservation through reuse and recycling to allow the Group to operate in a 

sustainable environment.  

 

The main waste materials generated from our operations are the aluminium chips from wheel production. All 

aluminium chips from production are collected for outsource recycling. As at 30 April 2019, 89% (FY2018: 90%) 

of the aluminium chips generated from production was recycled.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition, we are actively involved in recycling of used tyres through our retreading plants located in Singapore, 

Malaysia and Indonesia. The retreading plants serve to extend the life span of tyres thus saving valuable natural 

resources used in the production of tyres. Whilst preserving the environment, we also ensure all retreaded tyres 

are rigorously inspected to ensure quality and safety.

7.10 Sustainable business performance 

 

We believe in creating long-term economic value for shareholders by rewarding shareholders by way of consistent 

profits and dividend payments. 

 

Details of the Group’s economic performance can be found in the financial contents and audited financial 

statements of the Annual Report 2019. Our Annual Report 2019 is available as a downloadable PDF from our

7.11 Proactive anti-corruption practices 

 

We are committed to carry out business with integrity by avoiding corruption in any form, including bribery, and 

complying with the Prevention of Corruption Act of Singapore.  

 

An employee handbook is in place to provide guidance to our employees on areas such as conduct in workplace, 

business conduct, confidentiality of information and conflict of interest. 

 

We have implemented a whistle blowing policy to provide a mechanism for employees to raise concerns through 

accessible confidential disclosure channels about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting and 

others. In FY2019, no serious offence3 was reported. (FY2018: None) 

 

7.12 Robust corporate governance framework 

 

We are committed to high standards of corporate governance and believes a high standard of corporate 

governance is integral in ensuring sustainability of our business as well as safeguarding shareholders’ interests 

and maximising long-term shareholder’s value.  

 

Our overall Singapore Governance and Transparency Index (“SGTI”) score assessed by National University of 

Singapore Business School was 62 for year 2019 (year 2018: 66).  

 

The Board and Management firmly believe that the success of our quest for good governance lies in putting in 

place an effective framework of risk management and internal controls that is aligned with market standards 

and best practices. Refer to the Corporate Governance Report of the Annual Report 2019 for details for our 

corporate governance practices.
