ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

Financial Highlights

Financial performance of the Group is one of the key concern of stakeholders. We are proud to announce 

that during FY2018, the Group registered a 3.1% growth in revenue from S$65.3 million in FY 2017 to 

S$67.3 million in FY2018 attributed by the increase in service income from the Facilities Management 

Services division, comprising (i) new and on-going security projects, (ii) property management services, and 

(iii) gardening and landscaping services. However, the increase was offset by the decrease in (i) the number 

of FDWs that the Group has placed out to Singapore households, and (ii) service income from cleaning 

services and pest control services.

The Group maintained its high retention rate from existing customers, at 87.9% for its Building Management 

Business and 85.8% for its Security Services Business. As at 31 December 2018, the Group had service 

contracts (with varying contract periods) amounting to approximately S$3.7 million monthly from its facility 

management projects.

According to our Group policy, all of our employees undergo the annual performance appraisal. This 

exercise allows the managers and employees to set expectations, and address potential gaps in their 

performance. Regular and ad-hoc feedback are also given to employees. These practices to develop and 

improve employees’ performance have contributed to improve organisational performance. Furthermore, 

these practices allows the Group to monitor the skill-sets of employees and to develop human capital within 

the organisation. As at reporting date, all employees have concluded their annual performance review for 

the year ended 2018.

We had also achieved our target set for 2018, an average of 40 hours of training and development where 

the Group initial target was set at 20 hours.

Target Setting: To maintain yearly average training hours per operation staff and management staff at 28 

hours and 12 hours respectively

CUSTOMER PRIVACY

Our materiality assessment has indicated that 

customer data privacy and protection is of 

paramount importance to our stakeholders, 

making this one of the material topic for the 

Advancer Global. We understand that with the 

advancement of technology, there is a growing 

trend of concerns for individuals on how their 

personal data are being collected, managed and 

used.

Personal Data Protection Act

With the establishment of the Personal Data 

Protection Act (PDPA) in 2012, personal data 

is protected in Singapore by various rules 

governing the collection, use, disclosure and care 

of personal data. Protection of the personal data 

of our stakeholders, including but not limited to, 

customers and employees are vital to our ability 

to conduct operations.

We have in place a PDPA policy which includes 

procedures on responsible data handling, use of 

data and compliance monitoring. Customers’ data 

are stored in secure databases where we have 

established safeguards in place against impending 

IT security threats for instance, periodic change of 

passwords, installation of anti-virus and firewalls. 

These policies and procedures are disseminated 

to all employees and our operating entities in the 

Group. Every operational manager is expected to 

establish and implement the Group’s PDPA policy 

and monitor for compliance.

We are very proud to announce that we have not 

received any substantiated complaints or had any 

breaches or loss of customer data. Our customers’ 

privacy is of utmost importance to our Group and we 

consistently monitor and update our PDPA policy in 

accordance with new requirements and business 

developments. Subsequent to FY2018, we target to 

achieve zero complaints and PDPA breaches on a 

yearly basis.

Target setting: to achieve zero complaints and PDPA 

breaches on a yearly basis.
