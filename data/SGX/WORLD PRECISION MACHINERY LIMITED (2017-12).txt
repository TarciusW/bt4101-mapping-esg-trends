MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD

MR. SHAO JIANJUN

Executive Chairman

Dear Shareholders, on behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), I am pleased to announce the publication of our 

2017 Sustainability Report that is in compliance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), in relation to the financial year 

ended 31 December 2017 (“FY2017”). 

With stakeholders’ growing expectations in engaging global issues, the Board believes that being sustainable and 

dynamic in the ever-changing world of business is the way to sustain growth. We believe that this demonstrates our 

commitment to our stakeholders. 

World Precision Machinery Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) take pride in its assurance of the range of quality 

stamping machines produced, to suit the needs of a myriad of industries including automotive, home appliances and 

electronics.  Through its very strong in-house Research and Development (R&amp;D) team, the Group has adapted well to the 

gradual shift towards high-end stamping machines in its product mix, which is in line with its strategy to raise its market 

share in the premium sector. 

We place strong importance in the relationship between customers and stakeholders and have steadily continue to 

improve our position in strengthening our current position and future projects. This will help us augment the current 

market presence and help us achieve our long term goals that we set for ourselves. 

In this Sustainability Report, we have identified and selected 4 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues to 

focus on. These issues have been carefully selected, and have the greatest impact on our key stakeholders.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

The Group is pleased to announce that in order to achieve sustainable strategic growth, it has released five new stamping 

models compared to three models from the previous year. The increase in production showcases its unique R&amp;D capability 

to meet the demands of its customers.

Financial Highlights

The Group’s revenue recorded a year-on-year (“yoy”) increase of 11.2% to RMB803.9 million for FY2017 from RMB723.1 

million for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 (“FY2016”). The increase in the Group’s overall sales was largely 

due to the increase in number of units sold in conventional stamping machines and high performance and high tonnage 

(”HPHT”) stamping machines, which was partially offset by a downward revision in the average selling prices (”ASP”) of 

the stamping machines.

For FY2017, the Group’s finance expenses recorded a decrease of 55.3% to RMB3.3 million from RMB7.5 million in FY2016 

which was mainly due to a gradual decrease in interest expenses relating to a gradual decrease in bank loans.

 

As a result of the above, the Group’s net profit for FY2017 increased by 22.2% to RMB36.8 million from RMB30.1 million 

for FY2016. 

The Group strives to be the forerunner in the production of stamping machines to its customers, and integrate its cutting 

edge R&amp;D developments into its current and future work plans. As such, the Group will be able to achieve more cost-

saving and efficiency in an ever-changing and dynamic industry.

standards and codes such as OHSAS 18001 as well as comply with local legislation relating to health and safety.

submitted to Management.
