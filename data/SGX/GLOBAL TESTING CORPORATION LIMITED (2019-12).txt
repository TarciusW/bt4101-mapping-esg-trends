BOARD STATEMENT  

Dear Stakeholders, 

As the Board of Directors ("Board") of GTCL, we are pleased to present our sustainability report for 2019. 

To bear the fruits of long-term success, we firmly believe that is essential for us to incorporate 

sustainability in our business strategy. Sustainability is of significant importance to our Company and 

we are steadfast in our commitment to developing a corporate culture that values sustainable business 

practices and considering sustainability factors when conducting day-to-day operations. We are also 

committed to protecting and enhancing our stakeholders' interests, by incorporating their perspectives 

and concerns in responsible economic, environmental, and social (EES) business management. We build 

trusted relationships with our stakeholders through regular and planned dialogues. 

By setting a clear tone from the top, we are confident that we can play our part in environmental 

preservation, social inclusion, and achieving financial milestones. GTCL has and will continue to do so 

by setting goals that drive environmental stewardship and creating a safe working environment where 

our employees not just work, but can also thrive in. Our robust governance framework strives to 

maintain integrity, transparency, accountability, and discipline in all of our business activities. 

Together with the Board's leadership, the management will continue to strengthen our performance by 

integrating material EES factors in our business operations. We seek to go even further to developing a 

more sustainable business for the better of our stakeholders and community. 

On behalf of the Board of Directors, our management team and employees, we thank you for the 

opportunity you give us and for your confidence in GTCL, as we continue our efforts to build a better 

future for all of our stakeholders.

SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT  

Our stakeholders are essential to fuelling long-term and sustainable growth for the organisation. To 

satisfy our broad range of stakeholders, GTCL recognises the importance of cultivating our ESG factors 

consistently. 

GTCL has regularly engaged with its stakeholders through various channels during the financial year. 

The Group believes that such two-way communication is paramount for stakeholders to be kept abreast 

of our sustainability initiatives, as well as to gather feedback and concerns. Currently, workshops, 

surveys, and external audits are carried out to assess our business operations better and ensure their 

compliance with rules and regulations. GTCL is confident that that this approach will serve to align 

stakeholder concerns into operational, reporting, and organisational objectives.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

GTCL had conducted its third materiality assessment to identify the ESG topics material to the Group 

and its stakeholders in 2019. Similar to the previous year, the materiality assessment was conducted 

with the help of an external consultant, and GTCL will continue to involve them in the coming year.

CLIENT SATISFACTION  

The Group sends out an annual customer satisfaction survey to our main customer lines, which comprise 

of probing and final testing. The annual survey conducted is aligned with the ISO program ISO9001 and 

IATF16949 standard of the Customer Satisfaction Survey Handling Procedure.  

In 2019, our clients rated us with our overall rating of "Good" which met with their project outcomes 

and value added to their organisation throughout the reporting year. Thus, GTCL have fulfilled customer 

requirements and provided them with a quality experience. 

In future, GTCL aims to receive an overall rating of "Excellent", where more enhanced quality is 

delivered, which thoroughly satisfies the customers.

WORKPLACE

EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT  

OUR APPROACH 

Every employee at GTCL wields skills and knowledge that are essential to the sustained growth of the 

business. The Group is devoted to providing each employee with ample opportunities for training and 

development to improve their skill set in the face of changing circumstances. 

 

Figure 9: GTCL's Approach to Training and Education 

 

TRAINING AND EDUCATION  

GTCL remains deeply committed to diversity and inclusion, with a strong emphasis placed on ensuring 

accessibility to training for all employees, irrespective of gender or job profile. In 2019, GTCL maintained 

a balanced profile of employees across both genders.

GTCL's employees contribute significantly to the long-term success of business performance and culture. 

As such, constant and comprehensive development of their performance capabilities is essential. In 

2019, all employees attended trainings as part of their overall learning and development to improve 

their performance capabilities. Thus, 20,541 training hours were dedicated to training for all employees. 

The figure below captures the trend for the average number of training hours per employee, over the 

years. 

 

Figure 11: Average Training Hours per Employee across the years 

 

The figure below provides a breakdown of the training hours by employee gender and category for 

FY2019.

Figure 13: Total Training Hours by Gender and Management Level 

 

 

Figure 14: Targeted Average Training Hours per Employee in FY2019 and FY2020 

 

GTCL aims to maintain the average training hours in the future to continue to strive towards equipping 

its employees with the necessary knowledge and industry-specific skills, as well as elevate their 

competencies. 

It is also important that all employees receive regular performance evaluations, to aid in their personal 

development, contribute to skills management and develop human capital within the organisation. This 

is especially so for management, which is entrusted with a significant amount of responsibility to oversee 

and manage the organisation. Performance appraisal criteria are made known to all employees and their 

appraisers. 

In FY2019, the management team comprised of 48 people, out of which 42 were males and 6 were 

females. 100% of the total management received regular performance appraisal, which further helps 

the Company to achieve their strategic goals and objectives and also sets a clear sense of direction for 

the workforce. 

In the following year, GTCL strives to continue to provide regular performance and career development 

evaluations for all employees.
