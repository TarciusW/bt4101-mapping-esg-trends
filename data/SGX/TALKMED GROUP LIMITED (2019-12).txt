TalkMed Group Limited (“TalkMed” or the “Company”) is 

pleased to present our third annual Sustainability Report. 

This report reaffirms our commitment to sustainability 

and discloses our environmental, social and governance 

performance for the financial year ended 31 December 

2019 (“FY19”). The scope of the report covers our 

operations in Singapore.

The FY19 Sustainability Report has been prepared in 

accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards: Core option. The GRI standards were chosen 

as they are the first global standards for sustainability 

reporting. The GRI Content Index on pages 15 to 17 

contains the list of GRI references used in this report. 

This report is also formed with reference to the primary 

components set out in Singapore Exchange Limited listing 

Rule 711B on a ‘Comply or Explain’ basis.

We value the feedback of our stakeholders and welcome 

questions you may have on any aspect of our sustainability 

performance. Please write to:

enquiries@talkmed.com.sg


TalkMed Group is pleased to present our third 

Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 

31 December 2019. Our report documents our 

sustainability performance, progress and the initiatives 

we have adopted to meet our stakeholders’ expectations.

ENVIRONMENT

We are aware of our responsibility to conduct our business 

in an environmentally responsible manner. We strive to 

minimise the harmful environmental impacts of our day-to-

day practices and integrate sustainable practices across 

all business operations. Through sustainability reporting, 

we would be able to track the progress of our initiatives 

and create greater environmental consciousness among 

our community.

At TalkMed, we understand the dangerous effects 

of improper handling and disposal of medical waste 

on the environment as well as the society. We are 

therefore committed to adopt the best practices and 

ensure compliance with all relevant regulations. This helps 

minimise the risk of disease transmission, air and water 

contamination, as well as soil pollution. We hire licensed 

and experienced firms to collect, transport and dispose 

of any biohazardous and cytotoxic waste.

SOCIAL

As a medical service provider, we understand the 

importance of attracting and retaining talented employees 

to provide exceptional service to our customers. We are 

committed to enforcing fair labour practices, providing 

equal opportunities and providing a safe working 

environment for all our employees.

At TalkMed, we have created a culture that fosters 

innovation and encourage our medical staff to stay up to 

date with the latest development in their field. We provide 

them with diverse training opportunities and support 

their professional as well as personal development. This 

helps them be aware of the latest medical advancement, 

treatment methods and equipment available in the market 

and allows them to make well-informed decisions for our 

customers.

Our ultimate goal is to provide quality and safe patient 

care that exceeds industry standards and responds to 

the needs of our customers. We believe that maintaining 

a safe environment is a crucial aspect of competent 

healthcare. To protect the safety of both patients and our 

healthcare professionals, we ensure strict adherence to 

all applicable rules and regulations.

TalkMed values its employees, customers and the 

community it serves. Our doctors play their part by 

providing health education to the people. They share their 

knowledge and contribute to raising disease awareness 

in Singapore and neighbouring countries via newspapers, 

magazines, medical journals and medical educational 

sessions.

COMMUNITY

We strive to have a positive impact on our community 

and have collaborated with the Singapore Cancer Society 

(“SCS”) to create a difference. As part of our local 

initiatives, we sponsored and participated in the “Relay 

for Life” event in Singapore. We also sponsored the I-Do 

web series campaign1, under a partnership with Blue3Asia 

Pte Ltd (“Blue3Asia”) and SCS, to develop a web-series 

story to allow the public to better understand the journey 

of a cancer patient.

GOVERNANCE

We understand our role as a member of the medical 

fraternity and uphold the highest standards of corporate 

governance across all our business functions. To 

demonstrate our commitment to business ethics, this 

year we have included anti-corruption as one of the 

material topics in our report to disclose our practices, 

policies and performance. We strictly adhere to the 

compliance requirements of a public listed company 

and are committed to providing transparent and relevant 

information to all our stakeholders on a timely basis.

TalkMed believes our responsibility as a healthcare group 

goes beyond our business operations. We are committed 

to look for ways to enhance our services and use our 

resources responsibly. We strive for medical excellence 

and aim to provide the safest services to our valuable 

customers. We want to thank our stakeholders for their 

continuous trust and support in our sustainability journey.

TalkMed and its group of companies (collectively, the “Group”) is a premier provider of medical oncology services, 

stem cell transplant services and palliative healthcare services. We are headquartered in Singapore and our operations 

extend to serve the markets in Vietnam and China as well.

TalkMed was incorporated on 10 September 2013 and listed on the Catalist Board of Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited on 30 January 2014. TalkMed’s group structure as of May 2020 is as follows:

Singapore Cancer Centre Pte. Ltd. (“SCC”) provides 

tertiary healthcare services to the oncology patients in 

the private sector in Singapore, through Parkway Cancer 

Centre (“PCC”). Our highly-trained doctors attend to 

patients, examine and administer medical treatments, 

perform minor outpatient surgical procedures, prescribe 

medicines and conduct laboratory tests or diagnostic 

procedures. In addition to the above clinical functions, 

we review the results of these investigations and provide 

follow-up patient care.

TalkMed is recognised as one of the leading medical 

tourism facility in Singapore. This has been made possible 

by the excellent medical service provided by our team 

of fifteen doctors at nine clinics in facilities operated by 

Parkway Hospitals Singapore Pte. Ltd.. These include 

Gleneagles Hospital Singapore, Mount Elizabeth Hospital 

Singapore, Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre and Mount 

Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre. For the past few 

years, SCC has established itself as one of the market 

leaders in medical tourism in Singapore with foreign 

patients accounting for approximately half of its patient-

load.

TalkMed Vietnam Pte. Ltd. was established in March 2014 

and we collaborated with Thu Cuc International General 

Hospital to set up a medical centre known as Singapore 

Cancer Centre Thu Cuc. The centre provides specialist 

medical oncology services in Hanoi, Vietnam.

In August 2019, TalkMed China Pte. Ltd. (“TalkMed 

China”) established a 100% owned subsidiary, TalkMed 

Hospital Management (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“TMHM”) 

in Beijing, the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).

In September 2019, TalkMed China acquired 25% of 

the total issued and paid-up share capital of TalkMed 

Chongqing Pte. Ltd. (“TMCQ”) from TMCQ’s minority 

shareholder, ZXJ2 Holdings Pte. Ltd.. Following which, 

TMCQ became a wholly-owned subsidiary of TalkMed 

China. TalkMed China and TMCQ were incorporated with 

the aim of exploring healthcare-related collaborations in 

PRC and providing healthcare management services in 

Chongqing, PRC, respectively.

In October 2019, TMCQ jointly established a Sino-

foreign joint venture company, Sino-Singapore Hospital 

Management (Chongqing) Co., Ltd. (“SSHM”) in 

Chongqing, PRC, with Chongqing Yongchuan District 

People’s Hospital (“YCDPH”). TMCQ and YCDPH hold 

60% and 40% of the equity interest in SSHM respectively.

In November 2019, the Group incorporated a wholly-

owned subsidiary, TalkMed Greater China Pte. Ltd. 

(“TMGC”) in Singapore. The Group intends to utilise 

TMGC as a vehicle to explore and hold healthcare-related 

collaborations in PRC. Subsequently, TalkMed Group and 

TalkMed China transferred their entire issued and paid-up 

share capital of TalkMed China and TMCQ respectively 

to TMGC.

Stem Med Pte. Ltd. (“Stem Med”), set up in January 2015, 

is the first private stem cell banking facility in Singapore 

that specialises in the processing, cryopreservation and 

storage of adult stem cells.

business opportunities in Indonesia in the areas of 

operation of cellular laboratories, storage facilities and 

cellular therapeutics clinics; and

engaged in the research and production of highly-

effective products and technologically-advanced 

treatments for hair rejuvenation and customised skin 

care for the global beauty market.

CellVec Pte. Ltd. was incorporated on 8 August 2018 and 

is primarily engaged in the provision of cellular and gene 

therapy related products and services, with a focus on the 

development of novel platform viral vector technologies 

that strive to advance genetic modification of cellular 

therapy.

ENGAGEMENT

GRI 102-40 | 102-42 | 102-43 | 102-44

At TalkMed, we understand the importance of engaging our stakeholders and identifying the material issues that are 

most important to them. We selected our key stakeholder group based on influence, representation, responsibility, 

dependency and proximity.

In the financial year ended 31 December 2017 (“FY17”), we conducted stakeholder engagement based on a process 

of identification, prioritisation and validation to identify the key material issues.

We firmly believe that stakeholder engagement is a key factor to ensure the success of our business. Therefore, 

we constantly seek to improve our communication channels with all our stakeholders to seek their inputs as well as 

address their concerns.

ASSESSMENT

GRI 102-46 | 102-47 | 103-1









The content and aspect boundaries in this report have been developed in alignment with the GRI Reporting Principles 

of Materiality, Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Sustainability Context and Completeness. Our key stakeholders were engaged 

through carefully formulated surveys to understand their areas of concern.

TalkMed conducted a peer benchmarking exercise for our FY19 report. We compared the material topics and 

disclosures against our top local and national peers to assess gaps and identify areas of improvement. After analysing 

the findings from the exercise, we have refreshed our material aspects and selected “Anti-corruption” as an additional 

material aspect to be included in our Sustainability Report from FY19 onwards.

We are committed to updating our materiality assessment biennially.

GOVERNANCE

ANTI-CORRUPTION

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 205-3

Why is this a material issue?

TalkMed adheres to the highest standards of business integrity, ethics and transparency. Corruption in any form 

undermines the capability of healthcare organisations to contribute to better health and to serve their customers well. 

Hence, it is important for us to keep our corruption risk low through good corporate governance, business ethics and 

strong internal controls in our business processes.

As a medical services provider, we take this issue very seriously and are committed to complying with all applicable 

standards, rules and regulations necessary to prevent corruption and unethical behaviour.

Our approach to managing

At TalkMed, we have zero tolerance for all forms of corruption, bribery, fraud and unethical behavior. This is reflected 

in our Code of Conduct, which outlines the guidelines for maintaining transparency and accountability.

We have also established a whistle-blowing policy which will stipulate the mechanism by which concerns about plausible 

improprieties in matters of financial reporting may be raised. A dedicated secured email address allows whistle-blowers 

direct access to the Audit and Risk Committee.

The whistle-blowing policy and its procedures have also been made available to all employees.

The Company’s whistle-blowing policy allows employees to raise concerns and offers reassurance that they will be 

protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle-blowing in good faith.

FY19 Performance

There were no reported cases of anti-corruption during the reporting period.

FY203 Target

We aim to maintain zero cases of all forms of corruption in our future business operations as well.

Financial year ending 31 December 2020 (“FY20”)


CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 416-2

Why is this a material issue?

The safety and well-being of our customers form the core of our organisation’s value. We are committed to providing 

excellent service to our patients at all times and have taken several measures to ensure the same. 

We have integrated standards and procedures across all our operations and installed continuous monitoring systems 

to safeguard the health and safety of our valued customers.

Our approach to managing

As customer safety is a crucial aspect of our business, we ensure strict adherence to government regulations such as 

Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, Medicines Act, Health Products Act and Singapore Medical Council Ethical 

Code and Ethical Guidelines. 

We have in place a set of clinical standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) to maintain competency among staff and 

compliance with the applicable regulations and laws. 

As a provider of medical services, we believe the professional capability of our nurses is a direct reflection of the quality 

of our services. We have, therefore, put in place a system of competency checklists to assess and evaluate their 

proficiency. In addition to this, we also have an apheresis competency checklist, as our operations require handling 

blood products. The above SOPs and checklists are reviewed every year for relevance and completeness.

FY19 Performance

There were no incidents of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services. 

FY20 Target

TalkMed aims to continue its performance by maintaining a strong framework to ensure compliance with relevant 

guidelines and regulations.

EMPLOYMENT

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 401-1

Why is this a material issue?

Our employees are the foundation of our business and the secret to our long-lasting success. They are integral to 

our ability to provide exceptional medical services to our customers and consistently improve our performance. As 

they are our most valuable assets, we are committed to providing a challenging work environment for our workforce 

of talented doctors and specialists.

Our approach to managing

We are aware that our ability to attract, develop and retain highly motivated employees is critical to our business.

Our human resource team follows fair and supportive policies which are in line with our objectives. We have an equitable 

system of recognition and awards that allows doctors the opportunity to participate in revenue-sharing schemes. Our 

staff is awarded an attractive year-end bonus that commensurates with their performances. In addition to the above, 

we promote annual subsidised holidays to promote staff bonding. We recognise and acknowledge the contribution of 

our long-serving staff by rewarding them with long service awards.

We aim to have the very best talent and also work towards ensuring that each role is filled by a candidate who is 

qualified and of the right fit. Therefore, we have delegated this crucial task of recruiting new doctors to our Chief 

Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, while the hiring of new clinical staff is entrusted to nurse management and 

human resource department. This helps us to identify candidates with high potential who can contribute meaningfully 

to the Group.

FY19 Performance

Total new hire rate: 21.5%

Total turnover rate: 15.1%

FY20 Target

To ensure greater retention of the talent pool.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 404-1

Why is this issue material?

TalkMed places a strong emphasis on developing talent through training and education programmes. It is necessary 

for our doctors and specialists to be updated with the latest development in their field to perform to the best of their 

abilities. Therefore, we provide opportunities for holistic improvement in their competency level and help them reach 

their full potential.

Our approach to managing

To enable employees to refine their skills, we organise regular training and development programmes to cater to their 

area of specialisation. We offer our nurses fully-sponsored diploma courses to help them upgrade their qualifications. 

We have fostered a culture of learning in our organisation and we encourage regular feedback to identify new areas 

of improvement.

COMMUNITY









RELAY FOR LIFE 2019

On 2 and 3 March 2019, the third edition of Relay for Life 

(“RFL”) 2019 where TalkMed was the key sponsor, was 

held. The event saw around 7,000 participants celebrating 

the triumph of accomplishing the 15-hour relay.

A total of 208 teams took part in the 100 km challenge. 

This number of teams almost doubled as compared to 

2018. The teams set a new Singapore Book of Records 

for the longest distance (14,849.2km) covered by a group 

of runners in six hours.

Singapore is the 25th country to organise RFL and 

be part of this global movement. This event brings 

the community together to Celebrate the triumph of 

survivors, Remember those lost to the disease and Fight 

Back against a disease that has taken so much.

This event has helped to raise over S$1 million which will 

go towards funding the programmes and services run 

by SCS to Minimise Cancer and Maximise Lives of the 

cancer community.





SINGAPORE CANCER 

SOCIETY’S I-DO

The Company, through PCC, was the main sponsor for 

the web-series campaign – Singapore Cancer Society’s 

I-Do – held on 12 February 2019.

It was a partnership with Blue3Asia and SCS to develop 

a web-series story depicting real-time experiences in a 

cancer patient’s journey. At the grand finale, the series 

was screened at School of the Arts Singapore in the 

presence of media and patients.

The event also included an exhibition on the stakeholders 

(such as doctors, dietitian, counsellors, caregivers) 

involved in a cancer patient’s journey. Dr Ang Peng Tiam 

(Medical Director), Chloe Ong (dietitian) and Tan Hui Ping 

(counsellor) from PCC were featured in this exhibition.
