giving us hope that despite the 

pandemic-induced challenges, Chasen 

continues to work hard to overcome 

them and seize prospects not visible pre-

COVID-19. The light leads us to the path of 

opportunities where our agility to adjust to 

changes will give us the edge to be resilient and 

sustaining in the tough post-pandemic business 

environment.  Hence, Business Resilience will be

the theme steering our business going forward.




The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world and few can 

deny the sudden intense spotlight on sustainability and 

business continuity practices for organisations everywhere. 

Disrupted global supply chains have forced nations to reduce 

reliance on overseas supplies and businesses to re-think their 

operations and adopt nimble and agile strategies to respond 

to unexpected changes.  We believe a positive impetus for 

our services and solutions is a result of greater reliance on 

well diversified industry players like the Chasen Group, who 

are able to meet the growing demand for trustworthy and 

swift response of business partners to changes in operations 

planning and the supply chain.

As a market leader in Specialist Relocation and early mover 

in cross-border third-party logistics, we demonstrate our 

commitment through the adoption of sustainable business 

practices while complying with applicable laws and regulations 

in all the markets we operate in. The Board expects all Group 

employees to be vigilant in maintaining our corporate values 

BOARD STATEMENT

when delivering the Group’s high quality products and services.

The Group will continue to explore and evaluate business 

opportunities that have potential to generate value for the 

shareholders, including but not limited to strategic investments, 

partnerships, or mergers and acquisitions.  While we continue 

to seek breakthroughs for new growth, we recognize the 

increasing importance of strengthening the resilience and 

sustainability of our current business operations.

Moving forward, we would continue to invest in human capital 

as the key to the long-term sustainable success of the Chasen 

Group. Therefore, we are committed to strengthening our staff 

training and development roadmap, as well as enhancing the 

environmental sustainability of our operations in a low carbon 

economy of the future.

Our Strategic Approach to Sustainability

With our vision and corporate values in mind, we aim to 

integrate sustainability into the businesses of Chasen so that 

it is systematic and seamless.  Where possible, we incorporate 

sustainability considerations in our decision-making processes. 

Our sustainability efforts are led by our senior management 

who ensures that the Company’s business objectives are in line 

with our commitments to sustainable development.  Senior 

management is responsible for on-going communication to 

the Board of Directors.    

Chasen’s senior management has determined focus areas 

where Chasen can have the greatest economic, environmental 

and social impact, as well as the areas that are most important 

to our stakeholders.  

Chasen has taken efforts to seek the opinion of internal and 

external stakeholders either formally or informally. We aspire to 

understand the needs and expectations of our key stakeholders 

and strive to build mutually beneficial relationships.

ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY

At present, we are headquartered in Singapore, with operations 

extending to Asia and the United States of America. We 

manage our operations in accordance to our sustainability 

principles. We work closely with our and operation staff to 

identify and consider any sustainability opportunities and risks 

that may arise. 

Sustainability trends such as climate change, resource scarcity 

and demographic changes shape the competitive environment 

in which companies like Chasen operate by introducing long 

term sustainability opportunities and recognising risks. We 

therefore view our business performance beyond short term 

gains and financial bottomline. Our conviction is to achieve a 

balanced triple bottomline (People, Profit, Planet) for sustained 

growth for the organisation and the community it operates in.

The success of our business is highly dependent on the 

commitment of our management and staff. Their knowledge, 

professional expertise and their job satisfaction are key to our 

economic sustainability. 

More importantly, we strive to contribute positively to the 

society through our economic presence by serving as Asia 

Pacific’s leading specialist relocation and third-party logistics 

company in Singapore, Asia and the United States of America, 

while maintaining good stewardship of the resources we 

manage and generating good shareholders’ value.

Our business model focuses on cost leadership without 

compromising our service level and highest priority on 

customer’s interest. We seek organic growth from the existing 

outlets as well as through the acquisition of new businesses 

that reap good returns.

We strive to maintain our market position by ensuring we gain 

the trust of our customers and their families, and continually 

build our reputation and brand name in specialist relocation 

and third-party logistics industry in Asia Pacific.

The Group’s vision is to offer integrated services combining 

technical and engineering capabilities to complement logistics 

services. As the vision is being realised the Group would 

enhance its competitiveness beyond pricing.

As a whole, Chasen continues to make good progress and 

the current financial year is expected to be another watershed 

as each subsidiary successfully implement their strategic 

business plans approved by the Board last financial year. As 

book orders continue to build up and projects executed across 

our three business segments, we hope to achieve another 

record in annual revenue in line with global economic growth 

opportunities. 

In today’s highly volatile business environment, Chasen has, 

beyond sustained earnings, diligently embraced prudent 

financial management, capitalised on our assets and 

investments, and remained focused on growth strategies, to 

enhance shareholders’ value.

For more information on Chasen’s financial and business 

performance, please refer to  financial highlights in pages 

10-11  and the FY 2020 Annual Report.

stakeholders such as customers and their families, suppliers, 

competitors and contractors.

Committee.  By doing so, our stakeholders can be assured that 

all reports or suspicions of potential breaches of our Employee 

guidelines are taken seriously by the Group.

We tap on the water supply provided by Public Utilities Board 

and disposed used water into the public sewage system.

For FY2020, our water consumption in Singapore decreased by 

8% and expenditure decreased by 5.9% respectively. In terms 

of electricity, our consumption and expenditure decreased by 

66.5% and  60.3 % respectively. For diesel, our consumption 

decreased by 7.5% and expenditure increased by 22.3% 

respectively.

At the Group level, our water consumption and expenditure 

increased by 21.1% and increased by 24.5% respectively, 

largely due to the increase in water consumption by our 

Chinese operations.  In terms of electricity, our consumption 

and expenditure decreased by 47% and increased by 0.47% 

respectively. For diesel, our consumption and expenditure 

decreased by 67.6% and increased by 9.7% respectively.

As part of our initial efforts, we will align our environmental 

performance in our Singapore operations to key evaluation 

criterion for water consumption and energy conservation for 

the both electricity and diesel consumption.

This augmentation in the overall water consumption was 

due to the first time reporting of the subsidiaries in China 

in particular the precision engineering and contract 

manufacturing plant, which requires more water for its precision 

engineering processes. The volume of water consumption is 

in line with the nature of the business activity, even though 

it has laden an extraordinary increase in the overall water 

consumption at the Chasen Group level.

While we take conscientious efforts to conserve water and 

electricity, we are currently reviewing our utilisation pattern 

and will implement measures to reduce the consumption.

The electricity consumption at the Group level is relatively 

stable over the past two years. It is encouraging to note that 

the Chasen Singapore’s electricity consumption has declined 

over the past two years.

The flexi-work scheme was rolled out smoothly and expedited 

by the COVID-19 work from home requirements. Senior 

Management took the lead by working at least 2 day a week 

from home while the rest of the staff adopted similar 1 to 3 

days of  working remotely from home to alternate the rollout 

with minimal disruption to the business operations. 

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered by 

the Employment Act (Chapter 91) of Singapore, which provides 

basic employment terms and working conditions including 

contract requirements, remuneration, hours of work, overtime, 

rest days and annual leave entitlement. In addition to the 

statutory benefits outlined in the Employment Act, we provide 

beyond-compliance level benefits to our fulltime employees. 

Examples of these benefits include vacation, marriage and 

compassionate leaves.

Work–Life Balance

While developing the talents of our employees and providing 

equal opportunities for them to excel are the key drivers 

for our company, we also recognize that the well-being and 

contentment of our employees are pivotal to the success 

and sustainability of our business and performance. Our 

employees are our most valuable asset, and we appreciate 

that their overall well-being needs to be well looked after in 

order for them to sustain their performance and realize their 

full potential.

To support our employees to strike a work-life balance, we 

aim to create an environment that allows our employees to 

achieve harmony in their personal and professional life. We 

intend to adopt a flexible approach to work arrangements

and offering programmes to support health and wellness. We 

understand that the workplace can be at times stressful due 

to the competitiveness of our workforce and our business. To 

support our employees in their effort of pursuing excellence, 

we will launch various programmes and initiatives to balance 

their work with fun, and to development an environment and 

culture of mutual support.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

The CHASEN group is committed to embracing the highest 

standards of workplace, safety and Health (“WSH”) and 

environmental practices and inculcating the best practices 

in the CHASEN group.  We are guided by the steadfast 

commitment to our employees for a safe working environment 

in which one can work and excel with full confidence. 

The management team sets a strong foundation by providing 

clear direction within the organisation of the value of an effective 

occupational health and safety management approach to 

foster risk-free and environmentally-friendly premises. We are 

building the environmental awareness and green practices to 

lead the group in adhering to all WSH regulations as stipulated 

by the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) and all the relevant 

authorities of the national jurisdictions we operate in.

Our operations are closely monitored and reviewed by our 

appointed safety officers, who ensure all employees comply to 

the codes of practice and safety procedures they have set out. 

Our emphasis on promoting workers’ health and improving 

occupational safety has resulted in low numbers of accidents 

in our workplace and we will continue to uphold our mandate 

to target zero injuries and fatalities amongst our workforce.

upheld the principle of corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) 

in serving the communities we operate in, looking after the 

welfare of our employees, and building goodwill for our
