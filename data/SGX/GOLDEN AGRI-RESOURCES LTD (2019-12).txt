disclosures are included throughout 

the report using the notation: [XXX-XX] 

and the full GRI content index can be 

found on the GAR website.

 

This year, our report also contains 

disclosures recommended in the 

Agricultural Products Sustainability 

Accounting Standard (Industry 

Standard, Version 2018-10) that 

was developed by the Sustainability 

Accounting Standards Board (SASB). 

These disclosures are referenced 

throughout the report using the 

notation: [FB-AG-XXXX.X], and are 

included in the SASB disclosure index 

found on our website. 

This is the ninth edition of the GAR 

Sustainability Report. It provides 

a summary of our progress and 

challenges in managing our most critical 

sustainability issues in FY2019. Unless 

otherwise stated, this report does not 

include the Company’s activities outside 

of Indonesia, where the majority of 

our operations are based. We have 

prepared this report in accordance 

with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards – Core option. We have 

used the GRI reporting framework 

since we began reporting on our ESG 

performance in 2011 and continue 

to use it as it is the most widely-used 

reporting framework globally. GRI 

ASSURANCE

[102-56]

We have not sought third party assurance 

on our sustainability report. However,  

the information related to our material 

topics including High Carbon Stock 

(HCS), High Conservation Value (HCV) 

and Free, Prior and Informed Consent 

(FPIC) is reviewed by certification bodies 

such as the Roundtable on Sustainable 

Palm Oil (RSPO). This provides verification 

and credibility to the information  

and data submitted in this report. 

We have also commissioned PT 

Lloyd’s Register Indonesia to verify 

the greenhouse gas emissions for our 

subsidiary PT SMART Tbk.

progress towards compliance with our 

sustainability commitments. 

In 2019, we forged ahead  

with our Traceability to the 

Plantation (TTP) efforts. 

As of end 2019,

78%

of the FFB processed  

in GAR-owned and  

third party supplier mills  

is fully traceable.

To help accelerate the TTP process 

amongst our suppliers, we were pleased 

to launch the Ksatria Sawit programme. 

The programme reaches out to areas 

where many of our supplier mills are 

buying from smallholders and traces 

their agents and farmers. Since its 

launch in April 2019, we have covered 

provinces such as Aceh, North and South 

Sumatra, Riau, Jambi, Lampung, and 

Bangka Belitung. We estimate that the 

programme will help us trace almost 

60,000 smallholders. Through this 

programme we also hope to develop new 

mechanisms to help smallholders and 

agents adopt sustainable practices. 

Dear Stakeholders, 

As we move into the decisive decade to 

achieve the UN’s vision of sustainable 

development, Golden Agri-Resources 

(GAR) continues to work steadily 

towards achieving our sustainability 

commitments. Guided by the GAR Social 

and Environmental Policy (GSEP), our 

approach to sustainability is centred on 

balancing the need for environmental 

conservation and economic 

development. This is no easy task as 

the challenges faced by the industry are 

multi-faceted and success in facing them 

relies upon the collaboration of many 

stakeholders. 

As we look back at our performance 

over the last decade, we have seen 

much progress in areas such as helping 

our supply chain transform through 

our traceability efforts. We have also 

progressed on other fronts such as 

delinking deforestation and production. 

At the same time, we recognise that 

much remains to be done and we 

will continue to carry out work on the 

ground to ensure that what we started in 

previous years is followed through.  

ROBUST 2019 PERFORMANCE 

GAR ended 2019 on a high note. The 

good performance of our downstream 

business balanced the adverse impact 

of lower average Crude Palm Oil (CPO) 

prices during the year. This validates 

GAR’s strategy of investing in and growing 

a diverse, fully integrated business over 

the last several years, providing business 

resiliency against price fluctuations of the 

type seen for most of the FY2019. 

Over the years, we have successfully 

broadened the global market for palm- 

based value-added products. This covers 

an extensive portfolio of sustainably 

produced and quality products for food, 

industrial and bio-energy usage. We 

also plan to expand the capacity of our 

biodiesel facility in Kalimantan in order 

to support the government’s biodiesel 

programme. A full report on our financial 

performance can be found in the GAR 

Annual Report 2019.

ON TRACK TOWARDS FULL 

TRACEABILITY AND SUPPLY CHAIN 

TRANSFORMATION

In 2019, we forged ahead with our 

Traceability to the Plantation (TTP) efforts. 

As of end 2019, 78 percent of the FFB 

processed in GAR-owned and third party 

supplier mills is fully traceable.

Aside from providing our customers with 

verified information on where and from 

whom we source our raw materials, we 

have been using traceability to strengthen 

our relationship with our suppliers. This 

has enabled us to help them further

We continue to support our suppliers 

through targeted training on key issues 

like human rights, Free, Prior and 

Informed Consent (FPIC) implementation 

and responsible labour practices. We 

have also shared and emphasised the 

importance of adhering to GSEP with all 

our 424 suppliers. 

We extended support to independent 

smallholders through the Independent 

Farmers Replanting Programme and 

other schemes. These programmes are 

aimed at improving their productivity, 

livelihoods and income.

PROGRESS ON OTHER FRONTS

In 2019, GAR joined a pioneering 

industry initiative to improve surveillance 

of deforestation in Indonesia. Together 

with nine major palm oil producers and 

buyers, we are funding the development 

of a new, radar-based forest monitoring 

system known as Radar Alerts for 

Detecting Deforestation (RADD). This will 

make it easier for us to see deforestation 

happening in near-real-time and to take 

speedy follow-up actions.

A challenging fire season in 2019 put 

our fire management procedures to the 

test. With our strict adherence to the 

Zero Burning Policy and our strengthened 

fire management processes, we were able 

to keep the fire-affected areas contained, 

Looking ahead, we will continue to 

work on our many initiatives including 

achieving full TTP.

Our efforts continue to strategically 

support the UN Sustainable 

Development Goals especially goals 

2, 12 and 15 which focuses on food 

security, responsible production and 

consumption and protection of life  

on land. 

FUTURE OUTLOOK 

As I write this, the world is facing 

unprecedented challenges due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic. The disruptions and 

uncertainties experienced by communities 

and businesses have been and continue 

to be profound. It is during such times that 

we need to remain true to our values and 

keep all our stakeholders at the heart of our 

decision-making. Our immediate priority 

is to safeguard the wellbeing of everyone, 

including our employees and smallholders 

and local communities, while minimising 

business disruptions. We are committed 

to addressing the need for protective 

equipment for our employees and local 

communities surrounding all our operational 

locations globally during the pandemic. 

Especially in Indonesia, we are working 

together with the Government of Indonesia 

to alleviate the pandemic in collaboration 

with Indonesia Chamber of Commerce and 

Tzu Chi Foundation Indonesia. 

Longer-term measures include 

maintaining our many partnerships and 

alternative livelihood programmes with 

local communities aimed at diversifying 

their income streams and building 

food security and resilience. The global 

pandemic has shown us that it is critical 

to ensure that farming communities, who 

form the basis of food supply chains and 

global food security, are taken care of 

and empowered. 

This crisis will be a true test for 

companies. GAR’s strong vertically 

integrated business model and 

sustainable operations provide resilience 

during industry volatility and disruption, 

including the current COVID-19 

pandemic. With the momentum we 

have gained over the years, we remain 

hopeful that we will stay on track 

and continue to provide sustainably 

produced and superior quality palm oil 

products, while creating value for all  

our stakeholders.

prevention with communities around us

Palm oil and its place in sustainable 

development

Palm oil attracts more controversy than 

many other agricultural commodities with 

many detractors claiming it has detrimental 

impacts on the environment and rural 

communities. Yet, at the same time, palm 

oil which is responsibly produced has a 

crucial role to play in sustainable production, 

consumption and food security. 

 

The tropical crop has the highest yield of any 

oil crop and makes more efficient use of land 

in its production than any other vegetable 

for rural, remote areas allowing access to 

healthcare and education, further improving 

standards of living. 

The challenge for the sector is to correct 

unsustainable practices in some parts of 

the industry while strengthening its positive 

role in contributing to socio-economic 

development. 

GAR, as a leader in responsible and 

sustainable production, recognises these 

challenges and opportunities. As we enter 

this decisive decade in meeting the UN 

oil. It is extremely versatile and can be 

processed to form a wide range of products 

with different melting points, consistencies 

and characteristics, serving a myriad of uses, 

from food to cosmetics to cleaning products. 

Economically, the development of palm 

oil plantations has been a boon to tropical 

developing countries. In Indonesia, the 

sector has helped to lift millions of rural 

farmers out of absolute poverty. A palm oil 

farmer can earn up to seven times more 

than a subsistence farmer. Palm oil estates 

provide critical infrastructure and facilities 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) we 

are committed to working collaboratively 

with all stakeholders along our value chain to 

create a responsible palm oil industry. 

We believe that when done right, palm oil 

can take the lead, amongst agribusinesses, 

to delink production from deforestation 

and contribute to a more sustainable future 

focused on conserving the environment, 

ending poverty, providing decent work and 

economic growth, reducing inequalities, and 

championing responsible production and 

consumption.

 Our Supply Chain



As an agribusiness, GAR understands that 

our long-term success relies on adopting 

sustainable business practices.

 

We recognise the value of conserving 

the natural environment, which houses 

rich biodiversity and provides vital 

ecosystem services. At the same time, 

our belief that economic growth, social 

progress and environmental protection 

can and should go hand-in-hand. 

The GSEP establishes firm commitments 

that support these beliefs and we have set 

stretching targets to drive progress. Over 

time, we will update our approach to keep 

up with emerging concerns, as well as 

global and local trends. 

GAR provides ongoing training for 

employees on the GSEP. In 2019, around 

1,230 employees received GSEP training. 

We have also shared the GSEP with all our 

424 third-party suppliers. 

we are aware that growth in the palm oil 

industry supports millions of livelihoods in 

Indonesia. Our business needs to balance 

both realities. 

At the heart of our approach to sustainability  

is the GAR Social and Environmental 

Policy or the GSEP. The GSEP embodies 

Our Approach to  

Sustainable Palm Oil

Sustainable Palm Oil

ACTIONS SUPPORTING THE SDGS 

GAR AND THE UN SUSTAINABLE 

DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS)

In 2015, the 193 member states of the 

United Nations adopted the Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs), a new 

agenda for sustainable development. 

The SDGs represent an interrelated and 

holistic framework of the most pressing 

challenges facing humanity and require 

urgent actions from all actors. 

As a business operating in the palm 

oil industry, GAR has a role to play in 

supporting many of the 17 SDGs. As 

part of our strategic approach, we have 

chosen to focus our efforts on the goals 

where we can make the most meaningful 

contributions.

Following an assessment of the goals 

and their underlying targets, we have 

identified three SDGs – SDG 2, SDG 12 

and SDG 15 – which we believe align 

best with our strengths and our areas 

of impact as a company. They also 

represent the greatest opportunities to 

partner with other stakeholders and work 

together on sustainable development in 

support of SDG 17.

With the global population expected to continue 

growing exponentially, reaching an estimated 

10 billion by 2050, food security is becoming 

increasingly challenging. More food will have to be 

grown in the face of decreasing arable land and 

climate change. 

As an agribusiness, GAR is committed to the 

sustainable production of palm oil as a key food 

ingredient. While palm oil is already the highest-

yielding vegetable oil crop in the world, we have 

continued with R&amp;D of even better yielding seeds 

and planting materials. These will reduce pressure 

on the need for more agricultural land. We are also 

exploring the development of seed stock that is 

more resilient to the increasing threat of droughts 

and diseases stemming from climate change. 

Another area of R&amp;D involves developing high 

oleic palm oil which has a better nutritional 

profile. Our focus on productivity and improving 

agronomic practices extends to our plasma and 

independent smallholders. We support them to 

earn decent incomes, while adopting practices  

that protect the environment. 

(Relates to SDG Targets: 2.3; 2.4)

For more information please see, p 31-32, 36, 49, 57 

Achieving responsible consumption and 

production is essential to ensure that the natural 

resources we depend on are not depleted and are 

used efficiently, while minimising the impact to 

human health and the environment.

At GAR we do this through actions that include 

minimising waste through recycling and reuse, as 

well as phasing out harmful chemical substances in 

our operations. Since 2015, we have recycled 100 

percent of waste from the production of CPO in 

our upstream operations. We have stopped using 

the herbicide paraquat, while continuing to use 

a combination of natural solutions and biological 

controls for pests.

These commitments which are in our GSEP also 

apply to our supply chain. We are currently guiding 

our suppliers to improve their processes in these 

areas. 

(Relates to SDG Targets 12.2;12.4;12.5)

For more information please see p 29-32, 55-57 

Forests provide critical ecosystem services, host 

a large amount of biodiversity and support the 

livelihoods of indigenous peoples. As a palm 

oil company, we acknowledge that we have an 

important role to play in ensuring the protection 

of forest areas. This is an area which we have been 

working on for many years. 

GAR oversees and supports the conservation of 

144,000 hectares of conservation areas, directly 

and indirectly. This includes 72,000 hectares of 

HCS and HCV areas across our operations. On a 

landscape level, through partnerships with local 

communities, we have obtained agreements to 

protect over 7,700 hectares of forests. Through the 

engagement of our suppliers we are supporting 

their commitments to conserve 65,000 hectares  

of forests. 

GAR is also taking part in an industry initiative 

to fund radar monitoring aimed at improving 

surveillance of deforestation in Indonesia. 

(Relates to SDG Targets 15.1;15.2;15.3;15.5)

For more information please see p 51-56 

to help smallholders improve livelihoods and 

sustainability. 

(Relates to SDG Targets 17.16) 

For more information please see p 20, 32, 49, 

51, 52, 53 

To achieve sustainable 

development, partnerships 

between governments, the 

private sector and civil society 

is required.

All of our efforts are underpinned by local 

and global partnerships. These range 

from collaborations with communities and 

suppliers on conservation; working with 

top research facilities and universities on 

improving biodiversity; and with customers

102-26, 103-2]

We are committed to the highest 

standards of corporate governance, and 

to complying with the principles of the 

Code of Corporate Governance, reviewed 

last in 2018.

The make-up of our board is an important 

part of our approach to corporate 

governance. Currently, the board has eight 

members, including five independent 

directors, who exercise objective judgment 

in our corporate affairs. The board is 

headed by GAR’s Chairman and CEO,  

Mr Franky O. Widjaja, and is responsible 

for overseeing all aspects of our business. 

A full list of our board of directors and their 

profiles can be found on our website and in 

the GAR Annual Report.

The board and senior management 

are fully involved in and support GAR’s 

sustainability commitments under the 

GSEP. A Sustainability Committee (SC), 

which is chaired by Ms Jesslyne Widjaja, 

Corporate Strategy and Business 

Development Director, oversees all matters 

related to responsible business. The SC 

comprises the senior leadership team from 

the upstream, downstream and corporate 

business units as well as the head and 

other staff members of the Sustainability 

Department. The SC reports directly to  

Mr Franky O. Widjaja, and meets 

regularly to oversee the development, 

implementation and monitoring of the 

GSEP and our performance across all our 

business operations.    

Over the years we have continued to 

invest additional resources with the aim 

of embedding responsible palm practices 

in our day-to-day operations. We have 

a sustainability team of about 370 staff 

in Jakarta and in the field working to 

implement our sustainability measures. 

We employ specialists to oversee and 

handle key areas such as conflict resolution, 

HCS/HCV management, fire prevention, 

community consent (FPIC), responsible 

sourcing, grievance management and 

health and safety. The sustainability 

department also works with colleagues 

in Human Resources on labour issues to 

ensure fair labour practices are upheld, in 

line with the GSEP.

At GAR, we are committed to 

pursuing our business objectives with 

integrity and in compliance with the 

law. We comply with applicable laws 

in all the countries in which we do 

business, including all anti-bribery and 

corruption regulations. Additionally, 

GAR does not make any corporate 

political contributions. No significant 

cases of bribery or corruption were 

reported in 2019. 

We expect all our employees, 

contractors, suppliers and business 

partners to adhere to the GAR Code 

of Conduct, which is communicated  

to our existing and new employees. 

The Code is purposefully designed  

to be practically applicable to our 

day-to-day business, with definite 

guidelines on acceptable and 

unacceptable behaviour. It applies 

to all employees as well as  Board 

members. It also details avenues for 

raising concerns and whistleblowing 

procedures, encouraging employees 

to report any possible improprieties, 

in confidence and without fear of 

retaliation.

ranked GAR top amongst palm oil trading 

companies for tackling and resolving 

complaints with a 76 percent rate of 

resolution. 

 

We also have a grievance mechanism 

in place for stakeholders including 

employees to raise grievances involving 

our own operations as well as social 

conflict handling procedures. 

The Code also emphasises the 

Company’s commitment to fair 

employment practices; diversity; and its 

stand against discrimination and zero 

tolerance for harassment or abuse. No 

significant cases of harassment and 

abuse were reported in 2019.

Following internal review as a result 

of a closed corruption case in 20181 

involving three former employees at 

a GAR subsidiary, PT BAP, we have 

continued with annual mandatory 

refresher courses and online e-testing 

on the Code of Conduct for our 

employees. Executives also signed 

Integrity Pacts committing them to 

ethical and lawful behaviour. 

We also require our suppliers to comply 

with the Supplier Code of Conduct, 

which obligates them to adhere to our 

policies including the GSEP.

MONITORING, EVALUATION AND 

REPORTING

[103-3]

Under the GSEP we are committed to 

monitoring, evaluating and reporting 

our performance. We provide regular 

updates on our progress on several 

key using a variety of channels. For 

example, our Sustainability Dashboard 

initiatives is regularly updated with 

information on TTP, fire incidents, 

conservation, community engagement 

and grievance cases. Other channels of 

reporting include the GAR website, as 

well as reports such as the GAR Annual 

Report and the GAR Sustainability 

Report. We also participate in several 

disclosure platforms including CDP 

(which incorporates Task Force on 

such as local communities, smallholders, 

government, Civil Society Organisations 

(CSOs), academia, suppliers, the 

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 

(RSPO), our industry peers, customers, 

and implementation partners.  

 

In several instances, we have worked 

with CSO stakeholders like Greenpeace 

to develop new guidelines and standards 

such as the High Carbon Stock Approach 

(HCSA) to address deforestation 

concerns. This approach is increasingly 

being adopted, not only in our industry, 

but also in other sectors such as forestry.

Our main sustainability roadmap, the 

GSEP, was developed with feedback and 

input from key stakeholders including 

CSOs such as Greenpeace, Rainforest 

Action Network (RAN), Forest 

Peoples Programme (FPP) and our 

implementation partner, Earthworm 

Foundation (formerly The Forest Trust). 

We continue to improve our Standard 

Operational Procedures (SOP) for 

carrying out FPIC, handling grievances, 

conflict resolution and participatory 

mapping, often with input from 

external stakeholders such as CSOs. 

We also have several partnerships with 

customers and academic institutions 

designed to further our progress 

towards responsible production.

Finding the best way to operate 

sustainably often requires new, 

innovative solutions to thorny issues. 

We recognise that this is only possible 

through working collaboratively 

with relevant experts and key

Key to our approach in responsible palm

significant economic, environmental, 

social and governance issues that shape 

our success and that are of greatest

In 2017, we worked with specialist 

sustainability consulting firm Corporate 

Citizenship to update and refresh 

our understanding of our material 

sustainability issues. Our approach 

followed the principle of materiality as 

set out in the GRI Standards and included 

the assessment of sustainability issues 

across our entire value chain. We gathered 

a balance of internal and external 

stakeholder perspectives, through a mix 

of qualitative and quantitative methods. 

This included desk research, surveys and 

interviews. The detailed process can be 

seen on the GAR website.

medium concern to stakeholders. 

They are actively managed by the 

business. Updates on management 

and performance in relation to these 

issues is included in external reporting 

as relevant, based on sustainability 

context and stakeholder interest. 

• Moderate issues are of lower relative 

importance to both GAR and external 

stakeholders. However, these issues 

are still part of GAR’s responsible

Transforming 

our Supply Chain

In order to meet our sustainability 

commitments, we recognise we must 

source our raw materials from suppliers 

who agree to follow the same high 

standards of responsible production.  

We continue to make substantial 

investments in time and resources to  

help our supply chain transform and 

change for the better. 

OUR PALM SUPPLY CHAIN

[102-9]

The bulk of our procurement comprises 

crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel 

(PK) for our downstream business in 

Indonesia. In 2019, these raw materials 

were sourced from 424 third-party mills 

and 46 GAR-owned mills in Indonesia. 

Fresh fruit bunches (FFB), the feedstock 

for the mills, are in turn supplied by 

our own nucleus estates, third-party 

estates, thousands of individual farmers 

(plasma and independent), as well 

as brokers and agents who buy from

to make significant progress towards 

full Traceability to the Plantation (TTP) in 

2019, achieving nearly 80 percent TTP 

for GAR-owned and third-party mills. 

We believe we are on track to hit our 

target of 100 percent TTP by end 2020, 

(subject to possible delays due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic). 

Aside from being able to tell our 

customers where and from whom we 

source our raw materials, traceability 

provides us with a ready-made and 

invaluable platform for relationship-

building with our suppliers. Through this, 

we work with them to transform our supply

Transforming 

our Supply Chain





Read more about Ksatria Sawit on our website. 

What is Ksatria Sawit and what are  

its goals?

“Ksatria Sawit” is a Bahasa Indonesia term 

meaning ‘palm oil warrior’ in English. The 

name is also a Bahasa abbreviation which 

means transforming the supply chain through 

independent smallholders and agents, that’s 

why we chose the name. This programme 

reflects one of the pillars of our GAR Social 

and Environmental Policy (GSEP) which is 

to build a traceable and transparent supply 

chain that extends to farmers, and is a 

continuation of our efforts since 2015.

At the end of 2018, we were 62 percent 

traceable to the plantation. From our 

research, we found the majority of our supply 

chain that had not yet been traced were mills 

who bought a lot of raw materials from agents 

who collect Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB) from 

independent smallholders. These two groups 

of people – independent smallholders and 

agents – are an important part of our supply 

chain, and we needed to make an effort to 

understand the problems they face and work 

with them to improve their practices.

We initiated Ksatria Sawit where we work 

together with palm oil mills, agents and 

independent smallholders, to achieve full 

traceability.”

 Our People

 Consumers

Smallholders are a critical part of the palm 

supply chain in Indonesia with about two 

million farmers controlling around 44 

percent of palm oil estates in the country. 

Improving their livelihoods and responsible 

practices is key to improving the industry. 

We have been supporting and helping 

all our plasma smallholders achieve 

responsible farming for almost three 

decades. In 2019, around 70,300 plasma 

smallholders supplied FFB to GAR, about 

21 percent of our total intake of FFB. 

While GAR does not own the plasma 

plantations, they are closely integrated 

into our management system and we 

take the lead in promoting their success 

while adhering to the GSEP. In 2019, our 

smallholders achieved a CPO yield of around 

4.8 tonnes per hectare, which is among 

the highest in the industry in Indonesia.

Through our partnership, we provide 

plasma smallholders access to high-

yielding seeds and good quality fertilisers. 

We also ensure knowledge transfer and 

capacity building through regular training 

on Good Agricultural Practices.

GAR also extends support to a few 

thousand independent smallholders 

through the Independent Farmers 

Replanting Programme and other 

technical and financial schemes. 

The Independent Farmers Replanting 

Programme  was set up to encourage 

independent smallholders to replant with 

better quality, higher-yielding seeds which 

will help boost productivity and incomes, 

while potentially reducing the demand 

for new agricultural land. It gives farmers 

access to financing, helping them sustain 

their livelihoods during the four years it 

takes for the new seedlings to mature. 

Since 2014, GAR has helped independent 

farmers secure loans of nearly IDR 400 

billion from state-owned banks. 

 

We continue to run other finance and 

support programmes for independent 

smallholders. Through the Smallholders 

Development Programme, GAR has 

provided technical assistance and long 

tenure interest-free credit to independent 

farmers in East Kalimantan since 2013. 

Farmers have access to high-yielding 

seeds, fertiliser and herbicides, and 

heavy equipment rental, at below market 

rates. To date, we have disbursed more 

than IDR30 billion in interest-free loans 

and other aid. 

Our R&amp;D division, SMARTRI runs regular 

training programmes for smallholders. Each 

year, they train several hundred farmers in 

agronomic practices focusing especially 

on integrated pest management and 

fertiliser management. Beneficial plants 

are given to the farmers at the end of the 

training session, to be planted in their 

field to contribute to the biological control 

of herbivories. In addition, SMARTRI 

staff also visit smallholder farms when 

requested, to help solve pest outbreak 

issues or nutrient deficiency cases.

Support for

70,300  

plasma smallholders

such as Aceh, North/South Sumatra, Riau, 

Jambi, Lampung, and Bangka Belitung. 

We estimate that the programme will 

help us trace almost 60,000 smallholders. 

Through this programme we also hope 

to develop new mechanisms to help 

smallholders and agents adopt sustainable 

practices. 



We operate a transparent and accountable 

system where stakeholders can inform us 

of issues within our supply chain using our 

grievance process. As part of this process, 

we conduct ad-hoc site visits where an 

issue has been raised by an external 

stakeholder or discovered through our 

own monitoring. Our engagement is 

reported in our Grievance List. In 2019,  

32 new grievances were raised involving 

our third-party suppliers. We have 

resolved 11 of the new cases and two 

older cases (see p 18). Case studies which 

highlight action plans or our suppliers are 

published on our website.

SUPPORTING SMALLHOLDERS

[103-2, 103-3]

Suppliers who participate in our 

engagement and assessment processes 

are generally receptive to proposals for 

improvement. However, suppliers deemed 

non-compliant will no longer form part 

of our supply chain. In 2019, we stopped 

procuring from about 0.5 percent of our 

suppliers for non-compliance with our 

GSEP commitments, and from over seven 

percent since 2015.

are risks amongst some of our suppliers 

whether through lack of formal policies 

or through certain actions which can be 

perceived as indications of irresponsible 

labour practices. 

We are therefore proactively helping our 

suppliers review their labour policies. This 

includes providing recommendations 

to strengthen SOPs and recruitment 

mechanisms. We are training and 

supporting suppliers to formally 

implement no child labour practices and 

protect children within their operations. 

We have helped several suppliers create 

action plans for improvement and we 

monitor their progress. 

In 2019, we organised three workshops 

on the topic of child labour prevention 

in East Kalimantan, Langkat and Central 

Kalimantan. We also developed a video 

to help educate suppliers on child labour 

risks.

Aside from child labour issues, we are 

carrying out a workload study to help 

design guidelines for suppliers on setting 

workload incentives that are achievable 

by individual workers.

ENSURING CONSUMER SAFETY,  

WELL-BEING AND PRODUCT QUALITY

[103-2, 103-3, 416-1]

Our consumers rely on GAR brands for 

safe and high quality products that they 

can trust. We use international standards 

to ensure the quality of our products, bar 

codes for traceability, and we systematically 

record expiry dates and batch data.

All six palm oil refineries in Indonesia 

are accredited with ISO 9001 and three 

plants have ISO 22000 certification, 

which recognises that they adhere 

to strict international food safety 

standards. Three plants also have FSSC 

22000 food safety certification. The six 

facilities also have OHSAS 18001, ISO 

14001, Halal and Kosher certification. 

In addition, the refineries in Lampung, 

Belawan, Marunda, Tarjun and Lubuk 

Gaung have FDA accreditation and we 

have GMP+B2 certification for lauric 

products at the Belawan, Lampung, 

Lubuk Gaung. Five of our plants 

Caring for our Customers 

and Consumers

also have CPPOB certification (Good 

Manufacturing Practices for Processed 

Food). 

We are also committed to rolling out 

the Hazards Analysis and Critical Control 

Point or HACCP food safety system 

across our operations. 

We are aware of consumer concerns 

about the health and safety aspects 

of our end products. Our Downstream 

Research and Development department 

is actively addressing this area. GAR 

continues to focus on minimising 

occurrence of 3-monochloropropane 

diol (3-MCPD) precursors following the 

European Food Standards Authority 

revision of 3-MCPD and glycidyl fatty 

acid esters (GE) levels. Our business 

is successfully tackling the 3MCPD/

GE issue holistically, for example by 

minimising Free Fatty Acids (FFA) in 

CPO and optimising refining techniques. 

We are also continuing to optimise 

identification methods for 3-MCPD and 

GE esters. In 2019, GAR participated in 

the FAPAS UK 3-MCPDE, 2-MCPDE and 

GE proficiency tests with satisfactory 

results. These tests are conducted yearly. 

Read more about our efforts here.

 

We have put considerable effort into 

removing trans fatty acids from all 

our products and as of end 2019, we 

achieved this for 98 percent of all 

margarine, shortening and specialty 

products. While we aimed to be fully 

trans-fat-free by 2019, we have a 

small number of customers wishing 

to keep their existing formulas. This 

represents less than two percent of our 

total products and is mainly for local 

Indonesian consumption. Nevertheless, 

we continue to work towards the WHO 

target to eliminate industrial trans fatty 

acids by 2023.

The Indonesian government mandates 

fortification of Vitamin A in cooking oil. 

We comply with this and are making 

sure we provide healthy fortified cooking 

oil. In addition to Vitamin A, our Filma 

margarine is also fortified with vitamins 

B1, B2 and B3.

Following interest from several global 

customers, we have started exploring 

the development of a non-GMO high 

oleic palm oil (all our palm oil raw 

materials are non-GMO). High oleic oil 

is high in monounsaturated fats and has 

a better nutritional profile. In 2019, a 

joint research project between upstream 

and downstream R&amp;D began to explore 

developing new hybrid high oleic palm 

oil. Several hybrids have been selected 

and tested at pilot scale.

goods and services, and therefore the 

amount required for living.

In terms of benefits, full-time workers 

receive free healthcare for themselves 

and their family, company housing, 

water, electricity and free education for 

their children from kindergarten to junior 

high. GAR also provides its full-time 

workers with basic necessities such as rice. 

Our part-time workers receive free medical 

services at our polyclinics and their 

children have access to education at our 

estate schools.

RECOGNISING, RESPECTING AND 

STRENGTHENING WORKERS’ RIGHTS

[103-2, 103-3, 409-1]

We believe in the fair, equal and respectful 

treatment for all our employees. Through 

the GSEP, we have reinforced our 

commitment to ensuring that the rights 

of all people working in our operations 

are respected. The company also fully 

complies with local, national and ratified 

international laws. We adhere to all 

Indonesian labour laws covering issues 

such as freedom of association for our 

employees, decent pay and working 

hours, non-discrimination and the 

complete elimination of child and forced 

labour. Where legal frameworks are not 

yet in place, we defer to the International 

Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Declaration 

on Fundamental Principles and Rights at 

Work. 

Our commitment to fair labour is also 

emphasised in our company Code of 

Conduct and employment practices. We

have an equal opportunities policy on 

employment, banning discrimination 

based on race, national origin, religion, 

disability, gender, sexual orientation, 

union membership and political 

affiliation. Employees enter into 

employment freely as we do not require 

our employees to deposit identity 

papers or money. 

We are also engaging our supply chain 

on our labour standards, including 

prohibiting child labour, as part of our 

efforts to help them comply with the 

GSEP and adopt responsible practices. 

For more information on how we work  

on human rights in our supply chain,  

see the section on Transforming our 

Supply Chain.

PROHIBITING CHILD LABOUR

[408-1]

In accordance with regulations, the 

minimum age for employment in GAR 

in any capacity is 18 years. We aim to 

prevent all forms of child labour, and 

we rigorously enforce these principles 

at all our plantations, mills and other 

places of work. Our recruitment officers 

check identification cards against the 

prospective employee’s schooling 

records, such as their school diploma, to 

ensure that we do not employ children. 

We also provide schools and day care 

centres for our workers’ children to 

ensure that parents have somewhere safe 

to send their children while they are at 

work. 

DIVERSITY AND GENDER EQUALITY 

[103-2, 103-3, 405-1]

We believe in promoting gender equality 

in the workplace. However, the manual 

nature of agricultural work means that 

certain jobs continue to be more suited to 

male rather than female employees. Male 

workers perform heavier physical tasks 

such as harvesting FFB (which can weigh 

between 23- 27 kg) and carrying them to 

trucks for transport to the mills. Women 

generally work on weeding and collecting 

loose fruits that have fallen on the ground. 

Many women in rural areas also prefer to 

take on part-time jobs, as it gives them 

the flexibility for other responsibilities such 

as tending to the household; childcare; 

family gardens and other income-earning 

businesses.  

We have zero tolerance for sexual 

harassment. We conduct extensive 

training and socialisation for all estate and 

mill workers to ensure this is understood. 

Gender committees with representatives 

from labour unions and management 

have been set up to promote female 

participation and advancement in the 

workplace. These committees also 

handle sexual harassment complaints. 

When a case of harassment is reported 

either formally or informally, the relevant 

committee investigates the situation to 

determine whether further sanctions or 

law enforcement actions are needed. 

During the investigation, the committee 

also provides assistance and support to 

the victim. In 2019, no significant cases of 

harassment or abuse were reported. 

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND 

TRADE UNION MEMBERSHIP 

[102-41, 407-1]

121 labour 

unions representing 

&gt;81,000 

employees 

Freedom of association is mandated by  

Indonesian Law and Regulation No. 21/2000  

on Trade/Labour Unions and is in line 

with International Labour Organization 

Convention No. 98 on the freedom of 

organisation and collective bargaining. 

Each of our units has union 

representatives, elected by members. 

They meet with local management 

representatives regularly in bipartite 

forums, to discuss and resolve issues. In 

2019, there were 121 labour unions across 

our operations representing over 81,000 

employees (79 percent). 

TRAINING AND DEVELOPING OUR 

PEOPLE’S SKILLS

[103-2, 103-3, 404-2, 404-3]

We see training and development as an 

investment that delivers benefits to both 

employees and the employer.

GAR spent nearly USD 4 million in 2019 

on training and development in our 

Indonesian operations. 

 

To develop talent, we have launched 

several key initiatives linked to GAR’s 

Competency Model, such as Managing 

for Results, Interaction Management, 

Situational Leadership and Myers-Briggs 

Type Indicator (MBTI). Compulsory 

training that focuses on preparation of 

the individual’s career progression is 

ongoing through the Basic Management 

Development Programme, Supervisory 

Management Development Programme, 

Middle Management Development 

Programme, General Management 

Development Programme and Executive 

Development Programme. 

We have also introduced the Objective 

&amp; Key Results (OKR) approach to achieve 

business results. Through OKR, every 

individual will work towards concrete, 

action-oriented and results-driven

is one of the important aspects to 

ensure the effectiveness of OKR. 

This can now be carried out through 

Workday, a HR digital platform. Using 

Workday, all GAR employees will 

undergo a career development and 

Key Performance Indicator (KPI) review 

at least once a year.

CREATING A SAFE AND HEALTHY 

WORKPLACE

[103-2, 103-3, 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-

OHS

With thousands of employees 

across our operations, we take our 

responsibility in providing a safe and 

healthy workplace very seriously.  Our 

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 

management system aims to minimise 

workplace accidents, fatalities and 

other negative health impacts and 

covers all employees. The OHS systems 

that we implement are based on 

national and international frameworks. 

National requirements include Indonesian 

national OHS standards (regulation no. 50 

(2012)). We also base our OHS system on 

various certifications including ISO 14001, 

OHSAS 18001 and ISO 45001. Sustainable 

palm oil certification OHS requirements 

are also taken into consideration including 

the Principles and Criteria of RSPO, ISCC 

and ISPO. 

Additionally, our Indonesian operations 

under SMART are certified under the 

SMK3 (Sistem Manajemen Keselamatan 

dan Kesehatan Kerja) OHS management 

system, in recognition of good OHS 

management and implementation. 

Fifteen mills and one estate have been 

reviewed and certified under SMK3. These 

certifications are valid for three years and a 

fresh audit is carried out prior to renewal. 

We currently have over 220 OHS experts 

within our workforce and conduct periodic 

training for all employees in accordance 

with national regulations. In 2019, more 

than 480 of our employees received 

OHS training conducted and certified by 

Ministry of Manpower of the Republic of 

Indonesia.

In compliance with Law No. 1 of 1970 on 

Occupational Safety, each of our units 

has an OHS Supervisory Committee, 

which promotes cooperation between 

management and employees on OHS. 

On average, the committees for our 

plantations and mills have 40 members, 

with 60 percent worker representation. 

The committee meets monthly to 

review OHS data and performance. 

Monthly safety briefings are given to 

employees. 

We also assess work-related hazards 

through Hazard Identification and Risk 

Analysis, and by conducting OHS Cross 

Inspection to record unsafe actions and 

conditions. Examples include no or 

inadequate covers on rotating objects, 

lack of employee awareness and 

knowledge. The OHS Committee will 

consider these hazards and risks and 

determine suitable action to address 

gaps such as additional training; 

reviewing and strengthening safety 

SOPs; and ensuring Personal Protective 

Equipment (PPE) is adequate and worn 

by employees. 

All our downstream facilities have 

Occupational Health Service Centres. 

The centres conduct Health Risk 

Assessments (HRA) annually to identify 

occupational health hazards and 

establish control measures to minimise 

such risks. 

Workplace accidents

2019 involving our workers. The fatal

up programme is part of our effort to 

prevent and treat work-related illnesses 

through early detection.

To promote employee wellness, talks on 

various health topics are held regularly. 

Examples include talks on the prevention 

of HIV and the dangers of drug addiction.  

Information is also disseminated on 

ergonomics and work fatigue. We 

also provide healthy menus based on 

medical advice at staff canteens, in an 

effort to promote better nutrition for our 

employees. Sports and fitness facilities 

incidents were related to accidents when 

using tractors; falling FFB; being struck 

by lightning; being caught or struck by 

machinery; and falls.

 

We take the health and safety of 

our employees and contractors very 

seriously and to address this, we have 

investigated each accident thoroughly 

and implemented various action plans to 

safeguard against future occurrences such 

as improved or targeted safety training. 

We will continue to work on instilling a 

stronger OHS awareness and practices 

throughout our operations as well as 

continuing to aim for a declining trend in 

workplace accidents and fatalities.     

Healthcare and Well-being  

[403-6]

We are committed to providing our entire 

workforce access to healthcare, including 

in remote rural areas where there is less 

incentive for healthcare professionals 

to practice. We have 140 clinics, which 

cover all our estates, and more than 330 

medical personnel providing free medical 

services for our workers.  

The medical care that our facilities 

provide includes pre-employment 

medical check-ups for new recruits, and 

special medical check-ups for workers 

who are exposed to potential health 

and safety hazards. The medical check-

GAR’s COVID-19 response 

GAR has been progressively implementing 

OHS measures in light of the COVID-19 

pandemic in 2020 and in line with 

government directives in countries where 

we operate. In Indonesia where we 

remain operational, we are protecting the 

health and wellbeing of our employees 

while preventing spread of the disease. 

More information on the measures being 

implemented in Indonesia can be found 

here. In Singapore, GAR is complying 

with the government’s Safe Management 

Measures at the workplace. We have

government guidelines. Read about our

for employees such as basketball and 

badminton courts are also available. 

Security guards 

[410-1]

The safety of our workers and their 

families is of utmost importance, 

particularly in isolated rural areas. We 

employ security guards for our operations 

in Indonesia to ensure that our plantations 

and surrounding communities are secure. 

Our security guards are required to 



undergo a 21-day comprehensive training 

programme by the Bhakti Manunggal 

Karya Centre of Education and Training 

(BMK). Upon completion, they receive a 

certificate from the Indonesian National 

Police. The programme covers human 

rights standards as well as professional 

ethics.

Our security guards do not carry firearms 

but are equipped with standard defensive 

security tools such as batons and handcuffs.

plantations 

have social and 

community development 

programmes

The palm oil sector has helped to 

accelerate economic and social progress 

in tropical countries like Indonesia and 

Malaysia. Millions of farmers have seen 

their livelihoods and living standards 

improve in the past few decades, thanks 

to a boom in demand for palm oil. 

As one of the largest palm oil companies 

in Indonesia, we have created thousands 

of jobs in rural and remote areas. 

We have also helped provide public 

infrastructure such as roads, bridges, 

community halls and places of worship. 

Prior to developing an estate, we carry 

out Environmental and Social Impact 

Assessments (EIA and SIA) at the site of 

our operations. The results are shared 

with the local communities. All our 

plantations also have social community 

engagement and development plans. 

What we do in the community helps 

to contribute to the aims of UN SDGs 

especially in terms of tackling poverty, 

improving infrastructure and reducing 

inequalities. 

At the same time, we recognise that 

the establishment of plantations creates 

changes for local communities and 

indigenous people. As stated in the GSEP, 

we are committed to respecting human 

rights and fulfilling Free, Prior and Informed 

Consent (FPIC) requirements before any 

operations begin.1 GAR is also committed 

to improving its processes and procedures 

with regards to respecting the customary 

rights of local and indigenous communities.

since 2015

FPIC is a central tenet of the GSEP and 

part of our commitment to upholding 

human and community rights. We 

implement FPIC in all our plantations. 

Respecting FPIC means we ensure 

that decision-making by indigenous 

peoples and local communities 

regarding the presence of our 

operations is done without pressure 

and intimidation (free), performed 

before an activity that has impact 

on the surrounding communities is 

carried out (prior), and with sufficient 

knowledge about the activity and 

its impact on the surrounding 

communities (informed), so they may 

express agreement or disagreement to 

such activity (consent). Our FPIC SOP 

can be found here. 

Our rollout of Participatory Mapping 

(PM), including land tenure studies, 

seeks to ensure FPIC is implemented 

properly. In 2019, we focused more 

resources on PM to accelerate the 

process throughout our concessions. 

The PM status at 18 of our concessions 

can be found on our website. See the 

section on Environmental Management 

or our website for further details. 

We continue to carry out FPIC 

remediation in our concessions in 

Central and West Kalimantan following 

feedback that initial FPIC requirements 

were not fully met. This process is 

being conducted with local CSO, 

LINKS and Ekologika consultants. It 

involves fresh consultations with local 

communities and conducting PM to 

ensure that the community’s land 

rights are fully respected. To date, the 

remediation process has been carried 

out in over 30 villages.

In 2019, there were no incidents of 

FPIC violations or violations of the 

rights of indigenous peoples.

RESPONSIBLE CONFLICT RESOLUTION

Our policies and practices are designed 

to minimise the likelihood of any 

conflicts arising from our operations. 

However, when these conflicts do arise, 

we are committed to working towards a 

responsible resolution.

Our conflict management system maps 

all conflicts related to our operations and 

develops action plans to address them. It 

incorporates transparent monitoring and 

reporting, the option for local community 

and customary groups to access 

independent legal and technical advice, 

the ability for complainants to choose 

individuals or groups to support them or 

act as observers, as well as the option of 

a third-party mediator. We categorically 

reject the use of violence in any dispute. 

Our SOP for conflict resolution can be 

viewed here. 

INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES 

[103-2, 103-3]

GAR aims to help multiply the positive 

impacts of the palm oil business through a 

range of educational, healthcare, social and 

economic programmes for communities. 

On some of these programmes, we work 

with a wide range of partners including 

government agencies, local communities, 

as well as the Eka Tjipta Foundation (a 

non-profit social organisation founded 

by the family of the late Eka Tjipta 

Widjaja in 2006) and the Tzu Chi 

Foundation in Indonesia (affiliated with 

the non-denominational global Tzu Chi 

organisation established in Taiwan).

GAR believes education is a powerful 

enabler which helps to break the cycle 

of poverty in rural areas. We strive to 

provide quality education to children and 

young adults living in and around our 

concessions. 

All children of workers living on our 

estates receive free education from 

kindergarten to junior high school and 

heavily subsidised higher education. We 

also offer heavily subsidised education 

at all levels for children living near and 

around our estates. 

In line with the nine years of compulsory 

education required by the Indonesian 

government, we ensure that each estate 

has educational facilities ranging from 

kindergarten to sixth grade. Additionally, 

we make sure that every region has a 

junior high school for the children of 

our employees and local communities.

Spotlight on Safe Water Garden Project - A low-tech solution to treat wastewater in rural communities in Indonesia 

Read more about GAR’s work in this area here.

100 million safe water gardens for 

villagers around the world  

By Dr Marc van Loo

In tropical villages, wastewater is typically 

released untreated into the environment. 

The result is a health tragedy. Worldwide, 

about 2,000 children die every day as a 

result, 370 in Indonesia alone.

The world’s most cost-efficient sanitation 

system

A combination of septic tanks and leach-

fields (one set per household) has long been 

recognised as a viable solution. Using these, 

UNICEF, Red Cross and others developed a 

practical and economical solution for Aceh’s 

villagers after the 2004 tsunami.

Inspired by this life-saving work, in 2016, we 

started working with governments, schools, 

world-class universities and companies –notably 

the palm oil and plastic sector in the form of 

Sinar Mas Agribusiness and Food, Musim Mas 

and Borouge– to optimise the solution and 

make it even cheaper and easier to build locally.

After three years of extensive testing, in 2019, 

we had our result – the Safe Water Garden 

(SWG). It features 4 main components: a 

closed tank, a leach field (the garden), a pipe 

system connecting the parts, and a separate 

kitchen sink (not pictured). The Indonesian 

government quickly recognised the SWG’s 

potential to address the rural sanitation 

issue, and declared it fit for use early 2020, 

making the SWG officially the world’s most 

cost-efficient sanitation system.

Supporting the community during the 

global pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted 

the importance of food security and we 

continue working with local communities 

around our estates to ensure they have 

sufficient and varied food sources. We do 

this through our Alternative Livelihood 

programmes. To date, this programme 

has helped more than 40 communities 

across Indonesia improve their agricultural 

practices and grow crops ranging from 

organic vegetables to coffee. Read more 

about our programmes here. 

 

We are also addressing the need for 

protective equipment for our employees 

and 

local 

communities 

during 

the 

pandemic. We are organising the making 

and distribution of 30,000 masks in 

collaboration with Tzu Chi Indonesia. Read

PROMOTING SMALL AND MICRO 

ENTERPRISES

Our presence plays an important role 

as an economic driver and multiplier 

and has helped in the development of 

various businesses in the remote areas 

of Indonesia. 

We actively help promote small and 

micro enterprises that contribute to 

increased income for the community. 

Our ongoing goat breeding 

programme in 11 villages around 

PT Ivo Mas Tunggal in Riau is one 

example. The company has donated 

over 260 goats to the villages. Local 

communities are able to earn extra 

income through the sale of milk and 

meat. As the villagers breed more 

goats, these will then be given to a 

Farmers Group in another village to 

grow and expand the scheme. 

OUR EMPLOYEES IN THE 

COMMUNITY 

We involve and mobilise our staff 

for various causes. For example, we 

urge employees and tenants at our 

corporate headquarters in Jakarta 

and our operations units in Central 

Kalimantan, South Kalimantan,  

East Kalimantan, Lampung, Riau, 

West Kalimantan, Jambi, North 

Sumatra, South Sumatra, West 

Java and Papua to participate in 

regular blood donation drives for 

the Indonesian Red Cross. More 

than 4,700 blood donors comprising 

employees and members of local 

community participated in 2019.  

We also encourage our employees  

to contribute funds regularly to the

In 2019, we temporarily halted our conservation planning with communities in order to focus our resources fully on completing Participatory Mapping with communities.

The mapping lays the foundation for 

further dialogue on conservation through 

our Participatory Conservation Planning 

process. Our intensive consultative 

approach takes into account local 

community concerns, needs and 

aspirations. These include food security 

requirements, the ability to earn a decent 

living and maintain a stable quality of life. 

Part of this process involves designing 

suitable alternative livelihood projects for 

the local community. 

We have rolled out PM in 93 villages across 

our concessions to date. As part of our 

landscape approach to forest conservation, 

we will continue to roll out our conservation 

planning programmes with local 

communities.1 To date, we have convinced 

13 villages to set aside over 7,700 hectares 

of HCS forests for conservation. 

We are also supporting our suppliers’ 

commitments to protect 65,000 hectares 

of HCS and HCV areas. We are doing 

this through sharing the importance of 

complying with our no deforestation 

commitments as well as guiding them in 

best practices and helping them formalise 

their own no deforestation policies.

We continue to implement our 

long-term forest and biodiversity 

conservation initiatives. These require 

substantial investment of time and 

resources to execute. Tangible results 

include the maintenance of 72,000 

hectares of conservation area consisting 

of High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests  

and High Conservation Value (HCV) 

areas. This is roughly equal to the size 

of Singapore. 

We take a landscape approach to 

conservation, beyond the boundaries 

of our concessions. One approach is 

through our community conservation 

partnerships. These began in 2015, 

when we started to formally map their 

villages through Participatory Mapping 

(PM) – a process for helping villages 

map out critical areas such as customary 

boundaries and land necessary for 

food security. This map is then lodged 

with and formally recognised by the 

authorities, serving amongst other 

things to clarify land tenure rights and 

enabling villages to gain access to 

government development funds for  

the first time.

In 2019, GAR joined a pioneering industry 

initiative to improve surveillance of 

deforestation in Indonesia. Together with 

nine other major palm oil producers and 

buyers, GAR is supporting and funding 

the development of a new radar-based 

forest monitoring system known as Radar 

Alerts for Detecting Deforestation (RADD). 

This partnership between ourselves, 

Bunge, Cargill, Mondelez International, 

Musim Mas, Nestlé, Pepsico, Sime Darby 

Plantation, Unilever and Wilmar will 

make it much easier for companies and 

other stakeholders to see deforestation 

happening in near-real-time and with 

greater accuracy. With this information, 

GAR and other companies can speed up 

follow-up actions on the ground and work 

to improve the sustainability of supply 

chains. RADD is unique in that it is the 

first radar-based monitoring system of this 

scale that will make deforestation alerts 

publicly available.2 Once the system is 

complete, the alerts will be available on 

Global Forest Watch and Global Forest 

Watch Pro, and the methodology behind 

the alerts will be published. Read more

research riparian zone restoration

Our management of HCV areas involves 

the rehabilitation of riparian zones 

that have previously been cleared or 

planted. These riparian buffer zones 

play a crucial role in providing wildlife 

habitats and maintaining water systems. 

Since 2015 GAR has been carrying out 

a riparian rehabilitation programme 

in our 18 concessions. By 2018, we 

completed the rehabilitation of over 

2700 hectares of riparian buffer zone. 

To date, we have revegetated 96 

percent of these riparian zones with 

native trees and vegetation. 

To further improve our understanding 

of riparian zone rehabilitation, we are 

participating in the Riparian Ecosystem 

Restoration in Tropical Agriculture 

(RERTA) Project with Cambridge 



peatland in the PT Agro Lestari Mandiri 

(AMNL) concession in West Kalimantan. 

This project was launched at the end of 

2015. To date, we have revegetated 350 

hectares of the area as a buffer zone and  

we continue to monitor and maintain 

optimum water levels to keep the peat wet. 

We aim to revegetate up to 500 hectares 

of the area. From the beginning of the 

project, we have also worked on alternative 

livelihood projects for the local community 

in tandem with the physical rehabilitation 

of the area. This helps on two fronts: 

improving food security and livelihoods; 

and forest conservation. We are working 

with partners including the University of 

Tanjungpura (UNTAN), L’Oréal and the 

South Pole Group in this area. 

GAR is also working with various partners

naturally one of the most significant 

impacts for any agribusiness. Our 

conservation of HCS forests, which 

retain large stores of carbon, is one way 

we are contributing to avoidance of 

emissions. Another significant source of 

GHG emissions comes from Palm Oil Mill 

Effluent (POME), the wastewater from 

processing fresh fruit bunches (FFB)  

which emits methane if left untreated. 

POME treatment therefore remains one 

of our main GHG emissions reduction 

activities. We also carry out methane 

capture at some of our mills.

                     reduce 40-55%

                   GHG emissions 

To treat POME, we mix it with shredded 

empty fruit bunches to produce 

compost, which is used as organic 

fertiliser, in some of our estates. This 

contributes to a reduction of chemical 

fertiliser consumption, which is the 

second largest source of GHG emissions 

after GHG emissions of POME. In 

addition, since early 2020 we have 

implemented the use of coated urea 

fertiliser, which further contributes to 

reduction of GHG emissions3.

Warmer and drier climate conditions in 2019 

led to a challenging fire season in Indonesia. 

Due to our strengthened fire mitigation 

and fire-fighting procedures we were able 

to keep the fire-affected areas relatively 

contained, and as a result, 99.5 percent of 

our production area was unaffected. 

Our fire prevention measures include 

having more than 10,000 Emergency 

Response Personnel on standby across 

all our plantations. Our estates are also 

equipped with fire-fighting equipment. 

For more details on our approach to fire 

management, see our website.

As monitoring by the non-profit Global 

Forest Watch showed that the vast 

majority of the fires in 2019 occurred in 

areas other than palm oil plantations, 

we remain committed to our long-term 

fire prevention community programme 

or Desa Makmur Peduli Api (DMPA). In 

2019, we focused on strengthening our 

fire prevention and mitigation procedures 

amongst the villages taking part in DMPA. 

This involved a four-pronged approach: 

• Prevention: raise fire prevention 

awareness, increase community 

empowerment and improve water 

management system

• Preparedness: have well-trained and 

well-equipped personnel and improve 

infrastructure

• Early warning systems: monitor hot

This exercise helped us prepare for and 

tackle the 2019 fire season.

In addition, we collaborated on fire 

prevention with stakeholders and related 

technical agencies including: 

• Signing an MoU on fire and haze 

prevention with GAPKI and PT BGA in

MANAGING OUR WATER FOOTPRINT 

[103-2, 103-3] [FB-AG-140a.2]

Water is a vital resource for our operations 

and the communities where we operate. 

We recognise that water availability is an 

increasingly important issue in the face 

of climate change and we are looking at 

ways to minimise our water footprint. 

We strive to meet all our water needs 

through surface water that is processed 

to meet the quality standards required for 

production. We use ground water only in 

very limited quantities in locations where 

no surface water is available. We continue 

to improve our water efficiency by 

recycling and reusing where appropriate. 

Palm oil trees require adequate amounts 

of water in order to grow. As such we 

have not developed plantations in water-

stressed areas. Our plantations are rain-

fed and not irrigated. 

We also follow strict land management 

practices that are designed to reduce the risk 

of surface and ground water pollution. These 

include not applying herbicides or chemicals 

near and around riparian areas; restricting the 

application of treated liquid waste (POME) 

which is used as fertiliser to 50 metres from 

riparian areas; and planting vetiver grass 

to minimise soil erosion at riparian areas. 

We submit water sample analyses to the 

environmental agencies at least twice yearly. 

We have noted the increasing occurrence 

of extreme weather phenomena like El 

Niño which can lead to severe draught. 

We are now exploring ways to optimise 

water use in our plantations through the 

use of advanced technology including AI.

environmental risks.

Natural solutions and biological controls 

are our preferred method for controlling 

pests across all our plantations, including 

beneficial plants that attract parasitoids 

to control pests, pathogens or bacteria, 

and natural predators. We supplement 

this approach using handpicking and 

mechanical traps. 

Examples of this include breeding barn 

owls to control the rat population;

Overall, the quantity of chemical 

pesticides used in GAR plantations has 

declined in the last few years.

In 2016, GAR stopped using paraquat.  

In addition, pesticides that are categorised 

as World Health Organization Class 1A 

or 1B, or that are listed by the Stockholm 

or Rotterdam Conventions are not used, 

except in specific situations identified in 

national best practice guidelines, such as 

during an extreme pest infestation.

In parallel to minimising the use of 

chemical pesticides, GAR is promoting 

the use of biopesticides, to enhance the 

health condition of the soils and the palm 

trees.

MAINTAINING SOIL FERTILITY 

GAR implements best agricultural 

management practices to maintain 

and enhance soil fertility through 

a comprehensive mineral nutrition 

management plan. We aim to minimise 

the quantity of fertiliser applied whilst 

maximising yields. This reduces the 

pressure to open more land and minimises

IPM and selective weed control are the 

basis of the utilisation of pesticides in 

GAR plantations:

• Insecticides and rodenticides are 

used only as a final resort, when the 

population of herbivories and rats are 

above an acceptable level and are no 

longer controllable through natural or 

biological solutions.

• The utilisation of herbicides is mainly 

to maintain an appropriate access to 

the palms, for their maintenance and 

for harvesting. A selective strategy 

is implemented in order to minimise 

the use of herbicides.

• In addition, SMARTRI is continuously 

looking for alternative solutions in 

order to reduce the utilisation of 

herbicides, through the use of more 

efficient and less environmental 

We have SOPs which specify that the use of 

fertilisers should be tailored to the texture of 

the soil and its capacity for retaining nutrients; 

that fertilisers should not be applied during 

periods of heavy rain; and that there should 

always be an appropriate interval between 

applications. We also recycle palm fronds and 

other organic products to increase the fixing 

capacity of soils.

   ha/year CPO 

We focus on improving yields of oil palm 

as part of our long-term strategy for 

responsible and sustainable agriculture. 

The ability to obtain higher yields from 

existing agricultural land through better 

seed stock means higher revenue while 

potentially reducing the need for more 

agricultural land.  

Following years of R&amp;D, GAR launched 

super high-yielding seeds Eka 1 and Eka 

2, capable of producing over 10 tonnes/

hectare/year of CPO in 2017 (the average 

national yield in Indonesia is around 

3.6 tonnes/hectare/year). SMARTRI and 

SMART Biotechnology Centre are now 

working on creating sufficient clonal seed 

stock to be planted in the estates in the 

next few years. To date, around 2.5 million 

clones have been produced for replanting. 

Our biotech division has also succeeded 

in finding and developing genes related 

to resistance to the Ganoderma4 disease. 

These can be used as molecular markers 

to select seeds and clones that are 

resistant to the disease. 

In light of climate change, SMARTRI is 

also continuing to work on developing 

more climate-resilient seed stock such as 

seeds which are more drought-resistant 

as well as looking at strains which can 

better adapt to high CO2 content in the 

atmosphere. The biotech division is also

GAR did not otherwise incur any 

fines or penalties for violations of 

environmental regulations. 

PROPER ACHIEVEMENT 

Since 2007, GAR has participated 

in the Indonesian Ministry of 

Environment’s national public 

environmental reporting initiative 

known as the Programme for Pollution 

Control, Evaluation and Rating 

(PROPER). The programme uses a 

colour-coded rating to assess water 

and air pollution control, hazardous 

waste management and environmental 

impact. PROPER also considers other 

indicators, including the impact of a 

company’s community development 

programmes; progress of biodiversity 

conservation efforts; efficiency of 

water management; and innovations 

in emissions reduction, waste 

management and energy efficiency. 

In 2019, 31 GAR mills passed the 

PROPER assessment with Blue rating. 

Four of our downstream facilities have 

also achieved Blue rating. 

To ensure that we are aligned with 

PROPER requirements, internal audits 

and training are carried out in the 

company’s mills.

order to minimise adverse impact 

on the natural environment.  The 

monitoring is in accordance with 

the Environment Management Plan 

(Rencana Pengelolaan Lingkungan) 

and the Environment Monitoring Plan 

(Rencana Pemantauan Lingkungan), as 

set out in the Environmental Impact 

Assessment (Analisa Mengenai Dampak 

Lingkungan) documents submitted to 

the Government of Indonesia. 

Assessment of the environmental 

parameters is conducted by SMARTRI, 

our ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 17025 

accredited internal laboratory, as well 

as external laboratories referred by the 

Indonesian authorities.

Our regular internal monitoring and 

assessments are guided by the ISO 

14001:2004 Environment Management 

Systems and ISO 9001:2008 Quality 

Management Systems. 

In 2019, GAR’s operations received two 

administrative sanctions from Indonesian 

authorities. The sanctions involved our 

downstream operations at Tarjun and 

Lampung, and were related to various 

matters including environmental quality 

tests and waste disposal. Corrective 

actions were implemented, with reports 

submitted to the relevant authority and 

the cases were subsequently resolved.

UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT 

(UNGC) 

[102-12]

The United Nations Global Compact 

(UNGC) is a call to companies everywhere 

to align their operations and strategies 

with ten universally accepted principles 

in the areas of human rights, labour, 

environment and anti-corruption, and 

to take action in support of UN goals

subsidiary SMART has subscribed to the 

UNGC principles since 2006. In 2018, 

GAR became a signatory of the UNGC 

signifying our continuing commitment. 

Progressively, we take appropriate 

actions in line with the principles 

as fundamental guidelines for the 

sustainable development of our business. 

We continue to support UNGC by 

incorporating the ten principles in the way 

we do business, which helps make us a 

better corporate citizen.

As an active participant of the UNGC, this 

report also serves as our Communication
