Corporate Development: A Summary 

 

CIHL (Tianjin) Water Development Limited (“Tianjin Water”) is an integrated water supply 

company involved in processing raw water and reclaimed water, and distribution of treated 

water, and providing engineering services to clients in Tianjin, China. It has its own 

processing plants and distribution networks. Tianjin Water was established in September 

2004, and as of December 31, 2017, the Company owned and operated Beitang Water Plant and 

was also developing a new plant, the Xinhe Water Plant. 

 

Beitang Water Plant is located near Beitang Reservoir, and takes raw water from Beitang 

Reservoir as well Huanggang No. 1 Reservoir and Huanggang No. 2 Reservoir. Beitang Water 

Plant entered into operations in March 2006. The water treated by Beitang Water Plant 

meets the standard of non-drinking water for urban residential and industrial uses (“城市

treatment plant that discharges which is National Standard Class One A (“国标一级A”) to 

the standard of Tianjin Municipal Standard Class One A, suitable for discharge into the 

natural environment. In future, the discharged water will be treated further to meet the 

standards for non-drinking water for urban residential and industrial uses, using UF+RO 

processing technology. The treated water is suitable for non-drinking household use, as 

well for watering plants and industrial use. 

 

The Company’s network of pipelines covers Lingang Industrial Zone, between Haifang Road 

in the East and Tangjin Expressway in the West. It also covers Beitang Hi-tech Zone, 

Tanggu Ocean Hi-tech Zone, Dongxigu Area, Xiangluowan Business District, Lingang Economic

Xinhe Water Plant Expansion 

 

At the end of December 2017, the Xinhe Water Plant established a temporary facility to 

treat discharged water from a third party sewage treatment plant. This extra treatment is 

necessary for such water to be suitable for discharging under the newly implemented local 

standards. The Xinhe Water Plant will expand into a full fledges facility to treat 

discharged water from 2018 and 2019. 

 

 

Energy and Chemical Consumption 

 

The Company strives to increase efficiency in the use of energy and chemical. 

 

In 2017, the Company upgraded the automation for plant operations, improved safety and 

efficiency measures for operations, and implemented the remote monitoring of the plant 

operation and the distribution network on a 24/7 basis with centralized video links. This 

has resulting in increased efficiency and reduced costs. 

 

The Company also improved the sanitation equipment to reduce chlorine use. This 

achievement has resulted in higher safety, lower maintenance requirements, better work 

conditions and smoother operations.

throughout various processes of the operation. Monthly competitions are organized for work 

teams and bonus are paid in accordance with the competition results at the end of year.

Target and Evaluation of Chemical Uses 

 

The uses of chemicals depend on the characteristics of raw materials to be processed, ie, 

raw water and discharged water, as well as the standard for the products of process. 

External factors which may influence the uses of chemicals include seasonality, weather, 

the source of raw water, quality of raw water as well as the requirements of our users. 

 

The Company has yet to set the targets for chemical use and the relevant evaluation 

mechanism. It is intended that industry technical consultants would be retained in 

2018/2019 to conduct a review of what is appropriate.

Safety 

 

The Company has set up safety operation system and put in place measures to enforce the 

system. For pipeline network maintenance, the Company adopts regular patrols, together 

with a centralized video monitoring system. In the water plants, the Company sets up 

proper fences around the water pools, and places life vessels inside the pools. There are 

various warnings systems in the plants to highlight various risks. When entering work 

space, a work team must have at least two members walking together. Wearing of life 

jackets and reporting to central monitoring office in and out of work space are standard 

procedures. 

 

In the past three years, the Company has recorded no incidents which resulted death or 

injury to its workers. 

 

We have established relevant model code for safe operations and protection measures. We 

have stringent inspection rules in relation to network monitoring and maintenance. For 

example, we have installed security surveillance camera system covering all areas in our 

water plants with alarm system in major areas. Our protection facilities include 

protection bars over precipitation pools advection pool, lifebuoys in designate places, 

water level alarm, alarm in chlorine room, and safety goggles. When working at 

precipitation pools, our staff is required to notify the central control room before 

entering the room and live monitoring is activated for the entire process from the central 

control room. Our staff must work in pair and wear safety jacket in that room. New joiners 

must pass swimming test and other safety tests. We have adopted a practicable emergency 

management plan. We emphasize on strict compliance in model code for safety operation and 

protection measure and regular maintenance and repair to our facilities to ensure safety 

operation. 

 

Our philosophy has always been “Safety Production” when it comes to production. We are 

active in adopting all relevant rules and guidelines from our supervisory bodies, 

especially the “Notice on Commencing Deep Safety Operation Inspection” announced by 

Water Authority and Safety Committee of Binghai New District. We have established a safety 

operation team and a network safety operation team respectively headed by our vice general 

manager and internal supervisory department and reward system are also established at the 

same time.
