ABOUT THE 

REPORT

SCOPE OF 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

We have expanded the scope of our 

Sustainability Report 2019 to cover the 

yards under our operational control in 

Indonesia and Brazil, in addition to our 

operations in Singapore, unless otherwise 

stated. These three regions have the most 

significant impact on our organisation and 

our stakeholders. The data reported relates 

to the financial year ended Dec 31, 2019.

Within the Sustainability Report, the terms 

“Sembcorp Marine”, “Sembcorp Marine Ltd”, 

“the Group” and “we” are used interchangeably 

to reference operations and facilities in 

Singapore, Indonesia and Brazil, unless 

indicated otherwise.

The Group’s entities included in the 

consolidated financial statements are 

detailed in the Notes to the Financial 

Statements of our Annual Report 2019, 

which is published separately.

ASSURANCE 

We have engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers 

LLP for the third year to undertake an assurance 

engagement in respect of selected sustainability 

information of our report. The scope of 

assurance was conducted in accordance with the 

Singapore Standard on Assurance Engagements 

(SSAE) 3000 – Assurance Engagements other 

than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 

Information. Details can be found in the 

Independent Limited Assurance Report on 

Sustainability Information on our website.

To showcase our increasing commitment 

towards environmental, social and governance 

(ESG) matters, we have prepared our 

Sustainability Report 2019 as a standalone 

publication. Through this report, we aim to share 

the progress we have made in a clear, concise, 

and informative way.

We have prepared this report in accordance with 

the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: 

Core option. The GRI Content Index for this 

report is separately published on our website

Sustainability Reporting issued by IPIECA, 

the American Petroleum Institute (API) and 

the International Association of Oil &amp; Gas 

Producers (IOGP). 

This report can be accessed on our corporate 

website and should be read in conjunction with 

our sustainability disclosures online.

CHAIRMAN'S 

FOREWORD

Intense heat waves, melting 

polar ice caps, rising sea levels 

and severe storms are alarming 

signs of climate change that 

hasten the call for sustainable 

development and a low-carbon 

economy. Like many responsible 

organisations, Sembcorp Marine 

heeds this imperative diligently. 

We have been reporting our 

sustainability performance in the 

Sembcorp Marine Annual Report 

since 2011, but starting this 

year we are pleased to present 

our sustainability vision, goals 

and progress in a standalone 

Sustainability Report.

Sembcorp Marine creates 

long-term stakeholder value 

by observing high governance 

standards and managing our 

environmental and social 

impact proactively. We aim 

to broaden our low-carbon 

products and solutions, reduce 

our environmental footprint and 

improve our communities. In 

2019, our sustainable products 

and solutions accounted for 24% 

of our total revenue. We will raise 

this to 30% by 2025. 

Across Sembcorp Marine’s 

global operations, our ‘Climate, 

Ocean and Earth’ sustainability 

programmes focus on cutting 

carbon emissions, conserving the 

oceans and managing natural 

resources conscientiously. We 

walk the talk by increasingly 

tapping renewable energy and 

adopting energy-efficient and 

waste-reducing equipment. 

 

We rally our customers, vendors 

and employees towards a 

culture of Zero Harm to People, 

Property and the Environment. 

We are motivated to improve our 

safety practices continuously. In 

2019, we won 24 awards for our 

workplace safety performance.

Sembcorp Marine also believes 

in nurturing our people in a 

fair, inclusive and respectful 

working environment, with equal 

opportunities for growth. We up-

skill our workforce constantly. In 

2019, every employee received 

an average of 45 training hours.

Beyond the workplace, we aspire to 

be a socially responsible corporate 

citizen. In 2019, we contributed 

$1.81 million and over 10,000 

employee-volunteering-hours 

towards diverse social causes, 

including youth and education, 

environmental conservation 

and community care. We create 

employment opportunities in our 

global operations and implement 

health and social initiatives for the 

local communities. 

While Sembcorp Marine is 

fully committed to enhancing 

the well-being of individuals, 

society and the environment, 

Sustainability is a collective 

responsibility that all of us must 

commit to. Only then can we 

effectively ensure a greener planet 

and a better tomorrow for our 

present and future generations. 

I encourage everyone to do their 

part. Together, we can and will 

make a difference.

Sembcorp Marine takes a long-term approach to 

creating value for our stakeholders. We aim to minimise 

our environmental impact and support our communities, 

while achieving positive financial performance, 

business growth and high standards of governance. 

Our commitment to sustainability is anchored to our 

mission, vision and values, which are the guiding 

principles for our business conduct. 

In the course of our regular materiality reviews3, 

we identified seven key material issues and set 

corresponding sustainability performance targets in 

2017. Last year, we expanded our reporting scope 

beyond Singapore to include Indonesia and Brazil. 

While our sustainability performance is assessed by 

the Sembcorp Marine Sustainability Council, Senior 

Management Committee and Board Executive 

Committee, we also engage our global stakeholders 

regularly for their feedback.

Throughout the life-cycle of each project, Sembcorp Marine pays close attention to the environmental, social 

and governance impact of our activities. We see ourselves increasingly as an extension of our customers’ 

sustainability value chain and work closely with them to fulfil our obligations towards the environment and 

the community. 

CREATING VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS

We build trust and maintain

SUPPLY CHAIN 

MANAGEMENT

SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE 

SUPPLY CHAIN

Sembcorp Marine’s supply chain management plays 

a vital role in ensuring that our products comply with 

the required specifications and performance delivery. 

To enhance our competitiveness, our procurement 

strategies aim to deliver cost savings, economies 

of scale and operational synergies that are aligned 

with our customers’ needs. Our procurement team 

sources equipment, materials, parts and other items 

from a global network to reduce our transportation 

costs and carbon footprint while catering for projects 

executed at our worldwide locations. 

As part of our commitment to responsible 

sourcing, we ensure that the items we procure 

fulfil environmental regulations and public 

health requirements, meet our compliance and 

sustainability standards and do not originate from 

conflict-affected areas. 

We expect our suppliers to operate ethically and 

responsibly and to declare their compliance with 

environmental, social and governance requirements 

set out in the Sembcorp Marine Supplier Code of 

Conduct and Code of Business Conduct. To assess 

their credentials and reliability, our due diligence 

processes include pre-qualification checks and 

regular audits. We also collaborate with these 

partners to establish best practices in production, 

delivery and sustainability. 

We innovate our supply chain processes by 

integrating Industry 4.0 technologies such as 

digitalisation to improve lead-times and efficiency. 

To optimise our inventory levels and reduce 

wastage, we actively match the supply of raw 

materials and consumables at our shipyards against 

production requirements and establish advance 

delivery plans with our strategic bulk suppliers.

Battery-powered, Zero Emission ROPAX Ferry

Designed by Sembcorp Marine and tailored to 

our customer Norled’s shortsea Hella-Vangsnes-

Dragsvik connections in Norway, three units 

of this ferry are under construction at our Tuas 

Boulevard Yard. The vessels will be powered by 

lithium-ion batteries and can tap on shore-side 

hydroelectricity recharging points along their 

service route. This enables them to operate with 

zero emission.

DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE AND 

INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS

OUR FOUR KEY THRUSTS: 

New Opportunities &amp; 

Emerging Markets

We actively acquire new capabilities, through 

technology joint ventures and acquisitions, 

to develop new products and enter new 

markets. These strategic developments have 

translated into new products and contracts in 

new and emerging markets.

Greener &amp; Sustainable 

Products &amp; Solutions

Supported by a global team of more 

than 1,000 design engineers, we have 

developed a suite of safe, sustainable and 

high-specification solutions.

Award of cylindrical FPSO design 

Sembcorp Marine was awarded an exclusive 

Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) 

contract for our proprietary Sevan SSP 

circular hull. This hull design eliminates 

the need for a costly mooring turret while 

accommodating a larger number of risers 

and flexibility for future tie-ins.

Commercialisation of our proprietary 

Gravifloat Technologies

We continue to make good progress in 

commercialising our proprietary Gravifloat 

technologies for a variety of nearshore LNG 

terminal and gas infrastructure applications. 

Gravifloat offers high flexibility for site-

specific and expandable requirements with 

its modularised system. Strategic installation 

of several modules forms a breakwater to 

create calmer sea conditions.

Successful installation of patented  

Semb-Eco LUV Ballast Water Management 

System (BWMS)

We successfully installed our highly 

energy-efficient Semb-Eco LUV BWMS on 

Transocean Norge, a semi-submersible 

rig. This BWMS helps vessels mitigate the 

risk of invasive aquatic species in turbid 

or highly challenging tropical waters and 

hence protect ocean bio-diversity.

LNG bunker vessel designed by our 

subsidiary LMG Marin

This LNG bunker vessel is the largest of its 

kind to be built in Singapore, in terms of size 

and LNG tank capacity. Its two GTT Mark 

III Flex membrane tanks are more durable, 

safer for fuel transfer operations and reduce 

cargo loss through evaporation. The vessel’s 

dual-fuel engine will contribute to cleaner 

propulsion with less carbon emissions.

Strategic Build-and-Deliver 

Capabilities

We invest and develop game-changing 

facilities and infrastructure to automate 

production, resulting in faster delivery times, 

safer operations and enhanced quality.

Safer, Smarter &amp; 

Sustainable Shipyard

We envision a more sustainable 

manufacturing process and smarter products 

through digitalisation and automation, which 

are important components of Industry 4.0 

development.

Pushing the boundaries of  

production automation

As part of our smart yard development, 

Sembcorp Marine works closely with 

robotics manufacturers to customise and 

develop advanced robots that carry out 

multi-directional welding of large built-up 

structural blocks. This new capability is 

safer and more efficient and improves our 

product quality.

Investment in game-changing facilities 

The 2 x 15,000 MT gantry cranes installed 

at Tuas Boulevard Yard are an important 

differentiator for Sembcorp Marine’s 

project execution, enabling us to fabricate, 

assemble and install larger, heavier and 

more complex projects. Mega-structures 

such as FPSO topsides and hulls can leave 

the yard fully integrated, instead of being 

transported out in smaller parts which 

require further assembly.





Embracing new IoT technologies

Sembcorp Marine partnered with A*STAR’s I3 

to complete a proof of concept for applying 

IoT technologies to track steel materials. This 

development helps improve the traceability 

of materials, thereby enhancing overall 

productivity and reducing wastage.



Advancing Additive Manufacturing 

Our two-year collaboration with DNV GL, 

NAMIC and SIMTech paved the way for 

Sembcorp Marine to receive DNV GL 

certification qualifying our 3D printing 

procedures and specifications for 

components used in construction and repair 

projects. This development will allow us to 

unlock significant efficiencies and reduce 

supply chain risks, ensuring the sustainability 

of our operations.

our existing 12 diesel-powered ones.














ADDRESSING 

ENVIRONMENTAL 

CHALLENGES

ENHANCING OUR PRODUCTS AND 

SERVICES WITH OPTIMAL USE OF 

RESOURCES, AND WITH MINIMAL IMPACT 

TO THE COMMUNITY AND ENVIRONMENT


ADDRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL 

CHALLENGES

At Sembcorp Marine, we are actively managing the risks and opportunities 

brought about by climate change, ocean ecosystem degradation and 

resource availability.

We reduce emissions by operating more efficiently and increasing the 

proportion of renewable energy in our total energy use. With two of our 

largest yards already ISO 14001-certified, our environmental management 

goes beyond compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. 

By focusing on three key areas in our environmental programme, namely 

Climate, Earth and Ocean, we are constantly exploring new ways to improve 

our practices and minimise the environmental impact of our operations.

Sembcorp Marine, together with our sustainability partner Carbon Care Asia, 

has jointly developed a methodology to quantify our indirect carbon emission 

savings. This methodology provides a quantifiable assessment of the carbon 

dioxide equivalent (CO2e) savings attributable to our low-carbon energy 

solutions, including LNG-battery hybrid tug boats and battery-powered vessels.



In July 2019, Sembcorp Marine delivered 

the semi-submersible crane vessel (SSCV) 

Sleipnir to our customer, Heerema Marine 

Contractors. Sleipnir is the world’s first 

dual-fuel crane vessel with engines running 

on MGO and LNG for sustainable operation 

across all environmental jurisdictions.

“Sleipnir	scores	several	firsts	in	the	industry:	It	is	the	

largest crane vessel yet built; it has the strongest 

pair	of	revolving	cranes;	and	it’s	also	the	world’s	first	

crane vessel with dual-fuel engines running on MGO 

and LNG, dramatically reducing harmful emissions. 

Sleipnir’s innovative capabilities will place Heerema 

even	firmer	at	the	forefront	of	developments	in	the	

offshore oil, gas and wind energy industry for both 

installations and decommissioning.”

To manage the environmental challenges associated 

with climate change, Sembcorp Marine reduces 

GHG emissions by streamlining our operations to 

harness energy and other resources more efficiently. 

We reinforced our commitment to carbon emission 

reduction by introducing the Climate Action 

Programme in all our yards in 2019. 

Our Sustainability Report 2019 covers energy 

consumed by Sembcorp Marine yards in Singapore, 

Brazil and Indonesia. Our energy sources 

include electricity, diesel, LPG, CNG, acetylene 

and renewable solar energy. Our total energy 

consumption in FY2019 amounted to 1.411 million 

GJ, with electricity consumption accounting for 

approximately 59.6% of energy use.

To get a better representation of our energy 

usage efficiency, we began measuring our energy 

use based on man-hours of operation in Brazil, 

Indonesia and Singapore in FY2019. Our energy 

intensity was 0.117 million GJ/man-hour for the year.

Sembcorp Marine’s direct GHG emissions from 

sources we own or under our direct control, 

including fuel for vehicles, generators and air 

compressors (Scope 1), and indirect emissions from 

electricity consumption (Scope 2) are shown below. 

We have used the operational control approach to 

identify the GHG emissions. The boundaries of our 

reported emissions currently comprise our shipyards 

operating in Brazil, Indonesia and Singapore, 

excluding joint ventures.

OCEAN

According to UNESCO, nearly 3 billion people 

around the world depend on marine and coastal 

biodiversity for their needs. The ocean absorbs 

approximately a third of the carbon dioxide 

produced by humans, which helps negate the 

impact of climate change9. Many of our products and 

solutions operate at shore and near shore. Some are 

deployed across the world’s oceans, including the 

fragile arctic frontier. With this in mind, Sembcorp 

Marine has implemented responsible corporate 

practices, policies and programmes as part of our 

ocean conservation efforts.

We also make sure our production operations 

comply with discharge requirements. We conduct 

emergency exercises to maintain our response 

preparedness to accidental spills. In 2019, 

Sembcorp Marine neither incurred any significant 

fines from non-compliance with environmental laws 

and regulations, nor caused any significant spills. 

As a responsible ocean citizen, Sembcorp 

Marine removes marine plastics and debris 

from surrounding waters that drift into our yards 

seasonally. Over the years, we have removed more 

than 100 tonnes of waste material to protect marine 

EARTH

Sembcorp Marine consumes material and equipment 

in our core operational activities, which comprise 

offshore engineering and construction, ship repairs 

and conversion and specialised shipbuilding. These 

activities produce waste and emissions that impact 

the environment. 



To commemorate the 2019 World Cleanup Day, EJA employees 

participated in beach and mangrove cleaning activities along the 

Piraqueacu River

Due to climate change, water is also becoming 

increasingly scarce globally10. The Group recognises 

these challenges. We are committed to using our 

precious resources responsibly and we take necessary 

action to reduce our environmental footprint.

wildlife. Our employees regularly participate in 

beach and mangrove cleaning activities.

We support and organise community activities 

that contribute and protect the marine and coastal 

ecosystems from pollution. Sembcorp Marine's

contributes to a cleaner environment for marine 

wildlife to thrive in waters surrounding our yards.

Our key raw materials include steel, copper, 

welding materials and paint products. We source 

and choose our materials responsibly during 

the solutions development, engineering and 

procurement stages of our project management. 

In 2019, the total non-renewable materials used by 

the Group amounted to 1,904,959 metric tonnes, 

compared to 1,699,320 metric tonnes in 2018. The 

non-renewable materials used include steel, copper 

grits and steel grits. 

We have put in place environmentally-responsible waste 

disposal processes in our Singapore yards, including 

the use of licensed waste management vendors.  

Estaleiro Jurong Aracruz (EJA) in Brazil also reuses 

oil drums for solid waste collection, helping us avoid 

approximately 8,320 kg of metal waste in FY2019.

Besides monitoring water consumption closely 

during our operations, we conduct regular checks 

to reduce leaks in our shipyards’ water networks. In 

2019, Sembcorp Marine used 2.149 million m3 of 

water. By investing in new technology and adopting 

water efficiency practices such as using seawater for 

gearbox cooling, we achieved a 9.5% reduction in 

the consumption of municipal water and NEWater*, 

compared to 2018.

We actively develop our workforce competence and promote a culture of continuous improvement and 

organisational excellence.

To facilitate our employees' holistic development and empower them to achieve their highest potential, 

every job role in the organisation is mapped on to our four key learning thrusts:

• 

Total Workplace Safety &amp; Health (WSH) Excellence;

• 

Skills &amp; Competence;

• 

Innovation &amp; Productivity; and

• 

Growth &amp; Development.

Given the constantly changing market demands and technological disruptions in our industry, a highly skilled 

workforce readies the Group for new challenges and opportunities. We up-skill and re-skill our people on 

digitalisation, which prepares them for the future of work in an Industry 4.0 environment.



Since the launch of the Professional 

Conversion Programme (PCP) in 2018, 

Sembcorp Marine has been one of its 

key supporting companies. The PCP is a 

pathway for workers in Singapore to re-skill 

and up-skill themselves for new positions, 

through industry-recognised training 

programmes. In 2019, 38 of our employees 

from the Professionals, Managers, 

Executives and Technicians (PMET) 

category and new non-marine entrants 

completed the programme.

Mr.	Lin	Zewei,	an	ex-production	head,	was	among	the	first	batch	of	PCP	

participants at Sembcorp Marine. With the knowledge and soft skills gained 

from the course, he was able to transition successfully to his current position 

as a Senior Project Manager.

OUR ZERO INCIDENCE GOAL




PROTECTING 

OUR PEOPLE

Work accidents and occupational diseases are avoidable. With a strong prevention culture, we strive to eliminate 

the hazards and risks that can cause work-related accidents and occupational diseases. Sembcorp Marine’s 

Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) 2028 Vision Zero incidence goal is an important foundation of the Group’s 

work ethos. Executed via a robust and audited Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) integrated management 

system, we aim to eliminate harm to people, property and the environment. To achieve our goal of zero deaths 

and serious injuries by 2028, we have developed a set of HSE strategic thrusts that guide our actions.

Safe and healthy working conditions have a positive impact on the motivation of employees, the quality of 

our work and commercial solutions, our reputation, as well as the satisfaction levels of customers and other 

important stakeholders. All these factors in turn affect Sembcorp Marine’s economic success. We have 

implemented the Sembcorp Marine Vision Zero strategy with active contribution from all our stakeholders. 

We have a clearly communicated safety policy, safety leadership capabilities, standardised and repeatable 

safety management systems, and an engaged workforce that is properly informed and adequately trained on 

the hazards of their jobs and how to perform their work safely.

PROTECTING 

OUR PEOPLE

DEEPEN WSH OWNERSHIP

Good WSH performance requires strong ownership 

from all stakeholders, a holistic system with clear 

policies and procedures for implementing and 

building safety competency and a culture of 

prevention, trust and care. 

WSH Ownership and Accountability

Sembcorp Marine’s WSH framework is championed 

by the Sembcorp Marine Board and Management, 

employees, contractors and other stakeholders. 

While the Board Risk and Enterprise Risk Committees 

steer the HSE policies, framework, procedures 

and control processes, the Group HSE Committee, 

together with various sub-committees at the yards, 

is responsible for developing and deploying the 

strategies and work plans.

In 2019, yard-level HSE committees comprised over 

500 management and worker representatives. They 

collectively represented 100% of more than 45,000 

Sembcorp Marine employees and contractors. 

These committees are responsible for engaging the 

workforce in HSE programmes.

We have a clearly communicated safety policy, safety 

leadership capabilities, standardised and repeatable 

safety management systems, and an active and 

engaged workforce that is properly informed and 

adequately trained on the hazards of their jobs and 

how to perform their work safely. Our communication 

channels include Daily Toolbox Meetings, Vessel 

Safety Coordination Committee Meetings, Monthly 

WSH Committee Meetings and Monthly WSH  

Sub-committee Meetings.

Cultivate Positive WSH Culture

In 2019, we rolled out HSE Life Saving Rules, an 

important WSH culture-building programme that 

helps prevent injuries for high-risk activities at 

the workplace. It requires all direct employees, 

contractors, visitors and client representatives to 

identify critical controls that must be in place.

Continuous Enhancement in  

HSE Competencies and Capabilities

Previously certified to OHSAS 18001 Occupational 

Health and Safety Management System, Sembcorp 

Marine yards in Singapore and Indonesia have 

transitioned to the ISO 45001 certification.  

With the new certification, our management 

Training and Competency

All Sembcorp Marine personnel must be 

competent and possess the necessary 

knowledge, skills and behaviour to perform 

their work safely. We also require visitors, 

subcontractors and other stakeholders 

entering our yards to go through an HSE 

Induction programme.  In addition, our 

employees attend in-house training on hot 

commitment, employee involvement and risk 

control programmes are enhanced. Sembcorp 

Marine's Estaleiro Jurong Aracruz (EJA) facility 

in Brazil is currently preparing for the ISO 45001 

certification.

Hazard Prevention and Mitigation

A comprehensive Hazard Prevention and 

Mitigation Policy guides the Group’s system of 

hazard identification, risk categorisation, risk 

assessment matrix, action and controls. We 

conduct an annual Review, Educate and Validate 

(REV) programme, through which our yards and 

their contractor partners address evolving key 

risks. We also carry out joint site inspections with 

our customers. Key risks identified include fire 

and explosions, collapse of structures, and  

work-at-height and electrical hazards.

Our annual review of the Group’s incident 

and near-miss records against industry 

benchmarks helps us identify the most common 

occurrences. We also maintain statistics on the 

types of accidents and occupational diseases 

encountered in our facilities. For internal 

learning and prevention purposes, we regularly 

update our staff on internal workplace accidents 

and occupational diseases.

work, confined space, lifting, working with 

machinery and fire warden responsibilities. 

Sembcorp Marine subcontractors attend these 

sessions at no cost.

In 2019, we invested 55.5% of total worked 

hours on HSE training, compared to 60% in 

2018. 





From November 2018 to April 2019, EJA engaged Dupont 

Sustainable Solutions to launch a 'Risk Factor' Programme that 

helped the yard systematically improve its employees’ safety and 

well-being.  Dupont worked closely with EJA’s Internal Security 

Committee and HSE Management to prevent workplace incidents 

and injuries, and cultivate workplace safety excellence among 

employees – from yard workers to the top management.

EJA launched the 'Programa Amigo do Peito', or the Bosom 

Friend Programme on Feb 15, 2019, pairing employees as a single 

unit so that they can remind and caution one another to adhere to 

safety standards and applications.

PROTECTING 

OUR PEOPLE

FOCUS ON WORKPLACE HEALTH

Total WSH is the holistic and integrated approach to managing interactions between work, safety and 

health to promote the well-being of workers and employees. A safe workplace reduces the risk of injury 

and ill-health, leading to better worker well-being, a more productive workforce and superior quality of our 

commercial deliverables.

Occupational Health Risk Mitigation

Besides strengthening the prevention of workplace injuries and occupational diseases, we step up efforts to 

address lesser known issues, such as how workers’ inherent health conditions can affect safety outcomes at 

work, or can be aggravated by work conditions.

Proactive Incident 

Prevention

We enhance leadership and 

ownership, including up-skilling our 

WSH Professionals and supervisors 

so that they are empowered to 

identify, supervise and check 

individuals with health conditions 

that affect their work on-site.

Besides improving our 

management of personal health 

risk and occupational disease risk, 

we also adopt measures to reduce 

occupational disease incidence.

Workplace Health &amp; 

Wellness Programme

We offer our employees 

complimentary corporate 

health screening services at our 

Health Management Centre, 

job matching and adaptation, 

ergonomic assessments and 

health coaching to support our 

employees’ well-being.

Please refer to page 42 (under 

Human Capital) of our Sustainability 

Report 2019 for more details.

First Aid  

Training

We equip our employees 

and contractors with first-

aid knowledge and skills for 

rendering first-response medical 

assistance. Occupational first-aid 

training, including the use of 

automated external defibrillators 

(AED) and cardiopulmonary 

resuscitation (CPR), is held 

regularly.

Health Management 

Centre

The Health Management Centre 

in all our yards are staffed by 

occupational doctors, nurses and 

other healthcare personnel. This 

centre provides medical services 

and other health examinations; 

occupational health monitoring 

such as hearing conservation 

and respiratory protection; and 

counselling support for managing 

physical and mental issues.

Create Safe &amp; Supportive 

Environment

We create a flexible and adaptive 

environment for individuals to 

realise their abilities, cope with 

normal life stressors and work 

productively.

We conduct regular environmental 

checks to ensure air quality and 

sound levels are within safe limits.

We have a fumigation and 

vectors elimination programme 

for vector-borne diseases such 

as dengue to eliminate potential 

breeding grounds.

Emergency Contingency 

Plan

We have a system for preventing 

and recovering from potential 

threats such as major workplace 

accidents, pandemic outbreak, 

cybersecurity and terrorist attacks. 

These plans ensure that personnel 

and assets are protected, without 

affecting yard operations in the 

event of a disaster.

In 2019, over 125 emergency 

response drills and exercises were 

conducted together with local 

government agencies.

Resilient Workforce – Employee Health and Wellness Programme

We build and sustain our wellness programmes and services to improve the health and resilience of our workforce.

WSH ADVANCEMENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

Technological developments continuously impact our daily lives with new tools and resources that help 

us stay connected, manage our work and track our health. At Sembcorp Marine, we actively leverage 

technology to improve safety conditions for our employees and contractors.



3D Robotic Welding Un-manned Complex 

The 3D Robotic Welding Shop at Tuas Boulevard 

Yard has robotic welding machines enabled by 

advanced software to perform automatic welding 

and minimise our workers' exposure to physical and 

electrical hazards.

Hull Treatment Carrier (HTC) Utilising Robots 

The Hull Treatment Carrier-System Double (HTC-

SD) is a fully automated, self-navigating robotic 

system that eliminates the need for workers to 

work at height beside flat shipside surfaces. Only 

one operator is stationed at the base to control the 

system operations. This helps avoid exposure to 

at-height risks and chemical hazards.

Drones for Safety and Quality Inspection 

The use of drones is especially advantageous for our employees to carry out inspections and surveillance 

surveys while avoiding exposure to at-height risks.

Creating Positive Impact on Our Communities

Sembcorp Marine recognises the importance 

of active involvement in the community. By 

contributing towards community improvement 

and social advancement, we extend our positive 

influence as an agent of change and value creation. 

Our community engagement strategy, which 

is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals and ISO 26000 Guidance on 

Social Responsibility, has five focus areas: Youth and 

Education; Environmental Care; Community Care; 

Active Lifestyle; and Industry Outreach. 

We monitor the needs of the local communities in our 

global operations and implement programmes that 

create positive impact for our stakeholders. Regular 

reviews are conducted to ensure our outreach and 

engagement initiatives are relevant and effective. 

In 2019, the Group disbursed approximately  

$1.81 million through its global programmes, 

corporate social responsibility initiatives, 

sponsorships, donations, staff contributions, and 

industry programmes. Our employees clocked 

over 10,000 hours to support various community 

initiatives during the year. 

Beyond Singapore, the Group’s overseas yards 

organise programmes that advance local training 

and capability building, environmental sustainability, 

youth and educational development, as well as 

sports and cultural promotion. 



As part of our commitment to giving back to the community, we have awarded over $4.4 million of bursaries to more than 22,000 

students since 2001, through our long-standing School Book Assistance Grant (SchoolBAG).

EFFECTIVE ENTERPRISE RISK 

MANAGEMENT

Sembcorp Marine considers a wide range of 

risks and opportunities in its efforts to create 

value over the long term. We focus on a set of 

economic, environmental, social and governance 

topics that speak to our stakeholders’ interests 

and which help us create and preserve value in 

our business. In particular, environmental issues 

are a growing concern. 

In the 2019 Global Risk Report, extreme weather 

events and failure of climate-change mitigation and 

adaptation are the top three global risks in terms 

of likelihood and impact. We are paying greater 

attention to these risks, and addressing them through 

our sustainability targets. Our risk management 

framework is structured to progressively meet our 

mid- and long-term targets, and ultimately reduce the 

negative impact of our operations and activities on 

society and the environment. 

Risk Champions, appointed from various units, help 

the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) 

drive key risk initiatives and review risk issues across 

the Group. The ERMC, also chaired by the President 

&amp; CEO, reports to the Board Risk Committee. 

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework 

guides Management in dealing effectively with 

uncertainties and the associated risks in pursuing 

business opportunities.

best practices regularly. We review and enhance 

our policies and perform compliance assurance 

activities to ensure that we are adhering to all 

regulatory requirements and practices. We provide
