Board Message on  

Sustainability Report

We are pleased to present the 2nd sustainability report for Hwa Hong Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries  

(“Hwa Hong”, “HHC”, or the “Group”).  The Group continues to embark on its sustainability reporting journey for greater 

sustainable value creation in the areas of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”). This effort has led us to work on 

ways to improve our value chain, combining our own actions with those of our service providers and joint venture partners, to 

create positive impacts.

In compliance with Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Rules 711A and 711B, the Board 

of Directors (the “Board”) has placed great importance on adopting a strategic approach in managing and overseeing the 

ESG matters that are significant to Hwa Hong as identified by the Board. The Board has also reviewed the sustainability 

performance of the organisation and will continue to provide guidance to the Management in defining future priorities.

Together with the Management, the Board strives to promote greater resilience and sustainability in its business operations 

whilst engaging with all stakeholders of Hwa Hong.

About this  

Sustainability Report

The Group’s 2nd Sustainability Report is aimed at addressing non-financial matters in the aspects of ESG which are significant to 

the Group’s property investment operations in Singapore and UK1 (Figure 2). Unless otherwise stated, this sustainability report 

covers the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018.

This sustainability report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of SGX-ST Listing Manual Rule 711(B) and 

the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core option, which supersedes GRI G4 Guidelines. The GRI Standards 

is a globally-recognised framework and has been adopted for its universal application for reporting on ESG performance that 

allows for meaningful use of information and comparability in the market. In the preparation of the report, we have applied 

GRI reporting principles for defining the content and quality of Hwa Hong’s Sustainability Report.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUSTAINABILITY

At Hwa Hong, sustainability matters are governed by the Board which is supported by the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) 

(Figure 3). This committee is responsible for integrating sustainability principles and policies, which comprise of relevant 

policies and standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) throughout the Group. Compliance with these policies and SOPs is 

effected through periodic reviews by the Board.

The Group did not identify any environmental matters such as energy and water consumption as material sustainability matters for its properties in Singapore and 

the UK as the usage of water and electricity are not within the Group’s control. The property managements in the Singapore properties are mainly carried out either 

by the Management Corporation Strata Title (“MCST”) or by the anchor tenant in its Paya Lebar property. In the UK, the commercial properties are leased on a 

full repair, insurance basis (“FRI”) whereby repairs and insurance are largely borne by the tenants and for the residential properties, repairs and maintenance costs 

are shared by all leaseholders.

WHAT’S IMPORTANT FOR HWA HONG?

The Management, together with the Board conducted a formal materiality assessment exercise in late 2016. An extensive list 

of ESG matters were evaluated and then ranked according to their importance from both internal and external stakeholders’ 

perspectives. 

A materiality review process was conducted in FY2018 and it was concluded that the same five material sustainability matters 

reported in the last year remains reflective of our current business condition and are aligned with the Group’s sustainability 

strategy (Figure 4). 

The material sustainability matters as detailed in Figure 52 will thus form the focus of this report and be reviewed on a yearly 

basis to ensure that they continue to be relevant and reflective of key business impacts and stakeholders’ needs.  Future reviews 

will ensure a proactive response to emerging sustainability matters.

HIGH STANDARDS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

The Group recognises the importance of good corporate governance, accountability and transparency and believes that 

conducting business in a responsible and ethical manner is vital to the sustainability of the Group.

At Hwa Hong, the Board monitors the effectiveness of the Management and regularly reviews its corporate governance practices 

according to the principles and guidelines of the Singapore’s Code of Corporate Governance 2012 to maintain continual 

robustness of governance that is reflective of changes to existing environment. Additionally, the Management would engage the 

Company Secretary to conduct an annual review of the Group’s corporate governance practices to ensure that current practices 

are largely in line with the recommended best practices. 

The Group’s Singapore Governance and Transparency Index (“SGTI”) had declined to 208th position in 2018 from 100th 

position in 2017 and the overall SGTI 2018 score had remained quite close to overall SGTI2017, declining slightly from 

65 to 61 points. The SGTI is aimed at assessing companies on their corporate governance disclosure and practices, as well as 

the timeliness, accessibility and transparency of their financial results announcement. The Group will continue to look into 

maintaining the timeliness, accessibility and transparency of the announcement results and target to maintain and improve the 

SGTI score going forward. 

To demonstrate its commitment towards excellence in Corporate Governance, the Group had joined the Securities Investors 

Association Singapore (“SIAS”) and its partners for the past few years in making the following public Statement of Support, 

which was reiterated at the 9th Singapore Corporate Governance Week 2018, organised by SIAS in 2018.

“As an Organisation, we are committed to uphold high standards of corporate governance to enhance shareholder value. We believe 

good corporate governance is central to the health and stability of our financial markets and the economy.” 

One of the initiatives launched by SIAS which the Group participated in, includes raising key questions on the annual reports 

of SGX-listed companies on SGXNet to raise the quality of Annual General Meetings (“AGM”). This initiative was launched in 

2016, designed to help shareholders to focus on critical areas, such as business strategies, financial performance and corporate 

governance practices, etc. for constructive discussions during AGM. In April 2019, SIAS had raised some queries on the Group’s 

2018 Annual Report and the Group had promptly uploaded its responses in the SGXNet which had also been communicated 

to the shareholders during the 66th AGM held in April 2019. This further demonstrates the Group’s commitment in ensuring 

timely and transparent information available to its shareholders.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group has established a formalised risk management process where risks, control measures, risk tolerance level or limits 

and follow-up actions are identified and monitored by the Management and reported to the Board for review and evaluation. 

During the risk management process, the Board determines acceptable levels of risk tolerance and policies to ensure that all 

identifiable material risks should be analysed, understood, managed and monitored. The Group believes that effective risk 

management is the responsibility of all directors and managers, with the Board providing general oversight. 

Every year, the Management carries out a review of the Group’s risk registers to update and identify new risks that may adversely 

affect the Group’s operations. A risk management report highlighting high risk areas or new risks and measures to mitigate such 

identified risks is submitted annually to the ARC for review and discussion. 

For the year under review, the Management believes that the current framework for managing risks remains appropriate. 

Although risks cannot be completely eliminated, an effective risk management framework will reduce the uncertainties in 

achieving the Group’s business objectives and allow the Group to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. Please refer to 

the Corporate Governance Report and Risk Management and Control Environment sections of the Annual Report.

ANTI-CORRUPTION, ANTI-BRIBERY 

The Group recognises the importance of good governance, anti-corruption and anti-bribery and adopts an integrated Fraud 

Risk Management Framework, designed to identify and minimise fraud occurrences within the Group. The Group adheres to 

the Code of Corporate Governance 2012 and listing rules and regulations set out by SGX and MAS Securities and Futures Act, 

as well as all other applicable laws and regulations. 

In addition, the Group expects its business partners, such as joint ventures and suppliers, to approach issues of corruption and 

bribery in a manner that is consistent with the Group’s principles. The Group will use its influence to ensure that business partners 

meet high integrity standards. The Group will also ensure that the procurement procedures for appointing suppliers are open, 

fair and transparent. The selection of suppliers will be based on evaluation of merits, and not on personal recommendations.

Fundamental

Most of the Group’s investments are in developed markets such as Singapore and UK where there is very strong rule of law 

including anti-corruption laws. Where we have investments in emerging markets, the Group is careful that the investments are 

made with thorough due diligence. 

In support of an open and transparent communication culture, the Group has a whistle-blowing policy in place to provide an 

avenue for employees and external parties to raise concerns and offer reassurance that they will be protected from reprisals or 

victimisation for whistle blowing in good faith. The whistle-blowing policy is available on Hwa Hong’s website and details clear 

procedures for reporting on any improprieties. The Group has zero tolerance to fraud and/or misconduct, encouraging all team 

members to report suspicious cases of fraud and/or misconduct, and spreading awareness amongst them on risks faced by the 

Group. In addition, the Group adheres with the corporate policies and SOPs established (Figure 6), to guide conduct of the 

team members as demonstrated in the unblemished record of zero incidents this year.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Any form of non-compliance could potentially damage the Group’s reputation and affect confidence levels of the shareholders. 

It may also result in penalties such as fines, public warnings or reprimands from the regulators. The Group is also of the view 

that compliance with the applicable law and regulations is critical, so as to uphold Singapore’s reputation as a fair and reliable 

marketplace to conduct businesses.

The Group has established policies and SOPs to ensure that applicable regulations and legislation are complied with, which 

includes periodic self-testing, completing of routine compliance checklists and tracking of any regulatory breaches. In assessing 

the effectiveness of the management of regulatory compliance, the Group will undergo internal audits once every few years, as 

conducted by an external accredited party. The auditors perform an independent review and evaluation of the Group’s internal 

controls, risk management and corporate governance processes in assessing the adequacy and robustness. Through such internal 

audits, it further help ensure that the Group is adhering to the relevant regulatory requirements. The last internal audit on 

regulatory management was carried out in 2016 and no significant matters were noted.

In 2018, there were two instances of penalties of $300 arising from late lodgment of notices to ACRA and two instances of 

penalties of $1,813 arising from the GST voluntary ASK programme resulting from omissions in the GST filing. Other than 

these, there was no other known material incidents of non-compliance with the codes, laws and regulations.

SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS GROWTH

SUSTAINING LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GROWTH AND PERFORMANCE 

Listed on the SGX-ST, Hwa Hong reports its financial performance on a quarterly basis. At the time of the release of this 

report, the most recent financial results released are for the financial year ended 31 December 2018. Total revenue for the year 

was $10,424,113 and net profit was $4,357,822. As at 31 December 2018, Hwa Hong’s total investment properties achieved a 

6.5% increase in valuation, from $226,086,951 last year to $240,723,109.

Through a robust capital and asset management strategy, the Group focuses on investment opportunities that maximise 

shareholders’ value over the medium to long-term (Figure 7).

LONG TERM  

VALUE CREATION

Hwa Hong recognises that encompassing a good governance structure, access to capital and due consideration for the broader 

economic and business environments in both Singapore and UK are vital for the execution of this strategy. 

To meet the commitment of maximising the value of its shareholders, Hwa Hong has developed and paced itself to achieve the 

following strategic objectives:

1. 

Acquire properties with long term value given their location and type of use

2. 

Unlock value from properties or develop sites over time to create value

3. 

Optimise income from assets

4. 

Recycle capital

5. 

Maintain strong, and efficient balance sheet (including ensuring sustainable loans-to-values (“LTVs”) and interest cover)

6. 

Develop overseas markets

In addition, the management further strives to strike a balance between the distribution of a consistent dividend to its 

shareholders and its pursuit of potential investment opportunities with the aim to maximise overall shareholders’ value. The 

dividend payout for a given year is determined by the Board of Directors, after taking into account, inter alia, the Group’s 

balance sheet position, operating results, capital requirements and other factors as deemed relevant. Over the years, Hwa Hong 

remained fairly consistent dividend in its pay-outs to shareholders.

SUCCESSION PLANNING

A fundamental responsibility of the Board is to ensure the continuity of executive leadership, as well as, to assess if the potential 

candidate possesses sufficient depth and talent to execute the Group’s long-term strategy whilst addressing both current and 

long-term needs of the Group.

The Group’s corporate governance and Nominating Committee’s terms of reference details the Board’s responsibilities in ensuring 

succession planning to meet current and future challenges and opportunities. These include ensuring effective processes are 

implemented, such as the following:

• 

Establishment of a process to identify and assess potential internal candidates; 

• 

Conduct periodic review and assessment of readiness;

• 

Implement contingency plans for temporary absences of the Chairman and Group Managing Director due to disability 

or unexpected event; and

• 

Ensure long-term continuity and planning for succession to the Group Managing Director’s position

The Board will assess such processes with the relevant committees on an annual basis.

STRONG PARTNERSHIPS

From a geographical perspective, the Group continues to focus its property investments in its two key markets that are, Singapore 

and the UK. Given the Group’s relative small size and limited capital availability, the Group operates in the UK primarily 

through partnerships. As such, forging and maintaining strong partnerships for continued growth and sustainability is a key 

pillar of our sustainability strategy. 

The Group’s presence in UK has been longstanding and it continues to view London, and to an lesser extent, the UK, as a key 

overseas market for the Group. The Group believes the depth and liquidity of the London property market, in addition to, the 

transparency and the rule of law in the UK make the market attractive for foreign investors. Beginning in 2013, the Group 

has broadened its partnerships and resources in UK which has helped identify promising investment opportunities over time. 

Furthermore, this has managed to allow us to seize key investment opportunities to invest in properties for recurring income 

and potential long-term value creation.

In evaluating suitability for partnerships, the Group assesses largely on these criteria:

1. 

Potential partner’s profile and track record;

2. 

Potential partner’s previous partnership experience or reputation in the industry for new partnership;

 

Hwa Hong further considers several key process issues which are deemed vital in achieving optimal partnership outcomes. These 

process issues include:

1. 

Creating a shared vision on the investments;

2. 

Agreeing on terms upfront with robust and thorough legal agreements;

3. 

Regular monitoring of the investment;

4. 

Ensuring that dispute resolution is agreed upfront

With the above approach, the Group has managed to foster and maintain amicable and professional relationships with its 

partners, in which Hwa Hong believes will create opportunities for future investments.

INFLUENCING HWA HONG’S SUPPLY CHAIN 

Sustainability impacts occur at every aspect of the business and extends beyond the Group’s operations. Hwa Hong is committed 

to influence its value chain in sustainability matters. The Group’s main suppliers are property and project management service 

providers and professional service providers. In areas where the Group is in joint operations with joint-venture partners, the 

Group has varying degrees of control and influence over its property and project management service providers. 

Hence, where relevant and practicable, the Group actively engages the property and project manager and related service providers 

for collaboration to create a positive sustainability impact. To that end, Hwa Hong works closely with the property operators 

to undertake appropriate and adequate risk management procedures during the sourcing and procurement process of materials 

and services. For example, where relevant, only service providers verified to have the required license are allowed to carry out 

maintenance work and fitting-out works in the Group’s properties.

All stakeholders are important to Hwa Hong’s long-term success. Recognising the interdependency between Hwa Hong and its

The Group believes in the provision of fair and equitable opportunities for our team members to grow professionally within 

the organisation. Hwa Hong adopts fair employment practices that are aligned with the Fair Consideration Framework of the 

Ministry of Manpower and the five key principles defined by the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP).

These five key principles by TGFEP are:

(a) 

Recruit and select team members on the basis of merit (such as skills, experience or ability to perform the job), regardless 

of age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability.

(b) Treat team members fairly and respectfully and implement progressive human resource management systems.

(c) 

Provide employees with equal opportunities to be considered for training and development based on their strengths and 

needs, to help them achieve their full potential. 

(d) Reward employees fairly based on their ability, performance, contribution and experience.

(e) 

Abide by labour laws and adopt the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.

At Hwa Hong, the recruitment and career progressions follow a meritocratic approach. The Group remains highly committed 

in treating all team members fairly and equally. For example, the Group provides opportunities for senior citizens who have in 

turn, demonstrated good knowledge and loyalty to the Group.

As Hwa Hong has a lean workforce, the Group recognises that talent attraction and retention is an important aspect. 

Team members are identified as the Group’s most valuable assets and are continuously engaged. The Group views the 

importance of training, developing, growing and retaining its human capital through implementation of effective human 

resource policies and practices. The team members are encouraged to upskill themselves by getting trained for career 

growth and personal development. 

In addition, the Group offers competitive pay packages that are benchmarked to the market and reward team members based on 

merit. The Group’s remuneration package generally comprises two components. One component is fixed in the form of a base 

salary. The other is a variable component comprising Annual Wage Supplement (“AWS”) and performance bonus. The variable 

component is largely dependent on the Group’s financial performance as well as the individual’s performance for the year.

Hwa Hong regards its team members’ well-being as its top priority because it creates job satisfaction, which in turn lowers 

turnover rates and increase productivity. The Group focuses on providing a safe and conducive workplace for its team members. 

Various healthcare benefits, such as health insurance and health screenings are further provided to full-time team members. 

The Group strives to build a working environment that meets the needs of its team members wherever possible. Provision of 

additional leave days and flexible working arrangements are granted additionally, to allow team members to focus on their 

personal commitments as necessary. 

The Group believes in integrity and professionalism in the conduct of Hwa Hong’s business activities and expects the team 

members to embrace, practice and adopt these values as communicated. The Group’s code of conduct is made available to all 

staff as embedded within the employment policy.
