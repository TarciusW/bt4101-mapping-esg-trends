BOARD

STATEMENT





On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), we are pleased to present the second Sustainability Report of Wilton 

Resources Corporation Limited (“Wilton” or the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) for the 

financial year ended 30 June (“FY”) 2019. This report presents the Group’s sustainability strategy and performance as 

we embark on a journey to capture and create value, and promote sustainable development.

In this reporting period, there were no significant changes in the scale of our operation as we have not commenced our 

commercial production phase of the mine. We remain focused on fostering our relationship with the local communities 

and ensuring that our activities are conducted in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. 

We also continue to uphold our pledge to provide a safe and healthy workplace for all our employees and contractors. 

During FY2019, we have made significant progress in advancing our occupational health and safety management 

system and developed various procedures to support the implementation of safe work practices in our operations.

As we embark on our growth journey, we are committed to ensuring that we operate sustainably and that our presence 

creates positive impacts for our employees, as well as the local communities. We strive to continuously improve our 

sustainability performance and mature in our sustainability reporting journey over time.

OUR BUSINESS

Listed on the Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange, Wilton is headquartered in Jakarta and is engaged in the 

exploration, mining and production of gold dore in Indonesia – a major gold producing country. The Group’s concession 

area in West Java (“Ciemas Gold Project”) covers a total area of 3,078.5 hectares.

Based on the latest Independent Qualified Person’s Report (“IQPR”)1, it is estimated that the Ciemas Gold Project 

contains approximately 3,260 kilotonnes (“kt”) of ore reserves with an average grade of about 7.7 g/t of gold2. In 

terms of mineral resources, it is estimated that the Ciemas Gold Project has approximately 3,415 kt of measured and 

indicated mineral resources and 2,559 kt of inferred mineral resources, with an average grade of approximately 8.6 

g/t and 6.5 g/t of gold2, respectively.

Significant progress has been made towards completing the construction of the 500 tonnes per day Flotation and 

Carbon-In-Leach mineral processing plant and its associated supporting facilities. This will play a key role in unlocking 

the potential of the Ciemas Gold Project.

OUR PEOPLE3

In Wilton, we believe that our employees are the key driver for an effective and efficient business. We seek to 

continuously promote and build an inclusive workplace that encourages our employees to pursue their aspirations.

As at 30 June 2019, we have a total of 59 employees across our headquarter and operations in Indonesia and our 

corporate office in Singapore, an increase from 52 employees as at 30 June 2018. All employees are hired on a full-time 

basis and under permanent contract. In addition to these employees, our operations are also supported by outsourced 

workers who provided cleaning and security services at our offices, as well as other mining services at our mine. As 

at 30 June 2019, more than 88% of our employees are based in Indonesia.

Due to the nature of our business in mining operations, which traditionally attract more male applicants, our employees’ 

profile indicates a higher proportion of males compared to females. It is observed that the gender and employee 

category proportion in the Group remained stable as compared to FY2018. The profile of our employees are presented 

in Figure 4 and 5 below.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

We define our material sustainability matters as ESG matters that have significant impacts to our business and 

stakeholders. In FY2018, we undertook a four-step materiality assessment process, to identify our material sustainability 

matters. In this reporting period, we reviewed the existing material sustainability matters identified and confirmed that 

the four material matters are still relevant for reporting. Figure 9 summarises our materiality assessment process.

Figure 9. Materiality assessment process

As we embark on our growth journey, we plan to reassess our material sustainability matters and to progressively 

disclose more material sustainability matters in the next reporting period. Our four material matters are presented in 

Figure 10 below. The matters are not numbered in order of priority or importance.

FY2018

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

In identifying material ESG Matters, we 

conducted:

1. Consolidation of potential ESG matters 

through high level peer reviews and series of 

interview with key internal stakeholders.

2. Prioritisation of potential ESG matters 

through a materiality assessment workshop. 

Both internal and external stakeholders’ 

perspectives were considered in the 

exercise.4

3. Validation of the four material topics by  

the Board.

GOVERNANCE 

AND ETHICS

At Wilton, we believe that good corporate governance is the cornerstone of 

our business. The Group places emphasis on the importance of upholding a 

high standard of corporate governance and complying with applicable law and 

regulations throughout our operations. We understand that good corporate 

governance enables us to effectively manage our risks and opportunities, protect 

our reputation as a business, and more importantly, deliver sustainable value 

for our stakeholders.

OUR APPROACH

We strive to ensure transparent and accountable corporate governance 

practices which are in line with the recommendations of the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012 and the new Code of Corporate Governance 2018 for financial 

years commencing from 1 January 2019 onwards.

The Board is responsible for the overall risk management and internal control of 

the Group. The Board and Management of the Company hold the responsibility 

of the risk management function. Assessment of the effectiveness of internal 

control and the overall governance practices are carried out regularly.

The Group has in place a whistleblowing policy which provides direct channels 

for our employees to raise concerns on all matters relating to misconduct, 

including any possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting. Employees 

are expected to directly send their concerns in writing to the Chairman of 

the Audit Committee. All feedback received are directly handled by the Audit 

Committee and appropriate measures, including investigation, will be conducted 

accordingly. Details of the whistleblowing policy are described in Figure 12. 

Our detailed corporate governance practices can be found in the Corporate 

Governance Report in our FY2019 Annual Report (pages 20 to 42).

As a testament to our effort in implementing an effective corporate governance 

policies and practices, we were recognised as the runner-up of the Most 

Transparent Company Award under mining and quarrying category by the 

Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (“SIAS”) at the 20th Investors’ 

Choice Awards held in September 2019.

OCCUPATIONAL 

HEALTH AND SAFETY

15

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH

AND SAFETY

Occupational health and safety (“OHS”) is a critical issue in the mining sector, 

not only for the Company but also for stakeholders, including employees, 

contractors, and communities. In Wilton, we believe that the health and safety of 

our employees are essential for the sustainable growth of the Group. Promoting 

a healthy and safe workplace has always been our highest priority, and we 

remain committed to working towards the goal of zero-work related accidents.

OUR APPROACH

In our operations, occupational health and safety are managed by the “Zero 

Accident Committee”. Lead by Mining Head and Deputy Mining Head, this 

committee is supported by various project management team at our mining 

site. The committee is responsible for ensuring all OHS targets are met through 

the implementation of health and safety programmes, as well as reviewing the 

effectiveness of the management system.

As we embark on our growth journey, we have been working to obtain ISO 

45001:2018 (Occupational Health and Management System) certification for 

our Health, Safety and Environment (“HSE”) management system. We are also 

in the process of formalising HSE policy and developing various health, safety 

and environment-related procedures such as risk assessment, work permit, 

incident investigation, environmental aspects identification and hazardous waste 

management, among other procedures.

The HSE management system covers our operations in Indonesia, including 

our headquarter in Jakarta and mining site in West Java. Wilton’s HSE 

management system is established based on the plan-do-check action model. 

The iterative four-step cycle provides a framework to continually improve our 

HSE management system through identification of HSE key risks and hazards, 

implementation of HSE programmes, as well as regular monitoring and review 

of HSE performance. Figure 13 illustrates Wilton’s HSE management framework.

Further, as part of our efforts in minimising safety risks in our operation, we engage well-qualified miners with years 

of experiences, competencies and relevant safety certifications in the mining sector. Various safety programmes were 

also implemented in this reporting period. We conducted safety patrol to identify any unsafe conditions and implement 

necessary measures to prevent incident at our mining site. A series of safety inspections were also conducted to 

evaluate the condition of fire equipment and to ensure the safety of our facilities including workshop, warehouse and 

main camp.

We advocate the “safety first” culture to all levels of the workforce through several avenues such as daily safety 

talks, safety training, and fire drills. We mandate that all our employees and contractors are responsible for their own 

safety as well as the safety of those working alongside them. We expect all employees to comply with relevant safety 

regulations and standards.

DAILY SAFETY TALKS

To cultivate a strong safety culture in our operation, we conduct compulsory 

daily safety talks for our employees and contractors.

The regular talks cover various safety topics such as the importance of 

Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) usage, identification of unsafe 

conditions and behaviour, as well as the provisions of safe and healthy 

working conditions and activities. The initiative is mostly targeting our 

employees and contractor in our mining site due to the higher risk their 

work possessed, as compared to our employees in the office.

Through the implementation of this programme, the management aims to promote safe work practices among our 

workers and to manifest the goal of zero work-related accidents in our operations.

UNDERGROUND MINING

Wilton plans to implement an underground mining operation in the 

early phase of our operation. This method is known to have less land 

disturbance as compared to the open-pit mining method.

In our mine area at Cikadu, we have constructed an underground tunnel 

and a mining entrance portal. This tunnel serves as the main thoroughfare 

where raw ore is shuttled out of the mine. Underground mining operation 

possess additional safety concerns, hence, appropriate measures to 

ensure the safety of our workers have been planned to be implemented.

In operating the underground mine, we plan to implement a series of safety 

measures such as performing daily safety drill before the commencement 

of work and providing every worker with the required PPE. Further, regular 

checks on the tunnel structure under the geotechnical considerations will 

also be conducted as part of our procedure to ensure a safe working 

environment. Wire mesh and steel beams are installed to reinforce the 

tunnel structure, as necessary.

EMPOWERING LOCAL 

COMMUNITIES

EMPOWERING LOCAL

COMMUNITIES

Wilton recognises that community empowerment is one of the Group’s 

responsibilities. We understand that the Group’s presence should bring positive 

impacts to the communities where we operate. We believe that community 

empowerment is not only benefitting the local society but also advancing 

the Group’s business through various support from the communities to our 

operations.

OUR APPROACH

As our mining site is located in a developing region, we are mindful on 

the opportunities to improve the welfare and the development of the local 

communities. Through the Group’s Wilton Care programme, we respond to 

these opportunities by implementing various Corporate Social Responsibility 

(“CSR”) initiatives. In FY2019, we carried out several CSR activities and 

community investment such as donations for religious celebration and events, 

donations for national day celebration and provided technical support for 

infrastructure construction. Figure 14 summarised the CSR activities that we 

conducted during the reporting period.

Apart from all our CSR efforts, we contribute to the livelihood of the local 

communities through the creation of job opportunities in our operations. 

Through on-the-job-training, we also seek to assist in upgrading their skillsets 

and competency in the mining sector.

Regular engagements with the local community are conducted to understand 

their evolving needs better and to ensure that our CSR activities are able to 

address these needs. We strive to enhance our CSR activities so as to assist 

the local communities in improving their standard of living and contribute to the 

development of the local economy.

PROVIDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION

As part of our CSR initiatives, we provided technical support for bridge construction at Purwasedar Village in 

Sukabumi District. A 24-meters-long bridge is part of the Indonesian Army’s infrastructure development programme 

for undeveloped villages. Along with the other infrastructure developments such as road and drainage construction, 

this program aims to improve the local economy in Purwasedar Village.

 

SUPPORTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH VARIOUS 

DONATIONS

As Wilton’s mining area is located in both Ciemas and Mekar Jaya Village, most of our CSR programmes are targeting 

the communities in both regions. Regular CSR activities, including donations for religious and national day celebrations, 

as well as donations to orphanage and nursing home,  are consistently conducted by Wilton since we begin our Wilton 

Care programme. Ad-hoc contribution to infrastructure development such as a donation for mosque constructions is 

also made under this programme.

Through Wilton Care, we seek to strengthen the relationship between the Group and local communities and establish 

mutually benefitting relationships.

LAND

MANAGEMENT

We are committed to minimising the environmental impacts of our operations. 

We are mindful of the potential land disturbance from our mining activities 

and place great importance in restoring the function of the environment 

through reclamation and rehabilitation efforts. We understand that closure and 

reclamation of our operations possess risks that could affect our business 

and reputation. Effectively managing these risks throughout the mine lifecycle 

is crucial to address the growing regulatory requirements and stakeholder’s 

expectations. 

OUR APPROACH

As part of our effort in managing the environmental impacts of our activities, 

we plan to carry out underground mining operation in the early phase of our 

commercial production before exploring the surface mining operation. This effort 

enables us to minimise the potential environmental impacts as the underground 

mining operation limits the disturbance to the surface landscape of the mine 

area.

To manage post-mining rehabilitation, Wilton has in place a mine closure 

plan before the commencement of mining activities. This plan consists of 

environmental and social management programmes, including reclamation and 

revegetation plan. The mine closure plan has been approved by the Ministry 

of Energy and Mineral Resources of Indonesia and is developed in alignment 

with the relevant laws and regulations. The plan serves as a guidance for our 

rehabilitation effort and considers the physical, biological, and social aspect of 

our mine area. It is expected that through this plan, the natural environment and 

local social function of the area can be restored for its future intended purposes.

Our commitment to land reclamation and rehabilitation is also reflected through 

our financial commitments. We have identified the estimated investment for 

post-mining closure activities in our Environmental Impact Assessments study. 

Further, we have provided a monetary deposit to guarantee our reclamation 

efforts and mine closure to the Government of Indonesia. Figure 15 summarises 

our plans for land management at the post-mining phase.

We have also received the “Clear and Clean” certification by the Directorate 

General of Minerals and Coal through our subsidiaries, PT. Wilton Wahana 

Indonesia and PT. Liektucha Ciemas. The certification was given by the 

government to companies that have fully complied with the relevant 

environmental and mining laws and regulations in Indonesia. The “Clear and 

Clean” certificates can be found in Figure 16 below.

Reclaim 230 hectares

phase in FY2019, hence, 

there is no reclamation

A. Physical Environment Management

Demolition of mining facilities

Land reclamation

Erosion control

• Wilton will demolish its mining 

and supporting facilities 

to prevent any risk to the 

surrounding community.

• The demolition will be conducted 

gradually to minimise risks.

• Unused mining pit will be 

covered with topsoil and planted 

with selected vegetation.

• Mining area which inundated 

with water will be used for fish 

farming.

• Erosion control measures will 

be conducted using vegetative 

(planting of selected vegetation) 

and mechanical method 

(installing of selected structure).

Hydrology

Effluent management

Soil fertility control

• Drainage system and 

sedimentation pond will be 

constructed to flow the surface 

run-off water from the mining 

area.

• Effluents from mining 

activities are to be treated at 

sedimentation ponds prior to 

discharge into rivers.

• Regular monitoring will be 

conducted to ensure the 

compliance with relevant 

regulations.

• Introduction of organic materials 

as well as microorganism to 

improve soil fertility in the mine 

area.

B. Revegetation Programme

• Revegetation programme is conducted to restore the function of the natural environment in the mining area. 

The success of the programme is highly reliant on the type of vegetation that is used for revegetation.

• The selection of vegetation is based on both ecological and economical value. Pine and rubber are amongst 

the suitable vegetations that have been planned to be planted in Wilton’s mining area.
