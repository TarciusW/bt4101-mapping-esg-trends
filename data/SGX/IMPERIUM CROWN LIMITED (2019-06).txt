social regulations. 

On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my gratitude to our clients, business

Organisation Profile  

 

As a property investment, development and management company, the Group has 

planted the seeds of investment in the following areas. The Group acquired 60% of Global 

Entertainment Media Pte Ltd (“GEM”) which holds a 50-year operating rights to the 

Wonder Stone Park (the “WSP”), a park exhibiting naturally occurring stone boulders and 

rocks of a wide variety of sizes, colour and patterns and which are specifically native 

to Fei county (a county of Linyi city). The WSP is a mixed-use development and a 

tourist attraction with a theme park featuring rides and attractions.  

As part of the acquisition of a 60% stake in GEM1, a hotel (the “Hotel”) located 

strategically within the WSP was also acquired, resulting in the Group having 54% 

ownership over the Hotel. On 18 February 2019, the Group announced that they had 

signed a license agreement with the Inzone Hotels &amp; Resorts Group for the Hotel to 

operate under the “Inzone” brand (the “Brand”). Under this license agreement, Inzone 

Hotels &amp; Resorts Group has also been appointed to manage the Hotel. The Hotel 

started operations on 17 September 2019. 

Further to the Group’s attempt to seek out collaborations with professional business 

partners, a memorandum of understanding was signed with Sim Leisure Group (“SLG”) 

on 1 September 2018 where SLG will invest and operate a theme park that is designed 

based on their “ESCAPE” brand of theme park in Penang, Malaysia. The Group and 

SLG are currently in the final stages of formalising an operating lease agreement 

which will set out the terms of the cooperation.  

The Company also announced the incorporation of Fei County Yin Sheng Real Estate 

Co., Ltd (“Yin Sheng Real Estate”) to spearhead the property development and 

investment segment. As its maiden project, Yin Sheng Real Estate is holding 

discussions with potential collaboration partners to jointly undertake the development 

of the 2 plots of land acquired in WSP, measuring 13,409 square meters and 27,681 

square meters respectively. The development plans are in the final stages of being 

firmed up. Zoned for commercial and mixed-use in the WSP, the Group is confident of 

the prospects of the development and will continuously review the property market to 

identify future opportunities. 

 

 

1On 27 September 2018, the Company announced that it had entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with 

Fortsmith Investments Limited (the “Vendor”) to acquire the remaining 40% stake in GEM (the “40% Acquisition”).  Under the 

conditions precedent of the SPA, the Company is required to, amongst other conditions precedent, to obtain the approval of the 

shareholders of the Company at an extraordinary general meeting to be convened.  On 28 March 2019, the Company announced 

that it had entered into a supplemental agreement with the Vendor to extend the completion date of the 40% Acquisition to 30 

September 2019, or such later date as the Company and the Vendor may mutually agree in writing. On 26 September 2019, the 

Company announced that it had entered into a supplemental agreement with the Vendor to extend the completion date of the 

40% Acquisition to 31 March 2020, or such later date as the Company and the Vendor may mutually agree in writing.

Our Sustainability Story  

 

Sustainable Tourism 

The Group is committed to achieving sustainable tourism which makes a low impact 

on the environment and local culture, while helping to generate future employment for 

the local community. By conducting impact assessments before commencement of 

operations, we ensure that resources will be available for future generations. 

By achieving sustainable tourism, we maximise the positive contribution of tourism to 

biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction and the achievement of common goals 

towards sustainable development, including those related to poverty, inequality and 

environmental degradation. 

The Group is committed to operating sustainably in economic, environmental and 

social aspects. While the economic landscape for the leisure and hospitality industry 

remains competitive, we believe that with our strategic business decisions and astute 

foresight, we will achieve sustainable returns for our stakeholders.  

Sustainable Property Development 

The Group will work towards prioritising environmental sustainability in our property 

designs and construction. We strictly comply with environmental and socioeconomic 

laws and regulations. 

Sustainability Targets 

We envision to achieve sustainable Hotel operations and endeavour to boost 

employment for the local community by hiring locals in our operations when we 

commence operations in the financial year ending 30 June 2020 (“FY2020”). In 

addition, we incorporated sustainable building designs in the Hotel by installing eco-

friendly light-emitting diode (“LED”) lights and motion sensor lights.

Ethics  

 

Anti-corruption  

GRI 205-1, 205-2, 205-3 

The Group takes a strong stand against corrupt practices and strategies, and this 

value has been communicated to all of our employees, major suppliers and business 

partners. The Company has formal policies on anti-corruption and our employees are 

educated on our anti-corruption stance upon induction and reinforced when necessary. 

Any forms of corruption within the Group will not be tolerated, and will be escalated to 

the Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

There was no reported incident of corruption in respect of FY2019.  

Whistle-blowing Policy  

Management has put in place, with the endorsement of the Audit Committee (“AC”), 

arrangements by which staff of the Group may, in confidence, contact two of the 

independent directors of the Company, allowing any staff to raise concerns about 

possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters. The Company 

has also extended the channel of whistle-blowing to external parties via the 

Company’s website where the email addresses of the Chairman of the AC and another 

independent director of the Company are available for the raising of potential concerns. 

The objective for such arrangements is to ensure independent investigation of matters 

raised and to allow appropriate actions to be taken.  

There were no whistle-blowing letters received during FY2019.

Reporting Practice 

 

The Group’s FY2019 sustainability report has been produced in accordance with the 

Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards “Core” option covering our performance 

from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019. The GRI Standards represent the global best 

practices for reporting on economic, environmental and social topics.  The Company

SGX’s “Comply or Explain” requirements on sustainability reporting under Listing Rule 

711B and Practice Note 7F of the Listing Manual Section B: Rules of the Catalist of

1. Leisure and hospitality 

The Group has identified cultural tourism as an area of growth in China. Under the 

auspices of the Shandong provincial government, tourism has been identified as a major 

sector for growth. “好客山东” (or “Hospitable Shandong”) is one of the highest 

accolade and branding that aptly describes Shandong province and it ranks highly among 

provinces in terms of tourist visitor-ship. Blessed with a richness of cultural heritage, the 

amalgamation of culture and tourism is a natural attraction to visitors within China and 

from overseas.  

The wonder stone garden integrates wonder stones exhibition, garden tour, leisure and 

entertainment with folk culture. In an effort to preserve and celebrate the culture of this 

area, we implemented free entry for visitors to explore the theme park. The Hotel 

commenced operations on 17 September 2019 and our environmental and social 

performance will be reported in FY2020.  

Environmental Sustainability 

GRI 301-2, 302-5, 303-2, 303-3, 304-2, 305-5, 306-1, 306-2, 307-1, 308-1, 308-2 

Given the nature and locality of the operations of the Hotel in WSP, we are aware that 

there will be certain environmental impact, such as energy and water wastage, waste 

generation and effluents discharge. As such, the Group is committed to preserving the 

surrounding biodiversity and minimising negative environmental impacts of our Hotel and 

tourism operations. We conduct in-house environmental impact assessments on an 

annual basis to identify the anticipated effects of our operations on the environment to 

mitigate the environmental risks of our operations through optimised management and 

operations.  

We aim to implement sustainable practices and features at the Hotel, such as purchasing 

environmentally-friendly products and recycling hotel supplies wherever possible to 

reduce waste generation. Our Hotel uses solar energy to power its operations, thus 

reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions from non-renewable sources. In 

addition, water is sourced from a licensed water supplier instead of being drawn from 

natural sources of water. This minimises environmental issues such as excessive 

groundwater extraction and water contamination.  

The Hotel has its own wastewater treatment facility to ensure that wastewater is 

processed in accordance to regulatory requirements before discharge. A licensed waste 

collector is engaged to manage the disposal of waste. Furthermore, internal guidelines 

have been implemented to curb wastage and an incentive program is established to 

motivate waste reduction. The Hotel restaurant also takes into account the number of 

hotel guests and expected number of diners in the preparation of food to minimise food 

wastage.   

We select our Hotel operator based on their track record and environmental performance 

to ensure that our Hotel operations will be managed in a sustainable and eco-friendly 


 

11 

IMPERIUM CROWN LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 

 

manner. We also assess the environmental performance of our suppliers on an annual 

basis in an effort to establish a sustainable supply chain in our Hotel management. We 

evaluate them based on their energy and water conservation measures, as well as their 

waste management and recycling practices. 

The construction of our Hotel was in strict compliance with local environmental laws 

and regulations, and there was no reported incident of non-compliance with relevant 

environmental regulations among our contractors and Hotel operator in FY2019 and 

up to the date of this report.  

Social Sustainability 

GRI 202-1, 203-2, 413-1, 414-1, 414-2, 419-1 

With the WSP being an upcoming tourist attraction, we envision to contribute to the 

booming tourism industry in the Shandong province and attract more tourists, thereby 

boosting the economy in the local community. We endeavour to preserve and promote 

the site safety, uniqueness and recognition of the WSP as well as the surrounding tourist 

spots. 

Additionally, we believe that the ease of people moving around is important. With the 

WSP situated within a five-minute drive from the city centre, bus terminal and major 

expressways, connectivity in the community is going to be enhanced with our presence 

and infrastructure, via the highways connected to major cities and the soon-to-be 

completed Fei County High Speed Rail. 

Furthermore, we are committed to economic and social development by hiring from 

the local community to improve social conditions and community development. We 

also procure from local suppliers wherever possible to support local businesses and 

the economy. We have achieved the target of 50% local hire and procurement vendors, 

and we will continue to engage with the local community in our business.  

Other than increasing jobs and business opportunities available for the local 

community, we conduct social impact assessments of our operations and include 

assessment factors such as local employment and equal opportunities to ensure that 

negative social impacts on the local community are minimised. We will strive to 

minimise resource wastage by making responsible, sustainable purchase decisions. 

We conduct supplier evaluation on an annual basis to ensure that our contractors and 

Hotel operator operate in strict compliance with local social and economic laws and 

regulations. There was no reported incident of social and economic non-compliance 

in FY2019.

GRI 307-1, 419-1 

The Group is committed to being a responsible corporation in the communities we 

operate in, and we endeavour to deliver safe, efficient, environmentally sustainable 

and high-quality property developments. We strive to minimise our impact on the 

environment through conducting environmental impact assessments and achieving 

strict compliance with local economic, environmental and social regulations.  

During FY2019, the Group had no incident of non-compliance with environmental and 

socio-economic laws and regulations.  There were no environment impact 

assessments required to be made on the Hotel.

3. Our People, Our Assets 

 

The Group endeavours to create an inclusive workplace environment, committed to 

mutual respect, fairness and equality for all our staff and workers. We provide 

opportunities for continuous learning and skills improvement for staff development.  

 

Workforce Diversity 

GRI 401-1, 405-1 

We advocate fair employment and endeavour to achieve a balanced and diversified 

workforce. As at the end of FY2019, our total staff strength was 122. We hired 111 

new staff, equivalent to 1000% new hire rate due to the commencement of Hotel 

operations. 

 

We are proud of the equal gender representation of our workforce, with our female-to-

male ratio being 54:46. We will continue to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce 

to ensure equality and productivity in the work place.  

Employee Retention  

GRI 202-1, 401-2, 401-3, 404-3, 405-2 

The Group recognises the valuable contribution of all employees. Our employees are 

remunerated in compliance with local minimum wage laws. All employees are 

assessed regularly and remunerated fairly based on their experience, qualifications 

and performance, regardless of age or gender.
