In this regard, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company takes into consideration 

sustainability issues as part of the strategic formulation even as they pursue business 

growth.

ENVIRONMENT 

OUR APPROACH 

Our business operations pose a significant impact on the environment. We are committed 

to effectively manage the environmental aspects as well as to comply with applicable 

environmental standards, laws, and regulations.  

ENERGY 

Our main operations are in manufacturing and production, as such energy consumption is a 

key issue of concern. The energy sources used in the company are coal, waste gas (biomass) 

and electricity. We have implemented an energy monitoring practice to handle energy usage 

within the company. With the monitoring initiative in place, it aligns with the company’s 

goal by reducing the energy consumption and achieve greater efficiency in the use of energy 

to lower the operating costs. 

At Delong, we have a designated team to monitor the energy usage within the company. 

The team will analyse the energy consumption data on a monthly basis. Energy surges that 

were identified within the company will be investigated for possible faults in the instruments 

and machinery. 

The below charts show the detailed breakdown of Delong’s energy consumption statistics.

Figure 4: Total Energy Consumption (MWh) 

In FY 2017, the total energy consumption was recorded at 13,009,372 megawatt (MWh) 

hour which equivalent to 46,883,738,795 megajoules (MJ). 

In the future, we are looking to implement additional initiatives to minimise the energy 

consumption within the company.

WATER 

Water is identified as a priority resource for our business. We are committed to reducing water 

consumption and encouraging the use of treated/recycled water in our daily operations. We 

have a strategic approach to water management by:  

 

Implementing a water reuse system in our daily operations to reduce the reliance on 

municipal supply; and   

 

Establishing monitoring water leak detection work to monitor water usage as well as 

to reduce wastage due to leaking pipes or water overflow within the company. 

The below charts show the detailed breakdown of Delong’s water consumption statistics.

12 

 

 

Figure 7: Total Water Consumption (m3) 

 

In FY 2017, the total energy consumption was recorded at 4,381,522 m3. However, we will 

continue our effort in reducing the water consumption within the company by monitoring 

water leak detection work which is also in line with the company’s objective in minimising 

the operating cost. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

In order to ensure legal compliance, we analyse and follow the environmental laws and 

regulations in the countries which we operate in closely.  

In FY 2017, there were no major incidences involving significant fines or non-monetary 

sanctions for non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations. We aim to maintain 

this level of performance for many years to come and be a role model in our industry.

PEOPLE 

OUR APPROACH 

We emphasise the protection of labour rights, equal opportunity and non-discrimination in the 

workplace. We have a human resource policy that expresses the commitment to the ethical, 

professional and legal standards with the objectives to: 

 

Developing employees’ working competencies through learning and development; 

 

Creating a well-balanced workplace to attract talent; 

 

Fostering fair and equitable workplace culture; and 

 

Caring for employees’ well-being and benefits. 

 

EMPLOYMENT 

As of 31 December 2017, we have a total 4,345 employees and close to one percent of the 

employees were hired on temporary or contract basis. Recruitment of new employees is 

conducted in line with our corporate human resource policy. 

The below charts show the detailed breakdown of our employment statistics.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION 

We believe in employees’ learning and development by grooming them to their fullest 

potential, personally and professionally. At Delong, our employees are critical to the 

operations and function of our business. We emphasise heavily on continual training so as so 

to enhance staff performance and upgrade their professional skillsets.  

The training thus ensures that employees are able to acquire the necessary skillset relevant 

to their job scope. Regardless of category, each employee, on an average, has more than 100 

hours of training annually. In future, we aim to consistently meet our internal target for 

Continuing Professional Development (CPD) training. 

The below charts show the detailed breakdown of employees’ average training hours by 

gender and employee categories.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY  

We consider people as the backbone of our business operation and strive to ensure that our 

employees’ health and safety are always taken care of. We have formulated various systems 

for occupational health and safety (OHS) within the company.  

A Safety committee has been established at Delong to improve environmental health and 

safety (EHS) performance within the company, prevent industrial safety occupational 

diseases, as well as to create awareness of EHS among our employees.  

In the event of incidents, we have an on-site response plan that gives the safety committee 

overall responsibility in the treatment and evacuation of any injured workers. 

However, we have had six injury incidents reported in FY 2017, which translates into 18.4 

lost day rate per 200,000 hours worked. There were no cases of occupational diseases and 

work-related fatalities in the same year. 

The diagram below shows a full breakdown of our company’s occupational health and safety 

statistics for this year.  

 

To continue the emphasis on managing workplace health and safety in our business, we have 

outlined goals and targets to better manage health and safety concerns of our employees. 

We aim to achieve an excellent OHS culture within our Group to achieve zero reportable (lost-

time) incidents. We will follow up closely and report on our progress in the next report.
