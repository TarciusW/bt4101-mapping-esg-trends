BusinessGeneral Development of BusinessSummary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-1. As of December 31, 2018, Chevron had approximately 48,600 employees (including about 3,600 service station employees). Approximately 24,800  employees (including about 3,300 service station employees), or 51 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. Operating Environment Refer to pages 28 through 34 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook.Chevron’s Strategic Direction Chevron’s primary objective is to deliver industry-leading results and superior shareholder value in any business environment. In the upstream, the company’s strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities. In the downstream, the company's strategy is to grow earnings across the value chain and make targeted investments to lead the industry in returns.Information about the company is available on the company’s website at www.chevron.com. Information contained on the company’s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the company’s website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.________________________________________________________* Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,”  “us” and "its" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. 3Description of Business and PropertiesThe upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects* in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2018, and assets as of the end of 2018 and 2017 — for the United States and the company’s international geographic areas — are in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 66. Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Note 14 beginning on page 69 and Note 17 on page 77. Refer to pages 39 and 40 of this Form 10-K in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company's capital and exploratory expenditures. Upstream Reserves Refer to Table V beginning on page 95 for a tabulation of the company’s proved net liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2016 and each year-end from 2016 through 2018. Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations.At December 31, 2018, 29 percent of the company's net proved oil-equivalent reserves were located in the United States, 20 percent were located in Australia and 18 percent were located in Kazakhstan.The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2016 through 2018 are shown in the following table:  At December 31   2018 2017 2016 Liquids — Millions of barrels        Consolidated Companies4,975 4,530 4,131   Affiliated Companies1,815 2,012 2,197 Total Liquids6,790 6,542 6,328 Natural Gas — Billions of cubic feet        Consolidated Companies28,733 27,514 25,432   Affiliated Companies2,843 3,222 3,328 Total Natural Gas31,576 30,736 28,760 Oil-Equivalent — Millions of barrels1        Consolidated Companies9,764 9,116 8,369   Affiliated Companies2,289 2,549 2,752 Total Oil-Equivalent12,053 11,665 11,121 1 Oil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of crude oil.________________________________________________________* As used in this report, the term “project” may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of the term “project” as it relates to any specific governmental law or regulation.4Net Production of Liquids and Natural Gas The following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2018 and 2017 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 2.930 million barrels per day in 2018 was up 7 percent from 2017. Production increases from major capital projects, shale and tight properties, and base business were partially offset by normal field declines, the impact of asset sales, and production entitlement effects in several locations. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page 32 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2016 through 2018 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas, and refer to Table V on pages 98 and 99 for information on annual production by geographical region.    Components of Oil-Equivalent   Oil-Equivalent  Liquids  Natural Gas  Thousands of barrels per day (MBPD)(MBPD)1  (MBPD)  (MMCFPD)  Millions of cubic feet per day (MMCFPD)20182017 20182017 20182017 United States 791681 618519 1,034970 Other Americas            Argentina2423 2019 2427   Brazil1113 1012 44   Canada211698 10387 7965   Colombia1416 —— 8296   Trinidad and Tobago3—5 —— —29 Total Other Americas165155 133118 189221 Africa            Angola108112 98103 5957   Democratic Republic of the Congo312 12 —1   Nigeria239250 200213 233223   Republic of Congo5238 4936 1414 Total Africa400402 348354 306295 Asia            Azerbaijan2025 1823 1011   Bangladesh112111 44 648642   China2930 1617 8481   Indonesia132164 113137 113163   Kazakhstan4655 2733 120132   Myanmar1619 —— 98116   Partitioned Zone4—— —— ——   Philippines2625 33 138129   Thailand236241 6669 1,0221,031 Total Asia617670 247286 2,2332,305 Australia/Oceania            Australia426256 4227 2,3041,372 Total Australia/Oceania426256 4227 2,3041,372 Europe            Denmark1923 1214 4553   United Kingdom6575 4350 133155 Total Europe8498 5564 178208 Total Consolidated Companies2,4832,262 1,4431,368 6,2445,371 Affiliates2,5447466 339355 645661 Total Including Affiliates6 2,9302,728 1,7821,723 6,8896,032           1 Oil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of crude oil. 2 Includes synthetic oil:   Canada, net 5351 5351 ——   Venezuelan affiliate, net2428 2428 —— 3 Producing fields in Trinidad and Tobago were sold in August 2017.

Total “as sold” natural gas volumes were 6,270 million and 5,467 million cubic feet per day for 2018 and 2017, respectively. 5Production OutlookThe company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2019 will grow 4 to 7 percent compared to 2018, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2019 asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, as described beginning on page 29. Refer to the “Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,” beginning on page 8, for a discussion of the company’s major crude oil and natural gas development projects.Average Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of Production Refer to Table IV on page 94 for the company’s average sales price per barrel of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and per thousand cubic feet of natural gas produced, and the average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel for 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 293 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2019 through 2021. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are all based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. 6Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2,442 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2019 through 2021 from operations in Australia, Colombia, Indonesia and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries.Development Activities Refer to Table I on page 91 for details associated with the company’s development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2018, 2017 and 2016.The following table summarizes the company’s net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the company’s development wells drilling at December 31, 2018. A “development well” is a well drilled within the known area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.    Wells Drilling* Net Wells Completed    at 12/31/18 2018  2017  2016   Gross Net  Prod.

Chevron’s 2018 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 32, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-7. The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. United StatesUpstream activities in the United States are primarily located in the midcontinent region, the Gulf of Mexico, California and the Appalachian Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2018 averaged 791,000 barrels per day. The company's activities in the midcontinent region are primarily in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. During 2018, net daily production in these areas averaged 198,000 barrels of crude oil, 651 million cubic feet of natural gas and 77,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). In 2018, the company divested properties in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. The company is pursuing opportunities to increase development efficiency across the region.In the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, the company holds approximately 500,000 and 1,200,000 net acres of shale and tight resources in the Midland and Delaware basins, respectively. This acreage includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. The company is also applying data analytics and technology on its Permian well information to drive improvements in well targets and performance. In 2018, the company's net daily production in the basin averaged 159,000 barrels of crude oil, 501 million cubic feet of natural gas and 66,000 barrels of NGLs.During 2018, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 186,000 barrels of crude oil, 117 million cubic feet of natural gas and 13,000 barrels of NGLs. Chevron is engaged in various operated and nonoperated exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

The company is collaborating with other Carnarvon Basin participants to assess the opportunity of Clio Acme being developed through shared utilization of existing infrastructure. New Zealand Chevron holds a 50 percent interest and operates three deepwater exploration permits in the offshore Pegasus and East Coast basins. Seismic processing and interpretation continued in 2018.14EuropeIn Europe, the company is engaged in upstream activities in Denmark and the United Kingdom. Net oil-equivalent production averaged 84,000 barrels per day during 2018. Denmark Chevron signed an agreement to sell its 12 percent nonoperated working interest in the Danish Underground Consortium in September 2018. The sale is expected to close in 2019, pending regulatory approval.United Kingdom The company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2018 averaged 65,000 barrels per day, composed of 43,000 barrels of liquids and 133 million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2018, Chevron announced its intent to market its Central North Sea assets, including Captain. The Captain Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Project is the next development phase of the Captain Field, which is designed to increase field recovery by injecting a polymer/water mixture into the Captain reservoir. Stage 1 of the project is an expansion of the existing polymer injection system on the wellhead production platform that includes six new polymer injection wells and modifications to the platform facilities. Proved reserves have been recognized for Stage 1 of this project. During 2018,  construction continued to progress on Captain EOR Stage 2, which involves subsea expansion of the technology.  At the end of 2018, proved reserves had not been recognized for Stage 2 of the project.Chevron has a 19.4 percent nonoperated working interest in the Clair Ridge Project, located west of the Shetland Islands. The project is the second development phase of the Clair Field. The design capacity of the project is 120,000 barrels of crude oil and 100 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. First production was achieved in November 2018. The Clair Field has an estimated production life extending until 2050. In January 2019, Chevron sold its 40 percent operated working interest in the Rosebank Field. Norway In November 2018, the company divested its 20 percent nonoperated working interest in exploration Block PL 859, located in the Barents Sea. Sales of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids  The company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) from its producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements. In addition, the company also makes third-party purchases and sales of natural gas and NGLs in connection with its supply and trading activities. During 2018, U.S. and international sales of natural gas averaged 3.5 billion and 5.6 billion cubic feet per day, respectively, which includes the company’s share of equity affiliates’ sales. Outside the United States, substantially all of the natural gas sales from the company’s producing interests are from operations in Angola, Australia, Bangladesh, Europe, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Latin America, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Philippines and Thailand. U.S. and international sales of NGLs averaged 184,000 and 96,000 barrels per day, respectively, in 2018. Substantially all of the international sales of NGLs from the company's producing interests are from operations in Angola, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Nigeria and the United Kingdom. Refer to “Selected Operating Data,” on page 37 in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for further information on the company’s sales volumes of natural gas and natural gas liquids. Refer also to “Delivery Commitments” beginning on page 6 for information related to the company’s delivery commitments for the sale of crude oil and natural gas.DownstreamRefining OperationsAt the end of 2018, the company had a refining network capable of processing nearly 1.6 million barrels of crude oil per day. Operable capacity at December 31, 2018, and daily refinery inputs for 2016 through 2018 for the company and affiliate refineries are summarized in the table on the next page. Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization was 93 percent in 2018 and 2017. At the U.S. refineries, crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged 97 percent in 2018, compared with 98 percent in 2017. Chevron processes both imported and domestic crude oil in its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for about 70 percent and 71 percent of Chevron’s U.S. refinery inputs in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In the United States, the company continued work on projects to improve refinery flexibility and reliability. At the Richmond refinery in California, first production commenced at the new hydrogen plant in November 2018 and full operation of the 15project is expected in 2019. At the refinery in Salt Lake City, Utah, construction continues for the alkylation retrofit project. Project start-up is expected in 2020. In January 2019, the company signed an agreement to acquire a refinery in Pasadena, Texas.Outside the United States, the company has three large refineries in South Korea, Singapore and Thailand. The Singapore Refining Company (SRC), a 50 percent-owned joint venture, processes up to 276,000  barrels of crude per day and manufactures a wide range of petroleum products. The company continues to progress evaluation and development of upgrading projects to convert low-value products into higher-value products. The 50 percent-owned, GS Caltex operated, Yeosu Refinery in South Korea remains one of the world's largest and is targeted for additional investment with the addition of olefins production capacity. The company's 60.6 percent-owned refinery in Map Ta Phut, Thailand, continues to supply high-quality petroleum products through the Caltex brand in the Thailand market.In September 2018, the company completed the sale of its interest in the Cape Town refinery in South Africa.Petroleum Refineries: Locations, Capacities and Inputs  Capacities and inputs in thousands of barrels per dayDecember 31, 2018 Refinery Inputs  Locations Number Operable Capacity 201820172016 PascagoulaMississippi1351332349355 El SegundoCalifornia1269273251267 RichmondCalifornia1257249248188 Kapolei1Hawaii————37 Salt Lake CityUtah155515353 Total Consolidated Companies — United States 4932905901900 Map Ta PhutThailand1157160152162 Cape Town2South Africa——496878 Burnaby, B.C.3Canada———4051 Total Consolidated Companies — International 1157209260291 AffiliatesVarious Locations3538494500497 Total Including Affiliates — International 4695703760788 Total Including Affiliates — Worldwide 81,6271,6081,6611,688  1 In November 2016, the company sold the Hawaii refinery.2 In September 2018, the company sold its interest in the Cape Town refinery. 3 In September 2017, the company sold the Burnaby, B.C. refinery.

At year-end 2018, the company supplied directly or through retailers and marketers approximately 7,900 Chevron- and Texaco- branded service stations, primarily in the southern and western states. Approximately 310 of these outlets are company-owned or -leased stations.Outside the United States, Chevron supplied directly or through retailers and marketers approximately 5,000 branded service stations, including affiliates. The company markets in Latin America using the Texaco brand. In 2018, Chevron continued to grow, expanding to 135 branded stations in northwestern Mexico at the end of the year. In the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East, the company uses the Caltex brand. The company also operates through affiliates under various brand names. In South Korea, the company operates through its 50 percent-owned affiliate, GS Caltex. In September 2018, the company completed the sale of its marketing and lubricants businesses in southern Africa and Botswana.Chevron markets commercial aviation fuel at approximately 90 airports worldwide. The company also markets an extensive line of lubricant and coolant products under the product names Havoline, Delo, Ursa, Meropa, Rando, Clarity and Taro in the United States and worldwide under the three brands: Chevron, Texaco and Caltex.Chemicals Operations Chevron Oronite Company develops, manufactures and markets performance additives for lubricating oils and fuels and conducts research and development for additive component and blended packages. At the end of 2018, the company manufactured, blended or conducted research at 10 locations around the world. In June 2018, a final investment decision was reached for a lubricant additive blending and shipping plant in Ningbo, China. Commercial production is anticipated to begin in 2021. Chevron owns a 50 percent interest in its Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) affiliate. CPChem produces olefins, polyolefins and alpha olefins and is a supplier of aromatics and polyethylene pipe, in addition to participating in the specialty chemical and specialty plastics markets. At the end of 2018, CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 28 manufacturing facilities and two research and development centers around the world. In March 2018, CPChem commenced operations of a new ethane cracker with an annual design capacity of 1.5 million metric tons of ethylene located at the Cedar Bayou facility, and reached design capacity during second quarter 2018. Chevron also maintains a role in the petrochemical business through the operations of GS Caltex, a 50 percent-owned affiliate. GS Caltex manufactures aromatics, including benzene, toluene and xylene. These base chemicals are used to produce a range of products, including adhesives, plastics and textile fibers. GS Caltex also produces polypropylene, which is used to make automotive and home appliance parts, food packaging, laboratory equipment and textiles.GS Caltex expects to reach a final investment decision in first quarter 2019 to build an olefins mixed-feed cracker and polyethylene unit within the existing refining and aromatics facilities in Yeosu, South Korea.Transportation Pipelines Chevron owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and product pipelines and other infrastructure assets in the United States. In addition, Chevron operates pipelines for its 50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate. The company also has direct and indirect interests in other U.S. and international pipelines. Refer to pages 11 through 13 in the Upstream section for information on the West African Gas Pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline, the Western Route Export Pipeline and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Shipping The company's marine fleet includes both U.S. and foreign flagged vessels. The operated fleet consists of conventional crude tankers, product carriers, and LNG carriers. These vessels transport crude oil, LNG, refined products and feedstocks in support of the company's global upstream and downstream businesses. Other Businesses Research and Technology Chevron's energy technology organization supports upstream and downstream businesses. The company conducts research, develops and qualifies technology, and provides technical services and competency development. The disciplines cover earth sciences, reservoir and production engineering, drilling and completions, facilities engineering, manufacturing, process technology, catalysis, technical computing and health, environment and safety.Chevron's information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, cybersecurity and network technology to provide a digital infrastructure to enable Chevron’s global operations and business processes. In 2018, Chevron joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative and separately launched the Chevron Future Energy Fund. Both initiatives invest in technology designed to economically lower emissions. 17Chevron's technology ventures company supports Chevron's upstream and downstream businesses by bridging the gap between business unit needs and emerging technology solutions developed externally in areas of emerging materials, water management, information technology, power systems and production enhancement.Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain. Refer to Note 26 on page 89 for a summary of the company's research and development expenses. Environmental Protection The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. To complement the company’s capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project, which has the objective to further develop the industry’s capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. The company is committed to improving energy efficiency in its day-to-day operations and is required to comply with the greenhouse gas-related laws and regulations to which it is subject. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 18 through 21 for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevron’s business.Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 43 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2018 environmental expenditures. Refer to page 43 and Note 23 beginning on page 86 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Item 1A. Risk FactorsChevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the company's control and could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company’s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends.The scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects 18for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the company’s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. The company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.Chevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.Cyberattacks targeting Chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron's cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company’s information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. The company has limited control and visibility over such third-party IT systems. Cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations.The company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. 19For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page 70.The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition. Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevron’s business The company’s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations, trade, currency  exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with U.S. sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company's operations in certain countries. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability.Regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase Chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products In the years ahead, companies in the energy industry, like Chevron, may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to GHG emissions.  Like any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company’s oil and gas resources economically infeasible.  Although the IEA’s World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation, if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the company’s products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition.International agreements and national, regional and state legislation (e.g., California AB32, SB32 and AB398) and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In some jurisdictions, the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as, for example, via a carbon tax (e.g., Singapore and Canada) or via a cap-and-trade program (e.g., Mexico and China). The landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-assessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate.GHG emissions-related laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbon-based products, make the company’s products more expensive, adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources, and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes, revenues and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among others, those associated with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of 20crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products, as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the company’s control. In addition, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against the company.Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. Additionally, the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the company’s activities in it and market conditions.The ultimate effect of international agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions on the company’s financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes.Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the company’s periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the company’s business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2. PropertiesThe location and character of the company’s crude oil and natural gas properties and its refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals facilities are described beginning on page 3 under Item 1. Business. Information required by Subpart 1200 of Regulation S-K (“Disclosure by Registrants Engaged in Oil and Gas Producing Activities”) is also contained in Item 1 and in Tables I through VII on pages 91 through 101. Note 17, “Properties, Plant and Equipment,” to the company’s financial statements is on page 77.Item 3. Legal ProceedingsGovernmental Proceedings The following is a description of legal proceedings that the company has determined to disclose for this reporting period that involve governmental authorities and certain monetary sanctions under federal, state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment. As previously disclosed, on August 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the Chevron refinery in Richmond, California. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued alleged findings of violation related to the incident on 21December 17, 2013, pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act Risk Management Plan program (RMP). Following the Richmond incident, EPA also conducted RMP inspections at Chevron’s refineries in El Segundo, California; Pascagoula, Mississippi; Kapolei, Hawaii; and Salt Lake City, Utah. On October 24, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) lodged with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California a consent decree executed by Chevron, DOJ, EPA, and the State of Mississippi that resolves all of EPA’s alleged findings of violation related to the Richmond incident and subsequent RMP inspections. The consent decree includes the payment of a civil penalty of $2.95 million and the funding of supplemental environmental projects totaling $10 million. Chevron also agreed, as part of the consent decree, to investments in process safety enhancements at its current refineries, estimated at $150 million, a portion of which has already been spent. The consent decree is pending court approval. Chevron facilities within the jurisdiction of California’s Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) currently have multiple outstanding Notices of Violation (NOVs) issued by BAAQMD. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. As previously disclosed, on June 26, 2018, Chevron received a proposal from the BAAQMD seeking to collectively resolve certain NOVs issued between 2015 and 2017 to Chevron’s Richmond Refinery.  On November 5, 2018, Chevron and the BAAQMD entered into a settlement agreement to resolve allegations in the disputed NOVs for a civil penalty of $222,000.Chevron facilities within the jurisdiction of California’s South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) currently have multiple outstanding NOVs issued by SCAQMD. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.Other Proceedings Information related to other legal proceedings is included beginning on page 70 in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Item 4.

Business Environment and Outlook Chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control. In the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. It is the company's objective to deliver competitive results and stockholder value in any business environment. Periods of sustained lower prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance. The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Note 16 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years.Refer to the "Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information" on page 2 and to "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 18 through 21 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition. The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. The company's asset sale program for 2018 through 2020 is targeting before-tax proceeds of $5-10 billion. Proceeds related to asset sales were $2.0 billion in 2018.28Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other producers, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax and other applicable laws and regulations.The company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. However, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. Modest cost pressures continue in rig-related services across North America unconventional markets. Cost pressures have softened in well completion activity particularly in the Permian Basin, but are expected to rise when pipeline takeaway constraints are resolved in late 2019.  International and offshore markets are showing indications of increased activity levels with limited cost pressures to date.Capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors.The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The Brent price averaged $71 per barrel for the full-year 2018, compared to $54 in 2017. Crude oil prices increased throughout the first three quarters of 2018 due to solid demand combined with OPEC production cuts. Late in the year, continued U.S. shale growth, combined with unexpected short-term waivers from Iranian sanctions granted to several countries, led to excess supply conditions, resulting in a decrease in oil prices. In response, OPEC agreed to new production cuts in early December. As of mid-February 2019, the Brent price was $64 per barrel. The WTI price averaged $65 per barrel for the full-year 2018, compared to $51 in 2017. WTI traded at a discount to Brent throughout 2018. Differentials to Brent have ranged between $3 to $10 in 2018 primarily due to pipeline infrastructure constraints which have restricted flows on the inland crude to export outlets on the Gulf Coast, in addition to variability in 29Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsother factors impacting supply and demand of each benchmark crude. As of mid-February 2019, the WTI price was $54 per barrel.Chevron has interests in the production of heavy crude oil in California, Indonesia, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in Angola, China and the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea. (See page 37 for the company’s average U.S. and international crude oil sales prices.)In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in regional markets. Fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the United States are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and stored in North America. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $3.12 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2018, compared with $2.97 during 2017. As of mid-February 2019, the Henry Hub spot price was $2.61 per MCF. Outside the United States, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. Chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in many locations. In some locations, Chevron has invested in long-term projects to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. The company's long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the Asian spot LNG market.  The Asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for LNG in the Pacific Basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices. International natural gas realizations averaged $6.29 per MCF during 2018, compared with $4.62 per MCF during 2017. (See page 37 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.)The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2018 averaged 2.930 million barrels per day. About one-sixth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2018 occurred in the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Nigeria, Republic of Congo and Venezuela. OPEC quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production in 2018 or 2017. The company estimates that net oil-equivalent production in 2019 will grow 4 to 7 percent compared to 2018, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2019 asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. The company has increased its investment emphasis on short-cycle projects.30Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIn the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in May 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits. Net oil-equivalent production in the Partitioned Zone in 2014 was 81,000 barrels per day. During 2015, net oil-equivalent production averaged 28,000 barrels per day. As of early 2019, production remains shut in and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The financial effects from the loss of production in 2018 were not significant and are not expected to be significant in 2019.Chevron has interests in Venezuelan crude oil production assets operated by independent equity affiliates. During 2018, net oil equivalent production in Venezuela averaged 44,000 barrels per day. The operating environment in Venezuela has been deteriorating for some time. In January 2019, the United States government issued sanctions against the Venezuelan national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA), which is the company’s partner in the equity affiliates. The equity affiliates continue to operate, and the company is conducting its business pursuant to general licenses issued coincident with the new sanctions. Future events could result in the environment in Venezuela becoming more challenged, which could lead to increased business disruption and volatility in the associated financial results.Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 12.1 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end 2018, an increase of 3 percent from year-end 2017. The reserve replacement ratio in 2018 was 136 percent. Refer to Table V beginning on page 95 for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2016 and each year-end from 2016 through 2018, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018.Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages 32 through 34 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets and changes in tax laws and regulations.The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas.Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages 32 through 34 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies. Operating Developments Key operating developments and other events during 2018 and early 2019 included the following:Upstream Australia Achieved start-up of Train 2 at the Wheatstone LNG Project. United States Produced first oil from the Big Foot Project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.Downstream South Africa and Botswana Completed the sale of refining, marketing and lubricant assets.United States Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), the company’s 50 percent-owned affiliate, commenced operations of a new ethane cracker at its Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas.31Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsUnited States In January 2019, Chevron announced it has signed an agreement to acquire a 110,000 barrels per day refinery located in Pasadena, Texas. The transaction is expected to close later in the first-half of 2019, subject to regulatory approvals.Other Common Stock Dividends The 2018 annual dividend was $4.48 per share, making 2018 the 31st consecutive year that the company increased its annual per share dividend payout. In January 2019, the company's Board of Directors approved a $0.07 per share increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share, payable in March 2019, representing an increase of 6 percent.Common Stock Repurchase Program The company purchased $1.75 billion of its common stock in 2018 under its stock repurchase program. Results of Operations The following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the company’s business segments – Upstream and Downstream – as well as for “All Other.” Earnings are also presented for the U.S. and international geographic areas of the Upstream and Downstream business segments. Refer to Note 13, beginning on page 66, for a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments.” This section should also be read in conjunction with the discussion in “Business Environment and Outlook” on pages 28 through 31.U.S. Upstream Millions of dollars2018  2017 2016Earnings$3,278  $3,640 $(2,054)U.S. upstream earnings were $3.28 billion in 2018, compared with $3.64 billion in 2017. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the absence of the 2017 benefit from U.S. tax reform of $3.33 billion, higher other tax items of $160 million and higher exploration expense of $350 million, partially offset by higher crude oil realizations of $2.45 billion and higher crude oil production of $1.12 billion.U.S. upstream earnings were $3.64 billion in 2017, compared with a loss of $2.05 billion from 2016. The improvement in earnings reflected a benefit of $3.33 billion from U.S. tax reform, higher crude oil and natural gas realizations of $1.3 billion and lower depreciation expenses of $650 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in impairments and other asset write-offs. Lower operating expenses of $140 million also contributed to the improvement.The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2018 was $58.17 per barrel, compared with $44.53 in 2017 and $35.00 in 2016. The average natural gas realization was $1.86 per thousand cubic feet in 2018, compared with $2.10 in 2017 and $1.59 in 2016.Net oil-equivalent production in 2018 averaged 791,000 barrels per day, up 16 percent from 2017 and up 14 percent from 2016. Between 2018 and 2017, production increases from shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New 32Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsMexico and base business in the Gulf of Mexico were partially offset by the effect of asset sales of 35,000 barrels per day. Between 2017 and 2016, production increases from shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and base business in the Gulf of Mexico were more than offset by the effect of asset sales of 59,000 barrels per day and normal field declines.The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2018 averaged 618,000 barrels per day, up 19 percent from 2017 and up 23 percent from 2016. Net natural gas production averaged 1.03 billion cubic feet per day in 2018, up 7 percent from 2017 and down 8 percent from 2016.

International UpstreamMillions of dollars2018  2017 2016Earnings*$10,038  $4,510 $(483)*Includes foreign currency effects:$545  $(456) $122International upstream earnings were $10.04 billion in 2018, compared with $4.51 billion in 2017. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas realizations of $3.38 billion and $1.38 billion, respectively, higher  natural gas sales volumes of $1.67 billion, partially offset by lower gains on asset sales of $640 million, higher depreciation, operating and tax expenses of $470 million, $460 million and $230 million, respectively. Foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of $1.00 billion between periods. International upstream earnings were $4.51 billion in 2017, compared with a loss of $483 million in 2016. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil realizations of $2.59 billion, higher natural gas sales volumes of $1.22 billion, higher gains on asset sales of $750 million, and lower operating expenses of $410 million. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $578 million between periods. The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2018 was $64.25 per barrel, compared with $49.46 in 2017 and $38.61 in 2016. The average natural gas realization was $6.29 per thousand cubic feet in 2018, compared with $4.62 and $4.02 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.International net oil-equivalent production was 2.14 million barrels per day in 2018, up 4 percent from 2017 and up 12 percent from 2016. Between 2018 and 2017, production increases from major capital projects, primarily Wheatstone and Gorgon in Australia, were partially offset by normal field declines, production entitlement effects and the impact of asset sales of 14,000 barrels per day. Between 2017 and 2016, production increases from major capital projects and lower planned maintenance-related downtime were partially offset by production entitlement effects in several locations and normal field declines.The net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 1.16 million barrels per day in 2018, down 3 percent from 2017 and down 4 percent from 2016. International net natural gas production of 5.86 billion cubic feet per day in 2018 was up 16 percent from 2017 and up 42 percent from 2016.Refer to the “Selected Operating Data” table, on page 37, for a three-year comparison of international production volumes. U.S. Downstream Millions of dollars2018  2017 2016Earnings$2,103  $2,938 $1,307U.S. downstream operations earned $2.10 billion in 2018, compared with $2.94 billion in 2017. The decrease was mainly due to the absence of the 2017 benefit from U.S. tax reform of $1.16 billion and higher operating expenses of $420 million, primarily due to planned refinery turnaround activity. Partially offsetting these were higher margins on refined product sales of $380 million and higher equity earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem of $320 million, primarily reflecting the absence of impacts from Hurricane Harvey.U.S. downstream operations earned $2.94 billion in 2017, compared with $1.31 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $1.16 billion benefit from U.S. tax reform, higher margins on refined product sales of $380 million, lower operating expenses of $160 million, and the absence of an asset impairment of $110 million. Partially offsetting this increase were lower gains on asset sales of $90 million and lower earnings from the 50 percent-owned CPChem of $70 million, primarily reflecting the impacts from Hurricane Harvey.33Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsTotal refined product sales of 1.22 million barrels per day in 2018 were up 2 percent from 2017. Sales were 1.20 million barrels per day in 2017, a decrease of 1 percent from 2016, primarily due to the divestment of Hawaii refining and marketing assets in fourth quarter 2016. Refer to the “Selected Operating Data” table on page 37 for a three-year comparison of sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery input volumes.International Downstream Millions of dollars2018  2017 2016Earnings*$1,695  $2,276 $2,128*Includes foreign currency effects:$71  $(90) $(25)International downstream earned $1.70 billion in 2018, compared with $2.28 billion in 2017. The decrease in earnings was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales of $590 million and lower gains on asset sales of $470 million, partially offset by lower operating expenses of $290 million. The sale of the company's Canadian refining and marketing business in third quarter 2017 and the sale of the southern Africa refining and marketing business in third quarter 2018 primarily contributed to the lower margins and operating expenses. Foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of $161 million between periods.International downstream earned $2.28 billion in 2017, compared with $2.13 billion in 2016. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher gains on asset sales of $360 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $140 million. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $65 million between periods.Total refined product sales of 1.44 million barrels per day in 2018 were down 4 percent from 2017, primarily due to the sales of the company's Canadian refining and marketing assets in third quarter 2017 and southern Africa refining and marketing business in third quarter 2018. Sales of 1.49 million barrels per day in 2017 were up 2 percent from 2016, primarily due to higher diesel and jet fuel sales.

Net charges in 2018 decreased $1.88 billion from 2017. The change between periods was mainly due to absence of a prior year tax charge of $2.47 billion related to U.S. tax reform, lower employee expenses and the absence of a reclamation related charge for a former mining asset, partially offset by other unfavorable tax items and higher interest expense. Foreign currency effects increased net charges by $105 million between periods. Net charges in 2017 increased $2.77 billion from 2016, mainly due to higher tax items, primarily reflecting a $2.47 billion expense from U.S. tax reform, higher interest expense and a reclamation related charge for a former mining asset, partially offset by lower employee expense. Foreign currency effects decreased net charges by $139 million between periods.Consolidated Statement of Income Comparative amounts for certain income statement categories are shown below:Millions of dollars2018  2017 2016Sales and other operating revenues$158,902  $134,674 $110,215Sales and other operating revenues increased in 2018 mainly due to higher crude oil, refined product and natural gas prices. The increase between 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil prices, higher crude oil volumes, and higher natural gas volumes. Beginning in 2018, excise, value-added and similar taxes collected on behalf of third parties were no longer included in "Sales and other operating revenue", but were netted in "Taxes other than on income" in accordance with ASU 2014-09. 2017 and 2016 include $7.19 billion and $6.91 billion, respectively, in taxes collected on behalf of third parties.34Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsMillions of dollars2018  2017 2016Income from equity affiliates$6,327  $4,438 $2,661Income from equity affiliates increased in 2018 from 2017 mainly due to higher upstream-related earnings from Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan, Petroboscan and Petropiar in Venezuela, and higher downstream-related earnings from CPChem.Income from equity affiliates increased in 2017 from 2016 mainly due to higher upstream-related earnings from Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan and Angola LNG.

This line was added to the Consolidated Statement of Income in accordance with the adoption of ASU 2017-07.Millions of dollars2018  2017 2016Income tax expense (benefit) $5,715  $(48) $(1,729) The increase in income tax expense in 2018 of $5.76 billion is due to the increase in total income before tax for the company of $11.35 billion and the absence of the remeasurement benefits from U.S. tax reform recognized in 2017.U.S. income before tax increased from a loss of $441 million in 2017 to a profit of $4.73 billion in 2018. This increase in earnings before tax was primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices. The U.S. tax charge increased by $3.69 billion between year-over-year periods from a $2.97 billion benefit in 2017 to a $724 million charge in 2018. 2017 included a $2.02 billion benefit from U.S. tax reform, which primarily reflected the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. International income before tax increased from $9.66 billion in 2017 to $15.84 billion in 2018. This $6.18 billion increase was primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices. The higher crude prices primarily drove the $2.06 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $2.93 billion in 2017 to $4.99 billion in 2018. The decline in income tax benefit in 2017 of $1.68 billion is due to the increase in total income before tax for the company of $11.38 billion and the remeasurement impacts of U.S. tax reform. U.S. losses before tax decreased from a loss of $4.32 billion in 2016 to a loss of $441 million in 2017. This decrease in losses before tax was primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices. The U.S. tax benefit increased by $650 million between year-over-year periods from $2.32 billion in 2016 to $2.97 billion in 2017. The U.S. tax benefit for 2017 included a $2.02 billion benefit from U.S. tax reform, which primarily reflected the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a reduction of $1.37 billion as result of the impact of a decrease in losses before tax of $3.88 billion.International income before tax increased from $2.16 billion in 2016 to $9.66 billion in 2017. This $7.50 billion increase was primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices and gains on asset sales primarily in Indonesia and Canada. The higher crude prices primarily drove the $2.34 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $588 million in 2016 to $2.93 billion in 2017.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Time Deposits Total balances were $10.3 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $30.6 billion, compared with $20.3 billion in 2017 and $12.7 billion in 2016, reflecting higher crude oil prices and increased production. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $1.0 billion in 2018, $1.0 billion in 2017 and $0.9 billion in 2016. Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.0 billion in 2018, $4.9 billion in 2017 and $3.2 billion in 2016.Restricted cash of $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream abandonment activities, tax payments, funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and refundable deposits related to pending asset sales. Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $8.5 billion in 2018, $8.1 billion in 2017 and $8.0 billion in 2016. Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Total debt and capital lease obligations were $34.5 billion at December 31, 2018, down from $38.8 billion at year-end 2017. The $4.3 billion decrease in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2018 was primarily due to the repayment of long-term notes totaling $6.7 billion as they matured during 2018, partly offset by an increase in commercial paper. The company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $15.6 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $15.2 billion at year-end 2017. Of these amounts, $9.9 billion and $10.0 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2018 and 2017, respectively.At year-end 2018, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2019, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. Chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in May 2021 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.38Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation and Texaco Capital Inc. All of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA by Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital program and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company can also modify capital spending plans and discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 18, Short-Term Debt, on page 77.Common Stock Repurchase Program In July 2010, the Board of Directors approved an ongoing stock repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. From the inception of the program through the end of 2018, the company purchased 195.8 million shares for $21.75 billion, including 14.9 million shares for $1.75 billion in the second half 2018. On February 1, 2019, the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 billion and no set term limits. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company's shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time.Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Capital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: 2018   2017   2016 Millions of dollarsU.S.Int’l.Total  U.S.Int’l.Total  U.S.Int’l.TotalUpstream$7,128$10,529$17,657  $5,145$11,243$16,388  $4,713$15,403$20,116Downstream1,5826112,193  1,6565342,190  1,5455272,072All Other24313256  2394243  2355240Total$8,953$11,153$20,106  $7,040$11,781$18,821  $6,493$15,935$22,428Total, Excluding Equity in Affiliates$8,651$5,739$14,390  $6,295$7,783$14,078  $5,456$13,202$18,65839Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsTotal expenditures for 2018 were $20.1 billion, including $5.7 billion for the company’s share of equity-affiliate expenditures, which did not require cash outlays by the company. In 2017 and 2016, expenditures were $18.8 billion and $22.4 billion, respectively, including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $4.7 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. Of the $20.1 billion of expenditures in 2018, 88 percent, or $17.7 billion, related to upstream activities. Approximately 87 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2017 and 90 percent in 2016. International upstream accounted for 60 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2018, 69 percent in 2017 and 77 percent in 2016. The company estimates that 2019 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $20 billion, including $6.3 billion of spending by affiliates. This is in line with 2018 expenditures, and reflects a robust portfolio of upstream and downstream investments, highlighted by the company's Permian Basin position, and additional shale and tight development in other basins. Approximately 87 percent of the total, or $17.3 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities. Approximately $10.4 billion of planned upstream capital spending relates to base producing assets, including $3.6 billion for the Permian and $1.6 billion for other shale and tight rock investments. Approximately $5.1 billion of the upstream program is planned for major capital projects underway, including $4.3 billion associated with the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. Global exploration funding is expected to be about $1.3 billion. Remaining upstream spend is budgeted for early stage projects supporting potential future developments. The company will continue to monitor crude oil market conditions and expects to further restrict capital outlays should oil price conditions deteriorate.Worldwide downstream spending in 2019 is estimated to be $2.5 billion, with $1.5 billion estimated for projects in the United States. Investments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2019 are budgeted at $0.2 billion. Noncontrolling Interests The company had noncontrolling interests of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. Distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $91 million and $78 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Pension Obligations Information related to pension plan contributions is included beginning on page 81 in Note 22, Employee Benefit Plans, under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.” Financial Ratios  At December 31   2018   2017  2016 Current Ratio1.3   1.0  0.9 Interest Coverage Ratio23.4   10.7  (2.6) Debt Ratio18.2%  20.7% 24.1%Current Ratio Current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2018, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $5.1 billion. Interest Coverage Ratio Income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2018 was higher than 2017 and 2016 due to higher income. Debt Ratio Total debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders' Equity, which indicates the company’s leverage. The company's debt ratio was 18.2 percent at year-end 2018, compared with 20.7 percent and 24.1 percent at year-end 2017 and 2016, respectively.Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Guarantees and Other Contingencies Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements Information related to these matters is included on page 86 in Note 23, Other Contingencies and Commitments. 40Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations:  Payments Due by Period Millions of dollarsTotal1 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 After 2023On Balance Sheet:2         Short-Term Debt3$5,727 $5,727 $— $— $—Long-Term Debt3, 428,630 — 17,226 7,053 4,351Noncancelable Capital Lease Obligations233 30 39 32 132Interest4,736 801 1,278 936 1,721Off Balance Sheet:         Noncancelable Operating Lease Obligations2,159 540 870 408 341Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements5 7,797 773 1,523 1,208 4,293Other Unconditional Purchase Obligations52,526 565 963 569 4291 Excludes contributions for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans.

Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk The market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A. Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2018. The company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies. The company's risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors. Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2018 was not material to the company's results of operations. The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value, at the 95% confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market 41Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsconditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company's primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was not material to the company's cash flows or results of operations. Foreign Currency The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2018.Interest Rates The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2018, the company had no interest rate swaps. Transactions With Related Parties Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” on page 70, in Note 14, Investments and Advances, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party. Litigation and Other Contingencies MTBE Information related to methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) matters is included on page 70 in Note 15 under the heading “MTBE.” Ecuador Information related to Ecuador matters is included in Note 15 under the heading “Ecuador,” beginning on page 70. Environmental The following table displays the annual changes to the company’s before-tax environmental remediation reserves, including those for federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws. Millions of dollars2018 2017 2016Balance at January 1$1,429 $1,467 $1,578Net Additions197 323 260Expenditures(299) (361) (371)Balance at December 31$1,327 $1,429 $1,467The company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately $14.1 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2018 related primarily to upstream properties. For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. Refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company's 2018 environmental expenditures. Refer to Note 23 on page 86 for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to Note 24 on page 88 for additional discussion of the company's asset retirement obligations.Suspended Wells Information related to suspended wells is included in Note 20, Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells, beginning on page 79.Income Taxes Information related to income tax contingencies is included on pages 74 through 76 in Note 16 and page 86 in Note 23 under the heading “Income Taxes.”Other Contingencies Information related to other contingencies is included on page 87 in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “Other Contingencies.” 42Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsEnvironmental Matters The company is subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. For example, international agreements and national, regional, and state legislation (e.g., California AB32, SB32 and AB398) and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the national, state and local levels. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 18 through 21 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition. Most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company's liquidity or financial position.Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2018 at approximately $2.0 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $0.5 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.5 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites.For 2019, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.5 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein: 1.the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and2.the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is material.The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows: 43Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOil and Gas Reserves Crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs. The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron's Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:1.Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During 2018, Chevron's UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $14.8 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2018 were 6.1 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD&A in 2018 would have increased by approximately $800 million. 2.Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below.Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,” beginning on page 95, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ended December 31, 2018, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves” on page 101 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018. This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1, beginning on page 55, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 17 on page 77 and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," beginning on page 55.The company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company's crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision 44Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsis made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets’ associated carrying values.Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable. No individually material impairments of PP&E or Investments were recorded for 2018 or 2017. The company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties in Brazil and the United States during 2016 due to reservoir performance and lower crude oil prices. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets. Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2018 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 24 on page 88 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 22, beginning on page 81, includes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included on page 83 in Note 22 under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company's control.For 2018, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.7 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 3.0 percent for U.S. pension plans. The actual return for 2018 was negative. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2018, actual asset returns averaged 7.9 percent for these plans. Additionally, with the exception of three years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for these plans equaled or exceeded 6.75 percent during each year.Total pension expense for 2018 was $1.1 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 63 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2018 by approximately $83 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2018 by approximately $271 million. The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2018, was a net liability of approximately $3.9 billion. An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2018, the company used a discount rate of 4.2 percent to measure the obligations for the U.S. pension plans. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $339 million, and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion. 45Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFor the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2018 was $123 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2018, was $2.4 billion. For the main U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 3.8 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 3.2 percent to measure expense in 2018, and a 4.3 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31, 2018. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2018 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2018. For information on the sensitivity of the health care cost-trend rate, refer to page 83 in Note 22 under the heading “Other Benefit Assumptions.” Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 82 in Note 22 for a description of the method used to amortize the $4.6 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2018, and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2019. In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page 85 in Note 22 under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.” Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 23 beginning on page 86. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2018. An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

The statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and fairly represent the transactions and financial position of the company. The financial statements include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.As stated in its report included herein, the independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).The Board of Directors of Chevron has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are not officers or employees of the company. The Audit Committee meets regularly with members of management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. Both the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm have free and direct access to the Audit Committee without the presence of management.The company's management has evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2018. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the company's disclosure controls are effective in ensuring that information required to be recorded, processed, summarized and reported, are done within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.     Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  The company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, the company’s management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.                                   Michael K. Wirth Patricia E. Yarrington Jeanette L. Ourada  Chairman of the Board Vice President Vice President  and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Comptroller         February 22, 2019               48    Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Chevron Corporation:  Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.  Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.    San Francisco, California  February 22, 2019  We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1935.  49Consolidated Statement of Income Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts           Year ended December 31    2018  2017 2016  Revenues and Other Income        Sales and other operating revenues1$158,902  $134,674 $110,215  Income from equity affiliates6,327  4,438 2,661  Other income1,110  2,610 1,596  Total Revenues and Other Income166,339  141,722114,472  Costs and Other Deductions        Purchased crude oil and products94,578  75,765 59,321  Operating expenses220,544  19,127 19,902  Selling, general and administrative expenses23,838  4,110 4,305  Exploration expenses1,210  864 1,033  Depreciation, depletion and amortization19,419 19,34919,457  Taxes other than on income14,867  12,331 11,668  Interest and debt expense748  307 201  Other components of net periodic benefit costs2560  648 745  Total Costs and Other Deductions145,764  132,501 116,632  Income (Loss) Before Income Tax Expense20,575  9,221 (2,160)  Income Tax Expense (Benefit)5,715  (48) (1,729)  Net Income (Loss)14,860  9,269 (431)  Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests36  74 66  Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation$14,824  $9,195 $(497)  Per Share of Common Stock        Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation        - Basic$7.81  $4.88 $(0.27)  - Diluted$7.74  $4.85 $(0.27)  1  2017 and 2016 include excise, value-added and similar taxes of  $7,189 and $6,905, respectively, collected on behalf of third parties.   Beginning in 2018, these taxes are netted in "Taxes other than on income" in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09.   Refer to Note 25, "Revenue" beginning on page 88.  2 2017 and 2016 adjusted to conform to ASU 2017-07.

These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values. Noncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Equity.Fair Value Measurements The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.Derivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet. Short-Term Investments All short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the company’s cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as “Cash equivalents.” Bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days are reported as “Time deposits.” The balance of short-term investments is reported as “Marketable securities” and is marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in “Other comprehensive income.” 55Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsInventories Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials, supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value. Properties, Plant and Equipment The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 20, beginning on page 79, for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs. Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties, the company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense. Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 8, beginning on page 63, relating to fair value measurements. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 24, on page 88, relating to AROs. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed. The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets. Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Other income.” Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized. Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized. Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO 56Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsis made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 24, on page 88, for a discussion of the company’s AROs.For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured. Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the Consolidated Statement of Equity. Revenue Recognition The company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products  as a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer. Payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery. The company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performance obligation, and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized. Revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer. The company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include discounts and allowances. Until market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts, the transaction price included in revenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely outcome. Discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain multiple products, an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. The company includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a net basis in "Taxes other than on income" on the Consolidated Statement of Income, on page 50. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemicals products, and all other sources were recorded when title passed to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable.   Revenues from natural gas production from properties in which Chevron has an interest with other producers were generally recognized using the entitlement method. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer were presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income.Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. The company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights, which have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. In addition, performance shares granted under the company's LTIP will vest at the end of the three-year performance period. For awards granted under the company's LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each January 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on January 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria. The company amortizes these awards on a straight-line basis.57Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsNote 2 Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses The change in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses (AOCL) presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the impact of significant amounts reclassified from AOCL on information presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018, are reflected in the table below. Currency Translation Adjustments Unrealized Holding Gains (Losses) on Securities Derivatives Defined Benefit Plans TotalBalance at December 31, 2015$(140) $(29) $(2) $(4,120) $(4,291)Components of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)1:             Before Reclassifications(22) 27 — (161) (156)    Reclassifications2— — — 604 604Net Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)(22) 27 — 443 448Balance at December 31, 2016$(162) $(2) $(2) $(3,677) $(3,843)Components of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)1:             Before Reclassifications57 (3) — (310) (256)    Reclassifications2— — — 510 510Net Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)57 (3) — 200 254Balance at December 31, 2017$(105) $(5) $(2) $(3,477) $(3,589)Components of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)1:             Before Reclassifications(19) (5) — 28 4    Reclassifications2— — — 603 603Net Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)(19) (5) — 631 607Stranded Tax Reclassification to Retained Earnings3— — — (562) (562)Balance at December 31, 2018$(124) $(10) $(2) $(3,408) $(3,544)1 All amounts are net of tax.2 Refer to Note 22 beginning on page 81, for reclassified components totaling $779 that are included in employee benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Purchases totaled $1,751, $1 and $2 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The company purchased 14.9 million shares under its stock repurchase plan for $1,750 in 2018. No shares were repurchased under the plan in 2017 or 2016. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes changes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet that did not affect cash. "Depreciation, depletion and amortization," "Dry hole expense" and "Deferred income tax provision" collectively include approximately $1.1 billion in non-cash reductions to properties, plant and equipment recorded in 2018 relating to impairments and other non-cash charges.Refer also to Note 24, on page 88, for a discussion of revisions to the company’s AROs that also did not involve cash receipts or payments for the three years ending December 31, 2018. 59Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsThe major components of “Capital expenditures” and the reconciliation of this amount to the reported capital and exploratory expenditures, including equity affiliates, are presented in the following table:  Year ended December 31  2018  2017 2016Additions to properties, plant and equipment *$13,384  $13,222 $17,742Additions to investments65  25 55Current-year dry hole expenditures344  157 313Payments for other liabilities and assets, net(1)  — (1)Capital expenditures13,792  13,404 18,109Expensed exploration expenditures523  666 544Assets acquired through capital lease obligations and other financing obligations75  8 5Capital and exploratory expenditures, excluding equity affiliates14,390  14,078 18,658Company's share of expenditures by equity affiliates5,716  4,743 3,770Capital and exploratory expenditures, including equity affiliates$20,106  $18,821 $22,428* Excludes non-cash additions of $25 in 2018, $1,183 in 2017 and $56 in 2016.On January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) 2016-15 and 2016-18, which require retrospective adjustment of prior periods in the Statement of Cash Flows.In addition to other requirements, ASU 2016-15 specifies new standards for the classification of distributions from equity affiliates. In adopting these new standards, Chevron utilized the cumulative earnings approach to evaluate returns on and returns of investment from equity affiliates. For the year ended 2017 and 2016, a total of $166 and $322, respectively, was reclassified from “Distributions less than income from equity affiliates” to “Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment.”Adoption of ASU 2016-18 requires the inclusion of restricted cash and associated changes in restricted cash in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The impact of ASU 2016-18 is captured across several line items in the Statement of Cash Flows, including “Net decrease (increase) in operating working capital,” “Decrease (increase) in other deferred charges,” and “Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment” with associated net changes captured in both “Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities” and “Net Cash Used for Investing Activities.” The line item “Net sales (purchases) of other short-term investments” was removed in conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2016-18. The table below quantifies the beginning and ending balances of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet: Year ended December 31  2018  2017 2016 2015Cash and cash equivalents$9,342  $4,813 $6,988 $11,022Restricted cash included in "Prepaid expenses and other current assets"341  405 488 196Restricted cash included in "Deferred charges and other assets"798  725 938 904Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$10,481  $5,943 $8,414 $12,122 Note 4 New Accounting StandardsRevenue Recognition (Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers On January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2014-09 and its related amendments using the modified retrospective transition method, which did not require the restatement of prior periods. The impact of the adoption of the standard did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements. For additional information on the company’s revenue, refer to Note 25 beginning on page 88.Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20) On January 1, 2018, the company adopted ASU 2017-05, which provides clarification regarding the guidance on accounting for the derecognition of nonfinancial assets. The adoption of the standard had no impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) Effective January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2017-07 on a retrospective basis. The standard requires the disaggregation of the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost and allows only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. The effects of retrospective adoption on the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2017 and 2016 were to move $310 and $366 from "Operating expenses" and $338 and $379 from "Selling, general and administrative expenses" to "Other components of net periodic benefits cost," respectively.60Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsStatement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments Effective January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2016-15 on a retrospective basis. The standard provides clarification on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. For additional information, refer to Note 3 beginning on page 59.Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Restricted Cash Effective January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2016-18 on a retrospective basis. The standard requires an entity to explain the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and to provide a reconciliation to the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are not separately presented or are presented in more than one line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The company’s restricted cash balances are now included in the beginning and ending balances on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. For additional information, refer to Note 3 beginning on page 59.Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In fourth quarter 2018, the company elected to early adopt ASU 2018-02, which permits the reclassification of stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of  U.S. tax reform. Accordingly, Chevron reclassified $562 from "Accumulated other comprehensive losses" to "Retained earnings" associated with the reduction of the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. In accordance with its accounting policy, the company releases stranded income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income in the period the underlying activity ceases to exist. ASU 2018-02 allowed for the reclassification of stranded tax effects as a result of the change in tax rates due to  U.S. tax reform to be recorded upon adoption of the ASU, rather than at the actual date that the underlying activity ceases to exist. For additional detail, refer to Note 2 beginning on page 58. Leases (Topic 842) In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, which became effective for the company January 1, 2019. The standard requires that lessees present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The company plans to elect the short-term lease exception provided for in the standard and therefore will only recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year. The company further intends to elect the option to apply the transition provisions of the new standard at the adoption date instead of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The company plans to elect the package of practical expedients to not re-evaluate existing lease contracts or lease classifications and therefore will not make changes to those leases already recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under ASC 840 until the leases are fully amortized, amended, or modified. In addition, the company will not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. The company intends to apply the land easement practical expedient. Chevron plans to elect the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant non-lease (i.e., service) components in addition to the lease component. The company will reclassify some contracts, currently not classified as leases, as operating leases under the new standard.  The company completed accounting policy and disclosure updates and system implementation necessary to meet the standard's requirements. The company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material impact on finance leases, which are currently referred to as capital leases. The company estimates that the operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are approximately $4 billion, as of January 1, 2019. The company expects the implementation of the standard will have a minimal impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which becomes effective for the company beginning January 1, 2020. The standard requires companies to use forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates.  The company is evaluating the effect of the standard on the company’s consolidated financial statements.61Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsNote 5 Lease Commitments Certain noncancelable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased assets are included as part of “Properties, plant and equipment, at cost” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such leasing arrangements involve crude oil production and processing equipment, vessels, office buildings, and other facilities. Other leases are classified as operating leases and are not capitalized. The payments on operating leases are recorded as expense.

Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2018. Derivatives The company records its derivative instruments – other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale – on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are 63Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsobtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information. Properties, Plant and Equipment  The company did not have any individually material impairments in 2018 or 2017.Investments and Advances The company did not have any individually material impairments of investments and advances in 2018 or 2017.

The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days or less and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $9,342 and $4,813 at December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. The instruments held in "Time deposits" are bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days and had carrying/fair values of $950 and zero at December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31, 2018. "Cash and cash equivalents” do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $1,139 and $1,130 at December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018, these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds related to certain upstream abandonment activities, tax payments and a financing program, which are reported in “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt, excluding capital lease obligations, of $18,706 and $23,477 at December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively, had estimated fair values of $18,729 and $23,943, respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is $17,858 and classified as Level 1. The fair value of other long-term debt is $871 and classified as Level 2.The carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2018 and 2017, were not material. Note 9 Financial and Derivative InstrumentsDerivative Commodity Instruments The company’s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. None of the company’s derivative instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the company’s affiliates make such designation. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities. 64Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsThe company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. Derivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are below: Consolidated Balance Sheet: Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments      At December 31Type of ContractBalance Sheet Classification2018  2017CommodityAccounts and notes receivable, net$279  $22CommodityLong-term receivables, net4  —Total assets at fair value$283  $22CommodityAccounts payable$12  $122CommodityDeferred credits and other noncurrent obligations—  2Total liabilities at fair value$12  $124Consolidated Statement of Income: The Effect of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments   Gain/(Loss) Type of DerivativeStatement ofYear ended December 31 ContractIncome Classification2018  2017 2016CommoditySales and other operating revenues$135  $(105) $(269)CommodityPurchased crude oil and products(33)  (9) (31)CommodityOther income3  (2) —  $105  $(116) $(300)The table below represents gross and net derivative assets and liabilities subject to netting agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Consolidated Balance Sheet: The Effect of Netting Derivative Assets and Liabilities  Gross Amounts Recognized Gross Amounts Offset Net Amounts Presented  Gross Amounts Not Offset Net AmountsAt December 31, 2018     Derivative Assets $3,685 $3,402 $283 $— $283Derivative Liabilities $3,414 $3,402 $12 $— $12At December 31, 2017          Derivative Assets $1,169 $1,147 $22 $— $22Derivative Liabilities $1,271 $1,147 $124 $— $124           Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for "a right of offset."  Concentrations of Credit Risk The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company’s short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies limit the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s counterparties in derivative instruments. The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company’s diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the company’s broad customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral instruments to support sales to customers. 65Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsNote 10 Assets Held for SaleAt December 31, 2018, the company classified $1,863 of net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are primarily associated with upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12 months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2018 were not material.Note 11 Equity Retained earnings at December 31, 2018 and 2017, included approximately $22,362 and $18,473, respectively, for the company’s share of undistributed earnings of equity affiliates. At December 31, 2018, about 78 million shares of Chevron’s common stock remained available for issuance from the 260 million shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan. In addition, 748,211 shares remain available for issuance from the 1,600,000 shares of the company’s common stock that were reserved for awards under the Chevron Corporation Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan. Note 12 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon “Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation” (“earnings”) and includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock units by certain officers and employees of the company. Diluted EPS includes the effects of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the company’s stock option programs (refer to Note 21, “Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation,” beginning on page 80).

Note 13Operating Segments and Geographic DataAlthough each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies. 66Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsThe company’s segments are managed by “segment managers” who report to the “chief operating decision maker” (CODM). The segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the company’s operations are reported as "International” (outside the United States). Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in “All Other.” Earnings by major operating area are presented in the following table:  Year ended December 31  2018  2017 2016Upstream         United States$3,278  $3,640 $(2,054)   International10,038  4,510 (483)Total Upstream13,316  8,150 (2,537)Downstream         United States2,103  2,938 1,307   International1,695  2,276 2,128Total Downstream3,798  5,214 3,435Total Segment Earnings17,114  13,364 898All Other         Interest expense(713)  (264) (168)   Interest income137  60 58   Other(1,714)  (3,965) (1,285)Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation$14,824  $9,195 $(497)Segment Assets Segment assets do not include intercompany investments or receivables.

For certain equity affiliates, Chevron pays its share of some income taxes directly. For such affiliates, the equity in earnings does not include these taxes, which are reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income as “Income tax expense.” Investments and Advances  Equity in Earnings  At December 31  Year ended December 31  2018 2017 2018 2017 2016Upstream         Tengizchevroil$16,017 $13,121 $3,614 $2,581 $1,380Petropiar1,361 1,152 317 175 326Petroboscan1,315 1,080 357 154 (133)Caspian Pipeline Consortium1,022 1,151 170 155 145Angola LNG Limited2,496 2,625 172 27 (282)Other1,541 1,714 19 104 (193)Total Upstream23,752 20,843 4,649 3,196 1,243Downstream         Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC6,218 6,200 1,034 723 840GS Caltex Corporation3,924 3,826 373 290 373Other1,383 1,251 273 230 209Total Downstream11,525 11,277 1,680 1,243 1,422All Other         Other(16) (15) (2) (1) (4)Total equity method35,261 $32,105 $6,327 $4,438 $2,661Other non-equity method investments285 392      Total investments and advances$35,546 $32,497      Total United States$7,500 $7,582 $1,033 $788 $802Total International$28,046 $24,915 $5,294 $3,650 $1,859Descriptions of major affiliates, including significant differences between the company’s carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows: Tengizchevroil Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan. At December 31, 2018, the company’s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $120 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO’s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO’s net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project with a balance of $2,060, including accrued interest. See Note 7, on page 63, for summarized financial information for 100 percent of TCO. Petropiar Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. At December 31, 2018, the company’s carrying value of its investment in Petropiar was approximately $136 less than the amount of underlying equity in Petropiar’s net assets. The difference represents the excess of Chevron’s underlying equity in Petropiar’s net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture. Petroboscan Chevron has a 39.2 percent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company which operates the Boscan Field in Venezuela. At December 31, 2018, the company’s carrying value of its investment in Petroboscan was approximately $97 higher than the amount of underlying equity in Petroboscan’s net assets. The difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by Chevron over its underlying equity in Petroboscan’s net assets. The company also has an outstanding long-term loan to Petroboscan of $626 at year-end 2018.Caspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a variable interest entity, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak. The company has investments and advances totaling $1,022, which includes long-term loans of $468 at year-end 2018. The loans were provided to fund 30 percent of the initial pipeline construction. The company is not the primary beneficiary of the consortium because it does not direct activities of the consortium and only receives its proportionate share of the financial returns. 69Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsAngola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66. GS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants, predominantly in South Korea. Other Information “Sales and other operating revenues” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes $10,378, $8,165 and $5,786 with affiliated companies for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. “Purchased crude oil and products” includes $6,598, $4,800 and $3,468 with affiliated companies for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. “Accounts and notes receivable” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $884 and $1,141 due from affiliated companies at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. “Accounts payable” includes $631 and $498 due to affiliated companies at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.The following table provides summarized financial information on a 100 percent basis for all equity affiliates as well as Chevron’s total share, which includes Chevron's net loans to affiliates of $3,402, $3,853 and $3,535 at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Affiliates  Chevron Share Year ended December 312018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016Total revenues$84,469 $70,744 $59,253 $40,679 $33,460 $27,787Income before income tax expense16,693 13,487 6,587 6,755 5,712 3,670Net income attributable to affiliates13,321 10,751 5,127 6,384 4,468 2,876At December 31           Current assets$32,657 $33,883 $33,406 $12,813 $13,568 $13,743Noncurrent assets87,614 82,261 75,258 36,369 32,643 28,854Current liabilities26,006 26,873 24,793 9,843 10,201 8,996Noncurrent liabilities20,000 21,447 22,671 4,446 4,224 4,255Total affiliates' net equity$74,265 $67,824 $61,200 $34,893 $31,786 $29,346Note 15 Litigation MTBE Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to seven pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. The company’s ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States. Ecuador Background Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador ("the provincial court"), in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpet’s ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a three-year remediation program at a cost of $40. After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations. Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the 70Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsaction, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that Texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuador’s failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and Petroecuador’s further conduct since assuming full control over the operations. Lago Agrio Judgment On February 14, 2011, the provincial court rendered a judgment against Chevron. The court rejected Chevron’s defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion. The judgment assessed approximately $8,600 in damages and approximately $900 as an award for the plaintiffs’ representatives. It also assessed an additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within 15 days of the judgment, which Chevron did not do. On February 17, 2011, the plaintiffs appealed the judgment, seeking increased damages, and on March 11, 2011, Chevron appealed the judgment seeking to have the judgment nullified. On January 3, 2012, an appellate panel in the provincial court affirmed the February 14, 2011 decision and ordered that Chevron pay additional attorneys’ fees in the amount of “0.10% of the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment.” The plaintiffs filed a petition to clarify and amplify the appellate decision on January 6, 2012, and the provincial court issued a ruling in response on January 13, 2012, purporting to clarify and amplify its January 3, 2012 ruling, which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages was within 15 days of the clarification ruling, or February 3, 2012. Chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at trial. On January 20, 2012, Chevron appealed (called a petition for cassation) the appellate panel’s decision to Ecuador’s National Court of Justice (the National Court). On February 17, 2012, the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted Chevron’s cassation appeal in a procedural step necessary for the National Court to hear the appeal. On March 29, 2012, the matter was transferred from the provincial court to the National Court, and on November 22, 2012, the National Court agreed to hear Chevron's cassation appeal. On August 3, 2012, the provincial court approved a court-appointed liquidator’s report on damages that calculated the total judgment in the case to be $19,100. On November 13, 2013, the National Court ratified the judgment but nullified the $8,600 punitive damage assessment, resulting in a judgment of $9,500. On December 23, 2013, Chevron appealed the decision to the Ecuador Constitutional Court, Ecuador's highest court. The reporting justice of the Constitutional Court heard oral arguments on the appeal on July 16, 2015. On July 10, 2018, Ecuador's Constitutional Court released a decision rejecting Chevron's appeal, which sought to nullify the National Court's judgment against Chevron. No further appeals are available in Ecuador.Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' Enforcement Actions Chevron has no assets in Ecuador and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' lawyers have stated in press releases and through other media that they will seek to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in various countries and otherwise disrupt Chevron's operations. On May 30, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed an action against Chevron Corporation, Chevron Canada Limited, and Chevron Canada Finance Limited in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On May 1, 2013, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that the Court has jurisdiction over Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited for purposes of the action, but stayed the action due to the absence of evidence that Chevron Corporation has assets in Ontario. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed that decision and on December 17, 2013, the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed the lower court’s decision on jurisdiction and set aside the stay, allowing the recognition and enforcement action to be heard in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Chevron appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada and, on September 4, 2015, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has jurisdiction over Chevron and Chevron Canada Limited for purposes of the action. On January 20, 2017, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granted Chevron Canada Limited’s and Chevron Corporation’s motions for summary judgment, concluding that the two companies are separate legal entities with separate rights and obligations. As a result, the Superior Court dismissed the recognition and enforcement claim against Chevron Canada Limited.  Chevron Corporation still remains as a defendant in the action. On February 3, 2017, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed the Superior Court's January 20, 2017 decision. On May 24, 2018, the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the Superior Court’s dismissal of Chevron Canada Limited from the case. On June 22, 2018, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed leave to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario to the Supreme Court of Canada.On June 27, 2012, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs filed a complaint against Chevron Corporation in the Superior Court of Justice in Brasilia, Brazil, seeking to recognize and enforce the Ecuadorian judgment. On May 13, 2015, the public prosecutor issued its nonbinding opinion and recommended that the Superior Court of Justice reject the plaintiffs' recognition and enforcement request, finding, among other things, that the Lago Agrio judgment was procured through fraud and corruption and cannot be recognized in Brazil because it violates Brazilian and international public order. On November 29, 2017, the Superior Court 71Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsof Justice issued a decision dismissing the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ recognition and enforcement proceeding based on jurisdictional grounds. On June 15, 2018, this decision became a final judgment in Brazil. On October 15, 2012, the provincial court issued an ex parte embargo order that purports to order the seizure of assets belonging to separate Chevron subsidiaries in Ecuador, Argentina and Colombia. On November 6, 2012, at the request of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, a court in Argentina issued a Freeze Order against Chevron Argentina S.R.L. and another Chevron subsidiary. On January 30, 2013, an appellate court upheld the Freeze Order, but on June 4, 2013 the Supreme Court of Argentina revoked the Freeze Order in its entirety. On December 12, 2013, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs served Chevron with notice of their filing of an enforcement proceeding in the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina. Chevron filed its answer on February 27, 2014, to which the Lago Agrio plaintiffs responded on December 29, 2015. On April 19, 2016, the public prosecutor in Argentina issued a non-binding opinion recommending to the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina that it reject the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' request to recognize the Ecuadorian judgment in Argentina. On February 24, 2017, the public prosecutor in Argentina issued a supplemental opinion reaffirming its previous recommendations. On November 1, 2017, the National Court, First Instance, of Argentina issued a decision dismissing the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' recognition and enforcement proceeding based on jurisdictional grounds. On November 2, 2017, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Federal Civil Court of Appeals. On July 3, 2018, the Federal Civil Court of Appeals affirmed the National Court, First Instance’s, dismissal of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ recognition and enforcement action based on jurisdictional grounds. On October 5, 2018, the Federal Civil Court of Appeals granted, in part, the admissibility of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ appeal to the Supreme Court of Argentina.Chevron continues to believe the Ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in Ecuador, the United States and other countries. The company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence. Chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of any enforcement action. Chevron expects to continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions.Company's Bilateral Investment Treaty Arbitration Claims Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim in September 2009 against the Republic of Ecuador before an arbitral tribunal presiding in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The claim alleges violations of the Republic of Ecuador’s obligations under the United States–Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet (described above), which are investment agreements protected by the BIT. Through the arbitration, Chevron and Texpet are seeking relief against the Republic of Ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation constitutes a violation of Ecuador’s obligations under the BIT. On January 25, 2012, the Tribunal issued its First Interim Measures Award requiring the Republic of Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and outside of   Ecuador of any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case pending further order of the Tribunal. On February 16, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Second Interim Award mandating that the Republic of Ecuador take all measures necessary (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and outside of Ecuador of the judgment against Chevron. On February 27, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Third Interim Award confirming its jurisdiction to hear Chevron's arbitration claims. On February 7, 2013, the Tribunal issued its Fourth Interim Award in which it declared that the Republic of Ecuador “has violated the First and Second Interim Awards under the [BIT], the UNCITRAL Rules and international law in regard to the finalization and enforcement subject to execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and outside Ecuador, including (but not limited to) Canada, Brazil and Argentina.” The Republic of Ecuador subsequently filed in the District Court of The Hague a request to set aside the Tribunal’s Interim Awards and the First Partial Award (described below), and on January 20, 2016, the District Court denied the Republic's request. On April 13, 2016, the Republic of Ecuador appealed the decision. On July 18, 2017, the Appeals Court of The Hague denied the Republic's appeal. On October 18, 2017, the Republic appealed the decision of the Appeals Court of The Hague to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands. The Tribunal has divided the merits phase of the proceeding into three phases. On September 17, 2013, the Tribunal issued its First Partial Award from Phase One, finding that the settlement agreements between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet applied to Texpet and Chevron, released Texpet and Chevron from claims based on "collective" or "diffuse" rights arising from Texpet's operations in the former concession area and precluded third parties from asserting collective/diffuse rights environmental claims relating to Texpet's operations in the former concession area but did not preclude individual claims for personal harm. The Tribunal held a hearing on April 29-30, 2014, to address remaining issues relating to Phase One, and on March 12, 2015, it issued a nonbinding decision that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' complaint, on its face, includes claims not barred by the settlement agreement between the Republic of Ecuador and Texpet. In the same decision, the Tribunal deferred to Phase Two remaining issues from Phase One, including whether the Republic of Ecuador breached the 1995 settlement 72Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsagreement and the remedies that are available to Chevron and Texpet as a result of that breach. Phase Two issues were addressed at a hearing held in April and May 2015. On August 30, 2018, the Tribunal issued its Phase Two award in favor of Chevron and Texpet. The Tribunal unanimously held that the Ecuadorian judgment was procured through fraud, bribery and corruption and was based on claims that the Republic of Ecuador had settled and released in the mid-1990s, concluding that the Ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” Specifically, the Tribunal found that (i) the Republic of Ecuador breached its obligations under the 1995 and 1998 settlement agreements releasing Texpet and its affiliates from public environmental claims (the same claims on which the Ecuadorian judgment was exclusively based) and (ii) the Republic of Ecuador committed a denial of justice under customary international law and under the fair and equitable treatment provision of the BIT due to the fraud and corruption in the Lago Agrio litigation. The Tribunal also found that Texpet satisfied its environmental remediation obligations with a $40 remediation program and that Ecuador certified that Texpet had performed all of its obligations under its settlement agreement. Among other things, the Tribunal ordered the Republic of Ecuador to: (a) take immediate steps to remove the status of enforceability from the Ecuadorian judgment; (b) promptly advise in writing any State where the Lago Agrio plaintiffs may be seeking the enforcement or recognition of the Ecuadorian judgment of the Tribunal’s declarations, orders and awards; (c) take measures to “wipe out all the consequences” of Ecuador's "internationally wrongful acts in regard to the Ecuadorian judgment;" and (d) compensate Chevron for any injuries resulting from the Ecuadorian judgment. On December 10, 2018, the Republic of Ecuador filed in the District Court of The Hague a request to set aside the Tribunal's Phase Two Award. The Tribunal has not set a date for Phase Three, the third and final phase of the arbitration, at which damages for Chevron's injuries will be determined.Company's RICO Action In February 2011, Chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters, alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other state laws. Through the civil lawsuit, Chevron sought relief that included a declaration that any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. The trial commenced on October 15, 2013 and concluded on November 22, 2013. On March 4, 2014, the Federal District Court entered a judgment in favor of Chevron, prohibiting the defendants from seeking to enforce the Lago Agrio judgment in the United States and further prohibiting them from profiting from their illegal acts. The defendants appealed the Federal District Court's decision, and, on April 20, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral arguments. On August 8, 2016, the Second Circuit issued a unanimous opinion affirming in full the judgment of the Federal District Court. On October 27, 2016, the Second Circuit denied the defendants' petitions for en banc rehearing of the opinion on their appeal. On March 27, 2017, two of the defendants filed a petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. On June 19, 2017, the United States Supreme Court denied the defendants' petition for a Writ of Certiorari. Management's Assessment The ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on Chevron, remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects associated with the Ecuadorian judgment, management does not believe the judgment has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). 73Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsNote 16Taxes Income TaxesYear ended December 31  2018  2017 2016Income tax expense (benefit)      U.S. federal      Current$(181)  $(382) $(623)Deferred738  (2,561) (1,558)State and local      Current183  (97) (15)Deferred(16)  66 (121)Total United States724  (2,974) (2,317)International      Current4,662  3,634 2,744Deferred329  (708) (2,156)Total International4,991  2,926 588Total income tax expense (benefit)$5,715  $(48) $(1,729)The reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and the company’s effective income tax rate is detailed in the following table: 2018  2017 2016Income (loss) before income taxes         United States$4,730  $(441) $(4,317)   International15,845  9,662 2,157Total income (loss) before income taxes20,575  9,221 (2,160)Theoretical tax (at U.S. statutory rate of  21% - 2018, 35% - 2017 & 2016)4,321  3,227 (756)Effect of U.S. tax reform(26)  (2,020) —Equity affiliate accounting effect(1,526)  (1,373) (704)Effect of income taxes from international operations*3,132  (130) 608State and local taxes on income, net of U.S. federal income tax benefit162  39 (44)Prior year tax adjustments, claims and settlements(51)  (39) (349)Tax credits(163)  (199) (188)Other U.S.*(134)  447 (296)Total income tax expense (benefit)$5,715  $(48) $(1,729)       Effective income tax rate27.8%  (0.5)% 80.0%*  Includes one-time tax costs (benefits) associated with changes in uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances.The 2018 increase in income tax charge of $5,763, from a benefit of $48 in 2017 to a charge of $5,715 in 2018, is a result of the year-over-year increase in total income before income tax expense, which is primarily due to higher crude oil realizations offset by lower gains on asset sales in 2018 compared to 2017.  U.S. tax reform resulted in a benefit of $2,020 being recognized in 2017 reflecting the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. The company’s effective tax rate changed from (0.5) percent in 2017 to 28 percent in 2018.  The change in effective tax rate is a consequence of the mix effect resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions and the impact of U.S. tax reform to both the 2018 and 2017 results. As noted above, U.S. tax reform resulted in the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017.  The  U.S. tax return for 2017 was prepared and filed in 2018 and did not result in any material change to the the provisional amounts that were recognized in 2017, and the amounts are now considered final. 74Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsThe company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:     At December 31 2018  2017Deferred tax liabilities    Properties, plant and equipment$20,159  $19,869Investments and other4,943  4,796Total deferred tax liabilities25,102  24,665Deferred tax assets    Foreign tax credits(10,536)  (11,872)Asset retirement obligations/environmental reserves(5,328)  (5,511)Employee benefits(2,787)  (3,129)Deferred credits(1,373)  (1,769)Tax loss carryforwards(4,948)  (5,463)Other accrued liabilities(595)  (842)Inventory(505)  (336)Miscellaneous(3,481)  (2,415)Total deferred tax assets(29,553)  (31,337)Deferred tax assets valuation allowance15,973  16,574Total deferred taxes, net$11,522  $9,902Deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2018 increased by approximately $400 from year-end 2017. The increase was primarily related to property, plant and equipment temporary differences. Deferred tax assets decreased by approximately $1,800 in 2018.  The decrease primarily related to lower foreign tax credits and the utilization of tax loss carryforwards.The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. It reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management’s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2018, the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $13,731 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,198, primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2019 through 2036. U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $10,536 will expire between 2019 and 2028.  At December 31, 2018 and 2017, deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:  At December 31  2018  2017Deferred charges and other assets$(4,399)  $(4,750)Noncurrent deferred income taxes15,921  14,652Total deferred income taxes, net$11,522  $9,902Enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017 imposed a one-time U.S. federal tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings indefinitely reinvested abroad, which did not have a material impact on the company’s financial results. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for U.S. state and foreign withholding tax purposes.U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $59,900 at December 31, 2018. This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.Uncertain Income Tax Positions The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. 75Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsThe following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included.  2018  2017 2016Balance at January 1$4,828  $3,031 $3,042Foreign currency effects(6)  43 1Additions based on tax positions taken in current year239  1,853 245Additions for tax positions taken in prior years153  1,166 181Reductions for tax positions taken in prior years(131)  (90) (390)Settlements with taxing authorities in current year(13)  (1,173) (36)Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations—  (2) (12)Balance at December 31$5,070  $4,828 $3,031Approximately 82 percent of the $5,070 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018, would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition. Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2018. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States – 2013, Nigeria – 2000,  Australia – 2006 and Kazakhstan – 2007. The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “Income tax expense.” As of December 31, 2018, accruals of $33 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accruals of $178 as of year-end 2017. Income tax expense (benefit) associated with interest and penalties was $8, $(161) and $38 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2018, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt. At December 31, 2018, the company had $9,900 in committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities consist of a 364-day facility which enables borrowing of up to $9,575 and allows the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, and a $325 five-year facility expiring in December 2020. These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2018. 77Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsThe company classified $9,900 and $10,000 of short-term debt as long-term at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. Note 19 Long-Term Debt Total long-term debt including capital lease obligations at December 31, 2018, was $28,733.

If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense.The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31, 2018: 201820172016Beginning balance at January 1$3,702$3,540$3,312Additions to capitalized exploratory well costs pending the determination of proved reserves207323465Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the determination of proved reserves(13)(113)(119)Capitalized exploratory well costs charged to expense(333)(39)(118)Other reductions*—(9)—Ending balance at December 31$3,563$3,702$3,540*    Represents property sales.The following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling.  At December 31  201820172016Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period of one year or less$202$307$445Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year3,3613,3953,095Balance at December 31$3,563$3,702$3,540Number of projects with exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year*303235*    Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.Of the $3,361 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2018, $1,585 (14 projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future. The $1,776 balance is related to 16 projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development.The projects for the $1,776 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability: (a) $672 (three projects) – undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within four years; (b) $93 (one project) – development concept under review by government; (c) $963 (eight projects) – development alternatives under review; (d) $48 (four projects) – miscellaneous activities for projects with smaller amounts suspended. While progress was being made on all 30 projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. More than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years. The $3,361 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2018, represents 153 exploratory wells in 30 projects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis: Aging based on drilling completion date of individual wells:Amount  Number of wells1998-2007$410  312008-20121,076  612013-20171,875  61Total$3,361  153     Aging based on drilling completion date of last suspended well in project:Amount  Number of projects2003-2010$338  52011-2014894  102015-20182,129  15Total$3,361  3079Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsNote 21 Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation Compensation expense for stock options for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $105 ($83 after tax), $137 ($89 after tax) and $271 ($176 after tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and restricted stock units was $60 ($47 after tax), $231 ($150 after tax) and $371 ($241 after tax) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at December 31, 2018, or December 31, 2017. Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $1,159, $1,100 and $647, respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $43, $48 and $21 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash paid to settle performance shares, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights was $157, $187 and $82 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Awards under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May 2023, no more than 260 million shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than 50 million of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards issued before January 1, 2017, the contractual terms vary between three years for the performance shares and restricted stock units, and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. For awards issued after January 1, 2017, contractual terms vary between three years for the performance shares and special restricted stock units, five years for standard restricted stock units and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. Forfeitures for performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are recognized as they occur. Forfeitures for stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990.The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions:  Year ended December 31 2018  2017 2016 Expected term in years16.56.36.3Volatility221.2%21.7%21.7%Risk-free interest rate based on zero coupon U.S. treasury note2.6%2.2%1.6%Dividend yield3.8%4.2%4.5%Weighted-average fair value per option granted$18.18$15.31$9.531    Expected term is based on historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation data.2    Volatility rate is based on historical stock prices over an appropriate period, generally equal to the expected term.A summary of option activity during 2018 is presented below:  Shares (Thousands)Weighted-Average Exercise Price  Averaged Remaining Contractual Term (Years)Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at January 1, 2018103,765 $97.40  Granted4,665 $125.35  Exercised(12,991) $88.11  Forfeited(715) $115.25  Outstanding at December 31, 201894,724 $99.92 5.07 $1,101Exercisable at December 31, 201881,074 $99.34 4.60 $933The total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market price) of options exercised during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $506, $407 and $240, respectively. During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these awards. As of December 31, 2018, there was $53 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.At January 1, 2018, the number of LTIP performance shares outstanding was equivalent to 3,090,793 shares. During 2018, 1,491,141 performance shares were granted, 746,450 shares vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 165,754 shares were forfeited. At December 31, 2018, performance shares outstanding were 3,669,730. The fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $258, and was measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method. 80Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsAt January 1, 2018, the number of restricted stock units outstanding was equivalent to 1,236,500 shares. During 2018, 819,769 restricted stock units were granted, 222,946 units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 95,844 units were forfeited. At December 31, 2018, restricted stock units outstanding were 1,737,479. The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $125, valued at the stock price as of December 31, 2018. In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights that were granted under LTIP totaled approximately 4.2 million equivalent shares as of December 31, 2018. The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $70.Note 22 Employee Benefit Plans The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives. The company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. For the company's main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company. The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status of the company’s pension and OPEB plans for 2018 and 2017 follows:  Pension Benefits    2018   2017  Other Benefits  U.S. Int’l.  U.S. Int’l. 2018  2017Change in Benefit Obligation             Benefit obligation at January 1$13,580 $5,540  $13,271 $5,169 $2,788  $2,549Service cost480 141  489 151 42  32Interest cost370 206  366 219 94  95Plan participants' contributions— 4  — 4 71  78Plan amendments— 23  — 1 2  —Actuarial (gain) loss(1,051) (239)  1,168 (37) (272)  266Foreign currency exchange rate changes— (227)  — 374 (9)  10Benefits paid(1,653) (432)  (1,714) (310) (237)  (229)Divestitures— (196)  — (31) (49)  (13)Benefit obligation at December 3111,726 4,820  13,580 5,540 2,430  2,788Change in Plan Assets             Fair value of plan assets at January 19,948 4,766  9,550 4,174 —  —Actual return on plan assets(566) (9)  1,384 319 —  —Foreign currency exchange rate changes— (221)  — 358 —  —Employer contributions803 232  728 252 166  151Plan participants' contributions— 4  — 4 71  78Benefits paid(1,653) (432)  (1,714) (310) (237)  (229)Divestitures— (198)  — (31) —  —Fair value of plan assets at December 318,532 4,142  9,948 4,766 —  —Funded status at December 31$(3,194) $(678)  $(3,632) $(774) $(2,430)  $(2,788)Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the company’s pension and OPEB plans at December 31, 2018 and 2017, include:  Pension Benefits    2018   2017  Other Benefits  U.S. Int’l.  U.S. Int’l. 2018  2017Deferred charges and other assets$17 $412  $21 $448 $—  $—Accrued liabilities(180) (66)  (188) (100) (175)  (174)Noncurrent employee benefit plans(3,031) (1,024)  (3,465) (1,122) (2,255)  (2,614)Net amount recognized at December 31$(3,194) $(678)  $(3,632) $(774) $(2,430)  $(2,788)81Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsAmounts recognized on a before-tax basis in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for the company’s pension and OPEB plans were $4,448 and $5,286 at the end of 2018 and 2017, respectively.

These amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. During 2019, the company estimates actuarial losses of $239, $19 and $(3) will be amortized from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively. In addition, the company estimates an additional $290 will be recognized from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” during 2019 related to lump-sum settlement costs from the main U.S. pension plans. The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at December 31, 2018, was approximately 4 and 8 years for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, and 8 years for OPEB plans. During 2019, the company estimates prior service (credits) costs of $2, $12 and 82Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts$(28) will be amortized from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respectively. Assumptions The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended December 31:  Pension Benefits         2018   2017  2016     Other Benefits  U.S.Int’l.  U.S.Int’l. U.S.Int’l. 2018  2017 2016Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:                Discount rate4.2%4.4%  3.5%3.9% 3.9%4.3% 4.4%  3.8% 4.3%Rate of compensation increase4.5%4.0%  4.5%4.0% 4.5%4.5% N/A  N/A N/AAssumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost:                Discount rate for service cost3.7%3.9%  4.2%4.3% 4.4%5.3% 3.9%  4.6% 4.9%Discount rate for interest cost3.0%3.9%  3.0%4.3% 3.0%5.3% 3.5%  3.8% 4.0%Expected return on plan assets6.8%5.5%  6.8%5.5% 7.3%6.3% N/A  N/A N/ARate of compensation increase4.5%4.0%  4.5%4.5% 4.5%4.8% N/A  N/A N/AExpected Return on Plan Assets The company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. For 2018, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 67 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. In 2017, the company used a long-term rate of return of 6.75 percent for these plans, and in 2016, 7.25 percent. The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense. Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company's plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2018 were 4.2 percent for the main U.S. pension plan and 4.3 percent for the main U.S. OPEB plan. The discount rates for these plans at the end of 2017 were 3.5 and 3.6 percent, respectively, while in 2016 they were 3.9 and 4.1 percent for these plans, respectively.Other Benefit Assumptions Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs. For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2018, for the main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.2 percent in 2019 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2017, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with 7.4 percent in 2018 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. A 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans:   1 Percent Increase 1 Percent DecreaseEffect on total service and interest cost components$12 $(10)Effect on postretirement benefit obligation$197 $(156)Plan Assets and Investment Strategy The fair value measurements of the company’s pension plans for 2018 and 2017 are on the following page:83Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts U.S.   Int’l.  Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 NAV  Total  Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 NAVAt December 31, 2017                    Equities                    U.S.1$1,331 $1,331 $— $— —  $652 $651 $1 $— $—International2,060 2,057 3 — —  691 691 — — —Collective Trusts/Mutual Funds21,089 22 — — 1,067  204 19 4 — 181Fixed Income                  Government274 — 274 — —  296 77 219 — —Corporate1,492 — 1,492 — —  593 — 563 30 —Bank Loans117 — 106 11 —  — — — — —Mortgage/Asset Backed1 — 1 — —  8 — 8 — —Collective Trusts/Mutual Funds21,130 — — — 1,130  1,481 — 16 — 1,465Mixed Funds3— — — — —  80 1 79 — —Real Estate41,096 — — — 1,096  376 — — 56 320Alternative Investments51,022 — — — 1,022  — — — — —Cash and Cash Equivalents260 255 5 — —  366 362 4 — —Other676 (2) 28 43 7  19 (2) 18 3 —Total at December 31, 2017$9,948 $3,663 $1,909 $54 4,322  $4,766 $1,799 $912 $89 $1,966At December 31, 2018                    Equities                    U.S.1$1,110 $1,110 $— $— $—  $520 $520 $— $— $—International1,631 1,630 1 — —  521 520 — 1 —Collective Trusts/Mutual Funds2893 21 — — 872  152 9 — — 143Fixed Income                  Government225 — 225 — —  254 97 157 — —Corporate1,382 — 1,382 — —  409 — 389 20 —Bank Loans119 — 114 5 —  — — — — —Mortgage/Asset Backed1 — 1 — —  6 — 6 — —Collective Trusts/Mutual Funds2877 — — — 877  1,521 15 — — 1,506Mixed Funds3— — — — —  74 3 71 — —Real Estate41,065 — — — 1,065  378 — — 56 322Alternative Investments5941 — — — 941  — — — — —Cash and Cash Equivalents212 208 4 — —  287 277 2 — 8Other676 (4) 31 44 5  20 — 17 3 —Total at December 31, 2018$8,532 $2,965 $1,758 $49 $3,760  $4,142 $1,441 $642 $80 $1,9791 U.S. equities include investments in the company’s common stock in the amount of $9 at December 31, 2018, and $12 at December 31, 2017.2 Collective Trusts/Mutual Funds for U.S. plans are entirely index funds; for International plans, they are mostly unit trust and index funds. 3 Mixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixed-income instruments in order to diversify and lower risk.4 The year-end valuations of the U.S. real estate assets are based on third-party appraisals that occur at least once a year for each property in the portfolio.5 Alternative investments focus on market-neutral strategies that have a low expected correlation to traditional asset classes. 6 The “Other” asset class includes net payables for securities purchased but not yet settled (Level 1); dividends and interest- and tax-related receivables (Level 2); insurance contracts (Level 3); and investments in private-equity limited partnerships (NAV).The effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in Level 3 plan assets are outlined below:  EquityFixed Income          InternationalCorporate  Bank Loans  Real Estate  Other  TotalTotal at December 31, 2016$—$19  $11  $60  $44  $134Actual Return on Plan Assets:                 Assets held at the reporting date—1  —  1  —  2   Assets sold during the period——  —  —  —  —Purchases, Sales and Settlements—10  3  (5)  2  10Transfers in and/or out of Level 3——  (3)  —  —  (3)Total at December 31, 2017$—$30  $11  $56  $46  $143Actual Return on Plan Assets:                 Assets held at the reporting date4(2)  —  13  —  15   Assets sold during the period(4)—  —  —  —  (4)Purchases, Sales and Settlements—(7)  (4)  (13)  —  (24)Transfers in and/or out of Level 31—  (2)  —  —  (1)Total at December 31, 2018$1$21  $5  $56  $46  $12984Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsThe primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management. The company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 91 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans’ investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established. For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company's Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities 30–60 percent, Fixed Income and Cash 20–65 percent, Real Estate 0–15 percent, and Alternative Investments 0–15 percent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines: Equities 25–45 percent, Fixed Income and Cash 40–75 percent, and Real Estate 5–15 percent. The other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and illiquidity constraints. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds. The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations. Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2018, the company contributed $803 and $232 to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2019, the company expects contributions to be approximately $700 to its U.S. plans and $200 to its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. The company anticipates paying OPEB benefits of approximately $175 in 2019; $166 was paid in 2018. The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years: Pension Benefits  Other U.S. Int’l. Benefits2019$1,310 $271 $1752020$1,240 $266 $1722021$1,170 $577 $1712022$1,145 $228 $1682023$1,118 $234 $1662024-2028$4,972 $1,392 $795Employee Savings Investment Plan Eligible employees of Chevron and certain of its subsidiaries participate in the Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP). Compensation expense for the ESIP totaled $270, $316 and $281 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Benefit Plan Trusts Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2018, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations. Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, trust assets of $34 and $35, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts. Employee Incentive Plans The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $1,048, $936 and $662 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in Note 21, beginning on page 80. 85Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsNote 23 Other Contingencies and Commitments Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 16, beginning on page 74, for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination.Guarantees The company has two guarantees to equity affiliates totaling $968. Of this amount, $637 is associated with a financing arrangement with an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 3-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate. The remaining amount of $331 is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 9-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee. Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997. Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drill ships, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2019 – $1,300; 2020 – $1,200; 2021 – $1,300; 2022 – $1,000; 2023 – $800; 2023 and after – $4,700. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $1,400 in 2018, $1,300 in 2017 and $1,300 in 2016. As part of the implementation of ASU 2016-02 (Topic 842) effective January 1, 2019, the company will reclassify some contracts, currently incorporated into the unconditional purchase obligations disclosure, as operating leases in first quarter 2019 results.Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields, and mining sites.Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of 86Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsoperations in the period in which they are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Chevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2018, was $1,327. Included in this balance was $258 related to remediation activities at approximately 144 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. Of the remaining year-end 2018 environmental reserves balance of $1,069, $748 is related to the company’s U.S. downstream operations, $24 to its international downstream operations, $296 to upstream operations and $1 to other businesses. Liabilities at all sites were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2018 had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. Refer to Note 24 on page 88 for a discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations. Other Contingencies Governmental and other entities in California and other jurisdictions have filed legal proceedings against fossil fuel producing companies, including Chevron, purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate change. Further such proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability and injunctions against the production of all fossil fuels that, while we believe remote, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change, and will vigorously defend against such proceedings.Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future periods.The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. 87Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsNote 24Asset Retirement Obligations The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates. AROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation. The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2018, 2017 and 2016:  2018  2017 2016Balance at January 1$14,214  $14,243 $15,642Liabilities incurred96  684 204Liabilities settled(830)  (1,721) (1,658)Accretion expense654  668 749Revisions in estimated cash flows(84)  340 (694)Balance at December 31$14,050  $14,214 $14,243In the table above, the amount associated with "Revisions in estimated cash flows" in 2018 reflects decreased cost estimates to abandon wells, equipment and facilities. The long-term portion of the $14,050 balance at the end of 2018 was $12,957.Note 25 Revenue On January 1, 2018, Chevron adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and its related amendments using the modified retrospective transition method, which did not require the restatement of prior periods. The adoption did not result in a material change in the company’s accounting or have a material effect on the company’s financial position, including the measurement of revenue, the timing of revenue recognition and the recognition of contract assets, liabilities and related costs. The most significant change is the presentation of excise, value-added and similar taxes collected on behalf of third parties, which are no longer presented within “Sales and other operating revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income starting in 2018. These taxes, which totaled $7,861 in 2018, are now netted in “Taxes other than on income” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. This change to presentation had no impact on earnings. These taxes totaled $7,189 and $6,905 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.The company applied the optional exemption to not report any unfulfilled performance obligations related to contracts that have terms of less than one year. The amount of future revenue for unfulfilled performance obligations under long-term contracts with fixed components was insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue from contracts with customers is presented in “Sales and other operating revenue” along with some activity that is accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606, which is not material to this line, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 13 beginning on page 66 for additional information on the company’s segmentation of revenue. Receivables related to revenue from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The net balance of these receivables was $9,779 and $10,046 at January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Other items included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture operating and project costs and amounts due from 88Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Millions of dollars, except per-share amountsothers, primarily related to derivatives, leases, buy/sell arrangements and product exchanges, which are accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606. Contract assets and related costs are reflected in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and contract liabilities are reflected in “Accrued liabilities” and “Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts for these items are not material to the company’s financial position.Note 26 Other Financial Information Earnings in 2018 included after-tax gains of approximately $630 relating to the sale of certain properties. Of this amount, approximately $365 and $265 related to downstream and upstream, respectively. Earnings in 2017 included after-tax gains of approximately $1,800 relating to the sale of certain properties, of which approximately $850 and $950 related to downstream and upstream assets, respectively. Earnings in 2018 included after-tax charges of approximately $2,000 for impairments and other asset write-offs related to upstream.

For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.  Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the Manager of Global Reserves, an organization that is separate from the Upstream operating organization. The Manager of Global Reserves has more than 30 years’ experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and 95Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unauditedgraduate degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes. He has been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and is an active member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists and the Society of Petroleum Engineers.All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates. The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Chevron Corporation  Reserves Manual, which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board.RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2018, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates.Proved Undeveloped Reserves At the end of 2018, proved undeveloped reserves totaled 4.6 billion barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE), an increase of 317 million BOE from year-end 2017. The increase was due to 717 million BOE in extensions and discoveries, 69 million BOE in acquisitions, 58 million BOE in revisions and 6 million BOE in improved recovery, partially offset by the transfer of 531 million BOE to proved developed and 2 million BOE in sales. A major portion of this reserve increase is attributed to the company's activities in the Midland and Delaware basins.During 2018, investments totaling approximately $10 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves.  In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately $4.8 billion, primarily related to development projects of the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan.  The United States accounted for about $3.4 billion related primarily to various development activities in the Gulf of Mexico and the Midland and Delaware basins. In Africa, about $0.7 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada and Argentina were primarily responsible for about $0.9 billion of expenditures in Other Americas. Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels. At year-end 2018, the company held approximately 2.1 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 600 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects. The company completed construction of liquefaction and other facilities to develop this natural gas. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to 96Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unauditedoccur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 300 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 1.2 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 900 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more, with the majority related to the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints. Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2018,  increases in commodity prices positively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in proved reserve increases, and negatively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects. The year-end reserves volumes have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections. For 2018, this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 32 percent and 38 percent. Proved Reserve Quantities For the three years ending December 31, 2018, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest.At December 31, 2018, proved reserves for the company were 12.1 billion BOE. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 are shown in the table on page 98. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 99.Noteworthy changes in liquids proved reserves for 2016 through 2018 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:Revisions In 2016, improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields, including Jack/St Malo, and in the San Joaquin Valley were primarily responsible for the 109 million barrel increase in the United States. Entitlement effects were mainly responsible for the 64 million barrel increase in the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan. In Asia, entitlement effects, drilling and improved performance across numerous assets resulted in the 50 million barrel increase. In 2017, improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields, including Jack/St Malo and Tahiti, and in the Midland  and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 280 million barrel increase in the United States. Improved field performance at various fields, including Agbami and Sonam in Nigeria, were responsible for the 79 million barrel increase in Africa.  Synthetic oil reserves in Canada decreased by 42 million barrels, primarily due to entitlement effects. In the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, entitlement effects were mainly responsible for the 53 million barrel decrease.In 2018, improved field performance at various Gulf of Mexico fields and in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 155 million barrel increase in the United States. Improved field performance at various fields, including  Agbami in Nigeria and Moho-Bilondo in the Republic of Congo, were responsible for the 68 million barrel increase in Africa.  Reserves in Other Americas increased by 60 million barrels, primarily due to improved field performance at the Hebron field in Canada. In Asia, improved performance across numerous assets resulted in the 37 million barrel increase. In the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, entitlement effects were mainly responsible for the 39 million barrel decrease.Improved Recovery In 2016, improved recovery increased reserves by 293 million barrels, primarily due to the Future Growth Project in the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan.Extensions and Discoveries In 2016, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 131 million barrel increase in the United States.In 2017, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico were primarily responsible for the 458 million barrel increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in the Duvernay Shale in Canada were primarily responsible for the 74 million barrel increase in Other Americas.In 2018, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 532 million barrel increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in the Duvernay Shale in Canada and Loma Campana in Argentina were primarily responsible for the 36 million barrel increase in Other Americas.97Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - UnauditedPurchases In 2017, purchases of 33 million barrels in Asia were due to contract extension in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli fields in Azerbaijan. In 2018, purchases of 50 million barrels in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.Sales In 2016, sales of 34 million barrels in the United States were primarily in the Gulf of Mexico shelf.In 2017, sales of 57 million barrels in the United States were primarily in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and in the Midland and Delaware basins.In 2018, sales of 32 million barrels in the United States were primarily in the San Joaquin Valley.

This includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent  management’s estimate of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves.
