board statement

At Chasen Holdings Limited (“Chasen”), we are committed 

to upholding a high standard of Environmental, Social and 

Governance (“ESG”) practices within our organization. 

While we are taking our first steps in the sustainability 

journey, we have taken the challenge of driving corporate 

sustainability with conviction and fervor.

Embracing sustainability reporting has challenged the 

Chasen Board and management team to review aspects of 

the way we do business. As a result, we have broadened 

our business approach to incorporate non-financial 

parameters.

We subscribe to the belief that sustainable growth and 

success  is only possible with the sustainable development 

of the communities we operate in, be it social, business or 

national communities.

The Group will continue to explore and evaluate business 

opportunities (including but not limited to strategic 

investments, partnerships, or mergers and acquisitions) 

that have potential to generate value for the shareholders. 

While we continue to seek breakthrough for new growth, 

we recognize the increasing importance of strengthening 

the resilience and sustainability to our current business 

operations.

As a market leader in a niche logistics sector, we 

demonstrate our commitment through the adoption of 

responsible business practices. The Group is committed 

to complying with all applicable laws and regulations in all 

the markets we operate in. The Board expects all Group 

employees to be vigilant to maintain the corporate values 

and high quality of the Group’s products and services.

Moving forward, we believe that long term investment 

in human capital is the key to the long term sustainable 

success of Chasen Group. Therefore, we are committed to 

invest in strengthening our staff training and development 

by increasing the total and average training hours by 20% 

in the next 1-3 years.

In terms of Environmental Health &amp; Safety (“EHS”) 

excellence, we endeavor to enhance our EHS management 

system and processes. We regularly review and revise our 

existing Safety Management System. We have plans to 

measure the carbon footprint and the Greenhouse Gases 

Emission of our business operations progressively over the 

next three years.

For social impact, the Group plans to contribute in business 

and community initiatives in the next three years.

The Company was incorporated on 2 November 1999. It 

listed on SESDAQ on 8 August 2000 and was transferred 

from the SGX Catalist to Mainboard on 26 February 2013.

The Company changed its name from China Entertainment 

Sports Ltd to Chasen Holdings Limited (“Chasen”) on 17 

May 2007 following the completion of the reverse takeover 

exercise in February 2007 whereby the Company acquired 

the entire issued and paid up capital of Chasen Logistics 

Services Limited. As a result of the reverse takeover, the 

Company acquired a new core business in specialist 

relocation solutions for manufacturing industries that 

utilize sophisticated machineries and equipment.

Chasen is an investment holding company. Its Group 

businesses now extend further up the global supply chain 

to include third party logistics, technical and engineering 

services in Singapore, Malaysia, the  People’s  Republic 

of China, Vietnam,  Thailand  and  USA.  The Group 

diversified revenue sources cover industries such as 

wafer fabrication, TFT display panel production, semi-

conductor, chip testing and assembly, solar panel 

assembly, consumer electronics, telecommunications, 

marine, ordnance and construction sectors in the following 

business segments:

Specialist Relocation – providing specialist manpower 

equipped with specialized material handling tools, 

equipment and vehicles to relocate the machinery and 

equipment of our customers within their premises, from 

one location to another location within a country, or 

from one country to another. The Chasen Group acts as 

a strategic partner to its customers in the management

maintenance contracts. The Group is equipped to handle 

very sensitive machinery and equipment in cleanroom and 

“raised ﬂoor” environment.

Third Party Logistics – including packing, packaging, 

trucking, distribution, freight forwarding, warehousing and 

related services. We pack machinery and equipment to 

Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) specifications 

utilizing  specialized packaging material before they are 

transported to their new locations. Our cross-border 

trucking services are capable of delivering goods from 

Singapore through Peninsular Malaysia into Thailand, 

Myanmar and across Indo-China, Vietnam and into China. 

Most of our warehouses are air conditioned and humidity 

controlled, with ﬂoor level space for heavy equipment/ 

machinery or racked for palletized goods storage.

fabrication and installation of steel structures, mechanical 

and electrical installations including hook-up for production 

facilities, parts refurbishment, engineering and spares 

support, facilities management, scaffolding equipment 

and services, contract manufacturing, water treatment and 

process engineering services.

The Group’s diversified revenue base and longstanding 

customer relationship provide a strong fundamental that 

would enable the Group to weather business cycles in 

specific industry. Its business model and growth strategy 

have positioned the Group to benefit from growth 

opportunities in the region and to increase the proportion 

of recurring income in Group revenue.

The	three	core	business	segments	are	as	follows:

Headquartered in Singapore, with operations across Asia 

and extending to the United States of America, Chasen 

Group manages our operations in accordance with our 

sustainability principles. Management work closely with our 

operation staff to identify and consider any sustainability 

opportunity and risk that may arise.

Chasen operates with close purview of long term 

sustainability risks and opportunities. We therefore view 

our business performance beyond short term gains 

and financial bottomline. Our conviction is to achieve a 

balanced triple bottomline, i.e. People, Profit, Planet, for 

sustained growth for the organization and the community 

it operates in.

The success of our business is highly dependent on 

the commitment of our management and staff. Their 

knowledge, professional expertise and their job satisfaction 

are key to our economic sustainability.

More importantly, we strive to contribute positively to 

society through our economic presence by serving as 

Singapore’s leading specialist relocation company in 

South-East Asia, China and the United States of America, 

while maintaining good stewardship of the resources we 

manage and generating good shareholders’ value.

Our business model focuses on cost leadership without 

compromising our service level and highest priority on 

customer’s interest. We seek organic growth from the 

existing business units as well as through the acquisition of 

new businesses that reap good returns.

 

The Group’s vision is to be a leading global integrated 

service provider with turnkey capabilities in  supporting 

the development of new or relocated manufacturing and 

service operational facilities in this region and beyond. 

To achieve this, the Group continues to conduct internal 

reviews to further develop the capability and synergize the 

operations of its diverse business segments.

During the financial year ended 31 March 2019 (“FY2019”), 

all three business segments of the Chasen Group reported 

improved sales through greater market reach and traction. 

Our business has remained relatively unaffected by the 

on-going global trade tensions as the strategic initiatives 

ECONOMIC

Economic Contribution to Society

being implemented by the relevant group subsidiaries 

have continued to bear fruit. The Group achieved our 

highest-ever full-year gross profit of S$32.1 million and 

annual revenue of S$131.9 million since our listing on the 

Singapore Exchange.

The Group  expects to be well on its way to achieve its 

target of S$200 million in revenue by 2020 through the 

following strategies:

I. Scaling up relocation business in China, Malaysia, 

Vietnam and the US;

II. Growing the 3PL cross-border land freight business; 

and

III. Streamlining Singapore operations, particularly the 

Technical &amp; Engineering operations, to improve 

internal cost efficiencies.

Chasen as a whole continues to leverage on our expertise 

and track record to strengthen our foothold in existing 

markets, as well as expand into new markets such as the 

USA and India. To that end, the Group remains committed 

to continuous review and follow through with its strategic 

initiatives in the year ahead that include:

• Providing complementary services to our relocation 

clients in China, such as air-conditioned &amp; humidity 

control warehousing, cleanroom facilities for equipment 

refurbishment; 

• Growing the geographical and service coverage of its 

3PL cross-border land freight business; and

• Streamlining Singapore operational facilities and 

refining the cost structure of our T&amp;E business segment.

Apart from challenges faced by the individual business 

units’ operation in their respective markets, the Group 

remains mindful of macro-economic factors that can 

dampen business and investment confidence in the new 

fiscal year.

performance, please refer to financial highlights in

one of the top priorities for the Company. The decision- 

making process in the Company is strictly in line with 

legal and regulatory requirements and in compliance with 

the Code of Corporate Governance issued by Monetary 

Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Companies Act.

We promote ‘an ethical and act with integrity’ culture 

throughout the Company. We seek to conduct our 

business in an ethical manner and in compliance with the 

best practices in the different industries we operate in. All 

Directors, operations and management staff are required 

to fully comply with our principles set in our Employee 

Handbook and employment contract.

With zero-tolerance policy to bribery and corruption, we 

have put in place effective monitoring and management 

control systems to detect bribery, fraud or other malpractice 

activities directly at the source.

We have established a whistle-blowing mechanism for 

employees and any other concerned stakeholders such as 

customers and their families, suppliers, competitors and 

contractors.

The Group is proactive in ensuring its compliance with all 

relevant laws and regulations. Our management team is 

responsible to review and monitor the Group’s policies and 

practices in respect to legal and regulatory requirements 

across all operations.

Any non-compliance of the relevant laws and regulations

Compliance with Laws and Regulations

The Company has not received any correspondences or 

notifications in relation to any non-compliance of legal

whistle- blowing letters during the year.

The Employee Handbook details our expected standards 

of employee’s professional behavior towards our business 

partners whom we have business dealings with, to the 

community whom we serve and towards each other as 

employees of the Company. Above all, we are inculcated 

with strong corporate values to act with integrity.

Act and Singapore Companies Act.

GOVERNANCE

Any new enactment of or changes to the relevant laws and 

regulations will be communicated to all operations and 

management staff via emails and small group meetings. 

Such communication is necessary to ensure that all staff 

are aware of the changes and can carry out the necessary 

steps and actions to ensure compliance.

The Group recognizes the importance of risk management 

and how business risks may adversely affect Chasen’s 

business performance.

While it is the responsibility of the Audit Committee, as 

delegated by the Board of Directors, to oversee the 

effectiveness of our risk management and internal controls. 

The core function of internal audit is the responsibility of

adopt a responsible waste management process within 

our business operations.

We will be reviewing and fine tuning our waste 

management system to ensure optimal recycling for the 

all the raw materials, mainly wood and steel, are properly 

disposed or recycled.

In FY 2019 alone, we have recycled 5.75kg of waste in 

Singapore, a decrease in 14.8% of waste from the previous 

year.

Paper Usage

We have launched our Go-Green initiatives across all 

our operations and Corporate Office. The implemented 

initiatives aim to encourage the ‘Reuse’, ‘Recycle’ and 

‘Reduce’ of papers through the following ways: 

• ‘Reduce’ the use of papers through double-sided 

printing and print only when necessary.

• ‘Reuse’ the blank side of printed papers for non- 

confidential and draft documents. We plan to roll 

out the daily operations reports to be electronic and 

paperless form, going forward.

In Singapore, we have successfully recycled 20kg of paper 

in FY2019, a decrease of 69% from the past year. This 

reﬂect an efficiency in the paper usage of the company as 

there are less waste paper to be recycled.

development for our workforce. However, in FY2019, 

our total training hours and average training hours per 

employee had declined due to the increase in our staff 

strength.
