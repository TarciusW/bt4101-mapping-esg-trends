ENGRO CORPORATION LIMITED

Sustainability Report 2020



EnGro was incorporated on 27 November 1973 under 

the name SsangYong Cement (S) Pte. Ltd., and later 

converted into a public limited company on 31 May 1983 

and assumed the name SsangYong Cement (S) Ltd.

In 1976, the Company started off with manufacturing OPC 

but from 2003 onwards, it ceased production of OPC 

and offered high performance blended cement, Ready-

Mix Concrete (RMC), low carbon Ground Granulated 

Blast-furnace Slag (GGBS), microfine cement and other 

innovative construction materials.

In 2002, the Company marked the beginning of a new 

chapter as it witnessed the end of the Singapore-Korea 

partnership over the Company’s 30-year history. 

ABOUT ENGRO

OUR VISION

To be the preferred integral partner of 

innovation and sustainable material 

solutions.

OUR MISSION

To provide integrated material solutions 

that are value-adding, sustainable and 

cost-effective.

In 2005, the Company changed its name to EnGro 

Corporation Limited with a new logo that reflects its 

vision of growth in North Asia and growth through 

strategic partnerships. The striking blue and orange 

curves symbolise EnGro and its partners. The curve 

design of the logo simulates the hemisphere of a globe 

reflecting EnGro’s determination to expand globally. 

Over the years, EnGro diversified its business by 

investing in specialty polymer, venture capital activity 

focusing on info-com, property developments as well as 

food and beverage.

The “Building Sustainability” corporate tagline reflects 

EnGro’s commitment towards promoting green and 

achieving the triple bottom-line equilibrium of PEOPLE - 

PLANET - PROFIT.

formal and informal feedback from both internal and 

external stakeholders throughout the year to determine 

the material issues in the report. The Committee is 

supported by a cross-functional team that gathers and 

verifies the data. 

In preparing the Report, we continue to focus on 

communicating value creation through our ESG 

strategies. The Report covers the ESG performance of

OUR BUSINESS

Doing our business with integrity

ETHICAL BUSINESS CONDUCT &amp; COMPLIANCE

EnGro upholds our commitment towards corporate 

governance which is in accordance with our continuing 

obligation as a company listed on the SGX. We go beyond 

the basics in regulatory compliance and have established 

a robust internal system, governed by the board and 

senior management, that diligently cross-checks our 

compliance to regulations in various countries that we 

operate in. EnGro’s goal is to ensure that Management 

maintains a sound system of risk management and 

internal controls to safeguard shareholders’ interests and 

the Company’s assets. We have set up a risk assessment 

structure in the form of an Enterprise Risk Management 

(ERM) Committee comprising the key Heads of 

Departments. The ERM Committee regularly reviews the 

key risk areas that affect the Group’s business. The ERM 

committee submits its findings to the Audit Committee 

(AC) Chairman and the Board of Directors for review and 

comments on a quarterly basis. 

All of our employees also have access to an anonymous 

whistleblowing channel in the event that they would 

like to report on any unethical practices or misconduct. 

EnGro’s whistleblowing policy is designed for employees 

raising concerns without fear of reprisal, to an internal 

authority (Chairman of Audit Committee, Chairman &amp; 

CEO and the Internal Auditor). Employees can choose to 

voice their grievance to their supervisors or anonymously 

through an electronic mail box of the Company. The 

whistleblowing policy is reviewed annually to ensure its 

effectiveness and relevance to the dynamic environment. 

Anti-Corruption (GRI 205-3)

By adhering to laws, regulations, guidelines and 

specifications relevant to EnGro’s businesses, it ensures 

that the Group’s long-standing reputation is intact and 

continues to be preserved. In our view, a strong and 

ethical reputation forms an integral element of our core 

values of “Harmony, Trust, Excellence, and Win-Win”, 

which enhance our ability to attract strong partners 

SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS 

to expand our various businesses and attract relevant 

personnel to join our ever-growing capable workforce. 

When new employees join the Company, they undergo 

education and training that includes the Group’s policies 

relating to anti-corruption, bribery, explanations of rights 

and interests as well as labour standards. In FY2020, we 

have no confirmed cases of corruption, and no cases 

where employees or business partners were dismissed 

or terminated due to violations related to corruption.

Environmental Compliance, Socioeconomic Compliance 

(GRI 307-1, GRI 419-1)

We closely follow legal and regulatory changes while 

operating in strict compliance with local laws and 

regulations, with the goal of achieving zero violations. 

The Group requires each department and subsidiary to 

report on all lawsuits and claims as well as the status of 

any legal disputes. The corporate office then follows up 

on each of these issues and takes action when necessary. 

In FY2020, there were neither significant fines nor non-

monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws and 

regulations in the environmental or social and economic 

area.

ENGRO CORPORATION LIMITED

Sustainability Report 2020

BUSINESS EXCELLENCE 

The Group’s revenue fell 26.2 per cent from S$131.3 million in FY2019 to S$96.9 million in FY2020. However the Group 

recorded a profit after tax (PAT) of S$22.0 million in year ended 31 December 2020. This was achieved largely through 

venture capital investment gains and profits of the joint venture property development project in Tangshan, China. 

An overview of EnGro’s performance in FY2020 can be found on page 7 of the Annual Report. 

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the construction industry amidst a 

global health and economic crisis. Even as the construction industry undergoes recovery, the disruption of materials 

supply will inevitably result in price escalation. The additional safety management measures that EnGro has to put in 

place, complying with social distancing and other regulations (e.g. reduced workforce etc.) to ensure a safe working 

environment would also impact on the overall cost of operations. Under such difficult circumstances we will strive to 

maximise profits while reducing costs through strong relationships with our suppliers.

EnGro offers various employee benefit programs, covering each stage of life from hiring to retirement. EnGro 

funds or subsidises programs and clubs that bring together people with shared interests to foster better workplace 

communication. Employee benefit programs have also been developed in line with each site’s needs. In addition 

to providing employee benefits which are required by the local regulations, EnGro also provides certain non-

Employee Development (GRI 404-1)

EnGro seeks to hire and retain talent that can drive globalisation and innovation in its businesses with the ultimate 

goal of sustainable growth. With this in mind, we follow a uniform policy for hiring, job placement and human 

resource development. The Group has established various programs and systems, such as a career matching system 

to support the continued employment of each and every employee so that they remain motivated and can maximise 

their skills and abilities over the long term. Specialised training is provided for employees engaged in different types

Health and Safety of Employees

At EnGro, the various functions and departments work 

hand in hand to support safety and health. We have 

established detailed rules and regulations regarding 

occupational safety and health, which are also reflected 

in agreements with labor unions. Respective division 

General Managers who are part of the management 

team will report directly to the CEO on health and safety 

matters for each site. Each site establishes their own 

policies and plans regarding health and safety while also 

promoting the elimination of occupational accidents and 

improvement of health. 

Occupational Health &amp; Safety (GRI 403-1, GRI 403-2, GRI 

403-3, GRI 403-4, GRI 403-5, GRI 403-6, GRI 403-9) 

EnGro places significant emphasis on the health and 

safety of its employees. Management ensures that 

the Company complies with legal requirements for all 

safety and health matters and educate our employees 

to observe safety requirements at all times. Since 

2012, EnGro’s operations in Singapore have obtained 

OHSAS 18001 certification for Occupational Health and 

Safety Management Systems and these sites have 

now transitioned and certified to ISO 45001. At EnGro’s 

production facilities, employees attend toolbox meeting 

on a daily basis, where safety advisories and reminders 

are communicated to employees. 

Before commencing any work, supervisors or project 

managers must complete a hazard analysis or risk 

assessment of the work activities and submit to the 

appropriate EnGro management for approval. This 

requirement is applicable to both EnGro’s employees 

as well as its contractors. All accident cases have to 

be reported to the supervisors and plant managers 

and investigations are carried out to ensure corrective 

actions have been identified and implemented.

There were no cases of reportable accidents or injuries in 

FY2020. 

We aim to maintain a “Zero Accident” record for all our 

sites. In order to achieve this target, EnGro has taken the 

following initiatives:

1. 

Safety officers are deployed at our sites to educate 

and identify safety gaps and work towards closing all 

occupational health and safety gaps.

2. 

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are made 

available at all sites with safety rules embedded in 

all the work processes to ensure that safety rules are 

strictly and consistently observed.

3. 

Regular in-house safety trainings are conducted and 

safety instruction diagrams in are clearly visible near 

various equipment for easy reference. 

4. Supervisors are sent for safety training to upgrade 

their skills and to keep abreast of latest safety 

regulations.

OUR ENVIRONMENT

Protecting the Environment

More than three decades ago, when the Company was 

still under the auspices of SsangYong Cement (S) Limited, 

the Company took its first steps to go green with the 

intent to promote Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag 

(GGBS), a low carbon yet high performance material 

that could partially displace Ordinary Portland Cement 

(OPC), which had a high carbon footprint of almost 20 

times that of GGBS. From 2002 onwards, our Go Green 

program began to intensify after we expanded into North 

Asia, particular in China, where we have established 

18 green cement (i.e. GGBS) plants with a total GGBS 

production capacity of 10.8 million tons p.a. In 2008, we 

were the first among our peers to adopt independent 

carbon footprint assessment for our products, and 

provide third party assessed carbon footprint certificates 

to our customers for the products they procure from us. 

In 2007, various EnGro’s green products were the first in 

the industry to receive the Singapore Green Labelling 

Scheme accreditation for its sustainability qualities and 

similarly also achieved the “4 ticks” or “Leader” rating 

from the Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC). 

EnGro and its subsidiary companies have invariably 

sought to obtain international certifications, such as the 

ISO, to demonstrate our environmental commitment. 

Our Singapore operations were certified ISO 14001 since 

2012 and we have also obtained ISO certification for our 

Malaysia concrete operations. To closely communicate 

the results of our green initiatives, EnGro chose to 

implement independent carbon footprint assessments 

at product and company level to communicate the 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) footprint of our operations 

and products to our stakeholders. A product Life Cycle 

Assessment (LCA) has also been done for selected 

products in accordance to international standards 

ISO14040/44 and PAS2050. In 2012, we were early 

adopters of the ISO14064 to assess the GHG emissions 

relating to organisational emission. These assessments 

have enabled EnGro to better quantify and understand 

the opportunities for GHG reduction, which have in 

turn guided us in more efficient management of our 

resources. 

We strive to be at the forefront of product innovations 

through intensive research and development to develop 

our expertise and in-house capability. We rely on our 

knowledge-based culture of continuous learning 

and spirit of innovation to develop environmentally-

friendly products. Together with our research team 

and external partners, EnGro constantly develops new 

environmentally-friendly solutions to address new 

applications that generate long-term benefits to our 

stakeholders. We believe in a collective effort with the 

community in adopting green and going the extra 

mile, and upholding corporate governance practices to 

achieve a balance between People, Planet, and Profit, 

that is, the Triple Bottomline.

Energy &amp; Emissions (GRI 302-1, GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2)

Recognising the link between our business activities, 

energy consumption, and GHG emissions, EnGro strives 

to lower our GHG emissions at every stage of the product 

lifecycle. EnGro’s green cement products utilise recycled 

materials (such as GGBS) as ingredient materials and 

Top-Mix Concrete uses EnGro’s low-carbon VCEM 

product in green concrete products. This results in 

products of lower carbon-content, while maintaining and 

even improving the performance and functionality of the 

products. 

Our overall energy consumption from our offices and 

manufacturing sites in Singapore and Malaysia for 

FY2020 was approximately 49,546 GJ while the overall 

Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emission was 2,910 tCO2e and 

1,328 tCO2e respectively. For a better comparison and 

understanding of our GHG emissions, we have also, 

in this year’s report, included the performance data 

from FY2019 emissions. There has been a 28 per cent 

reduction in the total energy consumption for FY2020 as 

compared to FY2019, largely in part due to the shutdown 

of operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, 

we have also seen a 25 per cent reduction in the overall 

GHG emissions for FY2020 as compared to FY2019.

ENGRO CORPORATION LIMITED

Sustainability Report 2020

EnGro has been providing five bond-free scholarships annually to the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) since 

2016. Each scholarship, is applicable for one academic year and can be used for the recipient’s annual tuition fees for 

specified undergraduate programmes at SIT. As the Group strongly emphasises innovation as part of its culture, we 

provide a great working environment for graduates to display their talent and creativity. 

OUR RESPONSE DURING COVID-19

During COVID-19, our offices and plants in Singapore and Malaysia complied fully with local regulations relating to 

Safe Management Measures (SMM) and social distancing. Respective department representatives were tasked to 

establish procedures to ensure social distancing of at least 1 metre between persons at all times. Various types of 

work arrangement including work from home, team rotations and staggered working hours were implemented so 

that only 30 per cent of our employees were in the office (in Malaysia) at any one time. Employees have also been 

encouraged to conduct meetings virtually so as to reduce physical contact and office-based staff worked from home 

unless they needed access to specialised systems at company premises which could not be accessed from home, or 

they had to be present in office to fulfil certain legal requirements. For job roles or functions where employees were 

unable to work from home, staggered working times and break times were imposed so as to reduce congregation of 

employees at common spaces, and also to avoid commingling of staff working in different teams.

In addition to ensuring an adequate supply of appropriate Personal Protection Equipment (“PPE”), surgical masks 

and hand sanitisers in our offices, all our employees have also been trained and briefed on the correct use of the PPE. 

At our operations in Singapore, employees had to undergo a fortnightly swab test and attend a COVID-19 training 

arranged by the Ministry of Manpower. All our plant managers attended the safe management officer course and 

conducted additional COVID-19 checks during the routine SMM inspections.
