BOARD STATEMENT 

 

Sustainability Strategy 

The Group is committed to building on the efforts in sustainability and progress made in the 

past years. We recognise the importance of sustainable growth and are dedicated to working 

towards it. As we strive towards a sustainable future, we hope to obtain valuable input and 

perspective from stakeholders to help shape our sustainability agenda and strategy.  

 

Subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, it has disrupted our normal course of 

work. However, the wellbeing of our employees remains our top priority and we have 

implemented a series of safety management measures and provided our employees with the 

necessary support to telecommute while providing quality content to our readers during this 

COVID-19 outbreak.  

 

On behalf of the Board and Management of the Company, we wish to thank all who have been 

with us throughout our sustainability journey. We look forward to your continued partnership 

and support.

The Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation and 

determined material ESG factors. The Board continues to maintain an effective role in setting 

goals, reviewing and advising on overall strategies and directions. The Board oversees the 

management and monitoring of ESG factors highlighted in the Sustainability Report to ensure 

that the objectives are in line with the Group’s commitments to sustainable development.      

 

Sustainability Factors 

We are committed in maintaining good corporate governance, transparency and accountability, 

and do so using a set of internal policies, structure and processes, which include risk 

management, data protection and anti-corruption policies. With good corporate governance 

practices in place, we ensure that the material ESG factors are tracked and monitored closely. 

In this Sustainability Report, we look to the next phase of our sustainability journey by reviewing 

the strategies and initiatives and discussing the progress we have made relating to each factor

continuous internal and external stakeholder engagement and conclude that they continue to 

be relevant to our business and stakeholders. The following are the ESG factors that we have 

identified:

ANTI-CORRUPTION  

 

The Group does not tolerate corruption in any form and strives to conduct our business with 

utmost integrity and transparency. This has been made clear to all our employees and they 

are required to strictly abide by professional ethics and eliminate any corruption and bribery.  

We stay well informed with the recent developments of relevant regulations and Companies 

Act through updates received from Company Secretary on a half-yearly basis. Other anti-

corruption efforts include periodic updates to the Board on strategic developments and 

performance measurements by the senior management, allowing the Board to monitor and 

assess potential risks which may arise.  

 

A whistleblowing policy is put into place to provide a safe channel for employees to report and 

discourage practices and activities that are in violation of company work ethics and rules. 

Employees are encouraged to report any unlawful, unethical or fraudulent activities or 

practices with whistle-blower’s identity held in strictest confidence and these whistle-blowing 

reports will be submitted to the Audit Committee. Independent investigations for appropriate 

remedial and follow-up actions will then be conducted. Furthermore, employees must declare 

conflict of interests on an ad-hoc basis, if applicable. All employees including the management 

team and the Board are required to make declarations on any existing and potential interest 

in companies and the nature of the interest.  

 

There were no reported incidents of corruption during FY2020. There were also no whistle-

blowing reports received in FY2020.

necessary.

Environment conservation forms an integral part of our sustainability plan. We are fully aware 

of our responsibility to conserve the environment and reduce negative environmental impact 

at our workplace. Thus, we monitor our energy consumption closely to minimise any energy 

wastages. The Company continues to utilise energy-efficient fittings and products with Green 

labels. Additionally, the Group recognises that reducing carbon emissions in our daily 

operations has a positive effect on climate change. All employees stringently comply with the 

Group’s policy of saving energy to ensure power is turned off when electrical appliances are 

not in use and to conserve water usage. The following depicts the Group’s electricity and water 

consumption for FY2020 and FY2019:

We recorded a notable drop of (756 kwh) in electricity consumption in FY2020 (total

LOCAL COMMUNITIES 

 

In FY2020, Inovatif publishes 3 in-house publications, namely “Smart Investor”, “Calibre” and 

“Feng”. Our extensive coverage ranges from professional topics such as business and 

investment to more family-oriented topics such as health and wellness and cultures. Ultilising 

our market advantages, Inovatif has been promoting awareness about the local communities 

to our readers by incorporating local culture and society relevance into our publications.  

Furthermore, the Group aims to produce content which have positive impact on the society. 

We strive to include educational, inspirational and motivational contents in our publications, 

enabling us to reach a large audience. In line with the launch of Malaysia's National Strategy 

for Financial Literacy to improve the financial literacy of Malaysians in July 2019, we have 

ensured that our products continue to promote financial education and investment knowledge 

to the readers. Collaboration with local authorities had helped boost our reputation in the 

industry. During the year, we continue to be the media partner that promotes the local finance 

and investment industry such as Malaysian Industrial Relation Awards, Financial Planning 

Symposium, FSMOne Recommended Unit Trust Awards as well as other related business 

events and seminars. As part of our quality assurance efforts, we also target to minimise 

unnecessary errors in our publications and ensure that the written contents is fit for 

communicating the correct message to the target group  by proof-reading the contents before 

we publish them.  

We also seek to create long-term economic benefits for our communities through recruitment 

of local talents for our publishing team and engaging local suppliers, supporting a reliable local 

supply network to drive economic growth. For our events, we maintain our outreach to local 

community through constant lookouts for local talents in delivering impeccable services to our 

clients.  With stricter COVID-19 restrictions, several of our media events, such as Financial 

Planning Symposiums were cancelled, however, we were still providing media support to 

promote the events via online mode.
