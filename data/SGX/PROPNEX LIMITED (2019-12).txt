ABOUT 

THIS REPORT


2020 marks another milestone in PropNex’s history as the Group celebrates 20 years of trusted service in real estate. We are 

delighted to share that PropNex has a stronger foothold in the Singapore’s property industry -- closing an unprecendented number 

of transactions and producing 21 Millionaire Achievers in FY2019. Today, we continue to be the market leader in new launches and 

in attracting record numbers of experienced and new salespersons to join PropNex. Despite the cooling measures and weaker 

market sentiments, it is commendable that we achieved a revenue of $419.8 million for FY2019.

While the market was impacted by the July 2018 cooling measures, PropNex was able to harness our exceptional assets – leveraging 

on the strong branding and talent of our people across the Company, to win in the marketplace.

A cornerstone of our success is our focus in sustainability. Sustainability is fundamental to achieving our long-term vision of 

success. We have incorporated considerations for social and governance factors in the way we grow our business, cultivate our 

people and serve our communities. This is based on the belief that PropNex will thrive when our people are motivated, committed 

and empowered to continuously improve themselves and give back to society.

With support of the Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”), composed of our management team, we have considered sustainability 

issues as part of our strategic formulation, determined the material ESG factors, overseen the management and monitoring of the 

ESG factors. The SSC will continue to assist the Board in integrating ESG considerations into our strategic formulation, as well as 

monitor, manage and report on our ESG performance.

Our commitment to service excellence has enabled us to become Singapore’s largest home-grown listed real estate agency and we 

will continue to drive our business for years to come. We take pride in our motto “Service You Trust” and together with our Core 

Values, our business decisions are made with the aim of taking pole position in the market.

We are pleased to share with you PropNex’s approach to sustainability and efforts taken to be a sustainable business in the Group’s 

Sustainability Report.

BOARD 

STATEMENT


PropNex celebrated a truly commendable performance in 2019. Together, as one PropNex family, we achieved numerous 

milestones, including closing a record number of transactions, doubling the number of millionaires in 2019 over the previous year 

with 21 well-rewarded salespersons, continuing to be the market leader in new launches and being the only real estate agency in 

Singapore with more than S$500.0 million in gross commission value of the Group’s total property transactions1.

2019 was also a significant year for PropNex with the unity of different divisions into PropNex United #1PNG. Leaders and 

salespersons from different backgrounds come united and worked closely together under the umbrella of the Powerful Negotiators 

(PNG) division, as one PropNex family.

As the market leader and a respected real estate agency among our peers, PropNex welcomed esteemed Guests-of-Honour such as 

Minister Heng Swee Keat and Minister Josephine Teo during our 2019 PropNex quarterly conventions. They addressed a combined 

number of 7,000 salespersons, witnessed our philanthropic contribution of S$500,000 to Community Chest and honoured top 

performers of the agency.

We ended 2019 on a strong note, establishing ourselves yet again as the industry’s favourite real estate agency with a salesforce 

of 8,324 PropNexians (as at 1 January 2020) – the highest number of real estate salespersons in one agency. This is a 12.5 per cent 

increase when compared to the size of our salesforce as at the end of 2018. Thousands of customers, agents and employees are 

attracted to the solid reputation of the PropNex brand, built upon our amazing family-like culture, strong training and development 

programmes and powerful IT platforms.

We anticipate an exciting year ahead in 2020 as we celebrate our 20 years of trusted service in the real estate industry. The theme 

for the year “Building Legacies for Generations” reflects how PropNex has successfully helped hundreds of thousands of home 

owners and property investors to find their dream homes and investments, groomed the next generation of trusted real estate 

salespersons to continue the heritage of professional service and established a strong legacy of the PropNex brand across the 

region, with our partners in Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.

The achievements we have accomplished today, after 20 years in the real estate business, are made possible by our very own 

salespersons, managers, leaders and also all our PropNex staff who have continued to trust in the PropNex brand. It is through 

their belief and efforts that have made us number one in the industry.

We will continue to fly the PropNex flag high, backed by their trust and support, as well as that of our clients, developers and 

partners.

With Service You Trust,

Ismail Gafoor

Executive Chairman and CEO

PropNex Limited

1 Total property transactions refer to the total number of Option-to-Purchase issued by property sellers and developers to buyers but yet to be 

exercised for that financial year.

SUSTAINABILTY 

AT PROPNEX


This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of SGX-ST Listing Rules 711A and 711B, and with reference to 

the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards. The GRI Standards were selected as it is an internationally recognised reporting 

framework that covers a comprehensive range of sustainability disclosures.

To identify and prioritise material ESG factors that are important to our business and key stakeholders, we have implemented a 

three-step materiality assessment process that is in line with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards’ Materiality Principle.

The assessment for 2019 yielded seven material ESG factors. This year, we have added Environment as a material factor, given the 

reliance of our business on the physical landscape. We will continue to review the list of material ESG factors annually to ensure 

their relevance.

ENGAGING OUR 

STAKEHOLDERS


We help our people establish a fulfilling career at PropNex by offering them the care, guidance and resources they need to 

continuously improve themselves, exercise entrepreneurship and achieve autonomy.

EMPLOYMENT

The collective sum of our people – including their life experiences, knowledge, creativity and talent – represents the PropNex 

culture, reputation and achievements. We are committed to recruiting, cultivating and retaining staff and salespersons that believe 

in and practise our core values, and who consistently strive to provide service that our customers trust.

Recruitment

Staff

Our Recruitment &amp; Selection Policy and Diversity Policy guides the recruitment of our employees. We embrace and encourage 

our employees’ differences in age, colour, ethnicity, marital status, gender, national origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual 

orientation and other characteristics that make our employees unique.

At PropNex, we take cultivating a culture of diversity and inclusion seriously. Employees who believe they have been subjected to 

any kind of discrimination that conflicts with our Diversity Policy are encouraged to seek assistance from their immediate superior 

or the Human Resources Department. Any employee found to have exhibited any inappropriate conduct or behaviour against 

others may be subject to disciplinary action.

Our referral programme encourages our staff and salespersons to recommend suitable candidates to apply for job openings at 

PropNex. Upon appointment and subsequent confirmation in the position, a $500 referral fee will be awarded to the referee.

Salespersons

Our cultivation of salespersons begins even before they become a PropNexian and extends to providing assistance to new real 

estate salespersons (RES) candidates. Any person interested in becoming a RES is welcome to participate in our Real Estate 

Programme in RES Study Groups and we train and guide new RES candidates in preparation for the RES exam. Once they pass the 

RES exam, they will be eligible to participate in our orientation programme (Success Seminar) and activities like the Accelerated 

Closing System (ACS).

All employment conditions, including responsibilities and the split of commission, are stated in the Associate Agreement that our 

salespersons sign with us. We require our salespersons to review their contract with us at least once every two years to ensure that 

they are reminded of and fully understand their employment conditions. For our Team Leaders, we ask that they sign an additional 

contract when they become Team Leaders to ensure they understand their role and responsibilities.

raise their concerns about possible improprieties and misconduct.

SERVING OUR 

CUSTOMERS


PropNex strives to be a positive corporate citizen and influence, both for our society today as well as future generations. We do 

this by championing our core values of respect and concern for others, in reaching out and helping less privileged communities.

Since 2000, we have been involved in various charitable events and championed numerous meaningful causes, in Singapore and 

overseas. Our CSR Philosophy, “Empowering Future Generations through Education”, guides our CSR initiatives. We review current 

initiatives and plan for future CSR direction and initiatives during our strategic meetings.

PropNex firmly believes in contributing back to the communities around us and in which we operate, at the company, team and 

individual levels. We can only truly help our communities when a culture of giving is instilled in each and every one of our employees 

and salespersons. PropNex has established programmes and initiatives to enable everyone within the PropNex family to easily be 

involved with and contribute to our CSR initiatives.

PropNex has adopted Community Chest as its main charity beneficiary 

since 2013. Through Community Chest, we support myriad social service 

programmes that assist over 300,000 people in need in Singapore. We 

have also expressed a preference for adopting schools and centres that 

cater to children with special needs and disabilities as beneficiaries, to 

further align our contribution with our CSR philosophy.

Continuing our commitment of an annual $500,000 in donations since 

2015, we contributed another $$529,179 to Community Chest in 2019 

through our monthly SHARE and Sponsor-A-Child programme. The funds 

raised will help to improve facilities and programmes provided at our 

adopted beneficiaries, Pathlight School, AWWA, Care Corner Student Care 

Centre, SHINE and Metta Welfare Association.

In addition to monetary contributions, we also took 70 children from 

Community Chest Day Care Centre out for a Christmas Art Jam Funtastic 

Day on 4 December 2019, allowing our salespersons and staff to interact 

and engage with these children.

PropNex has won the Community Chest Platinum Award in 2019 in 

recognition of our corporate philanthropic efforts.

EMBRACING OUR 

COMMUNITY


Technology in the real estate realm has disrupted and transformed how business is conducted, and will continue to play a pivotal 

role in the way corporations conduct their business.

One of our key strategies is the empowerment of our people by enhancing our technological capabilities. We are committed 

to improving our salespersons’ productivity by providing relevant and reliable technological support. This in turn helps them to 

provide better customer service for their clients.

Our Information Technology (IT) Working Committee has developed the PropNex IT Roadmap to guide our future investments 

in technological and digital innovation. In consultation with our salespersons, we identified their needs and challenges. These 

were then translated into modules and focal points in our Roadmap. We continuously evaluate our IT needs and calibrate our IT 

Roadmap accordingly throughout the year.

Long term target

We aim to achieve the following through the implementation of our IT Roadmap:

• 

Digitalise manual procedures and processes;

• 

Reduce redundancies in procedures and processes;

• 

Facilitate the collaboration and sharing of resources amongst salespersons;

• 

Enable consumers to access relevant property information more easily.

As of 2019, we have developed several technological solutions that aim to assist our salespersons, as summarized below.

INNOVATING ON 

THE DIGITAL FRONT


Rampant use of energy from non-renewable sources can cause global warming and, through the resultant melting of the polar ice 

caps, subsequent sea level rise. As a small island state of which a third is below five metres above means sea level, climate change 

can adversely impact Singapore and the main business of PropNex: real estate.

2019 is the first year where we began measuring our environmental data. We have logged our electrical consumption captured at 

various corporate premises at HDB Hub Levels 10, 11 and 18, Branch Office and General Magnetic Building. Tabulations were based 

on utility bills from the electricity supplier.

All electricity is purchased from the national grid and is produced almost entirely by the combustion of natural gas, which is 

classified as Scope 2 emissions.

A total 660,887.7 kWh of electricity was used, which translates to 141.2 CO2e.

No incident of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations were identified within the reporting year.

ENVIRONMENT


As the nation’s largest real estate agency, PropNex fulfils an important role within the real estate sector by facilitating the buying, 

selling, renting and leasing of property in Singapore.

In line with our vision of having the strength of a big company and our status as a listed entity on the Singapore Exchange, PropNex 

also contributes to the economy by providing gainful employment to thousands of employees and salespersons.

In FY2019, the Group recorded a revenue of S$419.8 million, against S$431.5 million recorded in FY2018, as a result of a decrease in 

commission income from agency services of S$29.5 million year-on-year to S$278.3 million in FY2019. This was partially offset by the 

increase in commission income from project marketing services of approximately S$17.6 million year-on-year to S$134.9 million in 

FY2019. The Group’s salesforce grew from 7,400 as at 1 January 2019 to 8,324 as at 1 January 2020. Consequently, net profit after 

tax came in at S$21.1 million for FY2019, compared to S$21.9 million in FY2018.

You may refer to our financial results announcements on SGXNET or PropNex’s corporate website for more information.

No incident of non-compliance with socio-economic laws and regulations were identified within the reporting year.
