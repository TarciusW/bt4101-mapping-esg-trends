To determine this in AMOS’ ﬁrst year report after the 

merger, we conducted a formal materiality assessment 

which was supported by an external consultant. 

The material factors 

reported in AMOS’ report 

last year were reassessed 

and new factors were 

considered based on a peer 

and industry review.

Through discussions with 

senior management, the 

factors were deliberated in 

relation to the signiﬁcance 

of their impact and 

importance.

The list of material factors 

was circulated to the Board 

for feedback and to ensure 

completeness and relevance 

of factors selected.

After discussion with the 

Board, we concluded the 

ﬁnal material factors to be 

reported for AMOS. 

The Sustainability 

Committee will re-examine 

the material factors in 

relation to stakeholder 

feedback and market 

conditions on an on-going 

basis.

Why this is material?

AMOS is a global provider of supplies, services and 

solutions to major international shipping ﬂeets and 

o shore oil and gas operators.  Our fulﬁlment center in 

Singapore operates as our headquarters, warehousing, 

cold chain storage, and provisioning.  There are two main 

sources of energy that we consume.  Our few chartered 

vessels along with our ﬂeet of vehicles are run on diesel, 

while our o

ce premises, warehouse and fulﬁlment 

centre which are all located in the same area primarily 

use electricity.  Reducing our total energy consumption 

helps us to not only reduce our carbon footprint and 

impact on the environment, but to also drive signiﬁcant 

cost savings and impact our economic performance.

Management Approach

We strive to lower our energy usage by increasing 

awareness among employees, implementing energy 

e

cient technologies and leveraging carbon o sets. 

The current practices in place are as follows:

Awareness Among Employees

• Display of energy saving posters and other labelling 

in prominent spots at AMOS o

ce and warehouse to 

remind employees at all times on energy conservation.

• Improve awareness of AMOS employees in energy 

savings by yearly brieﬁngs.

• Encourage employees to reduce energy consumption

uent &amp; Waste Management

Why this is Material?

  We are conscious that non-hazardous waste is generated 

from our operations.  Such waste primarily include metal 

scrap, plastics, paper and wood amongst others.  Any 

mishandling in disposal may result in environmental 

damage through land and air pollution.  We also see 

waste reduction as a way to reduce operational costs 

and foster innovation in design.

Management Approach

Measures currently in place at the company include: 

• Waste segregation bins (metal, wood, plastic and 

paper) are placed at various locations.  These bins are 

collected daily by a licensed recycling contractor.

• Water dispensers are placed at every o

ce to minimize 

usage of plastic bottles.

Management Approach

We strive to lower our energy usage by increasing 

awareness among employees, implementing energy 

e

cient technologies and leveraging carbon o sets. 

The current practices in place are as follows:

AMOS is a global provider of supplies, services and 

solutions to major international shipping ﬂeets and 

o shore oil and gas operators.  Our “fulﬁlment center” 

in Singapore 

operates 

as 

our 

headquarters, 

warehousing, cold chain storage, and provisioning.  

There are two main sources of energy that we consume.  

Our few chartered vessels along with our ﬂeet of 

vehicles are run on diesel, while our o

ce premises, 

warehouse 

and 

“ fulﬁlment centre” which are all 

located in the same area primarily use electricity.  

Reducing our total energy consumption helps us to not 

only reduce our carbon footprint and impact on the 

environment, but to also drive signiﬁcant cost savings 

and impact our economic performance.

Our People

Employees are one of our most vital assets. We are 

committed to fair, equitable and quality employment 

practices in our recruitment process to attract, develop 

and retain a talented, innovative, ﬂexible and motivated 

workforce in every country that we operate in.  

We embrace diversity and inclusion, aim to attract and 

retain the best people to work with us, develop their 

talents and abilities, and most importantly, watch out 

for their safety and well-being.

Management Approach

As we go through this transition, we are ramping up 

engagement with our employees to understand and 

address their challenges.  We are in the process of 

harmonizing and streamlining policies and practices 

along with roles and responsibilities across business 

segments.  We are also in the process of refreshing our 

employee code of conduct, KPIs and appraisal process.  

Overall, we continue to practice fair employment, 

provide employment beneﬁts, reward their performance 

and build a diverse culture in our eforts towards this 

material factor. 

Fair Employment

We reward employees fairly based on their ability, 

performance, contribution and experience.  All our 

employees are given employment contracts with 

clear terms and conditions and equal employment 

opportunities that are clearly cited in the employee 

handbook.  We abide by labour laws in Singapore and 

adapt the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive 

Employment Practices (“TAFEP”).

Employee Beneﬁts

Ensuring employee welfare and beneﬁts are an 

important priority.  We provide insurance for all our 

employees and  we have also increased the number of 

days of annual leave since the merger.  Furthermore, we 

have been implementing free lunch and fruit days.

Our industry is foreign labour intensive, and we see their

We provide them with housing allowance with the 

purpose of enabling better ﬂexibility in their choice of 

living.  We also provide transport to all our employees 

from MRT station to their workplace as we understand 

most of our employees are reliant on public transport 

and do not have their own vehicle.

Diversity

We encourage diversity in respect of race, age, skills, 

experience and gender.  Therefore, part of the post-

merger eforts are on rearranging job roles as we take 

into account every employees’ strength and foreseeable 

contribution to the newly merged organization. 

Target

 • Extending our existing internship programmes to 

more polytechnic colleges and universities to attract 

talent.

• Completion of the employee code of conduct.

1 / Employee Welfare &amp; Talent Retention

Why is it Material?

Attracting and retaining talent has been a challenge 

in the maritime and ofshore industry over the past 

few years. High rates of turnover and the inability 

to attract the right talent disrupts the growth of the 

business, hinders succession planning and lowers the 

overall morale of the organization.  These issues are 

further aggravated when an organization goes through 

a structural transformation such as a merger. Often 

employees feel demotivated or insecure and lack clarity 

in terms of roles and responsibilities.  Hence, addressing 

this issue becomes more critical during such times.

3 / Occupational Health and Safety

Why is it Material?

We do not compromise on the safety of our employees 

and workers.  We recognize our industry is prone to 

health and safety risks and hence it is imperative that we 

ensure our employees’ well-being by having stringent 

safety policies in place. 

Management Approach

Operational health and safety is managed holistically 

by all departments whereby all department leads are 

responsible for the safety of employees under their 

charge.  Furthermore, there is a Quality Health Social 

Safety Environment (“QHSSE”) department that is 

responsible to administer and monitor operational 

health and safety performance throughout the 

organization.

AMOS is actively promoting work safety by continuously 

upgrading the skills of our employees in order to increase 

their knowledge and e

ciency in operational safety 

supervision and management through compulsory 

safety courses.  Fire safety drills are conducted twice 

yearly.

The QHSSE department also plays a role in communication 

of QHSSE alerts to the ﬂoor in ensuring employees 

are mindful of safety awareness at all times.  There is a 

designated QHSSE personnel conducting weekly walk-

arounds with department managers to review particular 

work activity or system to ensure safe operations on the 

ﬂoor.  Monthly committee meetings are held to discuss 

workers’ behaviour on safety aspects and reporting of 

any incidents or alert on safety housekeeping matters 

during the daily toolbox meeting.

A Risk Management Organization Chart has been 

introduced for the purpose of conducting risk 

assessments.  At every operational activity, a BizSafe 

Level 2 Trained person, approved by the Team Leader of 

the Risk Management Organization Chart, is given the 

responsibility to conduct risk assessment of that activity.  

The outcome of the risk assessments is briefed to the 

ground workforce.  Generally, risk is assessed by a 5x5 

matrix and control measures are determined by the 

hierarchy of controls. AMOS has been certiﬁed by the 

Workspace Safety and Health Council to have fulﬁlled 

the requirements to attain bizSAFE Level Star and 

obtained the OHSAS 18001:2007 certiﬁcation.

1 / Responsible Supply Chain Management

Why is it Material?

Our supply chain includes a number of parties.  Our 

marine supplies range from technical supplies such as 

steel valves and personal protective equipment (“PPE”) 

to general supplies such as frozen food and water.  

Our rigging, mooring and lifting business segment 

procures rigging equipment, rigging systems along with 

consumables amongst other items.  The large part of our 

suppliers are based overseas. 

We recognize that a signiﬁcant impact on our 

sustainability performance comes from the suppliers 

that we engage.  Furthermore, by ensuring that our 

suppliers provide high standards of product quality, 

health and safety, directly improves what we o er our 

customers.

Management Approach

AMOS has a close relationship with its strategic partners 

and suppliers who are committed to high quality 

and safety standards.  We engage with reputable 

manufacturers and strive for lean procurement to 

support fast turn-around and minimization of wastage.

Prior to engaging with a new supplier, we perform a 

pre-qualiﬁcation assessment as part of our Know Your 

Supplier (“KYS”) policy.  This is through a checklist ﬁlled 

up by the vendor applicants.  After assessment, selected 

vendors are included in the Approved Vendor List 

(“AVL”).  In addition to quality considerations, compliance 

with environmental regulations and health and safety 

practices are key requirements.

We conduct suppliers’ assessments periodically to ensure 

that they continue to deliver high quality products and 

services.  Based on this practice, we constantly monitor 

our AVL in updating new awarded suppliers, removing 

inactive, blacklisted or non-performing or non-

compliant suppliers. 

Performance

During the year, we have a total of 400 new suppliers 

in which all of them are screened using environmental 

criteria covered under ISO. 

Target

We are currently developing a supplier code of 

conduct to incorporate social consideration such as 

child labour policies.  Therefore, in the coming year, 

assessment on new suppliers will also be subjected to 

social considerations.  We are also planning to establish 

surveillance audit for selected critical vendors by QHSSE 

team in e orts to monitor and ensure a sustainable 

supply chain management in place.

2 / Product Quality and Reliability

Why is it Material?

As the marine industry is getting more competitive, 

our customers rely on our brands for safe and quality 

products and services.  We believe we are able to 

d

erentiate ourselves by providing our customers with 

products and services that exceed their expectations, 

hence leading to loyal and committed customer 

relationships that last in the long run.

Management Approach

We use international standards to ensure the quality 

and safety of our products and services.  We reﬂect 

on the periodic assessment of the health and safety 

impacts of our products and services to identify, assess 

and treat all quality and safety-related risks associated 

with our business activities, products and services in a 

responsible manner.

Performance

There were no incidents of non-compliance with 

regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning the 

health and safety impacts of products and services 

within the reporting period.  We have not identiﬁed 

any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary 

codes with respect to health and safety impacts of our 

products and services.

Target

We aim to maintain stringent risk assessments of 

our products and services.  We strive to achieve zero 

reportable incidents of non-compliance concerning the 

health and safety impacts of products and services in 

the upcoming year.

3 / Ethics &amp; Anti-corruption

Why is it Material?

Good corporate governance is an integral element of a 

sound corporation and enables a company to be more 

transparent and forward-looking.  Sound corporate 

governance is also an e ective safeguard against fraud 

and anti-corruption, which are foreseeable risks in our 

industry.  Any failure to comply, can lead to severe 

ﬁnancial and reputational damage to the company.

Management Approach

At AMOS, we are committed to maintaining a high 

standard of corporate governance.  We expect honesty, 

integrity and accountability at every level of the 

company.  The Board and the Management believe that 

an e ective whistle-blowing arrangement will act as a 

deterrent to malpractice and wrongdoing, encourage 

openness, promote transparency, underpin the risk 

management systems of AMOS and enhance its business 

practice, thereby increasing the reputation of AMOS and 

its management. 

The speciﬁc objectives of the policy are:

• To maintain a high standard of corporate governance.

• To provide a channel of communication to the 

employees of AMOS to report fraudulent practices 

and to guide employees on actions to address their 

concerns on suspicious fraudulent activities.

• To provide a process in investigations and 

management reporting.

The whistle-blowing policy can be found on our website 

with details on the scope of the policy, the whistle 

blowing o

cer, what is not covered in the policy, 

administration and whistle-blowing procedures.

Performance

There have been no cases of corruption at AMOS within 

the reporting year.

Target

We aim to maintain zero reportable incidents relating to 

corruption and bribery.
