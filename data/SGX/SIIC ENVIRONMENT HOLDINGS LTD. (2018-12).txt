Overview 

SIIC Environment is a leading integrated operator in the People’s Republic of China (the 

“PRC”)’s water and environmental industry and encompasses a nationwide portfolio of 

about 200 water treatment and supply projects, 7 waste incineration projects and 10 sludge 

treatment projects. These services cover 19 municipalities and provinces in China offered 

through our Central China, South China, North China, Northeast China, East China, Waste 

Incineration Division, and Ranhill Water business units. This management structure enables 

us to manage our day-to-day operations based on specific circumstances, react promptly to 

developments affecting projects, explore new regional and local opportunities and maintain 

strong relationships with local governments and communities.  

 

Business Outlook 

The Company has developmental strategies of expanding across the environmental industry 

value chain, improving operational efficiency and exploring opportunities to invest in the PRC 

and overseas. In line with this strategy, we capitalise on opportunities through successful 

project bids, active mergers and acquisitions, scaling up organic growth and industry 

consolidation. During the Reporting Period, the Company won mandates for 24 greenfield 

concessionary water projects, O&amp;M projects as well as expansion and upgrading of 

wastewater treatment plants in Guangxi, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Heilongjiang, Changchun, 

Jilin, Shandong and Jiangxi Provinces, adding up to a design capacity of 1.04 million tonnes/day 

to the Company’s total design capacity that is now an impressive 11.7 million tonnes/day – 

further cementing our position as one of the leading and largest providers of wastewater 

treatment and related services in the PRC. 

 

Water quality remains a key focus area in the PRC’s environmental sector, in turn supporting 

demand for wastewater treatment technology and management. Under the 13th Five-Year 

Plan, investments in the construction of urban wastewater treatment and recycling facilities 

are expected to reach RMB 565.4 billion, and it is anticipated that the PRC will achieve a 

wastewater treatment rate of 95% in cities and approximately 85% in towns by the end of 

2020 – rising national demand for services that the Company is well-poised to tap into. 

 

The State Council of the PRC has also announced new environmental initiatives that include 

plans for waste reduction and the development of “waste-less cities”. The PRC will also 

accelerate the establishment of a pricing mechanism that can cover the cost of treating 

sewage, sludge and solid waste. The treatment cost is expected to bring revenue to the 

businesses that the Company is expected to be a beneficiary of, as we push for downstream 

integration and further explore opportunities in the sludge treatment and waste-to-energy 

sectors. 

 

Leveraging on its scalability and competencies, SIIC Environment will continue to expand its 

business and explore new markets such as industrial wastewater treatment, seawater 

desalination,  soil treatment, renewable energy, water technology and pollution control, 

thereby strengthening its top-tier position in the PRC’s water and environmental industry. 

 

Board Statement 

The Board considers ESG issues as a part of our operational strategy and has reviewed the 

addressed material ESG issues identified by our stakeholders. The Board will manage and 

monitor these material ESG issues with the continuation of actively identifying opportunities 

for sustainable development.

In preparation for this Report, the Company reviewed our existing material ESG issues in line 

with a review of our business strategy, regulatory changes and industry trends during the 

Reporting Period. We concluded that the 13 material ESG issues identified in the 2017 

Sustainability Report (as shown in the table below) remain applicable to the Reporting Period, 

and hence, the Report. The Board has validated the addressed issues to ensure the rationality, 

balance and completeness of the Report.   

 

The contents of this Report hence address these 13 ESG issues that are considered material 

and sufficiently important to employees and management practices at SIIC Environment. 

These issues potentially affect stakeholders in a direct or indirect way. We anticipate 

expanding the scope of this materiality assessment in the future by covering our external 

stakeholders’ views so that we can better understand these ESG issues and capture different 

perceptions of stakeholders towards these issues. 

 

This year, we have also initiated the process of setting targets in relation to each of these 

material ESG issues, as shown below:

Organisational Governance 

At SIIC Environment, we acknowledge that good corporate governance ensures protection of 

shareholders’ interests and enhances corporate performance and accountability. Corporate 

governance practices in place are in line with recommendations of the Code of Corporate 

Governance issued by Singapore’s Ministry of Finance in August 2018 and the applicable 

provisions of the Corporate Governance Code set out in Appendix 14 to the Rules Governing 

the Listing of Securities on the SEHK.  

 

The Board is obliged to oversee the business and corporate affairs of the Company, including 

the consideration of sustainability issues. The Board is responsible for evaluating and 

determining the Company’s ESG-related risks, ensuring appropriate and effective ESG risk 

management and internal control systems, setting management approach, strategies, 

priorities and objectives of the Company, reviewing the Company’s performance periodically, 

and improving disclosures in the Company’s sustainability reports. 

 

The Company’s ESG Working Group is comprised of senior management and employees from 

various departments whom have sufficient knowledge in both ESG matters and the Company’s 

operations. The ESG Working Group is responsible for preparing the Company’s annual 

sustainability reports, coordinating stakeholder engagement materiality assessments, and 

liaising with business units within the reporting scope to collect and validate ESG data during 

the Reporting Period.  

 

During the Reporting Period, the Company adopted the use of an online ESG data collection 

system. Under the guidance of the ESG Working Group, representatives from each of the 

Company’s projects (in operation during the Reporting Period) were required to report their 

respective performance in 2018 by means of qualitative and quantitative key performance 

indicators. Submitted information was reviewed internally by representatives from our 

business units (Central China, South China, North China, Northeast China, East China, Waste 

Incineration Division, and Ranhill Water) and our headquarters, before being incorporated 

into this Report. This structure allows us to increase the accuracy and reliability of reported 

information, and to refine the management and governance of sustainability-related risks as 

well as opportunities. 

 

Anti-corruption 

The Company places a strong emphasis on corporate integrity and honesty. We strictly comply 

with the Criminal Laws of the PRC, Anti-Money Laundering Law of the PRC, Anti-Unfair 

Competition Law of the PRC, Prevention of Corruption Act of Singapore and other laws and 

regulations relating to bribery, extortion, fraud and money laundering.  

 

The Company has implemented its Fraud and Whistle Blowing Policy to facilitate the 

development of controls that aid in the detection of fraud, and to provide a framework for 

employees to express concerns about wrongdoing, malpractice or possible irregularity within 

the Group. This policy applies to all directors, officers and employees (including full-time, part-

time and contract employees) of the Company, its subsidiaries and associated companies.  

 

Whistle-blowing channels such as telephone hotlines, postal addresses and confidential 

emails, are available for all employees to report alleged acts of wrongdoing. Audits are also 

periodically conducted at project companies, covering the departments of finance, 

procurement, management and production. During the Reporting Period, no reports were 

received through the Company’s whistle-blowing mechanism, and the Company was not 


 

 

 

6 

aware of any incident of non-compliance with laws and regulations relating to bribery, 

extortion, fraud and money laundering.

Environment 

Management of Environmental Impacts 

The Company actively adopts effective measures to protect the environment and natural 

resources in our daily business operations and projects. We identify potential environmental 

impacts through regular assessing emission from facilities such as air-borne and water-borne 

pollutants, soil pollution, noise pollution, raw materials and resources usage, etc. We 

determine these impacts based on established mitigation measures, and identify potential 

gaps in existing risk prevention and control measures covered in a list of relevant 

improvement recommendations. 

 

Our environmental management processes and systems are based upon industry-specific 

guidance and best practices across the industry, and we guide our business units on 

implementing these processes and systems through internal environmental policies such as 

the Environmental Management System (Trial). Projects of our business units have 

implemented or are in the process of adopting the Environmental Management System (ISO 

14001). These policies and systems enable us to standardise our approach to environmental 

management, implement our environmental management strategies, and ensure full 

compliance with regulatory requirements. We stipulate that the focus of environmental 

protection is on comprehensive prevention and governance, clean production, control and 

mitigation of pollutant discharges and emissions. Our environmental and social management 

departments are responsible for carrying out environmental monitoring, and the 

environmental management leadership working groups are in charge of conducting 

environmental assessments of pre-investment projects and managing environmental issues 

of projects either under construction or in operation.   

 

In response to emergency environmental incidents such as local or regional environmental 

pollution incidents or ecological damage, our businesses have formulated Environmental Risk 

Emergency Plans – compiled with reference to the Environmental Protection Law of the PRC, 

Production Safety Law of the PRC, Regulations on the Safety Management of Hazardous 

Chemicals, Emergency Response Law of the PRC and other relevant laws, regulations and 

standards – to ensure swift, efficient and methodical on site remedial actions, therefore 

protecting the lives of residents and employees, plants, surrounding environment, and 

property safety. 

 

Our commitment to managing environmental impacts is also reflected in the way we 

collaborate with our business partners. In each established construction project contract, our 

suppliers are advised to carry out reasonable measures to protect the environment of 

construction sites, and to take specific and actionable precautions against potential air, water, 

noise and solid waste pollution.  

 

Promotion of Environmental Protection Concepts   

The Company has a corporate mission of pursuing business growth whilst remaining 

committed to protecting the planet, conserving the environment and preserving natural 

resources. To this end, we recognise the importance of passing on these concepts to our 

internal and external stakeholders. Internally, these concepts are communicated via 

corporate culture training, talks, environmental knowledge competitions, theatrical displays, 

websites of the Company and business units, newsletters, and other platforms. Externally, we 

convey our corporate mission via our websites, press releases, public reports (including 

sustainability reports), exhibitions, conferences, site visits and open days.

The spirit of the 19th National Congress was implemented in full in 2018, a key year for bringing 

moderate prosperity to society in China. The newly revised Environmental Protection Law 

designates June 5th as, and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment determines the theme of 

“Environment Day” during 2018-2020 as “Beautiful China, I am a Participant”. China 

Environmental News, the only official media channel of the Ministry of Ecology and 

Environment, carried out environmental education activities on 5 June 2018, and SIIC 

Environment participated in these activities as a co-organiser. In particular, we advocated: 

 

- 

The green development philosophy, “lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets”, 

whereby people become self-aware of modifications driven by minor changes in their daily 

habits; 

- 

Enterprises to strengthen their awareness of integrity, safeguard their environmental 

protection trustworthiness, be proactive about disclosing environmental information, and 

accept public scrutiny; 

- 

Enterprises to adhere to the concept of sustainable development, actively participate in 

environmental protection-related public welfare initiatives, and strive to forge a green public 

image;   

- 

The commitment to low-carbon travel, car-free days, and taking public transportation;  

- 

Reducing and segregating waste and the refusal of plastic bags, single-use products such as 

chopsticks, paper cups, tissues; and 

- 

Cultivating a green lifestyle, developing energy-saving habits, and cherishing every kWh of 

electricity, every drop of water, every piece of paper, every litre of oil, and every piece of office 

supply.

Treatment of Waste Gas, Wastewater and Solid Waste 

SIIC Environment envisages itself as a leading investor and operator in the environmental 

industry in the PRC. In the pursuit of sustainable growth, we remain committed to protecting 

the planet, conserving the environment and preserving natural resources. 

 

The Company strictly abides by the Environmental Protection Law of the PRC, Atmospheric 

Pollution Prevention and Control Law of the PRC, Energy Conservation Law of the PRC, Water 

Law of the PRC, Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law of the PRC, Law of the PRC on the 

Prevention and Control of Environment Pollution Caused by Solid Wastes, National Catalogue 

of Hazardous Wastes (Revised in 2016)1and other laws and regulations regarding air and 

greenhouse gas emissions, discharges into water and land, and the generation of hazardous 

and non-hazardous wastes. During the Reporting Period, we were not aware of any significant 

incidents of non-compliance with the above-mentioned laws and regulations. 

 

Waste Gas 

Waste gases and air pollutants as emissions from our plants are generated during wastewater 

treatment and sludge treatment, and fuel burning, respectively. Waste gas and air pollutant 

emissions can induce a negative impact on the environment and potentially damage human 

health.  

 

Waste gases emitted from wastewater treatment and sludge treatment plants consist of gases 

such as ammonia, hydrogen sulphide and methanethiol. Since the concentration of these 

gases may negatively affect the surrounding environment, we have conducted a series of 

control measures to minimise the emissions and corresponding impacts: 

 

- 

Cover and seal disposal tanks to prevent gas leakages; 

- 

Apply biological deodorisation technology utilising a high-pressure spray device to atomise 

non-toxic and harmless aqueous microbial deodorants into micro-sized droplets. These 

droplets then distribute throughout a room with odour.  Following the suspension of these 

droplets in the air for an hour, emissions of ammonia and hydrogen sulphide gas are reduced 

by 95% and 87%, respectively;  

Figure 4. Advanced odour treatment technology incorporated at the Fengxian West Wastewater Treatment Plant 

of our East China business unit. 

 

- 

Apply advanced odour treatment technology comprised of chemical washing, biofiltration and 

activated carbon adsorption and deodorisation, and require the output odour emissions to 

achieve the strictest domestic emission standards.

Ministry of Public Security (MPS). 






 

 

 

11 

Air emissions from waste incineration processes primarily consist of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen 

oxides, particulate matter and harmful flue gases (e.g. dioxins). In order to reduce emissions 

of malodorous gas in the pools of leachate stations, gas is discharged into negative pressure 

waste storage pits, whereby it is pumped by primary air fans into grate incinerators to support 

combustion. Flue gas produced from the waste incineration process is emitted through a 

chimney after deacidification, activated carbon adsorption and dust removal by bag dust 

collectors.  

 

 

Figure 5. South business unit deodorization system. 

 

During the Reporting Period, hydrogen sulphide and ammonia emissions from our wastewater 

treatment projects, and methanethiol and odour emissions from our sludge treatment 

projects met the respective national standards. 

 

In addition to waste gas, we also generate greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, of which direct 

(scope 1) emissions are primarily derived from fuel combustion in our incinerators, and of 

which indirect (scope 2) emissions are primarily derived from purchased electricity. To offset 

our GHG emissions, we have planted trees and installed photovoltaic systems across a portion 

of our business units. On our project sites, we have planted a total of 19,028 trees, equating 

to GHG emission savings of 437.64 tonnes CO2e1 per year. Solar panels installed at the Weifang 

City Wastewater Treatment Plant of our North China business unit has an average generation 

of 1,500 kWh per day, which equates to a saving of 484.15 tonnes CO2e per year; whereas the 

solar panels installed at our Dalian Quanshui River Wastewater Treatment Plant has an 

average generation of 3,600 kWh per day, which is equivalent to a saving of 1,020.85 tonnes 

CO2e per year. 

 

 

Figure 6. Solar panels installed at the Weifang City Wastewater Treatment Plant of our North China business unit. 

 

 

 

1 CO2 offsets were calculated using the methodology outlined in Guidelines to Account for and Report on Greenhouse Gas 

Emissions and Removals for Buildings (Commercial, Residential or Institutional Purposes) in Hong Kong (2010 Edition) published 

by the Environmental Protection Department and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department.

Wastewater 

Domestic and industrial sewage are two sources of wastewater. Domestic sewage includes 

discharges from toilets, baths and sinks, while industrial sewage is discharged from businesses, 

factories and plants. We are continuously exploring ways, such as the use of automation and 

artificial intelligence (AI), to analyse the water quality in our plants, treat our wastewater 

efficiently and reduce our emissions in the treatment process. We sample the treated effluent 

and measure water quality parameters such as COD. Networked instruments continuously 

monitor all effluent at the final stage of treatment process to ensure that water quality of 

treated sewage complies with the relevant requirements of the Discharge Standards of 

Pollutants for Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants (GB 18918-2002), and Environment 

Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002). Policies that guide the Company’s 

operations regarding these aspects have been set according to the national standards, 

relevant laws and regulations such as the Emission Standard of Air Pollutants for Municipal 

Wastewater Treatment Plants (DB31-982-2016).

Figure 9. Hanxi Wastewater Treatment Plant. 








 

 

 

13 

To improve treatment outcomes and reduce wastewater discharge, we have taken a series 

of initiatives including:  

- 

The use of an advanced wastewater treatment system with a sand filtration system applies 

backwashing to pump backwash water to biochemical systems or water distribution stage 

instead of diverting backwash water to the inlet, which prevents deviations in the volume of 

inflow and outflow water, and optimises our wastewater emissions; 

- 

The use of Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors (MBBR), high-efficiency sedimentation tanks, 

denitrification filters and other wastewater treatment facilities to achieve better treatment 

results;

treatment ponds. 

 

During the Reporting Period, we treated over 1.98 billion tonnes of wastewater and 

discharged approximately 2.01 billion tonnes treated effluent. We recycled and reused over 

89.17 million tonnes of water.  

 

 

 






 

 

 

14 

Solid Waste 

The Company adheres to waste management policies and encourages the conservation of 

resources based upon the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle). We aim to prevent and control 

solid waste pollution, conserve and improve the working environment and ecological 

environment on site, and protect human health. To this end, we have established a Safety 

Management Policy, which stipulates that our administrative departments are responsible for 

carrying out segregating, recycling and disposing of waste on a daily basis. The entire 

implementation is supervised by the safety management departments.  

 

 

Figure 12. Dewatering facility of one of our North China wastewater treatment plants. 

 

Untreated sludge generated from wastewater treatment plants has a water content of over 

80%, and contains a large number of pathogenic microorganisms and heavy metals, which are 

likely to lead to secondary pollution. To address such issues, we gather, collect and transport 

untreated sludge generated from our wastewater treatment and water supply projects to our 

own sludge treatment plants as well as third party sludge treatment plants. The treatment 

plants apply high temperature aerobic fermentation to stabilise organic matter in the sludge, 

and to kill pathogenic bacteria, parasite eggs and seeds of weeds effectively. Designated 

personnel conduct regular inspections and surveys with our customers on sludge treated by 

our sludge treatment plants to ensure that the treated sludge meets standards such as Quality 

of Sludge from Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant (GB24188-2009), Disposal of Sludge 

from Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant - Quality of Sludge used in Land Improvement 

(GB/T 24600-2009) and Disposal of Sludge from Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant - 

Quality of Sludge used in Separate Incineration (GB/T 24602-2009). Sludge classified as 

“hazardous” according to the definitions outlined in the National Catalogue of Hazardous 

Wastes (Revised in 2016) is rendered innocuous via treatment by third party contractors.  

 

In our wastewater treatment and water supply projects, we incorporate bioleaching and 

dewatering processes in sludge treatment to reduce its water content to ~40% (which can 

reduce the mass of sludge by over 90%), and we apply high temperature aerobic fermentation 

to detoxify and render sludge harmless. To reduce the generation of non-hazardous waste, 

we repurpose final-state sludge as fuels (blended or biofuels), construction materials, organic 

fertilisers, etc. The Company at the same time entered into agreements with brick-making 

plants to reuse generated sludge as bricks.  

 

Figure 13. Bioleached and dewatered sludge at one of our Northeast China wastewater treatment plants. 

 

Fly ash and activated carbon are the main wastes generated from our waste incineration 

projects. Fly ash is treated by impurity removal and solidification. Prior to treatment along 






 

 

 

15 

with fly ash, waste gas is adsorbed to the activated carbon and sent to landfill sites for disposal. 

These processes are conducted in line with the requirements set out in the Standard for 

Pollution Control on the Landfill Site of Municipal Solid Waste (GB16889-2008). To reduce the 

amount of generated non-hazardous waste, we recycle waste metals and other recyclables 

from slag derived from waste incineration processes; moreover, we screen the waste for 

materials that can be potentially used as construction materials (approximately 65% of waste 

slag is reused as construction materials). We also reuse slag generated from waste 

incinerators in wastewater sedimentation tanks to avoid the generation of additional waste. 

 

 

Figure 14. Central business unit Fenton process handling tanks. 

 

To reduce the amount of generated hazardous waste efficiently, the Company installs 

networked monitoring facilities to record the volume of liquids containing hazardous waste to 

a higher degree of accuracy. We also apply corresponding mitigation measures to hazardous 

waste accordingly. We preserve hazardous liquids (such as chemicals) in spill-proof containers, 

and centralise the storage of such waste in warehouses in accordance with regulatory 

requirements. A third party then collects and disposes of waste accordingly.

1 Due to the characteristics of the Company’s business operations, the air pollutant emissions and direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1) indicators are not material to the operations of wastewater treatment, 

sludge treatment and water supply business segments. Thus, these indicators have only been disclosed for the waste incineration business segment.   

2 In order to better reflect the environmental performance of different business segments of the company and improve the comparability of data over the years, the calculation method for the intensity of 

environmental performance will be revised from the beginning of this Reporting Period. The 2018 intensity calculation is based on the total daily design capacity of the projects disclosed in each business segment. 

Among them, the intensity of wastewater treatment business and water supply business uses 10,000 tonnes of treatment capacity per day as the denominator, and the sludge treatment business and solid waste 

business use treatment capacity per day in tonnes as the denominator. Besides, since the 2017 intensity is calculated using the operating income of each business segment as the denominator, it is not applicable in 

this report.   

3 Scope 2 emissions were calculated using the 2011–2012 Regional Power Grid Average CO2 Emission Factors in China guideline published by the National Development and Reform Commission of the PRC. Scope 2 

emissions were from electricity purchased during the Reporting Period.  

4 Hazardous wastes were defined according to the Directory of National Hazardous Wastes published by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the PRC.  

5 Other hazardous wastes generated during the Reporting Period consisted primarily of laboratory waste liquids, waste liquids from online monitoring instruments, waste motor oil. 

6 Other non-hazardous wastes generated during the Reporting Period consisted primarily of screenings and grit, domestic waste, wooden cartons, and cardboard boxes, with more types of non-hazardous wastes as 

compared to 2017. The non-hazardous wastes in 2017 mainly consisted of domestic waste and paper. 

7 CO2 offsets were calculated using the methodology outlined in Guidelines to Account for and Report on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals for Buildings (Commercial, Residential or Institutional Purposes) in 

Hong Kong (2010 Edition) published by the Environmental Protection Department and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department.

Use of Resources 

With an aim of high operational efficiency, SIIC Environment strives to utilise resources such 

as raw materials, energy and water effectively. The Company monitors and reviews energy 

and water consumption of all projects to identify areas for improvement. In addition, we have 

strived to refine our energy management plans in order to consume energy efficiently, 

implement energy conservation and emission reduction policies, and reduce operational costs. 

The management plan covers installation, selection and operation of transformers, pumps 

and valves in waterworks. The plan also addresses pipe network layout, the application of 

variable frequency speed control technology and automatic control systems across our plants, 

and methods in identifying ways to conserve resource use across our links in our production 

line. Furthermore, our Safety Management Policy advises subsidiaries to formulate water and 

energy saving measures, and to promote water-saving awareness such as advocating against 

faucets and lights running for a long time. The Safety Management Policy also requires the 

Company to fix tap dripping and pipe leakages, and carry out regular inspections on such 

issues.      

 

In addition to following water and energy consumption requirements of our facilities, we set 

feasible annual targets according to industry guidance, laws, regulations and notices. For 

example, projects based in Shanghai adhere to the Water-use Quota of Shanghai Municipality 

(for trial implementation), and the Regulation of Shanghai Municipality on the Supply and Use 

of Electricity. Moreover, the Company follows the municipal notices such as the Measures for 

Rewarding the Reporting of Violations of Environmental Laws in Shanghai to lower adverse 

impacts on the environment.  

 

A range of initiatives have been implemented to reduce our resource consumption across our 

wastewater treatment plants: 

 

- 

The use of reduced pumping pressure during off-peak seasons of water supply or drainage, as 

well as repair and maintenance of pump motors to conserve electricity consumption without 

degrading operating performance;  

- 

The use of variable frequency drives in electric motors to conserve energy; 

- 

The retrofitting of air pressure supply equipment in Dissolved Air Flotation and Filtration 

(DAFF) systems, and increasing the size of gas storage tanks to save energy equivalent to 15 

kWh per hour;  

- 

Comprehensive use of tailwater (i.e. water that has been treated and ready to be discharged) 

from wastewater treatment plants in cleaning dewatering facilities;  

- 

The use of reclaimed water in production processes;

Environment and Natural Resources 

As a company engaged in the sectors of wastewater treatment, water supply, waste 

incineration and sludge treatment, SIIC Environment provides solutions to conserving the 

environment, optimising resource management and protecting the planet. The Company is 

aware of its potential impacts of operations on the environment and natural resources, and is 

committed to bolstering the green and sustainable development of our projects. 

 

We generally outsource plant construction from third-party contractors that manage labour, 

machinery, and other input costs independently. Such contractors are selected following 

procedures outlined in policies such as the Project Company On-site Procurement 

Management System, Material Supplier Review and Management System, Bidding 

Management Approach. The selection of the contractors is also based on factors such as 

quality and charge of their products and services, financial position, company history, scale, 

organisational structure, technological expertise, etc. These factors are recorded and rated in 

our Office Automation (OA) System. All projects under construction are required to submit 

environmental impact assessment documents in accordance with the Environmental 

Protection Law of the PRC, the Environmental Impact Assessment Law of the PRC, Construction 

Project Environmental Protection and other relevant laws and regulations. In the event of 

significant environmental impacts, the Company must conduct a comprehensive assessment 

on the suspected impacts which is reported in an environmental impact assessment. We must 

obtain approvals from relevant administrative departments before commencing construction. 

Following the completion of construction projects, supplementary facilities of those which 

have been conducted with environmental impact assessment will not be put into production 

until the projects have passed inspection on environmental protection facilities.  

 

Furthermore, internal policies such as the Notice on the Publication of the Group’s 

Environmental Management System, Environmental Factor Identification and Evaluation 

Management System and Construction Project Contracts have been established to manage 

potential environmental impacts arising from construction and operation of projects. For 

example, where possible, ongoing works are scheduled during the day and before/after lunch 

hours to minimise disturbance to surrounding communities. Project contractors and 

supervisors are required to take preventive measures for such environmental impacts, in 

accordance with regulatory requirements.  




 

 

 

27 

Clean Water and Sanitation 

We highly value the quality of water that we provide to our esteemed customers, particularly 

given that water quality can induce potential impacts on their health. Our water supply plants 

possess state-of-the-art membrane technology to increase the quality of supplied water. 

Water supply projects source raw water from natural water bodies such as groundwater and 

surface water given proper and requisite approvals from regulatory authorities. The Company 

conducts daily testing on incoming water from the sources and outgoing water from plants 

and municipal pipelines to ensure that the water we supply meets the National Drinking 

Water Standards (GB5749-2006) and other national standards. Similarly, the reclaimed water 

that we supply for applications in agriculture, forestry, landscaping cleaning, fire control, 

construction and other purposes is required to meet the Reclaimed Water Quality Standard 

(SL368-2006), Quality Standard for Municipal Wastewater Reclamation for Municipal Multi-

Purpose Uses (GB/T18920-2002), Quality Standard for Municipal Wastewater Reclamation for 

Scenic and Environmental Uses (GB/T18921-2002) and other relevant standards. Furthermore, 

the Company has strict quality management systems which involve timely inspections and 

real-time monitoring to ensure the fulfilment of required water quality standards.  

 

With regard to sanitation, our business units have established a set of indicators to assess, 

monitor and track the hygiene and sanitary conditions of office environments, production 

areas, washrooms, canteens, outdoor areas and company vehicles. In addition, we also 

inspect the extent to which relevant management rules and regulations, and delegations of 

responsibilities, have been implemented on-site, in order to ensure adequate management of 

such aspects.

Period, we were not aware of any incidents of non-compliance with the above-mentioned 

laws and regulations. Projects of our business units have implemented or are in the process 

of adopting the Quality Management System (ISO 9001). 

 

Our business units assign procurement teams to follow a prescribed procedure for purchasing 

equipment to ensure the quality of our principal equipment, parts and components. We 

regularly review the list of our contracted suppliers in accordance with procedures set out in 

policies such as Project Company On-site Procurement Management System, and Material 

Supplier Review and Management System. These policies include the use of routine and 

spontaneous on-site inspections, ratings and evaluations of their performance. Suppliers that 

are deemed satisfactory remain as our contractors, whilst those unsatisfactory supplies will 

be dismissed.  

 

Internally, our Audit Committee and Risk and Investment Management Committee oversee 

regular inspections, evaluate and manage risks arising from our operations, and ensure the 

effectiveness of key internal controls. The two committees report findings to the Board of 

Directors for them to review. Through these procedures, we ensure full implementation of 

our policies and the absence of breaching relevant regulatory requirements or applicable laws. 

We maintain our operations in a good condition as we control the quality of treated effluent 

and supplied tap water, and take measures to prolong the service life of our facilities.   

 

SIIC Environment maintains a project management system and operational management 

procedures applicable to the Company as a whole. We hold quarterly meetings whereby our 

business operations are required to report their operational performance, significant 

fluctuations of water input and water supply, and material incidents to our headquarters. 

Interactions at these meetings assist us in identifying opportunities to improve the quality of 

our services. The senior management team of each project company is responsible for 

customer-relationship management.   

 

Employment and Labour Practices

Occupational Health and Safety 

Safety is our top priority at SIIC Environment. We strictly comply with the Law of the PRC on 

Work Safety, Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Control of Occupational Diseases and other 

laws and regulations relating to providing a safe working environment and protecting 

employees from occupational hazards. During the Reporting Period, we were not aware of 

any incidents of non-compliance with the above laws and regulations. Projects of our business 

units have implemented or are in the process of adopting the Occupational Health and Safety 

Assessment Series (OHSAS 18001). 

 

The mechanisms of production safety in our workplace are based on three main aspects: 

strengthening the development, supervision and control of our safety systems, providing 

employees with safety education and training, and enhancing employees’ awareness in 

emergency preparedness and response capabilities. These mechanisms are incorporated into 

our health and safety policies across our operating facilities. For example, the Safety 

Management System of our Waste Incineration Division elaborates our safe production 

principles, safe production targets, safety monitoring system, safety supervision system, 

safety education and training requirements, workflows and requirements, etc. Similarly, the 

Safe Production Management System of our Northeast China business unit addresses the roles 

and responsibilities of the safe production committee, including ensuring compliance with 

laws and regulations relating to safe production, monitoring the implementation of the 

system, organising safety training, and recording and reporting safety incidents, etc.  

 

The occupational health and safety (OHS) training that we provide to employees focuses on 8 

key areas, namely: 1) national and regional OHS laws, regulations and standards; 2) the 

Company’s OHS policies; 3) foundations and professional technical knowledge of OHS 

management; 4) the Company and facilities’ characteristics of production and main hazards; 

5) safety procedures and safety precautions; 6) knowledge on the use of safety, hygiene, 

environmental protection, and fire-prevention tools and protective equipment; 7) common 

accident case studies, accident prevention and emergency management; and 8) healthcare, 

self-help, mutual-help and common knowledge on preventing occupational diseases. 

 

From a supervisory perspective, the Company adheres to national standards such as the 

Standard for Supervision on Operation of Municipal Solid Waste Incineration Plants, the 

Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Employers’ Occupational Health 

Surveillance, Regulations on the Reporting, Investigation and Disposition of Work Safety 

Accidents and other relevant laws and regulations. We supervise employee engagement in 

operating facilities, equipment and systems and monitor their potential exposure to 

occupational health hazards. We also check the health condition of our employees at work, 

during work, after work, and in emergencies to make sure that they are suitable to perform 

their duties. In addition, we have standardised our safety accident reporting procedures to 

ensure that accidents are reported to supervisory personnel and regulatory authorities in a 

timely manner. Moreover, the self-assessments of the Company reflect our management of 

potential OHS hazards. We submit reports to regulatory authorities on a regular basis 

disclosing the results of self-assessments on OHS hazards. Recommendations provided by 

regulatory authorities lay a foundation for us to further improve our safety standards.  

 

The Company implements fire evacuation drills and other emergency simulations to enhance 

employees’ health and safety awareness. We also provide protective equipment to employees 

in specialist and technical positions, and check the equipment on a regular basis to ensure 

optimal working environments for the employees. The equipment is required to meet 

applicable national or industrial standards with respect to their design, manufacturing, 


 

 

 

33 

installation and usage. The Company has established specialist teams, which are responsible 

for coordinating, planning, organising, developing and promoting health and safety matters. 

In order to guide employees to take sufficient OHS precautions and enforce warning systems 

for potential OHS hazards, we place warning signs, instructions and other visual aids at eye-

catching positions close to equipment.

business unit (right). 

 

Case Study 

On 7 September 2018, our Shangzhi City Wastewater Treatment Plant of our Northeast China 

business unit organised a flood control and safety evacuation exercise. The drill enacted a 

scenario of a torrential rainfall event with the precipitation exceeding 50 mm per hour, 

resulting in the waterlogging and overload of drainage wells in the factory. In order to mitigate 

the flood, the participants carried out a level two response plan. The aim of the exercise was 

to improve the capability of plant leaders and relevant departments of flood control and 

prevention so that we can evacuate people from areas affected by floods in a timely and 

orderly manner.

unit 

 

Case Study 

On 18 May 2018, the Jiangxi Province Yihuang Industrial Park Wastewater Treatment Plant of 

our Ranhill Water division invited the local Fire Safety Committee to conduct a fire drill and 








 

 

 

34 

training exercise. These exercises educated our employees with fire instruction and 

emergency training included demonstration of a fire extinguisher. The fire drill served as an 

opportunity to raise awareness of fire prevention and safety among our employees.

Training and Development 

SIIC Environment views professional development and training of its employees as a way to 

broaden employees’ horizons and assist them in realising their own value and potential. In 

line with internal policies such as the Safe Production Education and Training Management 

System, Occupational Disease Prevention and Education Training System, we have provided a 

range of internal and external training programmes for our employees. During the Reporting 

Period, a total of 4,571 employees received approximately 60,000 hours of training, 

equivalent to an average of 13.1 hours per employee. A breakdown of this training is provided 

below.

Research and Development 

We actively explore opportunities to develop our core technologies which put us in a strong 

position to improve our operational efficiency, lower operating costs, develop and 

commercialise new technologies in areas anticipated with a strong growth potential. We 

believe that sustaining innovations will improve the processes of wastewater treatment, 

water supply, waste incineration and sludge treatment, thus leading to an increase of the 

competitiveness in our existing projects. 

 

Across our projects, we are exploring the use of automation and AI to reduce our costs, and 

raise our productivity, efficiency and reliability. This technology is used for monitoring and 

analysing water quality indicators, cleaning sludge, and maintaining and repairing equipment 

in our plants. If these applications are successfully developed, we plan to upscale and 

introduce the applications across a wider range of our plants. 

 

During the Reporting Period, our expenditure on research activities amounted to RMB3.8 

million. Our investments of research and development were mainly in core technologies 

across our businesses. We also strive to protect our innovations by encouraging the 

development of intellectual property.  

 

Case Study 

Our East China business unit has cooperated with Shanghai SIIC-LongChuang Smarter Energy 

Technology Co., Ltd to apply Internet of Things (IoT) technology across wastewater treatment 

plants to automate the collection of key production and operational indicators, realise real-

time monitoring, conduct data mining and analytics. Through the application of IoT, we 

anticipate a rising competitiveness by means of our technology-driven products and 

workforce. We have also invested in methodology of improving our evaluation of the 

effectiveness and the optimisation of wastewater treatment at our Fengxian West Wastwater 

Treatment Plant. We expect the technology to better capture fluctuations in water quality and 

response times of biochemical processes with an aim of maintaining the stable operation of 

the plant.  

 

Case Study 

Excess sludge from wastewater treatment plants, kitchen waste and other forms of organic 

solid waste have become a serious burden on the environment. The Research and 

Development Centre of our Northeast China business unit has worked in conjunction with the 

Qingshan Environmental Bureau to research and develop the use of new reactive oxygen 

species to treat organic solid waste with an efficient energy use.

In the traditional aeration process used in biochemical pools, the large bubbles formed by 

gases gradually rise to the water surface, which reduces utilisation efficiency and lowers 

sewage treatment capacity. Collaborating with a Japanese company, our Northeast China 

Research and Development Centre developed an ultra-fine bubble (UFB) technology replacing 

traditional aeration processes so that we are able to improve oxygen transmission efficiency, 

effectively activate microorganisms in sludge, and increase sewage treatment capacity. 

 

 

Figure 34. Ultra-microbubble technology developed by our Northeast China Research and Development Centre. 

 

Strengthening Communication and Partnerships Within the Industry 

SIIC Environment also values the environment and social performance of our business 

partners and contracted suppliers. Our partnership with business partners and suppliers is 

built upon a foundation of cooperation and mutual benefits by realising a common 

developmental goal for SIIC Environment.  

 

In order to minimise potential supply chain risks, each project has an individual supplier 

management and self-assessment system, which ensures that suppliers and procured 

materials meet assessment standards. Procedures and criteria for assessing suppliers are 

stipulated in the Material Supplier Review and Management System and other policies across 

our projects. We aim to confirm that supplied products meet the requirements and standards 

set out in contract agreements as well as all applicable laws and regulations. The Company 

updates the list of suppliers at regular time intervals with a scoring system to evaluate the 

performance of suppliers. Transparent evaluation rules create a fair and open bidding process 

for the sake of high-quality and efficiency at our procurement departments. These activities 

are also performed in accordance with the Bidding Law of the PRC and the Regulation on the 

Implementation of the Bidding Law of the PRC and other related laws and regulations.  

 

Case Study 

In November 2018, representatives from our Dazhou City Municipal Household Waste 

Incineration Power Generation Project of our Waste Incineration Division reported the 

operational situation of the plant to officials from Sichuan Provincial Energy Bureau and the 

Sichuan Provincial Government. Following governmental coordination and approval, the load 

curve of the plant was adjusted as appropriate to reduce environmental risks and guarantee 

a smooth operation.

Case Study 

On 29 November 2018, a delegation from the Hong Kong Water Resources and Water Quality 

Advisory Committee and the Water Supplies Department visited the Pudixia Wastewater 

Treatment Plant of our South China business unit, and received a tour of projects either in 

operation or under construction. The delegates paid attention to our ongoing efforts in 

improving flood control standards, and upgrading the wastewater collection and 

transportation system. These efforts have had a positive impact on water quality in the upper 

reaches of the Shenzhen Reservoir.

Case Study 

On 29-30 November 2018, the 13th China International Conference on Urban Water 

Development and New Technology and Equipment Expo was hosted in Chongqing. Over 60 

leaders and experts from 39 cities and counties from Heilongjiang Province were present at 

the conference. Our Northeast China business unit was invited to the conference. The 

attendees comprised representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-rural 

Development, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the International Water Associated 

(IWA) China Committee, the China Urban Science Research Association, the China Water 

Association, provincial water associations and industry representatives. The conference 

highlighted technology and equipment used in the industry, and fostered collaborative 

opportunities amongst professionals in the water industry by shedding light on hot research 

topics.   

 

Social Responsibility 

SIIC Environment has a strong presence in society and we strive to build a rapport with local 

communities where we operate. To this end, employees are encouraged to participate in 

community services and utilise available corporate resources to help those in need. Our social 

responsibility work mostly focuses on helping the poor and participating in community 

development such as supporting educational opportunities for those in need. 

 

Case Study 

On 23 March 2018, SIIC Environment was listed on the Main Board of SEHK; instantly, the 

Company made a generous donation of HK$1,000,000 to The Community Chest of Hong Kong. 

The Community Chest of Hong Kong has fundraised over HK$278 million in the 2017/18 period 

from 245 other individuals and organisations. The received donations will be used to support 

162 social-welfare agencies that reach out to over two million beneficiaries in Hong Kong in 

six major areas of services: children and youth; elderly, family and child welfare; medical and 

health; rehabilitation and aftercare; and community development.

Case Study 

On 27 September 2018, volunteers from our Chenzhou City Linwu County Wastewater 

Treatment Plant of our South China business unit organised a charity donation event at Jiahe 

County Special Education School. With the theme of “Helping Poverty Alleviation and 

Protecting the Disabled”, we regarded fundraising as a means of promoting traditional 

Chinese virtues, fostering a spirit for community service, and setting an example for party 

members in the spirit of dedication, friendship and mutual assistance. Volunteers interacted 

with the children in the activities and bestowed gifts to the children. A “heart of thanksgiving” 

sign language dance was performed by the children to express their gratitude. The business 

unit donated several thousand yuan to the school, and advocated social respect to the 

disabled and support to the development of special education.
