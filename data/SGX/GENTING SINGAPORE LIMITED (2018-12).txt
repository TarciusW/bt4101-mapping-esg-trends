message from our president

MESSAGE FROM OUR PRESIDENT

Dear Stakeholders,

As 2018 drew to a close, I would 

like to take the opportunity to thank 

our stakeholders who, in one way 

or another, have helped Genting 

Singapore grow strongly throughout 

the year. 

2018 was an exciting year for 

sustainability development. 

Singapore marked 2018 as the Year 

of Climate Action, where the country 

aims to raise the level of national 

awareness on the importance of 

collective effort towards fighting 

climate change. 

In aligning ourselves with 

the national commitment to 

combat climate change, Genting 

Singapore has performed well in 

our conservation initiatives and 

is on track to meet its targets of 

cumulative energy and water savings 

of 63% and 15% respectively. This 

year, grid electricity consumption 

has fallen by about 3%, while fresh 

water consumption has dropped 

by 20%. New waste management 

initiatives also contributed to 

more than 20% reduction in waste 

production and an increase in the 

use of recycled materials. This year, 

RWS also received the Singapore 

Packaging Agreement (SPA) 

Award 2018 as a testament of our 

significant environmental efforts in 

reducing packaging waste.

Rolling out a series of environmental 

conservation initiatives, our 

Guardians of the S.E.A.A. (GOTS) 

have been shoring up community 

support towards protecting the 

marine environment, as well as 

reaching out to more than 24,000 

students in Singapore to encourage 

them to join in the national effort to 

become a Zero Waste Nation. 

In reaching out and making a 

difference to the underprivileged 

community, our corporate social 

responsibility platform, also known 

as RWS Cares, has contributed to 

and enabled more than $8.4 million 

in cash and in-kind donations to 

various charities and organisations 

that are aligned with our corporate 

philosophies of community 

empowerment, engagement and 

environmental conservation. 

This is the third year we are 

executing our Sustainability21 

Strategy and our sixth 

comprehensive sustainability report 

in accordance with the Global 

Reporting Initiatives (GRI) guidelines. 

As one of the pioneering companies 

on the Singapore Exchange 

Sustainability Indices in 2016, 

we are pleased to be one of 

the top 10 constituents of 

iEdge SG ESG Leaders Index.

We would like to extend 

our deepest gratitude and 

appreciation towards our 

partners, stakeholders and team 

members who have participated  

and worked hard in our sustainability 

journey. We look forward to your 

continued support and partnership  

in Genting Singapore’s journey 

towards building a sustainable 

destination for all.

Tan Hee Teck,  

President and Chief Operating Officer

board statement

2018 marks the third year of our Sustainability21 Strategy. 

As we arrived at the halfway mark of our journey, we 

are seeing satisfying progress in achieving our national 

and international sustainability goals. This year, Genting 

Singapore has taken a stand in aligning ourselves with the 

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  

In support of the nation’s efforts to designate 2018 as the 

Year of Climate Action, we are also aligning ourselves  

with SDG 13: Climate Action. We are committed to  

ensure that we stay relevant and continue to improve  

our sustainability efforts with regards to protecting  

the environment.

Our Sustainability21 Strategy, built on 4 key pillars of 

Marketplace, People, Community and Environment, 

ensures that all Environment, Social and Governance 

(ESG) matters are factored in our strategic formulation.  

It allows the Board and senior management to 

concentrate on developing policies and practices,  

setting performance targets and action plans in line 

BOARD STATEMENT



Genting Singapore Board of Directors at table65 – our fine-casual celebrity chef restaurant

with these pillars, to create a sustainable value for all 

stakeholders. In addition, our initial alignment with the 

United Nations SDGs also means there will be more 

policies and practices inclined towards these areas, 

further contributing to our role as a responsible corporate 

in the nation-wide effort to become a sustainable city.

During the year, the Board maintained oversight over 

the Sustainability Working Committee and Sustainability 

Steering Committee, managing sustainability risks and 

opportunities, while ensuring all ESG matters significant 

to us are well-managed and monitored. The Board placed 

significant emphasis on enhancing the sustainability 

performance of our business practices as well as the 

transparency of our disclosures. We will continue to strive 

for better sustainability performance and remain vigilant 

in managing our commitments to sustainability efforts 

to ensure sustainable growth and development of the 

communities around Genting Singapore.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

We have a company-wide Sustainability Steering Committee to oversee and drive Environmental, 

Social and Governance (ESG) practices across all departments within Genting Singapore. 

The Committee initiates, drives and monitors various aspects of our sustainability strategy, 

practices and initiatives, ensuring effective integration of ESG initiatives into our business 

operations and corporate objectives. The Sustainability Steering Committee meets quarterly to 

review our sustainability progress and performance. 



SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY &amp; 

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

In response to the key ESG risks identified, we developed our Sustainability21 Strategy in 2016. 

Sustainability21 Strategy is a sustainability framework that supports the strategic commitment 

of Genting Singapore to be the brand leader in sustainable integrated resort developments.  

The framework is built on four key pillars – Marketplace, Environment, People and Community 

which underpin the management approach in developing policies and practices, setting 

performance targets and action plans on key Environmental, Social and Governance factors 

to create sustainable value for all stakeholders. It also aligns our sustainability goals with 

national and international interests and tracks our sustainability targets towards 2021.

AGENDA 2030 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

With 2018 as Singapore’s Year of Climate Action, the government has underscored the need for 

enhanced efforts and partnership across all sectors to meet the nation’s climate goals. At Genting 

Singapore, we are committed to do our part as a responsible corporate citizen. 

Building on our firm foundation in ESG management, we strategically aligned our sustainability 

efforts with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, an ambitious plan of action set out by 

the world’s leaders to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice and protect the planet. It forms an 

integral part of our Sustainability21 strategy.

sustainability strategy &amp; sustainable development/materiality assessment

Locally, our sustainable initiatives are also aligned with and support the Sustainable 

Singapore Blueprint (“SSB”). 

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

Nine material topics were identified under four pillars of Sustainability21 Strategy through 

formal Materiality Assessment exercise conducted in 2013 by the Senior Management team. 

A long list of ESG issues were reviewed and prioritised according to their potential impacts on 

operations. We also took into account external stakeholders’ concerns or interests collected 

during the year from existing engagement channels embedded in our daily operations.

The material matters were then reviewed annually by Sustainability Working Committee and 

Sustainability Steering Committee for their continued relevance and against current global and local 

trends and emerging regulatory development. There was no change in our material matters in 2018. 

Our stakeholders’ concerns or interests about our business vary and therefore require different 

actions or responses. The main topics that arose in 2018, as well as the actions we undertook to 

address them, are summarised under the How We Report section.

2. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

A robust ERM framework is established to manage our operational risks and safeguard our assets in 

order to create long-term value for our stakeholders. Our ERM framework is based on the Singapore 

Exchange Securities Trading Limited Listing Rule 1207(10) and Code of Corporate Governance 2012 

Principle 11. Its objective is set out in Figure 4.

3. APPROACH TOWARDS  

ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR

We comply with Competition Act and are strictly against 

and do not take part in any anti-competitive behaviour. 

This includes activities that prevent, restrict, or distort 

competition within Singapore. Our commitment for zero 

tolerance for such behaviour is demonstrated in our 

performance in Figure 5.

The ERM framework is reviewed and endorsed by the Risk Management Committee (RMC) to 

ensure that the business objectives and strategies are aligned with the risk profile of Genting 

Singapore. Our RMC, which comprises of our Senior Management, reports to the Audit and Risk 

Committee and Board of Directors every quarter on all risk management matters, playing a pivotal 

role in providing management action and direction on risk matters.

non-compliance will be reviewed by our compliance and/or 

legal team and reported to the Committee. The Committee 

meets quarterly to assess the compliance risks, evaluate the 

effectiveness of mitigation controls and ensure progress on 

any action plans on agenda. 

Despite our best efforts, we incurred five fines by the Casino 

Regulatory Authority (CRA) in 2018. Corrective actions were 

put in place to prevent the recurrences as described in the 

table below. We will continue to strive towards achieving zero 

non-compliance cases next year.

to prevent minor from entering the casino. 

In 2018, RWS detected and prevented

3,122 minors and 77 impersonators from

entering the casino.

In November 2018, we also implemented the 

Facial Recognition technology at our guest 

entrance and back-of-house area which leads 

into the casino. This mitigates the risk of 

unauthorised entry into the casino.

Disciplinary action letter from 

CRA received in February 2018 for

GUEST HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

Ensuring the health and safety of all our guests is integral to providing them with 

an enjoyable experience at Genting Singapore. Detailed risk assessments and 

management plans are developed for each business division such as Attractions, 

F&amp;B and Convention Centre to actively identify the significant hazards and relevant 

Guest Safety standard operating procedures (SOPs) are in place to manage the 

risks in all activities. These SOPs are maintained and enforced by respective 

business divisions. The Safety and Emergency Planning (S&amp;EP) department 

coordinates health and safety management and reporting activities at resort level. 

RWS’s Risk Committee reviews guest health and safety incidents on a regular 

basis as well as any corrective actions taken to prevent future recurrences.

GUEST SATISFACTION

We strive to create a positive experience for all our guests. In RWS Attractions, our service 

excellence framework is built upon a distinctive service DNA which defines the shared values 

we hold when engaging guests and supported by tailored competency training programmes 

and robust monitoring activities for continuous improvements. The service excellence 

framework covers a suite of training in the areas of service image, service language, 

service knowledge, and service attentiveness. It also includes a service feedback system 

to encourage and monitor service levels at key touchpoints and finally, an administrative 

function overseeing external service recognition awards.

Figure 12: Service DNA Strategies

SERVICE DNA

Our Service DNA covers elements of warmth, caring and creating memorable and fun experiences.

To achieve service excellence, it is important that our staff are equipped with the necessary skills. 

As the service roles at Genting Singapore are diverse and unique, we developed competency matrix 

for each role such as the attractions operations crew and star guides to determine the different 

types of skills training required. The training also aims to promote the right attitudes for service 

providers such as energetic, friendly and engaging. In 2018, we provided 170,692 training hours 

related to service delivery.

to constantly create new and innovative products and 

services while minimising our negative environmental 

and social impact. RWS responsible sourcing strategy 

remains anchored on 3 key pillars.

FOCUS AREA #1: SUSTAINABLE SOURCES 

At the start of the supply chain, we are committed to identify sustainable sources for our key 

material categories; including food and beverages, hotel amenities, live animal feed and pulp based 

materials. Those materials in aggregation comprise approximately 40% of the total value of our 

procurement. The sustainable sources however will not comprise our commitment for quality. For 

example, sustainable food items should pass a blind taste test by our chefs to ensure they deliver 

the same quality. The same standard applies for all other material categories.

FOCUS AREA #2: SUPPLY CHAIN ASSURANCE

In 2018, we conducted a comprehensive supply chain assessment exercise to holistically  

assess ESG risks exposure in our supply chain. For suppliers who are identified as high risk  

or fail to meet minimum ESG standards, we seek to find alternative suppliers or not assign  

any high-risk activities.

across all waste categories. In 2018, we achieved 21 tonnes of packaging waste reduction and 

was awarded Singapore Packaging Agreement Top Achievement award. Above was achieved 

by replacement of packaging materials with reusable or recyclable materials. We will continue to 

champion packaging waste reduction efforts to drive material impact along our supply chain.

FOCUS AREA #4: SUPPLY CHAIN INFLUENCE

We want to partner with suppliers who share the same values as us. All our suppliers have to comply 

with our Supplier Code of Conduct (Figure 15) as part of our Purchase Orders Standard Terms and 

Conditions. The Code of Conduct sets out our expectations across the following dimensions:  

1. Ethical Business Practice

2. Labour and Human Rights

3. Health and Safety

4. Environmental Responsibility

80% of our spending are locally sourced which puts us in a good position to drive and influence our 

supply chain towards sustainable business practices.

ENVIRONMENT

As the owner of one of the largest integrated 

resorts in the world, we are dedicated to identifying 

and understanding the impact that our facilities, 

operations and products have on the environment. 

Our environmental sustainability strategy focuses 

on two main areas; (1) preserving scarce resources 

via maximising our energy and water efficiency, and 

reducing waste throughout our operations and (2) 

protecting natural capital that is trusted in our care.  

We have set up a Sustainability Steering Committee 

comprising of our Senior Management from the various 

Business Units. A Sustainability Working Committee 

comprising of members from middle management reports 

to this Working Committee. Under the Working Committee, 

there are various sub-committees to look into various 

aspects of Sustainability. Two of the bigger sub-committees 

focusing on the environment aspects are the Blue and the 

Green Committee. Various Business Units further have their 

task force groups to look at various programs like energy 

and water reduction, publicity, awareness and education, 

sustainable procurement etc. 

The Blue Committee consists of team members from 

various business units within the Attractions. The Blue 

Committee assists in driving various sustainability initiatives 

and campaigns, largely related to marine conservation 

and causes. Blue Committee members may also utilise the 

committee for information and educational materials, and  

in turn, serve as voices for these conservation initiatives 

such as outreach efforts for the reduction of single-use  

plastics campaign.

Our Green Committee consists of team members from 

various Business Units, including Estate Management, 

Facilities Management &amp; Engineering, and Communications, 

and focuses on areas like waste management initiatives 

including 3R (reduce, reuse and recycle), energy  

savings, water conservation, land biodiversity and  

forest management.

At the CleanEnviro Summit Singapore 2018 organised 

by the National Environment Agency (NEA), Genting 

Singapore joined the INCUBATE partnership, which serves 

to demonstrate our strong commitment to leveraging 

technologies and innovation to transform environmental 

services such as cleaning, waste management and 

recycling. The partnership will help Genting Singapore 

develop more effective and eco-friendly solutions to serve 

guests better and make a positive impact on  

the environment.

PRESERVING OUR RESOURCES 

ENERGY AND WATER SAVING 

Genting Singapore invested significantly in a Building 

Energy Management System (BEMS) which monitors, 

records and trends utilities consumptions of electricity, 

water, gas and chilled water of each key entity within our 

resort. The utilities usage pattern and data are monitored 

closely by our Facilities Management &amp; Engineering team 

to look out for abnormal usage patterns and explore 

opportunities for improvements. 

We continually implement new initiatives to further 

improve our energy and water use efficiencies. In 2015, 

we started our 5-year phased project to convert resort-

wide lightings to energy efficient LEDs and as of end 

2018 (phase 4), we have upgraded more than 90% of our 

lightings to LEDs. The chilled water system is one of the 

largest single user of electricity and water in our resort. 

We pride ourselves with operating one the most efficient 

district cooling systems in Singapore. Our award-winning 

district cooling plant is fitted with sophisticated controllers 

with algorithms to continuously tune and operate the plant 

at the lowest possible Coefficient of Performance (COP). 

This is achieved through automatically controlling and 

varying the multiple operational parameters of the chillers, 

pumps, cooling towers and heat exchangers for optimum 

overall efficiency. 

Other measures like replacing water heaters with heat 

pumps in our Beach Villas and kitchens results in lower 

energy consumption for hot water production and also 

provides additional cooling energy to reduce cooling 

loads in the respective areas. We have further used 

environment-monitoring sensors to optimise the operating 

patterns of our carpark ventilation fans serving the  

largest underground carpark in Singapore, to achieve 

energy savings. 

In 2018, we harvested a combined energy savings of 

3,130,000 kWh, sufficient to power more than 5,500 

units of 4-room HDB flats for a month. As of 2018, RWS 

has already achieved cumulative energy savings of 

172,000,000 kWh and is on track to exceed our 2020 

cumulative energy savings target.

We also seek to use renewable energy to reduce our 

carbon footprint. RWS has installed solar photovoltaic 

panels which generate about 640,000 kWh of renewable 

energy every year, sufficient to power about 140 HDB 

4-room flats for a year. The solar array built on the roof 

of the Revenge of the Mummy building in Universal 

Studios Singapore (USS) theme park, covering more than 

4,500 m2 area, was the largest single solar installations 

in Singapore when it was installed. Furthermore, in 

collaboration with BlueSG, we implemented initiatives to 

promote the use of electric cars. Carparks at RWS now 

provide parking spaces and charging stations for  

BlueSG users.

To promote the environmental message, we participate 

yearly in the the global Earth Hour movement in March, 

switching off all non-essential lightings across the 

resort for an hour on 24th March and encouraging our 

team members to play a part by switching off printers, 

computers, air-conditioning and other electrical 

equipment where possible. 

We strongly recognise water as a scarce resource. We 

use three sources of freshwater; namely, city water, 

NEWater and harvested rainwater. For our marine animals, 

we draw and filter sea water from Keppel Harbour through 

the Ocean Water Supply system. A water reclamation 

system was installed in 2018 for the District Cooling 

Plant to recycle cooling tower blowdown water, thereby 

reducing fresh water intake to the cooling towers by 

almost 7%. Furthermore, we have planned to set up 

systems to reduce water make-up for our swimming 

pools during raining days, increase and explore more 

uses of our harvested rainwater and explore lower water 

consumption shower heads for our hotel rooms.

Since the inauguration of PUB, Singapore’s water 

agency, our blue light-up program serves to highlight the 

importance of water in conjuction with the Singapore 

World Water Day on 22nd March, an initiative which we 

have been supporting every year without fail. 

Similar to our energy savings, RWS has also been proudly 

achieving total freshwater consumption reduction targets 

year on year since 2015. As of 2018, we have achieved 

850,000 m3 of cumulative water savings and have already 

exceeded our cumulative 2020 water savings target.

WASTE REDUCTION 

Our waste management system monitors and categorises 

waste produced by type and disposal methods.  

General waste and carton box waste comprise 85% and 

5% of total waste. Compared to 2017, in 2018 we saw a 

105% increment in recycled waste, 5% overall decrease 

in waste produced, 8% decrease in waste sent for 

incineration. Of the waste produced this year, 13%  

were recycled. 

We introduced several initiatives to reduce our  

plastic waste: 

• The integrated resort has stopped providing plastic 

straws across its five themed attractions, including 

Universal Studios Singapore and S.E.A.A., as well 

as dining establishments such as celebrity chef 

restaurants and Malaysian Food Street. The move to 

go strawless across RWS will eliminate more than three 

million straws a year (approximately 1.2 tonnes), helping 

to save our oceans and reduce marine plastic pollution.

• In December 2018, Festive Hotel14 had entirely phased 

out the use of single-use plastics in rooms with water 

and soap dispensers by replacing these single-use 

plastic bottles.

• Other hospitality establishments will work towards 

zero-plastic rooms in phases (e.g. bedroom slippers 

without plastic wrapping, toothpaste tubes and 

toothbrush lengths to be reduced).

We also recycled our horticulture waste by composting 

and using the compost for our landscape maintenance.

We have also strengthened our e-waste recycling 

management. E-wastes such as electronic gadgets, 

computers or mobile accessories are collected by 

licensed waste collection vendor and transported to 

their sorting facility where they go through a segregation 

process to salvage recyclables such as plastic and 

metal, which are then sent to a plastic recycling plant and 

a scrap metal facility for recycling respectively. Non-

recyclable waste are sent to NEA’s incineration plant. 

Further to our waste reduction, we are also looking to 

improve the efficiency of our wastes management system. 

For example, we implemented a new waste bin system 

to reduce the haulage trips from 9 to 4 trips per day and 

installation of high-loading capacity, automatic cleaning 

function and fire safety protection system at our bin 

centre to reduce manpower required to manage  

those facilities.

CASE STUDY 1  

REDUCING FOOD WASTE

In 1 June 2018, we installed a grinder to break down the waste before sending 

them to the biodigester. The new grinder can achieve 85% to 90% reduction 

in waste volume through grinding and compressing, which in turn increases 

the efficiency of the biodigester during digestion as the food has already been 

broken down into smaller pieces. A cost diversion was carried out, where the 

purchase of the food grinder can increase the overall efficiency without having 

to buy 2 more biodigesters to achieve the same efficiency. In fact, we can 

reduce the use of trash bags by 19,000 pieces, which is equivalent to 2 tonnes 

of plastic. Moreover, the introduction of the grinder means that we can afford to 

reduce 3 trucks per year, which translates to 1,713 tonnes less carbon dioxide 

emitted into the atmosphere.

CASE STUDY 2 

ATTAINING THE TOP ACHIEVEMENT AWARD  

(MNC) FOR SINGAPORE PACKAGING AGREEMENT 

AWARD (SPA) 2018

The following initiatives led Genting Singapore to clinch the Top Achievement 

Award (MNC) for SPA Award 2018.

GENTING HOTEL JURONG 

INITIATIVES

At Genting Hotel Jurong, the  

wall-mounted dispensers for liquid 

amenities including shower gel, 

shampoo and hand soap for hotel 

rooms used to contain disposable 

cartridges of 325 ml and 525 ml. 

Since February 2018, the dispenser 

systems were replaced with recyclable 

2-litre refill packs. By this change, it 

is estimated that about 0.9 tonnes of 

plastic packaging waste and  

0.5 tonnes of transport packaging 

could be avoided annually as the refill 

packs come with less packaging and 

occupy less space.

OTHER INITIATIVES

RWS also worked with its egg supplier 

to reduce packaging waste from egg 

deliveries, and sent wooden pallets 

used for delivery of goods to its 

warehouse for recycling.

Since November 2017, RWS required its 

suppliers to optimise their packaging 

in accordance with guidelines under 

the SPA’s Singapore Environmental 

Code of Practice for the Packaging of 

Consumer Goods (ECOPP).





RWS has also established a 

conservation group at the S.E.A.A., 

known as Guardians of the S.E.A.A. 

(GOTS), which conducts various 

public engagement programmes to 

rally community support efforts in 

protecting the marine environment. 

To support the national effort towards 

becoming a Zero Waste Nation, 

GOTS collaborated with Zero Waste 

SG to support a year-long nationwide 

BYO (Bring Your Own) Schools 

programme beginning in September 

2017. The programme involved  

20 schools and more than 24,000 

students, saving more than 32,600 

plastic disposables from ending up 

as waste. As students understand 

about plastic disposables and 

marine litter through assembly 

talks and interactive booths, they 

became motivated to bring their own 

reusables and reduce the use of 

plastic disposables.

3R AWARDS FOR RWS FESTIVE HOTEL

In 2018, RWS also attained the 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) Awards for 

Festive Hotel.

For instance, individual sachets of sugar and plastic containers for sauces were 

replaced with refillable containers. Festive Hotel also collected returned room 

key cards and the cards were reprogrammed for new guests.  

Festive Hotel also sought to reduce the amount of potential waste generated 

by emptying the minibar in each room so that they can make use of the 

space for personal items instead. An online system was also implemented 

for procurement – related orders so that the amount of papers used will be 

reduced. We also required suppliers to deliver goods with less or no packaging, 

if not by reusable crates.

Lastly, leftover amenities or unwanted items in working condition were either 

reused at staff toilets or donated to charities.

Figure 28: Our land and marine biodiversity conservation approaches

BIODIVERSITY

Housing a 2.9 ha protected secondary forest and 

more than 100,000 individual animals within our 

premises, Genting Singapore takes a strong stance 

on the conservation of our biodiversity. Our land 

and marine biodiversity conservation approach is 

governed by biodiversity conservation principles, 

which are key to maintaining the wide variety of 

flora and fauna within our compounds. 

To monitor our performance, RWS conducts annual surveys to record native plant and marine species 

sightings within our premises biannually. Furthermore, experts from the Nature Society Singapore 

(NSS) are engaged upon request to examine the endangered species within our premises. Among 

plants and animals under our care, several species have been listed under national and international 

conservation lists for their vulnerable status (Figure 28). Besides our premise, we are conscious that 

we are part of larger Sentosa Island biodiversity system. There are 2 Nature Areas on the island; Mt. 

Imbiah and Mt. Serapong. Mt. Imbiah – north of the island is next to our 2.9 ha secondary forest, 

separated by Siloso Road. RWS forest was preserved during the construction period, and it serves  

as buffer for Mt. Imbiah. 

All marine species in S.E.A.A. are acquired sustainably in accordance to Association of Zoos and 

Aquariums’ (AZA) Animal Programme Standards. Stringent curatorial working procedures which are 

specific to different species are implemented to ensure the optimal animal health.

MARINE CONSERVATION PRIORITIES 

Guardians of the S.E.A.A. (GOTS), the conservation group of S.E.A.A. continues to make great 

strides this year in supporting education and public engagement efforts to protect the marine 

environment. It aims to protect the ocean by partnering with the community, through its strategies to 

Explore, Protect and Educate. In 2018, GOTS rolled out 14 public engagement initiatives, reaching 

out to more than 115,000 people. More information on the various initiatives can be found below.

GOTS will continue to develop our “Explore” strategy by continuing to support researchers and 

scientists. We will build relationships with various academic institutions or organisations to  

promote conservation action. Our aim is to secure populations of species in natural habitats in  

the long term and to support research studies to advance animal welfare in the aquarium and  

zoological community.

GOTS will “Protect” and “Educate” by continuing to lead and support conservation actions to 

impact and improve ocean health. One way we could do this is to encourage the community to 

better protect our natural resources. We will continue to host, support conservation activities inside 

and outside the Resort; these engagement activities will immerse our supporters to further their 

understanding of our Singaporean marine bio-diversity. GOTS will spread awareness of the issue 

on plastic pollution, and garner further support for our “Reduction of Single-use plastics campaign”.  

As the Resort embarks on future phases to remove other single-use plastic items (in addition to

PROTECT OUR OCEAN 

As of 1 October 2018, Resorts World Sentosa has stopped providing 

plastic straws at its five themed attractions (including Universal Studios 

Singapore and S.E.A.A.), as well as dining establishments such as 

celebrity chef restaurants and Malaysian Food Street. This resort-wide 

campaign was spearheaded by GOTS. While GOTS raises awareness 

on the issue of plastic pollution and garner support for this resort-wide 

initiative amongst our guests, we also recognise that support should start 

from our own employees and we embarked on a series of engagement 

sessions to reach out to team members across the resort. These 

engagement sessions touch on diverse topics, including our strawless 

campaign, general awareness of marine conservation and scientific facts.

2018 saw 358 members of the public and team members join us for our 

5 beach, reef and mangrove cleanups. Through the various cleanups, we 

successfully removed 905.5 kg of trash from Singapore’s shorelines, doing  

our part to keep our waterways beautiful. Our biggest beach cleanup saw  

214 volunteers collect 493 kg of trash. 

In June, 155 kg of trash, of which most were discarded glass bottles, was 

cleared from the waters around Pulau Hantu Kechil. The second reef cleanup 

in November hauled up 38 kg of trash. The first mangrove cleanup at Sungei 

Tampines saw participants haul up 102 kg of trash, amongst which were more 

than 1,900 plastic straws and more than 470 food wrappers. 

The information we collect goes to International Cleanup Singapore database, 

and is used to educate the public on marine debris issues and to encourage 

positive change in public policies. Data from reef cleanups is also handed to 

Project AWARE’s flagship citizen-science programme, Dive Against Debris®, 

which collates information on the distribution of marine litter around the globe. 







the “No Straws – Save Marine Life” campaign), we will continue with our engagement sessions to 

reach out to team members and public, to encourage others to reduce their own usage of single-use 

plastic items. 

We will continue to support the Sustainable Seafood Campaign, empowering people with more 

essential information. The information garnered on sustainable fishing practices may either 

enable them to make informed consumer choices, or help business units make more sustainable 

procurement choices. We will continue to generate awareness for the ocean, by supplementing 

our outreach efforts of our in-house GOTS booth and with our roving outreach community booths. 

GOTS will rally enthusiastic people to inspire them to take marine action by educating others 

about the aquariums conservation efforts, and other conservation efforts around the island. These 

conservation messages may be weaved through all other public-facing platforms, which may range 

from aquarium events, scientific talks, outreach booths, assembly talks, and others.

With support from the National Parks Board, GOTS 

released two rescued sea turtles into the waters around 

Singapore on 19 June 2018 in hopes that they breed and 

increase their populations in the wild. After more than 

two years of rehabilitation and care by the curatorial 

and animal health teams at the S.E.A.A., “Hawke” the 

hawksbill turtle returned to the waters of Sisters’ Islands 

Marine Park and “Louie” the green sea turtle was 

released into the waters of Pulau Semakau. Both turtles 

have been excellent animal ambassadors, shedding light 

on the plight of their wild population.

GOING FORWARD

To develop four science based 

lecture series for targeted 

audiences from the Polytechnic 

and University levels

   ACHIEVED

Over 10 schools with close to 60 students 

aged 15 to 18 participated in the Marine 

Youth Ambassador programme. In addition 

we provided a ‘Science in the S.E.A.A.’ 

speaker series in collaboration with James 

Cook University (JCU). JCU’s leading 

faculty members shared findings from 

their field research and inspired learning 

and conservation actions amongst the 

audience. The first Science in the S.E.A.A. 

session was conducted in February 2018, 

with three other conducted in 2018. Topics 

covered ranged from sharks, marine turtles, 

environmental DNA and aquaculture. About 

190 participants attended these four talks. 

To inspire the public to take action for marine 

conservation, GOTS also organised monthly 

events in the aquarium to interest, then 

educate about the ocean and its wildlife.  

8 such events, in celebration of 

internationally recognised conservation days, 

ranged from sharing sessions on coral  

bleaching, manta rays, marine relationships 

to upcycling workshops and games. 

These events welcomed about 550 marine 

enthusiasts, attracting a wide range of 

audience, ranging from young children  

to adults.

We will continue to generate 

awareness for the ocean, by

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

We believe in promoting an inclusive culture where our team members can grow and thrive 

in our diverse and vibrant environment. In alignment with this belief, we have adopted the  

20 International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, in addition to the five principles of 

the Tripartite Alliance for Fair &amp; Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP).

Our recruitment process is fair and just, we do not discriminate against any individual based on 

their race, age, gender, religion or nationality. We regularly hire senior citizens, persons with special 

needs from Grace Orchard School and Delta Senior School, as well as ex-offenders in partnership 

with the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises.

In the best interests of our team members, Genting Singapore provides a platform for employees 

to seek redress for labour practices or human rights grievances through the Grievance Handling 

Procedure. In 2018, there were no reported grievances on labour practices and human rights 

through this platform.

EMPLOYEE WELLNESS AND BENEFITS 

We believe that taking good care of our team members will boost their morale and productivity 

at work. Besides healthcare and insurance for our team members, Genting Singapore organises 

company-wide events such as the Health and Wellness Week to improve the overall well-being of 

our team members as well as to raise awareness on the topic. Facilities such as the clinic for all 

team members and gym access for performers are available in the resort. All staff are also entitled

TALENT DEVELOPMENT

We believe that our human capital is a key contributor to our business growth. Learning 

opportunities are provided for our team members to improve their skills, knowledge and 

capability to continually deliver memorable experiences in sync with our Service Vision of 

‘Creating Wow Moments Together’.

To lay the right foundation, new team members are expected to attend induction courses, where 

they are introduced to our Group policies, including our anti-corruption policy. Development 

programmes are catered specifically to Professional, Managers, Executives and Technicians 

(PMETs), to allow each of them to better understand the role they will play within the Group. 

Figure 33 shows the types of courses our employees may take, based on their needs and business 

units. Team members can also request for internal transfers to enhance their work experience  

and future career prospects. 

This year, Career maps which plan out the career route for key roles were developed to allow more 

transparency on the career opportunities and progression for team members.  



During the year, a team member satisfaction survey was carried out to measure satisfaction levels 

amongst our team members working in the Attractions at RWS. The overall satisfaction is 73.3%. 

Our turnover rate in 2018 is 14.7%, which is lower than the national average of 22%17.  

We also had over 1,300 team members join the Group this year.

Figure 36: Genting Singapore’s Safety Committee structure

WORKPLACE HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

Genting Singapore is committed to providing a safe and conducive environment for all team 

members. Our Safety Committee (Figure 35) oversees our company-wide Workplace Safety 

and Health (WSH) policy, which reaffirms the management’s commitment to WSH by ensuring 

that we abide by all regulatory requirements and to continue improving our safety and health 

performance. The policy is reviewed regularly and was last updated in August 2018.  

More information can be found below.

Another initiative we had for 2018 was to leverage on the national programmes, such as SkillsFuture, 

to further enhance our training and development initiatives. In June 2018, we partnered with various 

learning partners, including Attractions, Resorts &amp; Entertainment Union (AREU), Employment and 

Employability Institute (e2i), NTUC Learning Hub, to run a series of Learning Festivals in various 

locations of RWS. The aim of these festivals was to reach out to Team Members and share with 

them more on the upskilling opportunities and development initiatives. We shared with the team 

members about the use of SkillsFuture credits, bite-sized mobile learning platforms like the ULeap 

application and development courses available for them, such as Workforce Skills Qualification 

(WSQ) Workplace Skills and Leadership &amp; People Management frameworks. 

The safety steering committee meets on a quarterly basis to discuss safety performance and 

programmes, as well as the follow-up actions by the respective committees.

ROBUST OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

We attained bizSAFE Level Star Status for Occupational Health and Safety Management System, 

exceeding the minimum local requirement of bizSAFE Level 3. For the scope of work covered by 

Facilities Management and Engineering (FM&amp;E), our system also adheres to ISO45001. 

The best system prevents accidents from happening in the first place; hence, 

hazard identification and elimination is crucial in protecting our employees’ 

safety. The risk registers are prepared by the Safety and Emergency Planning 

department via on-site inspections with area owners and inputs from our near 

misses and accidents reporting process. The safety risk assessments are 

reviewed three times a year or whenever an incident happens or when there 

are significant process changes. For all recorded work-related incidents, 

corrective and preventive actions are implemented and monitored for 

effectiveness, appropriateness and adequacy. 

Besides our own employees, we extend the same standard to all contractors 

and service providers. Safety induction and meetings are held by departments 

and their contractors before work starts. Safety considerations are included 

in our criteria when shortlisting vendors during the procurement process. The 

appointed contractors’ management system is reviewed regularly for their 

robustness and their safety performance constitutes part of the assessment 

during their contract renewal process.

We believe accident prevention and promotion of safety practices are responsibilities of every team 

member. Each department has its own safety committee meeting to involve team members in the 

promotion of safety practices relevant to their roles and responsibilities. Once a month, a safety 

inspection is done together with the respective Head of Department. Work-related incidents are 

communicated to employees during department safety committee meetings, pre-shift briefings, 

safety video at wardrobe areas, induction training, safety bulletins and safety alerts. We also 

take into account team members from different backgrounds to ensure that these services are 

communicated in a language that they can understand. The workers are also encouraged to report 

any unsafe act through various channels such as whistle-blowing channels, HR touchpoints and 

WSH common mailbox.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES

As we carry out the day-to-day running of business operations for RWS, we are mindful of 

the importance of leaving a positive impact in our local communities by empowering and 

engaging the underprivileged and disadvantaged. We believe in inspiring our team members 

to give back to the community from the heart where our philanthropic strategy is carried 

out in response to evolving needs of the community and making the most positive impact 

on less fortunate members of society. This is primarily achieved through the many activities 

and programmes driven by RWS Cares, the company’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) 

platform. A robust selection process for choosing the beneficiaries ensures that our CSR 

efforts will have a lasting and positive impact. We also prefer long-term partnership to 

ad-hoc activities; for example, a five-year partnership with Community Chest was inked to 

provide both cash and in-kind support from 2014 to 2018. We have started a formal process 

for feedback to enhance the effectiveness of each event.

PERFORMANCE 

In 2018, we contributed to and enabled more than S$8.4 million in cash and in-kind donations to 

various charity organisations in Singapore, registering a significant increase from our contributions 

of about S$6.2 million in 2017. Children, youths and elderly remain the key focus in our outreach, 

where more than 78% of donations went toward these causes. Genting Singapore has also joined 

the national movement towards building a more caring and inclusive society by sponsoring venues 

and providing technical expertise for events that empower the special needs community and 

individuals with disabilities.

Our volunteerism spirit continues to strengthen each year with our one-day Volunteer Leave, which 

team members can utilise, over and above their annual leave, to take part in CSR events organised 

or endorsed by RWS Cares. As such, we clocked more than 8,500 volunteer hours in 2018, which 

translated to $262,000 worth in salary cost. In total, RWS Cares has engaged and reached out to 

more than 40,000 beneficiaries.



More than 370 senior management and team members rolled up their sleeves 

for aRWSome Volunteer Day on 17 August 2018, the second year of RWS’s 

annual home cleaning and refurbishment project. For the first time, RWS 

worked with two Community Development Councils (CDC) – South West CDC

More than 500 underprivileged children strode 

down the streets of New York in Universal Studios 

Singapore as part of Santa’s Snowy Sleigh Ride 

parade led by Mr Tan Hee Teck, Chief Executive 

Officer of RWS and Ms Denise Phua, Mayor of 

Central Singapore District. This is the highlight of 

aRWSome Wishes held on 30 November 2018, 

where RWS team members volunteered their time 

to host the children to a day at the theme park 

and purchased Christmas presents for all of them 

out of their own pockets. RWS also designed an 

eco-friendly Christmas e-card and pledged  

S$5 to Community Chest for every card sent, with 

donations channelled towards the Compassvale 

Bow Adult Disability Home, Singapore’s first 

specialised home for adults with autism.

An ExtraOrdinary Celebration

Volunteer Leave

We were Official Venue Partner in support 

of An ExtraOrdinary Celebration concert, 

organised by ExtraOrdinary People Limited, 

a charity dedicated to serving children and 

youth with special needs to foster a more 

inclusive society. Sponsoring the use of 

Resorts World Theatre and lending our

platform for more than 500 children, 

comprising those with special needs as well 

as students from mainstream schools, to 

put up Singapore’s largest inclusive concert. 

The event on 10 November 2018, celebrating 

children with different abilities and talents, 

was attended by Mr Ng Chee Meng, Minister 

in Prime Minister’s Office and Secretary-

General of National Trades Union Congress.

RWS continues to strongly

RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING ACCREDITATION

In December 2018, RWS has once again successfully attained the RG Check accreditation and 

achieved the highest score amongst more than 150 venue accreditations and reaccreditations 

completed to date by the Responsible Gambling Council. This milestone speaks of the commitment 

of RWS Casino’s executive team and casino staff to implement significant player safeguards. 

RWS remains committed to the prevention of underage and problem gambling within our casino 

premises. RWS takes on a holistic approach to Responsible Gambling (RG), cumulating in the aim to

FIRST GAMING OPERATOR TO CONTRIBUTE IN RGF NEWSLETTER

Our close collaboration with the government and strong RG Programme has allowed us to be the 

first gaming operator to contribute an industry sharing piece in the RGF bi-annual e-newsletter. The 

e-newsletter, which is distributed to gambling operators as well as the public, is aimed at promoting 

a shared commitment and understanding towards responsible gambling through the regular sharing 

of RG information, experiences and best practices. 

In the article, which can be seen in the pictures below, we shared our RG approach, as well as 

introduced our various RG initiatives and what RG means to us. 

RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING AWARENESS WEEK (RGAW) 2018

One of the marquee events of the RGF is also the Responsible Gambling Awareness Week (RGAW) 

2018, which was held from 5-13 April 2018. The theme this year “Have You Crossed the Line?” 

encouraged patrons to reflect on their gambling behaviour and avoid problem gambling. 

During this period, RWS hosted three sessions of RG roadshows in the casino. 14 RG Ambassadors, 

together with representatives from the MSF, engaged patrons in a series of interactive games to 

raise awareness about the randomness of casino games, in setting limits and playing responsibly.

The roadshows saw a turnout of more than 700 patrons, with some participants expressing 

appreciation for our Ambassadors’ reminders to gamble responsibly. The RG Ambassadors, who 

are our Casino Team Members, are specially trained to recognise behaviours that suggest problem 

gambling and to provide information and assistance to casino patrons.

OUR SUPPORT FOR NATIONAL SERVICE 

OUR APPROACH 

Cognisant of the importance National Service (NS) plays for the safety and security of Singapore’s 

social fabric, Genting Singapore fully supports our operationally-ready NSmen in fulfilling their NS 

and reservist responsibilities. Our HR policies enable our NSmen to strengthen their commitment to 

serving the nation, by organising fitness events to encourage them to lead healthy lifestyles. 

As representatives sitting on the Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence (ACCORD), 

Genting Singapore has worked closely with stakeholders, businesses and members of the public to 

raise support and understanding on national defence matters. 

In 2018, we celebrated Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Day for the sixth year. Team members 

who are operationally-ready national servicemen are encouraged to come to work on 2 July 2018 

(Monday) in their SAF uniform in a show of solidarity and pride. Other team members are also 

encouraged to show their appreciation to NSmen.
