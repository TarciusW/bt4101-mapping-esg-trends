1. BOARD STATEMENT 

 

 

  

We are pleased to present our third Sustainability Report of Shanghai Turbo Enterprises Limited (“STE” or 

“Group”) which covers the Group’s performance from 1 January to 31 December 2020 (Reporting period). 

This report covers all relevant materials of sustainable issues, performance and ESG factors of our group and 

it is prepared according to the Core Option of Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards. 

 

The Board of Directors (“Board”) appoints a 3-member Steering Committee consisting of the AC Chairman, 

the General Manager (Long Wei has resigned on 13th May 2020, Tan Juay Kiat was appointed on 13 May 

2020 and left on 31 August 2020 and Gao Zhong took over since 5 November 2020) and the lead supervisor 

to work with the Working Committee since May 2019. In the process, the team brought out many issues for 

discussion and had provided pragmatic solutions. 

 

In 2020, the board of directors worked hand in hand with the management focusing more on the production 

areas like enhancing machine programming, waste management, etc. Reducing our impacts on the 

environment has been an important part of how we run our business for many years. Over the years, besides 

reducing the impact on the surrounding environment through efficient waste management, recycling of 

scrap materials such as copper and paper, we have also raised employee awareness on critical issues in 

sustainable development through relevant initiatives. There is a 9% increase in energy cost in 2020 mainly 

due to a 37% increase in the production volume. 

 

During the Covid-19 pandemic period, we have experienced near-term business-model disruptions and 

broader transition risks. The pandemic presented an unforeseen challenge to industrial operators as they 

face the immediate impact of plummeting demand for many products, as well as pressing needs to ensure 

the safety of the employees. During 1Q FY2020, in accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of 

China on the Prevention and Control of Covid-19, the JiangSu province and ChangZhou City had announced 

on 29 January 2020 that all the factories must not resume work before 9 February 2020. The subsidiary 

actually resumed work on 13 February 2020. The manufacturing sites are now subjected to strict hygiene 

and social distancing requirements. We are fortunate that there has been no infection involving our China 

employees and their families throughout the year. 

 

The 3 non-executive independent directors, Dr. Pan Penwei, Mr. Victor Goh Yeow Kiang and Mr. Joseph Liew 

Yoke Pheng were appointed on 6 June 2009 and they had all stepped down at the AGM held on 30 June 

2020. Dr. Wong Kee Hau (Non-Independent and Non-Executive Director &amp; NC Member) was appointed on 30 

April 2019 and resigned on 16 June 2020, Mr. Huang Wooi Teik (Non-Executive Chairman and Lead 

Independent Director, NC Chairman, AC Member &amp; RC Member), Mr. Loh Kai Keong (Non-executive and 

Independent Director, AC Chairman, NC Member &amp; RC Member) and Mr. Lee Kiang Piaw (Non-executive and 

Independent Director, AC Member, NC Member &amp; RC Member) were all appointed on 30 April 2020 and 

resigned on 30 June 2020. Mr. Shi Bin (Non-Executive Chairman and Lead Independent Director, NC 

Chairman, RC Chairman and AC Member) was appointed on 9 June 2020 and resigned on 30 September 

2020.  

 

The board now comprises 3 Non-executive and Independent Directors and 1 Non-independent director.  Mr. 

Hong Yong (Non-Executive Chairman and Lead Independent Director, NC Chairman, RC Chairman &amp; AC 

Member) was appointed on 30 September 2020, Mr. Poh Siew Beng (Non-executive and Independent 

Director, AC Chairman, NC Member &amp; RC Member) was appointed on 8 July 2020, Mr. Foo Chee Meng

2.3 Our Capabilities 

We are China’s leading High-Technology Industrial Vane Manufacturer. To meet the high degree of 

dimensional accuracy required in our manufacturing process, we continually invest in cutting-edge 

technology. Our CNC precision machineries include Japanese-made Mori Seiki machines, Swiss-made 

Starragheckert 5-axis manufacturing equipment, Korean-made Daewoo vertical manufacturing machines and 

10 latest models of Italy-made C.B. Ferrari precision manufacturing equipment. 

 

China’s economy was the first to be hit by the COVID-19 outbreak, the first to be locked down, and the first 

to begin an economic recovery. We would examine the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on China’s GDP growth 

using a set of alternative growth indicators. 2020 was full of challenges brought about by the Covid-19 

pandemic.  We had devoted a lot of our resources to regain our key clients’ confidence in CZ3D’s 

capabilities. The entire sales and production processors had been enhanced with the ultimate intention to 

increase customer satisfaction in all areas. As such, we have been reinforcing our pool of skilled workers and 

sourcing new talents through on-job training.

2.4 Regaining The Old Ground And New Business Growth Initiatives 

Diversification, Downstream and Upstream business expansion 

In 2020, we strived to rebuild our existing overseas customers’ confidence in us and continued to explore 

other new OEM products in worldwide. We had consumed a lot of new resources to establish and sustain 

the business opportunities. We will continue to venture into new industries and innovative products. On the 

other hand, we continue to focus on current precision vane product and other precision vane products at 

lower profit margins as these core products help to greatly cover our overhead costs. 

 

In the next 3 years, we will maintain our core business of vane production while transforming and 

diversifying to become a qualified supplier of aviation blades, OEM product for medical, robotic and 

automotive components. Our target is to reduce our 100% reliance on income from vane products to 50% or 

less.

3. SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT AND APPROACH   

 

We are aware of the responsibility of an organization towards its community and country in relation to 

sustainable ESG factors before the Singapore Stock Exchange’s (“SGX”) mandated for all listed entities to 

report their sustainability performance as most of our senior staffs had attended ESG-related talks and 

implemented policies according to the local compliance which could be found in this report. 

 

In recent years, the change in the procurement method of turbine manufacturers has put OEMs like us in a 

disadvantage, as our profit margins are being squeezed due to fierce competitions. We do believe through 

the vertical expansion of our business, we can reduce both material wastages and processing time drastically. 

This, in turn, will increase our profit margin significantly in the long run. 

 

During 2020, STE has adopted a sustainability framework based on the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) 

standard guidelines (Core Option) in the preparation of this report. This report is part of our annual report 

that is also available at STE’s website at www.Shanghaiturbo.com 

 

3.1 Participation of Key Management in formation of our sustainability strategy 

A Steering Committee (3 members comprising AC Chairman, GM and the lead supervisor) and a Working 

Committee (5 members including deputy GM, group FC, subsidiary FM, HR manager and the lead supervisor) 

were formed to lead the Company’s sustainability efforts and are responsible for periodical meetings with 

the Board to determine sustainability issues in its business decisions. Sustainability and risk management are 

emphasized in the evaluation of any new orders or investment opportunities. The process has identified 

several materiality ESG factors for STE that are reflected in our materiality matrix under material 

considerations.

3.2 Materiality Identification Process 

 

During our materiality assessment process, we have prioritized the following steps: 

 

1. Identify and Define important issues that might impact our business strategy 

2. Sort out critical factors that might affect our stakeholders 

3. Prioritize selected factors and validate their severity within each business unit 

4. Embed solutions in the system and monitor regularly 

5. Adopt them to become our SOP or corporate culture when tested reliable  

 

The Committees identified the specific ESG factors which are material to the Group based on their collective 

and respective knowledge, the industrial perspectives and the implications to our operations. Besides the 

regular in-house meetings on operational and financial progress, the committee members also engaged in 

regular dialogue sessions with the stakeholders for feedback and suggestions. For easy understanding of our 

stakeholders’ concern, (Stakeholders include our customers, employees, investors, suppliers, community and 

regulators), we chart the following materiality matrix to reflect their degree of importance towards the 

topics during the year 2019.

3.6 Engaging the Stakeholders 

The Company’s sustainability objectives must always be the interest and concern of our stakeholders. 

We had listed out here the 6 key groups in this report. 

 

We firmly believe that truthful and regular communication is the key to healthy stakeholder relationship.  

Over the years, we have engaged them via AGM, annual dinners, incentive tours, in-house training 

programs, annual industry convention, business talks and seminars, product exhibitions and international  

trade shows. Each of our business unit has always kept our stakeholders in mind in search of achieving  

our business excellence.

5.2 Current Human Capital Market in Changzhou 

 

During the year, 65 employees left the company representing 36% of staff members in 2020 due to personal 

reasons. The company faces more difficulty in attracting younger workers to join our traditional factory and 

work regime, particularly the polishing department where the air particle density is much higher. The ratio of 

annual total compensation of highest- paid individual to the median of total compensation for all employees 

is around 17 times for this reporting year.

During the year, the HR department had implemented several policies to enhance the benefits for the 

workers and staff which include contributing to their social security in 5 categories - transport allowances, 

seasonal greeting &amp; gifts, annual paid leaves &amp; free vocation, medical check-up expenses and paid medical 

leaves etc. For married female workers, they are eligible to apply for paid maternity leave. For recruitment 

effort, there were more than 10 recruitment activities during the year. Trainees are given in- house training 

and coaching by the seniors, internship programs are extended to schools which collaborate with us. 

Company maintains a relatively stable employee union since incorporation. Headed by the manager of 

General Affairs Department, its role is to facilitate an effective communication channel with the 

management and organizing activities in cohesive building and enhancing corporate cultures. 

 

Costs austerity measures have been implemented to ensure the manpower are streamlined without 

compromising productivity and innovation in our product lines. More R&amp;D and higher level technical staffs 

will be recruited to strengthen the core technology department in order to cope with the new non-vane 

businesses.

7. MEASURES AND TARGETS for 2021 

In the coming years we will be focusing in resolving the following concerns. 

Sustainability Concerns 

Policies &amp; Measures 

Targets &amp; Impacted  

SDG Goals  

Diversification for 

Growth and 

Sustainability  

Our machines and skilled workers allow us 

to venture into other areas of product lines 

beside turbo engine vanes. Profit margin 

could be lower but it helps to cover some 

overhead cost. Also we are now working on 

several potential downstream businesses 

for acquisition and to expand our business 

upstream to be in a better bargaining 

position. 

 

 

 

In the next 3 years, we will 

maintain our core business 

of vane production while 

transforming and 

diversifying to becoming a 

qualified supplier of 

aviation blades, OEM 

product for medical, 

robotic and automobile 

component. Our target is 

to transform from a 100% 

single vane processing 

structure to 50% or less.  

 

Environmental  

Compliance  

(There are five targets 

set for the coming 

year)  

1. Work Place Air and Environment  

We have set up a maintainance unit to 

constantly monitor the air condition and 

discharge level on a weekly basis. Workers 

of certain production lines will be sent for 

medical check-up regularly. HR department 

will report to the weekly management 

meetings. 

 

2. Waste Management 

We review the qualification and 

performance of our contractors regularly 

and assign supervisor to monitor their 

disposal procedures randomly.  

 

3. Production Safety Standardization 

We are to conduct in-house training and 

awareness seminars with all level of 

workers quarterly to ensure all safety 

standardization requirement SOPs are fully 

complied. 

 

4. Supply Chain/Responsible Procurement 

To ensure raw material supplies (about 

80% purchased locally in 2019) are reliable 

 

To renovate the Polishing 

department and to 

improve the exhaust 

system by the third quarter 

of 2020 and in 2021.  

 

 

 

 

Put in place a review 

committee in the next 

review and selection of 

contractors during 

2020/2021. 

 

Zero accident due to high 

awareness of safely rules in 

2020. 

 

 

 

 

A committee consists of 

staff of supply, accounts &amp;

and flexible within our purchasing and 

supply level, we are constantly sourcing for 

new suppliers and reviewing their supply 

code of conduct.  

Also, we are implementing responsible 

procurement policies in the selection of 

construction vendors, material suppliers 

and project partners and monitor their 

ongoing performance.  

 

5. Energy Saving Plans  

In 2016 our power consumption was nearly 

RMB 5 million in which wasted energy due 

to poor power management and old 

compressors had significantly reduced our 

profit. 

We had replaced an old generator in 2017 

and put in place an energy saving plan of 

controlling the switches in a reasonable 

level. During this reporting year the power 

consumption had dropped to RMB2.35 

million, the reduction was partially 

attributed by the reduction in production 

volume. 

production departments 

will review the suppliers 

during the 3rd quarter of 

2020 and in 2021. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We will continue to ensure 

energy saving policy is 

consistent. The production 

unit concerned has set to 

reduce the energy saving in 

2021. By implementing &amp; 

enforcing SOPs in place, 

the energy cost definitely 

will be reduced and saved 

in 2021.  

 

Recruitment and  

Upgrading of  

skilled workers 

We are working closely with the local 

technical and vocational schools for fresh 

graduates to join the company to ensure a 

continual supply of younger workers with 

better technical know-how. Better 

incentives are provided to workers that are 

willing to learn and upgrade themselves. 

Also, by constantly reviewing their piece 

rates vs the complication of the work itself 

to ensure workers’ pay are fair and 

sustainable. 

 

To reduce the attrition 

rates by 5% in the next 

reporting year through 

revived incentives scheme 

and loyalty bonus. We also 

set targets for every worker 

at all levels to improve 

his/her skill by at least one 

grade in 

2021. 

 

Corporate  

Social  

Responsibility (CSR)    

We have plans to promote healthy life style 

among the industrial zone with annual walk 

&amp; jog campaign where charity contribution 

is a built-in element. Also we are proposing 

to set up a Scholarship schemes for both 

our staff children and for some selected 

schools in the long run. 

 

We aim to kick start the 

above plan by second half 

of the year 2021.
