WEE HUR HOLDINGS LTD 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

Dear Stakeholders, 

 

I am very pleased to share with you the Sustainability 

Report of Wee Hur Holdings Ltd (“the Company” or 

“Wee Hur”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) for the 

financial year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

We have achieved an important milestone in FY2018. 

Our 

1st Purpose-Built 

Student 

Accommodation 

(“PBSA”) in Brisbane, Unilodge Park Central was 

partially completed in May 2018 and we received our 

1st batch of student in July 2018. The whole PBSA 

was completed in September 2018 and it is in full 

operation since January 2019. We are collecting 

environmental data for this PBSA to help to improve 

our sustainability disclosure for the financial year ended 

31 December 2019 (“FY2019”). 

 

We are pleased to share also the receipt of Certificate 

of Merit for Parc Centros in BCA Construction 

Excellence Award 2018 and BCA Green Mark Award 

(GoldPlus) 2018 for Parc Botannia. These awards are

the testimonial of our commitment to deliver projects with 

high quality, environmental, health and safety standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At Wee Hur, we design and build with the community 

in mind. We endeavour to create innovative and 

sustainable buildings locally and beyond. We adopt 

a comprehensive approach to managing the 

environmental impact of our building designs and 

construction 

activities. 

We 

strictly 

comply 

with 

environmental rules and regulations and review our 

environmental policies and performance annually to 

continuously improve the effectiveness in mitigating 

environmental risks. 

 

In FY2018, we have continued to leverage on technology 

to improve productivity at our construction sites. We 

embarked on the use of a web-based mobile 

application to manage our Permit to Work system, site 

safety inspections and corrective actions. This replaces 

the traditional paper-based system and allows the 

safety team to perform more efficiently and productively 

in their work.  

The Group is committed to providing a safe working 

environment for all employees. Our health and safety 

performance have significantly improved as compared 

to the financial year ended 31 December 2017 

(“FY2017”), and we have seen a reduced number of 

incidents, zero fatalities and no stop-work days in 

FY2018.  

Our people are our greatest assets. We endeavour to 

empower our people by developing them to their fullest 

potential with regular training and education. We encourage 

employees to embrace and adapt to changes to support 

our growth and steer the Group ahead.   

 

 

 

 

 

I am thankful to our shareholders, business associates, 

consultants, sub-contractors, suppliers, employees and 

other stakeholders that have supported us and 

contributed in making our progress possible. I am also 

grateful to the Board of Directors (“the Board”) for 

their guidance and support. Thank you for your interest 

in Wee Hur’s sustainability journey. I hope you enjoy 

reading this report.  

 

Sincerely,  

GOH YEOW LIAN 

Executive  Chairman and Managing Director

Low glazing-to-facade ratio which improves thermal efficiency

Vertical solar fins are designed for west-facing glazing, which reduces heat 

accumulation in the rooms and improves resident comfort

Utilisation of reed switches at windows in rooms so that air-conditioning is switched off if the 

windows are opened

LED lights will be used throughout the building

By selecting efficient water fittings and water management measures incorporated in the design, the predicted 

water consumption fares better than the average residential water consumption rates. 

We have incorporated energy and water management initiatives in our PBSA building designs.

leakages.  

All our construction projects are equipped with Earth Control Measure as part of the requirement to control 

earth and silt from being discharged into public drains that lead to water catchment areas. The collected water 

containing a mixture of mud and silt will be treated and filtered before being discharged into the common public 

drainage.

Our public safety measures include managing site access to ensure that site boundaries are clearly and physically 

defined with proper constructed hoardings. Access to construction site is restricted with biometric access at security 

post, and we have security guards manning the site to prevent unauthorised entry. Where construction works are 

near the site boundary, overhead catch platforms and shelters above hoarding are provided to ensure public safety.

Vector Control (GRI 413-1) 

Vector control plans are implemented at every construction site to prevent mosquito breeding. National Environment 

Agency (“NEA”) officers are invited to give talks during our annual campaign to eradicate mosquito breeding. 

The worksites are divided into different zones, with personnel in-charge assigned for each zone to monitor and 

take action to prevent any forms of mosquito breeding. 

We have also implemented cross-checking of sites for mosquito breeding to remain vigilant. External pest control 

companies are also engaged to carry out checks and regular insecticide spray to control mosquito breeding. 

We take a serious view on mosquito breeding as it might lead to a health hazard for our workers like dengue fever. 

Three instances of mosquito breeding were discovered at our project sites in FY2018. 

Innovation and Excellence (GRI 203-2) 

We adopted the use of biometric authentication system for our PUB Waterhub project. The system allows capturing 

of entry and exit of personnel at the worksite automatically using biometric authentication, thereby increasing security 

and reducing the need for manual recording and compilation of reports. 

In FY2018, we embarked on the use of a web-based mobile application to manage our Permit to Work system, as 

well as to manage site safety inspections and corrective actions. This replaces the traditional paper-based system and 

allows the safety team to perform more efficiently and productively in their work. We have selected the system vendor 

and are in the process of finalising the details of our requirements. We expect the system to roll out in the first quarter 

of FY2019.

Workplace Health and Safety (GRI 403-1, 403-3, 403-4) 

Wee Hur has a risk management plan in place for our construction sites to identify, analyse and management 

the risks throughout the lifecycle of the project.  

The project manager works closely with the project team members to ensure that risks are managed during the 

construction process. Risks will be identified as early as possible in the project so as to minimise their impact. 

The health and safety of employees is our number one priority  

The Group has implemented an Environment, Health and Safety Management System to uphold best practices for 

workplace safety. 

 

A safety committee team (“Safety Committee”) is formed for every project site, chaired by the project manager and 

assisted by the Workplace Safety and Health Officer (“WSHO”). A Safety Committee site-walk and meeting is convened 

every fortnightly to ensure all procedures are in place. Non-compliances are identified, and action plans are 

formulated to prevent recurrence. 

For all new workers, they will undergo a safety induction briefing conducted by the Safety Committee before being 

allowed to commence work on site. For contractors, all personnel and workers entering construction sites will 

undergo a safety orientation by the site WSHO before they are allowed to work. Daily toolbox meetings are 

conducted to remind workers to thoroughly review the work for the day and the safety issues to look out for. 

We also conduct twice weekly mass exercise and safety talk at all project sites for all contractors. Safety briefings, 

demonstration and talk are given to all workers to educate and remind them on safety. For all high-risk activities, 

a permission-to-work system is in place and the checklist will need to be checked by the safety assessor before 

approval from the project manager is obtained for the work. Site safety is reviewed monthly during the senior 

management review meeting for every site, where project managers report on the safety performance of their projects. 

Regular safety promotion campaigns are also conducted at project sites to raise awareness and remind workers of 

the best practices expected of them. Emergency drills are conducted to instil the level of vigilance in our workers 

to respond effectively to emergencies at construction sites.  

A near miss is an unplanned event that did not result in any injury, illness or damage, but had the potential to do so. 

By tracking near misses, we can take pre-emptive action before an incident happens. Our Group abides by 

Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) regulations regarding the reporting requirements for work related incidents. 

In FY2018, there were four reportable incidents at our construction sites.  

Our health and safety performance have significantly improved as compared to FY2017. We have seen a reduced 

number of incidents, zero fatalities and no stop-work days in FY2018.

Managing our Suppliers (GRI 308-1, 414-1) 

Wee Hur strives to ensure that suppliers throughout the supply chain meet the practices and standards expected by 

the Group.  

Suppliers and subcontractors are required to declare and acknowledge their responsibilities in ensuring compliance to 

local regulations. Above and beyond, we comply with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standards 

and assess our suppliers and subcontractors based on their environmental and social obligations. 

Fines or Penalty (GRI 307-1, 308-2, 414-2, 419-1) 

Wee Hur received fines of $32,300 in FY2018. We have an overall monitoring structure to ensure that corrective actions 

have been implemented to effectively reduce future occurrences.

As a result of our safety measures, safety performance has vastly improved, as evident from the reduction in near miss 

and non-reportable incidents. 

To promote safety awareness, we have started the monthly evaluation of site safety performance. Safety Committee will 

conduct monthly safety audits and evaluate the safety performance at every site. The performance of every site will be 

circulated to all teams to encourage them to place more emphasis on safety, and areas for improvement will be 

highlighted. 

For project sites with poorer safety performance, the frequency of corporate safety inspections and audits will be 

increased. Close guidance will be given to the team to improve their safety performance in the shortest time possible.

Energy, Emissions and Water Management  (GRI 302-1, 302-3, 302-5, 303-1, 305-2, 305-4, 305-5) 

The energy and water consumption increased in FY2018 as compared to FY2017, as there was an increase in the 

number of occupants. As a result, the intensity ratio of consumption per occupant decreased despite the increase in 

consumption.  

This attests to the effectiveness of our energy and water management, and we will continue our efforts to minimise 

consumption.  

Waste Management  (GRI 306-1, 306-2) 

The sewage and sanitary drainage system at Tuas View Dormitory is designed and operated in accordance to the 

requirements and provisions of the Sewerage and Drainage Act. All waste water generated from the dormitory are 

discharged into the public sewer according to the requirements and provisions of the Sewerage and Drainage Act.  

Occupant Health and Safety (GRI 416-1) 

Induction programmes are conducted for occupants during check-in to inform them of the safety rules and regulations. 

Posters for safety and health awareness have also been placed around the residential area for tenants in different 

languages to educate them of safety precautions. Regulatory bodies such as the Singapore Police Force, NEA and 

MOM are invited to conduct roadshows to engage with the occupants to educate on safety and legal obligations 

in Singapore. 

 

Wee Hur takes a firm stand towards complying with legal and regulatory requirements and ensures that treatment 

for fogging, larviciding and treatments for rats, cockroaches and mosquitoes are conducted to ensure cleanliness of 

premises. Clean room awards are given to occupants who display outstanding efforts in maintaining a hygienic premise. 

PBSA 

Our 1st PBSA, Unilodge Park Central, Brisbane has been in full operations since the beginning of 2019, and we are

By engaging employees, there will be more intra and inter-department interaction, as well as between employees 

and management. The Group has also rolled out initiatives like meals and sports allowances to promote cohesiveness 

amongst employees and to promote active and healthy lifestyles. With these initiatives, the Group ensures the 

employees’ well-being and all-round personal development. Employees will also be able to better understand the 

Group’s policies and direction and providing feedback or suggestions to improve areas that may be lacking. 

Wee Hur supports the government’s pro-family policies and follows MOM regulations with regards to parental leave.
