Board Statement 

 

3 

 

 

The Board of Directors (the “Board” or 

“Directors”) of Aoxin Q &amp; M Dental Group 

Limited (the “Company” or “Aoxin Q &amp; M”, 

and together with its subsidiary corporations, 

the “Group”) are pleased to present our third 

sustainability report (the “Report”). This 

Report sets out what we have done in the 

economic, environmental and social aspects 

of our business in the financial year ended 31 

December 2019 (“FY2019”), as well as the 

measures the Group had adopted to achieve 

sustainable 

development.

As a Group, we are committed to creating sustainable and long-term business growth, while 

leading and shaping positive change for our industry and customers, the communities we 

operate in, our people, and the environment. Since our listing in April 2017, the Group has, 

in our pursuit for growth, placed strong emphasis on environmental protection, workplace 

safety, staff training, and responsibility to the society. Sustainable development is already 

integrated into the way we conduct our business and each and every one of us at Aoxin Q &amp; 

M has a role to play. 

 

As at 31 December 2019, the Group has expanded its operations to 17 dental centres, 

comprising 6 dental hospitals and 11 polyclinics. Despite the 18% increase in the Group’s 

total revenue from RMB119.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”) to 

RMB141.1 million for FY2019, the Group’s overall performance was impacted by the 

gestational losses incurred for the setting up of new hospitals and clinics as well as higher 

expenses for training of dentists and staff to cater for its expansion. 

 

Moving into 2020, we expect the Group’s performance to be impacted by the COVID-19 

outbreak and gestational losses incurred for the new hospitals and clinics opened in FY2019. 

However, the Group will continue to focus our efforts on improving the revenue of the 

hospitals and clinics, reduce gestational losses, maximise the cost efficiency of the hospitals 

and clinics and increase dental chairs utilisation. The Group will remain focused on 

recruiting and training undergraduate dentists, nurses and laboratory technicians to support 

the Group’s long-term growth plan. Furthermore, we will collaborate with existing vendors 

to introduce products, such as dental materials and equipment, and reach out to new clients, 

as well as source for reputable vendors to increase the range of high-end products available 

to customers. However, amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, the Board will also continue to 

monitor the Group’s revenue, cash flows and evolving situation closely.  

 

We acknowledge the importance of sustainable development and we place strong emphasis 

on long-term sustainability when considering our Group’s long-term strategy, to unlock and 

maximise shareholders’ value. Our Board actively incorporates sustainability issues as part 

of our strategic formulation and oversees the management and monitoring of the material 

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors. As we work at improving our 

sustainability profile, we continue to remain committed in making consistent improvements 

to our services and products while upholding the tenets of integrity and ethics.

Supply Chain Management 

Engaging responsible partners remains as one of our focus areas when integrating a 

sustainable supply chain into our operations. Creating value through supporting local 

suppliers and assessing our key suppliers against our Group’s sustainability criteria are the 

main features of our supply chain management.  

 

The Group has a Procurement Policy in place which sets our guiding principles on the 

assessment of our suppliers against our Group’s sustainability criteria. Our sustainable 

procurement policies include strict adherence to the ethical code of conduct, which 

addresses issues of integrity, due diligence, fairness and conflict of interest in the selection 

of vendors, suppliers and contractors. In line with our Procurement Policy, our suppliers 

have undergone the Group’s stringent selection and evaluation criteria on a periodic basis 

to ensure that their performance align with the sustainability criteria established. We also 

ensure that all suppliers are registered with relevant local regulatory bodies for the sale of 

dental equipment and supplies. 

 

We engage with suppliers across all three business segments – Private Dental Services, 

Distribution of Dental Equipment and Supplies, and Laboratory Services. The significant 

dental equipment and supplies that the Group utilizes include dental chairs, ultrasound 

scanners, dental equipment, materials and consumables. Shenyang Maotai Q &amp; M Medical 

Equipment Co. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, is engaged in the distribution 

and sale of such dental equipment and supplies to dental hospitals, clinics, distributors and 

laboratories. 

 

We have continued our long-term distribution agreements with Shofu Dental Trading 

(Shanghai) Co. Ltd.（松风齿科器械贸易（上海）有限公司）, Align Technology (Shanghai) 

Trading Company Ltd.（爱齐（上海）商贸有限公司）and A-dec (Hangzhou) Dental 

Equipment Co. Ltd.（爱德（杭州）牙科设备有限公司）, as well as secured distribution 

rights for brands such as Shofu Dental for certain provinces, including the Liaoning Province 

in the Northern PRC. 

 

 

 

The Group has a team of certified technicians to provide maintenance and aftersales 

support to our customers for dental equipment and supplies within and beyond the 

warranty period, thus extending the useable lifespan of the equipment. We also work 

closely with our suppliers to ensure that equipment parts and technical support are 

available for our customers in the event that repairs are required.   

 

In addition, having 100% stakes and control of our hospitals, polyclinics and entities allow us 

to have full control of the procurement of dental equipment and supplies as well as fine 

tune the individual needs of our dental centres. As a result, we are better positioned to 

obtain bulk volume discounts from our suppliers and ensure continued sustainability of our 

supply chain.

Organisation chart – Management 

 

  




Governance and Sustainability Approach 

18 

 

The Board is committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance to ensure 

greater transparency and to protect the interests of our stakeholders. We have established 

the Sustainability and Risk Management Committee (“SRMC”) who, in consultation with the 

Board, oversees the development of the sustainability strategy, sustainability performance 

and monitoring, as well as the production of this sustainability report. The SRMC comprises 

of the following personnel as shown in the organisation chart below: 

 

 

 

Our approaches towards risk management of the Group’s daily operations include: 

• Establishing a quality assurance team, consisting of experienced technicians and 

engineers, who conducts routine checks on the dental equipment and supplies 

received from our suppliers, and; 

• Providing strong aftersales support to ensure customer satisfaction. 

 

In addition, we monitor and ensure compliance with all PRC laws and regulations in relation 

to quality standards, and constantly seek feedback from our dental professionals, patients, 

customers and relevant stakeholders. 

 

 

 




Governance and Sustainability Approach 

19 

 

Governance and Sustainability  

Our Group has put in place policies and procedures that will safeguard the interests of 

stakeholders and enhance stakeholders’ value as part of our effort to maintain high 

standards of corporate governance, in line with the principles and provisions of the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018 issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore where 

applicable. 

 

Creating a sustainable positive impact and value for our stakeholders is fundamental to us. 

Hence, we strive to create long-term growth by consistently enhancing our approach in the 

communication and management of ESG factors arising from our business operations and 

build on the sustainability efforts integrated into our operations. 

 

Conflict of Interest Policy 

The Board has also established procedures to address any potential conflict of interests 

faced by the Directors. Each Director is required to promptly disclose any conflict of interest, 

whether direct or indirect, in relation to a transaction or proposed transaction with the 

Group as soon as is practicable after the relevant facts have come to his knowledge. On an 

annual basis, each Director is also required to submit details of his other directorships and 

interests in other entities for the purpose of monitoring interested persons transactions. 

Where a Director has a conflict of interest in relation to any matter, he will recuse himself 

from discussions and decisions involving the issues of conflict.  

 

Interested Persons Transactions Policy  

Our Group has established procedures to ensure that all transactions with interested 

persons are reported in a timely manner to the Audit Committee (“AC”) and that the 

transactions are conducted on normal commercial terms and are not prejudicial to the 

interests of the Company and its minority shareholders. Such transactions are to be 

reviewed and approved by the key management, the AC and/or the Board, as the case may 

be, in accordance with prescribed procedures.  

 

Whistleblowing  

The Company has put in place a whistle-blowing policy to provide a channel for employees 

to report in good faith and in confidence, without fear of reprisals, concerns about possible 

improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. Information received pertaining to 

whistle blowing will be treated with confidentiality and restricted to the designated 

persons-in-charge of the investigation to protect the identity and interests of the whistle-

blowers. The objective for such an arrangement is to ensure independent investigation of 

such matters and for appropriate follow-up action. All complaints or information would be 

forwarded to the AC Chairman or the Financial Controller, where appropriate. Details of the 

whistle-blowing policy and arrangements have been made available to all employees, and 

can also be found at the Company’s website at http://www.aoxinqm.com.sg. 


Stakeholder Engagement 

 

20 

 

Accountability to Stakeholders  

At Aoxin Q &amp; M, we recognise the importance of a meaningful two-way engagement with 

our key stakeholders to understand their interests, expectations and address the economic 

and ESG topics that are material to our business and stakeholders, whilst taking into account 

any pivotal developments within this industry. We evaluate the needs and expectations of 

our key stakeholder groups which are significant to our Group’s value creation strategy and 

strive to build mutually beneficial relationships. The Company has regularly engaged its 

stakeholders through various medium and channels to ensure that the business interests 

are aligned with those of the stakeholders, to understand and address the concerns so as to 

improve services standards, as well as to sustain business operations for long-term growth. 

We have also made conscious efforts to seek the opinions of our stakeholders through 

formal and informal engagements as well as establishing an internal review process to 

integrate stakeholder feedback with our corporate strategies.

important to our stakeholders. As mentioned earlier, the Group constantly seek the 

opinions of its stakeholders and constantly evaluate the needs and expectations of our key 

stakeholder groups. As a result of these periodic assessments and efforts to engage our 

stakeholders, the Company uses the following materiality matrix to identify the material

Economic Performance 

 

22 

 

At Aoxin Q &amp; M, we strive to deliver sustainable long-term value for our stakeholders. In 

FY2019, we have continued to build on our entrance into the paediatric dentistry market 

and maintained our market position as one of the leading dental service providers in the 

region with the support of our extensive paediatric dentistry infrastructure network of 

Shenyang Aoxin Q&amp;M Stomatology Hospital Co. Ltd. (“Shenyang Aoxin”).  

 

Based on the Group’s unaudited financial statements results announcement for FY2019, we 

are pleased to share that the Group’s total revenue increased by 18% from RMB119.1 

million for FY2018 to RMB141.1 million for FY2019. This was due to the increase in revenue 

in the following three segments of our business: 

 

Revenue from the primary healthcare segment increased by 9% to RMB81.7 million in 

FY2019 from RMB75.1 million in FY2018. This was mainly due to an increase in revenue 

generated from the new hospitals and clinics of RMB11.0 million, which was partially offset 

by the overall decrease in revenue of RMB2.6 million from existing hospitals and clinics, and 

lower management fee of RMB1.9 million received from Shenhe District Sixth Hospital (“6th 

Hospital”) and Shenyang Huanggu Aoxin Dental Clinic Co., Ltd. (“Huanggu Clinic”). 

 

Revenue from the distribution of dental equipment and supplies segment increased by 44% 

to RMB46.5 million in FY2019 from RMB32.3 million in FY2018, mainly due to higher 

revenue from sales of both materials and dental equipment to distributors. 

 

Revenue from the provision of laboratory services increased by 11% to RMB13.0 million in 

FY2019 from RMB11.7 million in FY2018 due to higher revenue from government hospitals.  

For the avoidance of doubt, the abovementioned financial performance of the Group is 

based on the unaudited financial statement results announcements for FY2019. As the 

Group is still in the midst of finalizing its audited financial statements and annual report for 

FY2019, further details of the Group’s financial performance for FY2019 will be reported in 

the Company’s annual report for FY2019, which will be released by 14 June 2020. 

 

In FY2019, the Group has expanded to a total of 17 dental centres, comprising 6 dental 

hospitals and 11 polyclinics as compared to 11 dental centres, comprising 5 dental hospitals 

and 6 polyclinics in FY2018. 

 

 

Subsequent Reporting for FY2020 

Moving forward, we will continue our efforts on improving the revenue of the hospitals and 

clinics, reduce gestation losses, maximize cost efficiency of the hospital and clinics and 

increase dental chairs utilisation. The Group will also remain focused on recruitment and 

training of staff to support the Group’s strategy of expanding our operations in order to 

achieve long-term sustainable growth. However, amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, the Board 

will also continue to monitor the Group’s revenue, cash flows and evolving situation closely. 

 


Anti-Corruption 

 

23 

 

The Group is committed to a high standard of ethical conduct and adopts a zero-tolerance 

approach to fraud and corruption. We expect all employees to conduct themselves in 

accordance with the expectations set out in the code of conduct and places heavy emphasis 

on ethical business conduct. The Group will take a series of actions such as formal 

disciplinary proceedings in view of unethical conduct or malpractice in relation to corruption 

or fraud, if necessary. This moral code will enhance our business relationships and our 

corporate social responsibility. 

 

The Company also has in place a whistle-blowing policy, as mentioned in the “Governance 

and Sustainability Approach – Whistleblowing” section of this Report, which provides a 

proper avenue for stakeholders and employees to raise concerns on actual or suspected 

improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters and to receive feedback on 

any action taken. 

 

In addition, the PRC government has stepped up its anti-bribery efforts to reduce improper 

payments and other benefits received by staff in connection with the purchase of 

pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and supplies, and the provision of healthcare 

services. Under the revised anti-graft Bill, the new National Supervision Commission will 

have the power to conduct searches, seize property and freeze assets as well as detain 

suspects for up to six months as part of corruption investigations. The Commission will focus 

its anti-graft efforts in areas that concern the public the most, such as education, healthcare, 

environmental protection and food and drug safety. The local commission also plans to use 

confessions of corrupt officials and case studies to warn others to avoid such behaviour. 

We are pleased to announce there was no report of any whistle-blowing incident, and no 

reported incidents of corruption in FY2019.  

 

 

Subsequent Reporting for FY2020 

Our Group aims to maintain its zero record of corruption cases and will continue to cultivate 

an environment mindful of anti-corruption measures and policies in place by inculcating a 

clean and transparent working culture within the organisation.  

 


Energy 

 

24 

 

Our Group’s relentless commitment to incorporate sustainability into every aspect of our 

business motivates us to develop our business responsibly and efficiently through 

conserving resources, being environmentally friendly, and educating staff on the importance 

of energy conservation. We have raised awareness throughout the organisation and have 

put in place procedures to carefully monitor energy and water consumption. We have 

implemented initiatives which are in accordance with PRC environmental laws and 

regulations. These initiatives include using energy saving lamps and controlled use of air-

conditioners and water consumption. 

 

The Group has been utilising LED energy saving lamps since 2014 and all lamps in the Group 

have been replaced by energy saving lamps. The advantages of using these lamps are that 

they are energy saving, have a longer lifespan and are brighter than traditional lamps. We 

also practice switching on our centralised air-conditioner only when it reaches a certain 

temperature during the summer season, while the heater temperature is maintained at an 

acceptable temperature during winter seasons to reduce our electricity/gas consumption. 

 

In addition to the efforts put into afforestation and reduction of major pollutions, China’s 

Government Work Plan in FY2019 included plans to decrease sulphur dioxides and nitrogen 

oxides emission by 3%, ensure toxic waste are properly treated before disposal, as well as 

pushing for more companies to utilise renewable energy sources such as solar and wind 

energy. In line with the Government Work Plan, our Group has implemented stricter 

monitoring on the water consumption in our organisation. We put up posters to educate 

and remind staff on water conservation, as well as conduct regular checks on our pipelines 

to ensure there is no leakage and that all pipelines are well-functioning. We have also 

launched share-and-learn sessions, which take place twice a year, for staff to share their 

experiences and the efforts put in to conserve water and energy, as well as to learn new 

methods of conserving water and energy. 

 

As seen from the table below, despite the increase in energy, water and natural gas 

consumption (due to the corresponding increase in gross floor area), the energy, water, and 

natural gas intensities have decreased as a result of our conservation efforts and initiatives.

Subsequent Reporting for FY2020 

For each of its energy, water and natural gas intensities per gross floor area, the Group aims 

to, minimally, maintain the same level for FY2020 as compared to FY2019. As the Group is 

unable to control its energy consumption at the premises of its clinics due to certain 

restrictions, the Company will endeavour to maintain the same levels of intensities through 

other conservation efforts and initiatives. The Company will, at an appropriate time, 

consider setting targets on a medium-term and long-term basis. Moving forward, we aim to 

implement more energy conservation initiatives, reduce energy consumption, and increase 

monitoring of the Group’s energy consumption as part of our sustainable efforts.  


Training and Education 

 

26 

 

With the rapid technological and market changes, it is vital for our employees to keep 

themselves abreast of the latest industry developments and be future-ready. As our 

employees are our greatest assets, we believe that training and education is instrumental in 

ensuring the continuous development of our employees to equip them with the relevant 

skill sets to provide top quality service to our patients.  

 

Orientation pre-job training and a probation period of 3 months are mandatory for all new 

employees, during which their technical skills and knowledge, as well as work attitude, 

ethics, and efficiency are assessed. During the 3 months’ probation, new employees 

undergo strict centralised training. In addition to on-the-job training, our new hires will also 

shadow another experienced employee to familiarise themselves with our Group’s 

operations, and their specific job scopes. Employees who have passed the probation 

assessment will be provided with regular and continuous training and development 

conducted internally. 

 

Furthermore, our stomatology centre in Shenyang provides students with exciting 

internship programs. The internship program includes general skills trainings, such as public 

speaking and interpersonal communication, as well as technical trainings, such as 

stomatological technical training and practical training. Interns who had completed their 

program and have met all necessary educational requirements has the opportunity to be 

offered employment with our Group. In FY2019, 66 students participated in the internship 

program, of which 15 of them had obtained their practitioner licences and were employed 

by our Group. 

 

 

 

 

 




Training and Education 

 

27 

 

Dental Professionals 

Our Group has implemented customised training models to nurture our staff and enhance 

our service quality. In FY2019, our Group’s training plans were divided into 3 main segments: 

trainee dentists, trainee nurses, and new employees. We pride ourselves in having the 

relevant resources and budgets to allow our staffs and employees to attend several training 

programs that are held throughout the year, in order to ensure the continued education in 

our dental professionals. 

 

To assist and facilitate our dentists in their continuous efforts in keeping abreast with the 

latest technology and evidence-based practice, we are always engaging them with 

workshops, seminars and conferences, including training by external experts. We ensure 

that our dental centres are fully equipped with qualified dental professionals with the 

necessary exposure and experience in different departments.  

 

Our dentists participated in a total of 9 conferences in the past year, and our total training 

hours for all staff was 65,912 hours in FY2019 as compared to 50,100 hours in FY2018. 

Following a review of the previously disclosed statistics, our Group is of the view that the 

presentation of overall average training hours for each employee will be more accurate. 

 

 

Besides providing basic training and teaching classes, we often encourage our dental 

professionals to share on academic platforms to exchange ideas. Additionally, our dental 

professionals would attend courses and postgraduate trainings which are held in specialised 

institutions such as China Medical University and Jinzhou Medical University. Our dental 

professionals also receive regular performance and career development review with their 

respective heads of department.

Subsequent Reporting for FY2020 

Due to the COVID-19 lockdown in China, physical training sessions have been halted 

temporarily, until such time that there is more certainty on the COVID-19 situation. As the 

health and safety of its employees is of utmost importance to the Group, we expect the 

training hours in FY2020 to be affected adversely. Hence, for FY2020, we target to maintain 

the same number of training hours as FY2019. 

 




Occupational Health and Safety 

29 

 

Physical Well-being 

 

The safety of all our employees are of utmost importance. We acknowledge that in our line 

of work, dentists and nurses are highly exposed to several health hazards, such as bacterial 

or viral infections transmitted through needles, and it is our responsibility as employers to 

mitigate such risks. Therefore, in FY2019, we have appointed a Health and Safety 

Committee (“HSC”) in place to monitor and implement comprehensive safety measures that 

are in line with regulations set by the relevant government authorities. Our HSC comprises 

of the Director, 4 Deputy Directors, and 7 members, who are staff of the Group, with the 

following responsibilities respectively:  

 

Designation Responsibilities 

Director 

• 

Overall In-Charge on infection prevention and control 

Deputy 

Director 

• 

Assist Director in monitoring and managing infection control measures 

Member 

• 

Ensure that hospitals and clinics are regularly disinfected, and that dental 

equipment used are all sterilised before disposal 

• 

Ensure that waste materials are sterilised and disposed in a proper 

manner. 

 

The Infection Control Department of the Ministry of Health conducts health and safety 

procedures trainings 2 – 3 times a year and all our staff are required to attend these 

trainings. The National Medical Products Administration also requires hospitals and clinics to 

apply for health certificates annually for all employees who are involved in handling drugs 

and materials, waste treatment and disposal, as well as clinical surgery. Non-compliance will 

result in penalties and fines. Our Group ensures compliance by having the Department-In-

Charge monitor the expiry dates of the certificates and all applications of the health 

certificates must be reviewed and approved by the Deputy General Manager.  

 

In addition, the Group has implemented guidelines on clinic operational procedures to 

safeguard patients’ safety and health. We provide every patient with a new set of dental 

consumables such as gloves, dental bib, mouth-rinsing cup, needles and dental instruments. 

After each session, this set of dental consumables will be properly disposed and replaced 

with a new set, and the dental instruments used will be sterilised.  

 

 

 














Occupational Health and Safety 

30 

 

Physical Well-being (Cont’d) 

 

In compliance with the China’s social security system regulations, we also provide all 

employees with the mandated 5 types of insurances schemes, namely pension, medical, 

unemployment, work-related injury, and maternity insurances. On top of that, our Group 

also provides all dentists with doctors’ liability insurance.  

 

Other examples of health hazards include exposure to X-ray radiation during trainings, and 

we have posters to remind our employees on the safety measures. We ensure an X-ray 

signage is displayed on the X-ray room door in all clinics. We are subject to inspection from 

government officials to ensure we adhere to the country’s safety standards. Furthermore, 

we have posters in the clinics to remind our employees on the safety measures and risks 

exposure. For example, an X-ray signage is displayed on the X-ray room door in all clinics to 

caution employees on X-ray radiation. We also put up posters to promote healthy lifestyle 

to all staff and these posters are updated every quarter. 

 

 

 

Mental Well-being 

 

In addition to physical well-being, we also place emphasis on the mental well-being of our 

staff and employees. Each freshly graduated dentist will be tagged to an experienced dentist 

to facilitate on-the-job training. Experienced dentists can share their valuable experiences 

and guide new dentists through this new working environment. This will help to alleviate 

the stress and provide mental support for these young dentists, thus resulting in them being 

able to provide their best service to our patients. 

 

 

 




Occupational Health and Safety 

31 

 

Privacy 

 

Besides physical and mental well-being, we recognize privacy to be fundamental to human 

rights. The protection of patients' privacy is an industry consensus, and at Aoxin Q &amp; M, we 

take a firm stance in safeguarding the confidentiality of personal information. Our clinics 

have adopted the use of the Clinic Assist (CA) IT systems, which ensures that adequate 

controls are in place to restrict access to such sensitive information. Examples includes 

computers being connected internally to our local intranet and that our dentists can only 

view the information of patients that they have attended to. 

 

We are pleased to share that in FY2019, there was no reported workplace injury nor 

fatalities and no penalties were imposed to the Group by regulatory authorities.  

 

 

Subsequent Reporting for FY2020 

We aim to raise the standards of our medical quality and service, as well as to continue 

practicing medical safety among all staff and employees to minimise the risks of infections 

and exposure to health hazards. We also target to maintain zero serious workplace injuries 

encountered by our staff and employees for the following years. 

 

 


Local Communities 

32 

 

 

Investing in our community is an integral part of our sustainability strategy. Our Group is 

committed to being a responsible corporate citizen in the market we operate, driving 

positive and sustainable change for our communities. Through our partnerships and staff 

engagement initiatives, we combine our collective resources and leverage our skills and core 

competencies to make a positive and sustainable change to communities in need. 

 

We hold free clinics and treatment sessions at every of our Group’s clinic on “Oral Care Day” 

on 20 September every year. Throughout the year, we held numerous “Little Dentists” 

programmes (小牙医活动) throughout Liaoning Province.  During these outreach sessions, 

our dentists and staff went to kindergartens, elementary schools, and early education 

centres to teach young children the good dental habits and educate them on the 

importance of maintaining good dental health.  Additionally, we conducted free dental 

check-ups at kindergartens.  In Jinzhou, 4 of our staff even held an information session to 

educate preschool teachers on adolescent dental care.   

 

We also sponsored the Liaoning Children Health Check-up initiative and conducted free 

dental hygiene education and dental check-up, offering dental hygiene assistance to special 

needs children.  

 

In FY2019, we further partnered with trade unions to hold ad-hoc check-ups and dental 

screenings for local communities in various cities. In addition, we collaborated with other 

corporations to educate dental hygiene to communities, as well as conduct surveys to 

promote dental hygiene and raise dental health awareness to these communities. We also 

worked together with leading academic institutions and conducted visits to kindergartens, 

schools, and communal space to organise educational talks on oral care. 

 

We also promote dental health awareness through marketing and digital media campaigns 

on online platforms such as WeChat and Weibo, which in turn resulted in raising our 

Group’s reputation in the region. These initiatives are in line with our corporate concept of 

giving back to the community and have allowed us to integrate Aoxin Q &amp; M’s values into 

our business decisions. 


Local Communities 

33 

 

 

Our Group also teamed up with Jinzhou Medical University to provide lectures and practical 

training to students and dental professionals. In particular, 4 of our dental centres are 

designated as training centres/ clinical hospital: 

• Huludao Aoxin Q &amp; M Stomatology Hospital Co. Ltd. 

• Jinzhou Aoxin Youxin Dental Clinic Co. Ltd. 

• Panjin Aoxin Quanmin Stomatology Hospital Co. Ltd. 

• Shenyang Aoxin Q &amp; M Stomatology Hospital Co. Ltd. 

Our stomatology training centre at Shenyang is fully equipped with a multimedia teaching 

hall, a multi-function simulation laboratory and a technical laboratory, so that aspiring 

dentists are sufficiently educated and trained in the appropriate fields of practice, ensuring 

that they are competent enough to offer patients their services. In addition, Dr. Shao 

Yongxin who is also the Dean of Jinzhou Medical University, Shenyang Department of 

Stomatology, actively participates in the learning and growth of the undergraduates through 

conducting lectures and reviewing their progress.  

 

 

Furthermore, the Shenyang training centre has also been accredited for undergraduate and 

post-graduate training by Jinzhou Medical University. Students who graduate from this 

training centre with dental qualifications (shown below) awarded by Jinzhou Medical 

University will be recognised by universities in China.  












Local Communities 

34 

 

 

Enrolment remains highly competitive and it is extremely well-received as a degree of 

choice among undergraduates in the region.  

 

In addition to providing us with a platform to give back to society, these activities also allow 

our employees to connect and engage with their community.  Many of our employees felt 

that these initiatives were an effective way to educate the public, especially youth, on the 

importance of good dental health.  Additionally, by connecting with the community through 

such programmes, Aoxin Q &amp; M has been able to bolster its reputation as a quality dental 

service provider for the community as well. 

 

 

Subsequent Reporting for FY2020 

 

Moving forward, we target to have more collaborations with charity organisations or youth 

organisations to reach out to more people through free clinic, free dental hygiene education 

and dental check-up, offering dental hygiene assistance to children with special needs.
