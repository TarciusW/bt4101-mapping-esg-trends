prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) guidelines on Environmental, 

Social and Governance (“ESG”) topics, in relation to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 

(“FY2019”). 

In 2019, we continued our sustainability journey by reviewing our business operations and focusing 

areas important to Beng Kuang Group and our stakeholders. The Group strongly believes that 

sustainability is one of the key factors to stay resilient and remain competitive in the market. As a

Recycle”. Meanwhile, we also work towards providing a conducive and safe working environment for 

all our employees. 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) closely monitors the Group’s sustainability efforts and execute 

business strategies with sustainability objectives in mind. This year, the Board considered and re-

validated the ESG topics according to our stakeholders’ concerns and significance to Beng Kuang 

Group’s business operations. Looking ahead, we remain committed to operate in a responsible and 

sustainable manner with the Group’s values of Believe, Beyond and Become underpin Beng Kuang 

Group’s sustainability objectives.  

 

On behalf of board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their dedication 

as well as our customers, partners and shareholders for their continuous support as we continue to 

do better in the years to come.

Materiality Assessment 

 

 

The five topics i.e. anti-corruption, energy, water, effluent and waste as well as occupational health 

and safety were identified and disclosed in published Sustainability Report since Financial Year 2017. 

The material topics are identified based on the significance of the topics against their influence on 

stakeholder’s assessment and decisions. Through active engagement with our stakeholders, these five 

key material topics are re-assessed on their relevance to our business and they remain relevant and 

material to our business operations in FY2019.

The Group continues to achieve zero corruption case 

during this financial year.   

At Beng Kuang Group, we remain committed to achieve 

high standards of corporate governance and we uphold our 

stance on zero tolerance to corruption. Our Anti-

Corruption Policies and Whistle Blowing Policy were 

established and updated under the guidance of Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018 and the SGX listing rules. The 

policies are aimed to allow our employees to raise any 

concerns regarding possible corruptions confidentially.  

The Group also maintains a sound system of internal 

controls with the help from external professionals. Policies 

and procedures, which designed to safeguard against fraud 

and protect stakeholders’ interests, are periodically reassessed to identify and rectify the gaps, if any 

in order to mitigate possible unfavourable consequences. We also ensure that the latest policies and 

procedures are communicated and educated to all our employees.  

For further details on Corporate Governance, kindly refer to Annual Report page 14 – 38.

Environment 

 

We are committed to maintain and improve on stringent environmental policies and standards across 

the Group. We are constantly seeking new technologies and innovative ways to reduce the 

environmental impacts in delivering our products and services while ensuring the quality. The Group 

believes that it is our responsibility to ensure sustainability of the environment for our future 

generations.  

Energy 

Energy consumptions are 

closely monitored by the 

Group as the effort to 

reduce 

the 

carbon 

footprint 

during 

our 

business 

operations. 

During this financial year, 

increase was observed in 

both diesel and electricity 

consumption. Increase in 

projects is the main factor 

contributing to the rising 

diesel 

and 

electricity 

consumption.  

We also encourage our employees to actively 

engage in our environmentally friendly initiatives 

not just in office, but at home as well.  Moving 

forward, we will continue to implement more 

feasible environment conservation measures in all 

our entities and work towards to reduce our total 

energy consumption further while ensure the 

normal operations in our business.

Water 

 

Although 71% of our planet is covered 

by water, only 4% of which is potable. 

Bearing 

this 

in 

mind, 

water 

conservation is one of our top 

priorities to ensure sustainability. 

New technologies such as water 

efficient 

fittings 

are 

widely 

implemented across our Group. 

Constant reminders are given to all 

employees to cultivate habits for 

water conservation. 

Total of 2,101 cubic meters of potable water were consumed in FY2019, an increase of 74 cubic meters 

as compared to consumption in FY2018. Sources of the water consumption include water from local 

catchment, imported water and recycled water. The increase is mainly due to increase in projects 

during current financial year.  

 

Effluents and Waste 

 

“Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” is the main 

strategy implemented across the Group 

throughout the years in compliance 

with relevant environmental laws and 

regulations. Policies and procedures are 

established and formalised for waste 

management as both hazardous and 

non-hazardous wastes are inevitable 

during the course of our business 

operation. 

Only 

licensed 

waste 

collectors especially for hazardous 

waste are carefully selected to handle the waste generated in consideration of factors such as 

reputations and social responsibility. The Group also looked into new technologies to help reduce the 

waste produced further continuously. The hazardous waste, mainly copper slag, produced during our 

course of business had increased due to the larger number of projects during the year.  

The Group is committed to continuously reduce harmful impacts to the environment through reducing 

resource usage, minimising and recycling waste as much as possible.

Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”) 

 

Employees are the foundation for the corporation. Taking care of their health and safety is our utmost 

priority.  Policies and Procedures were established and put into place to minimise the possibility of 

any health and safety issues at workplace and office. 

 

OHS targets are being set and appraised on a yearly basis. We are proud to announce that the effective 

OHS management and framework put into place are well-paying with all our OHS targets being 

achieved for FY2019, as well as enhancing staff productivity and morale. 

The Group is determined to comply with government regulations and industry guidelines on 

prevention of any occupational accidents or illnesses at workplace. To showcase our determination in 

ensuring a safe working environment to our employees, we are both OHSAS 18001:2007 and Bizsafe 

certified by the Workplace Safety and Health Council Singapore (WHSC). 

 

 

 

We are proud to announce that we had achieved zero case of safety and industrial accidents in FY2019 

as compared to three cases in FY2018 (including one case of fractures and 2 cases of other injuries, 

which translates into lost day rate of 0.0002). The Group strives to maintain our zero-case 

occupational accident record through all the preventive safety measurements put into place.





OHS Targets 

 Reduce the Major Injury Accident Frequency Rate (“AFR”) and Accident Severity 

Rate (“ASR”) to below 1.2 and 100 per million-man hours worked 

 Reduce the Minor Injury AFR and ASR to below 6.5 and 50 per million-man hours 

worked. 

 Achieve Zero occupational diseases 

 Achieve Zero Noise Induced Deafness Case
