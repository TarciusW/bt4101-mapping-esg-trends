EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CEO’S STATEMENT 

 

 

 

 

“We seek to balance the 

potential for growth with 

important ESG 

considerations that are key 

to the sustainability of the 

Group’s operations.” 

 

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS, 

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Hai Leck 

Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), 

I am pleased to present our sustainability report 

for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 

(“FY2021”). 

 

FY2021 continues to be a challenging year as the 

Singapore and global economies continues to feel 

the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

 

 

We continue to focus on the long-term viability 

and profitability of the Group. As we engage our 

teams to prepare for the eventual re-opening of 

the Singapore and global economies, we also 

seek to balance the potential for growth with 

important environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) considerations that are key to the 

sustainability of the Group’s operations. 

 

Health and safety of our personnel remain of 

paramount importance amidst this pandemic. We 

are deeply saddened by the loss of a colleague to 

an accident during FY2021 which brings to the 

forefront the importance of being constantly 

mindful of personal safety as we go about 

performing our daily work. We continue to focus 

on equipping our personnel with the right 

knowledge on workplace safety as well as 

enforcing compliance with safety rules and 

regulations. In addition, we also continue to 

actively comply with existing safe management 

measures. 

 

With news of extreme weathers and natural 

disasters from around the world, we share in the 

global community’s concerns over climate change 

and actively play our part to ensure that our 

operations do not bring harm to the environment 

and personnel involved. 

 

Through the various challenges faced throughout 

FY2021, I am heartened to see the resilience 

shown by our people in overcoming difficulties 

encountered and the unity that they have shown 

in getting through uncertain times together. I 

sincerely thank them for their commitment and 

hard work. 

 

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank 

all our stakeholders: customers, shareholders, 

employees, suppliers, bankers and business 

partners for the support given through the years. 

The Group looks forward to being able to 

contribute to the well-being of all stakeholders for 

many years to come.

Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 

We have zero tolerance where workplace safety 

is concerned, and this is a culture that we actively 

cultivate within the Group. 

 

We have a target of a zero accident workplace. To 

that end, we have implemented a robust 

workplace safety and health management system 

that is BS OHSAS 18001 compliant. We have also 

renewed our bizSAFE Level Star certification, 

which is the highest certification level accorded by 

the Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) Council. 

 

In line with our culture of zero tolerance where 

safety is concerned, we believe that everyone is 

responsible for their own safety and the safety of 

others. To inculcate this culture right from the start, 

each new hire is required to attend the necessary 

safety 

induction 

courses 

tailored 

to 

their 

respective scope of work, during which workplace 

hazards and at-risk areas are highlighted. They 

are also issued with standard personal protective 

equipment 

as 

well 

as 

specialised 

safety 

equipment suited to their nature of work. In the 

current global health situation, masks are also 

supplied to further protect their health. External 

training courses and all medical examinations 

required under the Workplace Safety and Health 

Act are carried out by qualified service providers. 

 

We regularly share best safety practices in order 

to continuously improve on our safety standards. 

Recent accidents in the industry or near misses 

are periodically shared as learning points and to 

serve as reminder of the importance of safety at 

our workplace. To further reinforce the importance 

of workplace safety, we regularly conduct safety 

campaigns or actively participate in campaigns 

organised by our customers. 

 

Our safety performance record for FY2021 and 

the financial year ended 30 June 2021 (“FY2021”) 

are as shown below:

indicator 

FY2021

(“LTI”) Rate

0 

 

Unfortunately, despite our best endeavours, there 

was a workplace fatality in FY2021. We are co-

operating fully with the Ministry of Manpower 

whose investigations are still ongoing. 

 

Pursuant to  

 

In fact, safety is so deeply ingrained into our 

corporate culture that compliance with the Group’s 

safety requirements and safety awareness form 

part of our performance appraisal. 

 

In recognition of our safety efforts, we received 

accolades from our customers. Amongst the 

accolades received in FY2021 are: 

 

Zero LTI in 2020 

 

Safety Excellence – 45 million manhours 

without LTI 

 

Beyond occupational health and safety, we also 

prioritised personal health and safety. Since news 

of COVID-19 first surfaced, we have actively 

sought to protect our personnel by equipping them 

with face masks and advised them to avoid 

crowded areas. We increased frequency of 

cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched 

surfaces and made hand sanitisers readily 

available even before official guidelines were 

issued by the authorities. 

 

Unfortunately, notwithstanding our best efforts, we 

were not able to keep the infection at bay. While 

our workers have since been cleared to resume 

work, we continue to be mindful of the need to 

remain vigilant and work closely with our 

personnel to ensure necessary precautions 

continue to be taken.

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

 

We 

dispose 

of 

waste 

in 

a 

safe 

and 

environmentally sound manner in accordance with 

local regulations. 

 

The waste generated by our operations are 

categorised into hazardous and non-hazardous 

waste. Due to its potential impact on the 

environment and persons who come into contact 

with them, waste disposal, particularly hazardous 

waste, is taken seriously. All wastes are collected 

by licensed waste collector to ensure proper 

transportation and disposal. 

 

The amount of waste generated is a function of 

the level of activities during the year. Nonetheless, 

the Group is careful not to procure excess raw 

materials with limited shelf life that may eventually 

end up as waste. 

 

The quantities of hazardous and non-hazardous 

waste disposed in FY2021 and FY2020 are as 

shown below: 

 

 

 

 

 

Our target is to have no violation of local 

regulations. There were no violations in FY2021. 

 

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

 

We are committed to creating wealth for our 

stakeholders. Therefore, we constantly seek 

opportunities 

for 

operational 

and 

financial 

improvements.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in much 

hardship for certain segments of our society. As 

such, we chose to do our part for the society this 

year by supporting the Salvation Army which 

helps the needy who may require more assistance 

during this difficult period. The Salvation Army 

was selected due to their long and reputable 

history in Singapore since 1935. 

 

The event was held from 7 to 9 December 2020. 

To ensure that this event was conducted safely 

during the pandemic, we put in place safety 

measures such as isolated storage location, 

disinfection 

of 

items 

collected 

and 

social 

distancing when our staff contributed and sorted 

the donated items. Thanks to overwhelming 

support from our staff, we were able to do our part 

for the charity. 

 

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

 

The Group complies with all applicable anti-

corruption laws of the countries in which we 

operate. 

 

All new staff are briefed on the established Code 

of Professional Conduct during their orientation.  

All staff are required to declare any possible 

conflict of interest and are prohibited from offering 

or accepting favours or gifts from third parties. 

 

Our Whistle Blowing policy and procedures 

enable employees to report any illegal or unethical 

behaviour. 

 

There were no confirmed incidents of corruption in 

FY2021.
