MEMORIES GROUP LIMITED SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2020

01


This Report describes our sustainability performance for the period 1 April 2019 – 30 September 2020 (“FP2020”). 

It covers all of Memories Group Limited’s (the “Company”, or collectively with its subsidiaries, “Memories Group”) 

activities in Myanmar and includes acquisitions that were completed by 30 September 2020 unless otherwise stated, 

and has been prepared taking reference from the SGX Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (set out in Listing Rule 711A 

and 711B of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist). 

This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards – “Core” Option, 

which represents the global best practice for reporting on a range of economic, environmental and social impacts.

The GRI Standards has been adopted as a framework for Memories Group’s Sustainability Report as it is internationally 

recognised and widely used sustainability reporting framework, which allows us to address our social, environmental 

and economic performance.

The boundary for this Report is based on our operations in Myanmar.

Our annual Sustainability Report also provides us with a valuable opportunity to engage our stakeholders and respond 

to issues that matter most to them and to our business. It will continue to inform company risk management, strategy 

development and stakeholder engagement activities as we work to further focus and prioritise our sustainability and 

corporate social responsibility initiatives.

Our Sustainability Report is produced on an annual basis and is available online on our corporate website.

We welcome comments and feedback on our Sustainability Report at sustainability@memoriesgroup.com.

ABOUT THIS

REPORT


The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present Memories Group’s Sustainability Report 2020, which is 

our Group’s third Sustainability Report. Memories Group’s sustainability approach is aligned to that of our affiliated 

company, Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd., (“Yoma Strategic”) and First Myanmar Investment Public Company Limited 

(“FMI”), and is premised on the recognition that Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) aspects are increasingly 

important to our stakeholders. The Board, together with the Management, is committed to managing relevant ESG risks 

and opportunities across our different assets, while contributing positively to the environment and society. The Board 

has considered the material ESG factors as part of its strategic formulation, determined the material ESG factors and 

overseen the management and monitoring of the material ESG factors.

In FP2020, we continued to report on our sustainability performance in these five focus areas – Governance, Respect 

for the Environment, Employability and Local Development, Our Customers and Preserving Local Heritage and Culture. 

The content of this Report has been reviewed and approved by the Board and Management of Memories Group and 

our Sustainability Committee.

Memories Group’s sustainability efforts are structured around the guiding principles of the United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals (“UNSDGs”), and our targets are aligned with the Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan (“MSDP”) 

2018 – 2030, enabling us to create long-term value for our stakeholders.

MEMORIES GROUP’S CONTRIBUTIONS FOR FP2020

Vegetables are grown at our hotels – Keinnara Hpa-An, Keinnara Loikaw and Awei Pila. Food 

waste is composted and mixed with soil, after which it is used to grow vegetables for our 

hotels and restaurants. This helps us to avoid over-reliance on vegetables to be delivered from 

far distances, especially for Awei Pila. Apart from providing our guests and employees with 

pesticide-free and fresh vegetables, these vegetables also have a lower carbon footprint and 

help us to establish a sustainable food production system. The vegetables grown at our hotels 

comprise between 15% to 40% of the total vegetables consumed by guests and employees.

The Group provides long-term training and development programs to its employees across 

various business units. Each employee has achieved on average more than 40 hours of 

training during FP2020. Burma Boating provides Moken youths with learning opportunities 

on handcrafting of traditional boat models from the elder Moken population, and the sales of 

these boat models are available on Burma Boating trips. Burma Boating also provides schooling 

supplies for Moken children as well as basic photography skills trainings.

Approximately 29% of the Group’s workforce are female. Females are represented at the 

executive as well as the senior management levels across the Group. In FP2020, 100% of 

managers have completed training on Code of Conduct and on the topic of anti-harassment.

Awei Pila provides electricity and waste collection for the nearby villages and educates the local 

community on the impacts of improper dumping of waste.

The Group’s businesses provide a total of approximately 571 jobs to the local communities 

in Myanmar. All employees are paid at least the government prescribed minimum wage. It 

fully supports and practices the International Labour Organisation’s eight fundamental core 

conventions and the International Finance Corporation’s Labour and Working Conditions 

Standards. The Group prohibits child labour at all of its business operations and projects, and 

there was no case of child labour reported in FP2020.

Through partnerships with local social enterprises in Yangon and Bagan, the Group’s Hotels 

segment and Experiences segment provide a platform for these social enterprises to market 

and sell their handcrafted products. Seafood for restaurant at Awei Pila is purchased from the 

local fishermen and the resort employs the local communities living at nearby villages.

Memories Travel has increased the number of community-based tour operators for activities 

in Magyeekan Village in Salay near Bagan and Panpet in Loikaw. The number of local artisan 

crafts in our programmes have also increased to include painting in a Bagan lacquerware 

workshop and hands-on activities in a wooden pipes workshop in Mawlamyaing. With this 

approach, the Group is also able to upskill local labour, build local capacity and contribute to 

economic growth in the local communities.

(Refer to Annual Report 2020, Pg. 23 &amp; 24)


SDG

MEMORIES GROUP’S CONTRIBUTIONS FOR FP2020

Renewable energy produced from solar panels installed at Awei Pila covers approximately 40% 

of total energy consumption of the resort. Guest rooms at Awei Pila are designed to optimise 

the use of natural light during the day so as to minimise the use of artificial lighting in the room.

Technical improvements have been made to Burma Boating’s yacht, SY Meta IV, to allow it to 

sail at higher speeds with low winds so that fuel consumption can be reduced.

At Awei Pila, all amenities are free from plastic, as plastic bottles are not being used in the guest 

rooms and all glass bottles are crushed to be recycled and used for road construction. Plastic 

straws are also not being used on yachts for Burma Boating.

Burma Boating is partnering with “Tide Ocean” to implement a new bottle disposal system in 

Ranong and Kawthaung whereby yachts as well as the local communities can actively collect 

ocean plastic bottles to be upcycled and transformed into premium raw material that can be 

used to produce new sustainable products.

Regular beach cleanups have been organized at Awei Pila to remove debris which is transferred 

to the mainland to be recycled properly. Various recycling methods are currently being explored 

to assess the possibility of transforming the debris into valuable resources such as building 

materials which can then be used by the local communities.

Awei Pila partnered with Ocean Quest (an environmental organisation based on Malaysia) in a 

coral conservation project in September 2019. Two sites – Long Beach and Honeymoon Bay, have 

been identified for the development of coral nurseries. In addition to cataloguing the marine life 

around Pila Island, nine coral nurseries were established on Pila Island in October 2019 and this 

repopulating program will continue for four years. An alternative coral rehabilitation method is 

being used in the north bay where coral nurseries are difficult to establish. Parts of the reef on 

this bay already show encouraging signs of coral resilience in the short-term.

In June 2019, Burma Boating, together with Awei Pila, partnered with Ocean Quest to remove 

over 310kg of ghost fishing nets and over 10,000kg of general waste from four coral reefs around 

Pila Island to be recycled on shore.

Since November 2019, the conservation team of Ocean Quest has created more than 10km of 

trail across the jungle and also started monitoring and cataloguing local species of birds on Pila 

Island to better understand the biodiversity of the area. The improved access to the remote 

parts of the island enable the team to identify local fauna and flora more efficiently.

Observation points have been built while minimizing disturbance to the existing landscape in 

order to allow us to observe birds and mammals in their native habitats. Indigenous tree species 

and ancient mangrove species, some of which are endangered species, have been discovered. 

Programmes to protect and conserve these endangered species are currently under study.

OUR APPROACH

Myanmar is a vast country full of rich tradition, breath-taking natural sights and delicious local cuisine.  Memories Group’s 

portfolio of hotels, resorts, experiences and services which are in unique locations of Myanmar provides our guests 

with personalised, authentic and experience-driven travel. We aim to provide each of our guests with unforgettable 

memories of Myanmar that they experience with us – from our hotels and resorts to experiences like sailing and hot air 

ballooning, and visiting the local sights. We have also introduced nature-inspired programmes in some of our hotels to 

raise awareness amongst our guests and showcase the ecological heritage and biodiversity of these locations. 

We are also committed to provide each guest with an exceptional level of customer service, and value the opportunity to 

receive feedback from our guests through different feedback channels. This allows us to better meet the requirements 

and expectations of our guests and in turn, achieve an exceptional level of customer service.

Our Vision: Customer Satisfaction

We serve our customers by being their trusted partner and by delivering the best products and services 

that cater to their needs.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE

Experiential and authentic travel for our customers

From our hotels to our experiences and services, we aim to create experience rich trips while at the same time ensure the 

continued sustainability of the destinations and communities we visit. By taking a local approach as much as possible, 

we hope to provide more authentic experiences for our guests. Memories Travel implements sustainable practices and 

policies in all parts of the business supply chain and regularly monitors performance of suppliers to ensure they comply 

with sustainability standards and local regulations. Excursions are chosen with care, taking into consideration whether 

they are sustainable and comply with the standards set by Memories Travel before offering them to tourists. No harm is 

done to the environment, heritage, animals or social aspects of the communities that we operate in. 

At Awei Pila, we offer our guests a guided 1.5-hour forest trek to the nearby Moken (sea gypsies) village so that they 

may learn more about the history of this ethnic group as well as their way of life. The Moken are semi-nomadic, sailing 

around the archipelago during the dry season and taking to land for the fierce monsoon. This group decided to give 

up their seafaring life because they are no longer allowed to cut down trees to make their traditional boats, which are 

carved from a single, massive trunk. Their children attend school at Pila Island, and several men from the village work 

at Awei Pila.

Safety and crisis management

Health and safety are important for both our customers and our staff. Our operations are equipped with all necessary 

safety equipment with instructions provided. Frequent quality checks are carried out on our equipment and are replaced 

when necessary. First aid, fire safety and emergency evacuation training is provided to appropriate team members 

in-charge of the relevant activities and any incidents of injury or illness are thoroughly investigated, with procedural 

changes put in place to prevent recurrence. 

Safety briefings are provided to our Burma Boating, Balloons Over Bagan and Balloons Over Inle customers as well as 

those who join our experiential trips through Memories Travel. More than half of our staff from Balloons Over Bagan 

and Balloons Over Inle are trained in basic first aid. Emergency drills are also carried out once every season for each 

location in Bagan and Inle, and there is also a safety management system in place with safe work procedures and a crisis 

management plan. 

Since the initial cases of Covid-19 were announced in Myanmar in March 2020, Memories Group has taken all 

necessary measures to ensure the safety and well-being of our customers and staff. When the hotels reopened in 

June 2020 following the guidelines by the Ministry of Health and Sports in Myanmar, Memories Group partnered with 

Diversey, Inc.* and implemented a thorough process for cleaning and disinfection for all our hotels and experiences, as 

well as services provided for our guests.

At our hot air balloons experience, a facial protective mask is recommended to be worn by our guests during the visit 

to Balloon over Bagan’s office, at our operation sites, during the bus rides to and from the launch site, as well as during 

the entire hot air balloon flight. On arrival at our offices and launch sites, our staff conduct temperature screening for all 

guests. Guests are also informed to respect social distancing requirements of at least one meter away from other guests 

whenever possible, and to stay in designated areas and not to visit other groups to minimise co-mingling among guests.

These safe distancing requirements, cleaning and disinfection practices and training for our staff form Memories 

Group’s CleanPledge commitment, to ensure that local and international guidelines and best practices are adhered to 

for our hotels and experiences. 

In the best interest of public health, guests’ safety and well-being of our employees, Keinnara Hpa-An, Keinnara Loikaw, 

and Hotel Suggati – Mawlamyaing were closed temporarily from April to September 2020 in light of the second wave 

of Covid-19.

Diversey, Inc. is a provider of cleaning, sanitation and maintenance products, systems and services that efficiently integrate chemicals, machines and 

sustainability programs. Diversey, Inc. provided cleaning and hygiene protocols, tools and resources to help ensure key infection prevention protocols are 

followed, as well as product solutions for infection prevention and control. (www.diversey.com)

OUR 

CUSTOMERS


All of Memories Group’s businesses which are allowed to operate during the Covid-19 pandemic have received specific 

approvals and comply with relevant health and safety standard operating procedures (SOPs). Where our frontline 

staffs are required to be at work, they are provided with twice a day temperature screening and personal protective 

equipment (PPE) such as face mask, face shield, hair nets and gloves.

Customer satisfaction

Our frontline staff, managers of the hotels, guides from our experiential travel services and crew on the yachts and 

hot air balloons strive to get to know our customers personally – their likes and dislikes, suggestions and concerns. 

Customer feedback through feedback forms and online platforms is constantly analysed by management and team 

members in order to identify improvement points as well as to provide a curated experience that meets our customers’ 

needs. This helps in resolving issues quickly for our customers and builds our ongoing relationships with them. By 

letting them know that we care, we also aim to build strong bonds with our customers and create customer loyalty for 

our hotels, experiences and services. The strong commitment of all team members ensures a consistently high level of 

guest satisfaction. Keinnara Hpa-An, Keinnara Loikaw, Awei Pila and Balloons over Bagan were listed in the TripAdvisor’s 

2020 Traveller’s Choice Awards, with average rating scores of 9 and above achieved for each of them.

In light of the current COVID-19 situation, guests with existing reservations at all our hotels – Keinnara Hpa-An, Keinnara 

Loikaw and Hotel Suggati Mawlamyaing, experiences and services have the option to either receive a full credit for the 

same amount of their original booking for use until 31 December 2021 at the same property as per the valid season’s rate 

or a full refund.

WHAT WE PLAN TO DO

Monitoring the satisfaction of our customers is an important issue for Memories Group in order to continuously provide 

strategies which meet our travellers’ needs and preferences. We plan to focus on training at least 80% of our frontline 

employees in FY2021 on the new normal Guest Experience with an emphasis on Service Standards.

MSDP Goal 5:

Natural Resources &amp; the 

Environment for the Posterity 

of the Nation

OUR APPROACH

Improving the environmental performance, such as our energy consumption, water use and waste management in 

our operations is important to Memories Group. We have a clear ambition to enhance our operational and financial 

performance while continuously reducing our environmental impact. We have implemented various policies to minimize 

resource consumption and manage waste effectively, including an “Environment, Health and Safety” (“EH&amp;S”) policy in 

support of a groupwide Corporate Governance framework, to:

1. 

foster greater awareness of sustainable approaches across Memories Group;

2. 

enhance our capabilities to identify and manage adverse impacts from all business activities; and

3. 

instil a culture of “no harm, less pollution and wider conservation approaches to protect the environment” in all 

business operations.

Our key priorities for waste management are to manage our waste properly, implementing the concept of a circular 

economy – reducing, reusing, recycling and replacing throughout our operations, and to eliminate single-use plastics, 

where possible.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE

Reduce impact of operations on environment, reduce use of plastics / Introducing and increasing recycling efforts

The issue of single-use plastics is a concern and one that clearly requires global commitment and collaborative action. 

As part of the Refill Not Landfill Southeast Asia programme, we have rolled out the use of stainless-steel bottles at 

targeted resorts/hotels to replace plastic bottles. All hotels are encouraged to reduce plastic waste through initiatives 

such as use of refillable bottles or to avoid the use of plastic straws. 

The hotels have implemented a number of programmes that are specific to local circumstances for waste management, 

including waste segregation and recycling. Burma Boating is partnering with “Tide Ocean” to implement a new bottle 

disposal system in Ranong and Kawthaung whereby yachts and the local communities can actively collect ocean plastic 

bottles to be upcycled and transformed into raw materials to produce new sustainable products. Awei Pila, our island 

resort, together with Burma Boating ensure that garbage separation is done so that waste which can be recycled is sent 

for recycling.

As part of our strategy to reduce the amount of waste going to landfills, we have also started to compost the food 

waste from our kitchens. In FP2020, approximately 35% to 50% of food waste was composted instead of being sent 

to landfills. The resulting composted material was mixed with soil to grow vegetables for our hotels and restaurants at 

Keinnara Loikaw, Keinnara Hpa-An and Awei Pila. This helps us to produce between 15% to 40% of the total vegetables 

consumed by our guests and employees. Apart from being pesticide free, these vegetables enables us to establish a 

sustainable food production system and avoid over-reliance on vegetables to be delivered from far distances, especially 

for Awei Pila, which also helps to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and the Group’s carbon footprint since we would 

use less fuel for transportation of supplies. We have just started collecting the data for waste composted and will be 

monitoring and reporting on this data in the subsequent years to monitor the success of our initiative and to set relevant 

targets on this aspect in the future.

RESPECT FOR THE 

ENVIRONMENT


The organic garden at Awei Pila provides our 

guests and employees with fresh beans, cabbage, 

corn, kale, cucumber, pumpkin, okra, herbs, 

gourds, water melon and many others.

Our food waste is composted with the Bokashi 

system, helping to avoid approximately 15kg of 

food waste going to landfill daily. The composted 

material is then mixed with the soil, creating a 

nutrient-rich medium for growing our vegetables.

Awei Pila and Burma Boating, in partnership with Ocean Quest, have been organising annual expeditions 

since May 2019 to clear lost and disused fishing nets, also known as ghost nets, from the coral reefs in the 

Mergui Archipelago. In May 2020, the expedition resulted in the retrieval of about 300kg of ghost nets. Since 

September 2019, Awei Pila in partnership with Ocean Quest, has embarked on a coral conservation project at 

two sites at Pila Island. In addition to cataloguing the marine life around Pila Island, nine coral nurseries were 

established and this coral repopulation program is planned to continue over the next 4 years. 

In recognition of our efforts for “Earth Hour 2020: Business for Nature Challenge”, Memories Group was 

selected as one of “WWF-Myanmar’s Earth Hour” winners, and was awarded “Earth Hour Encouragement 

Award – Earth Hour 2020”.

In FP2020, we have generated a total of 4.8 tonnes of non-hazardous waste, of which 2.17 tonnes which includes paper, 

plastic or glass, was recycled. We have also managed to reuse 1.5 tonnes of waste through composting. The volume of 

waste generated in 12M-Mar2020 is higher than that for the same period in FY2019 due to the disposal of face masks 

and cleaning materials used because of COVID-19. This increase in non-hazardous waste generated is similarly also 

seen for 6M-Sept2020 due to the same reason. Since the start of FP2020, we have also started to track and monitor the 

volume of hazardous waste generated.

At Awei Pila, we have built a sorting area for recyclables and general waste. This enables proper areas for waste 

segregation and recycling prior to removal from the island. The bricks used to construct this area was hand-made on 

the island, helping to save costs and fuel for transportation of construction materials from the mainland. As part of 

our efforts to embrace the circular economy and to minimise the use of natural resources, the bricks were made using 

crushed recycled glass, clay and sand, all of which were available at Awei Pila.

Water scarcity

Extreme weather conditions such as floods and droughts often affect Myanmar’s access to clean water. The management 

of water resources is important to ensure that there is a sustainable supply of water from ground water or from the lakes 

and rivers. Memories Group wants to be recognised as a prudent and responsible user of water that does not adversely 

impact on local water resources.

RESPECT FOR THE 

ENVIRONMENT


Our hot air balloon business located in Bagan and Inle rely on well water which is used for cleaning the balloons and 

washing of linen. For the 12 months ended 31 March 2020, we used almost twice as much water than we did in FY2019, 

with the largest increase coming from our hotels segment. Awei Metta, which is a 46-room resort, was included as 

part of the data collection process for FP2020, along with Hotel Suggati. These two hotels were not included in the 

data collection for FY2019. In addition, only 5 months of water consumption data for Awei Pila was collected in FY2019. 

With the inclusion of full year data from these three hotels, along with increased cleaning activities due to Covid-19, 

to ensure the health and safety of our guests and employees, our water consumption increased in FP2020. As the size 

and facilities at our hotels and resorts differ from one another, we will continue to measure and monitor our water 

consumption for the next three years to have a better understanding of our baseline and set our targets in FY2023.

To ensure that the environment is not polluted by untreated wastewater from our hotel operations, where water is used 

for washing or other purposes at our hotel operations and needs to be discharged into the surface drains, we will treat it 

with a bio filter and chlorine sterilization before discharging it to ensure there is minimal impact to the local waterways. 

Where possible, water is recycled or reused for activities such as landscaping or for flushing of toilets.

At Keinnara Loikaw, a rain garden was constructed to help manage surface runoffs during the rainy weather and 

secondly to provide shade and natural beauty for our guests and employees. The gardens created help to reduce the 

amount of runoff during heavy rains on the walkways and also keeps the surrounding areas cool during hot weather.

WHAT WE PLAN TO DO

Since FY2018, Memories Group has started the monitoring programme for use of fuel and electricity across our various 

business segments to help us better understand our environmental footprint. We will also continue with our policy of 

reducing the use of plastic bottles in our hotel rooms, boating operations, hot air balloons operations and our offices. In 

doing so, we aim to create awareness for our guests and people we work with, on the negative environmental impacts 

of single use plastics, and at the same time, reduce the amount of plastic waste generated in our operations.

We will continue to monitor our energy usage and have a better understanding of our consumption pattern, energy 

intensity and to identify areas for improvement.

OUR TARGET FOR FY2021

Collect environmental data to set the targets for energy consumption and emissions in FY2021.



Note:

(18) Scope 1 GHG emissions covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 GHG emissions covers indirect emissions from the 

generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by Memories Group.

MSDP Goal 1:

Peace, National Reconciliation, 

Security &amp; Good Governance

OUR APPROACH

Creating and maintaining our culture of ethics and integrity starts with our employees and leaders and extends to our 

business partners and suppliers. Memories Group adopts corporate policies including inter alia, business ethics, code 

of conduct, conflict of interest, environment, health and safety as well as human rights policies. The policies are also 

publicly available under the “Corporate Policies” on the Memories Group website.

We have adopted and implemented the Human Rights Policy to:

1. 

foster greater awareness of human rights throughout Memories Group including (but not limited to) equal 

opportunity, anti-discrimination, right to life, liberty, and security of person;

2. 

enhance Memories Group’s capabilities to identify and manage adverse impacts from all business activities; and

3. 

instill a culture of respecting individuals’ right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion including freedom 

of opinion and expression without interference in all business operations.

Memories Group takes a zero tolerance approach to acts of bribery or corruption by employees and associates. The 

Board and senior management team continue to foster a culture within Memories Group in which bribery or corruption 

is never acceptable. Suspected incidents of bribery and corruption are required to be reported to the Company’s Audit 

and Risk Management Committee (“ARMC”). The ARMC would monitor the progress and outcomes of investigations 

conducted and thereafter fully investigated by the Group’s Risk Management and  Assurance Team (“ARMC”).

Our Vision: Investor Satisfaction

We create sustainable investment opportunities by leading with integrity and engaging in ethical and 

equitable business practices.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE

Business ethics (GRI 205-3)

Memories Group has in place a whistle-blowing policy which encourages its employees and any other parties, in 

confidence, to raise concerns about possible corporate improprieties related to matters of financial reporting and other 

matters. Our whistle-blowing policy assures employees who make reports in good faith of malpractice or impropriety 

in the workplace will not be dismissed, penalised or discriminated against by us as a result of the making of such 

reports. Details of the whistle-blowing policy can be found in our Annual Report 2020, Pg.50. Memories Group has a 

zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption – any team members suspected of a crime or malpractice will be 

investigated.

In FP2020, we have achieved our target with zero reported incidents of corruption or bribery and no business 

partnerships were terminated or not renewed due to corruption.

We have also adopted a Code of Conduct to regulate the standards of ethical conduct for our Directors, officers 

and employees. They are required to observe the Code of Conduct and also maintain high standards of integrity in 

compliance with the laws, regulations and our policies. Our ‘Conflict of Interest’ policy assures a high level of ethical 

conduct of persons employed by or involved in the governance of Memories Group, and to avoid public perceptions 

and financial consequences detrimental to Memories Group that could arise from the misuse, or perception of misuse, 

of an individual’s position or influence.

In FP2020, we have achieved our target set in the last Sustainability Report and there were no significant fines or 

non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws and/or regulations in the social and economic area in Memories 

Group.

Child labour, human rights

Memories Group has strict human rights policies and we have aligned our policies with no forced labour, child labour, 

slavery or human trafficking in our businesses. We ensure that there is a safe and secure working environment for all 

our workers and that no underage workers are employed in our operations. Our suppliers are also reminded that no 

child labour is to be used and human rights of workers have to be respected. We have achieved our target set in the last 

Sustainability Report and none of such breaches  have occurred in FP2020, however, if a case were reported it would be 

thoroughly investigated with swift and appropriate measures administered to rectify the situation.

WHAT WE PLAN TO DO

In FY2021, we will continue to review the policies to enhance those which are material to our operations. We will 

continue to deliver training on our internal Code of Conduct, and Awareness on Business Ethics and Human Trafficking. 

As the tourism sector is one of the world’s largest sectors of employment and is responsible for the movement of 

people, we have a responsibility to make a difference by ensuring that our various business segments are aware of signs 

of human trafficking, what they should do and how to mitigate this.

OUR TARGET FOR FY2021

Strive to maintain compliance with the relevant rules and regulations where we operate

To continue to advocate and raise awareness in our supply chain against use of child labour 

Achieve minimum of 80% training coverage on the Group’s internal Code Of Conduct policy and 

awareness on Business Ethics and Human Trafficking

MSDP Goal 5:

Natural Resources &amp; the 

Environment for the Posterity 

of the Nation

OUR APPROACH

Memories Group is committed to conserving the culture and heritage of the destinations that we operate in while 

sustaining local livelihoods and skills through gainful employment. We support responsible travel by connecting guests 

with cultural and natural heritage to create stewardship and resilience. It also helps to boost awareness of the tourist 

site, attraction or area’s significance and encourages local residents and visitors to be mindful about their impact on the 

natural and built environment.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE

Identifying “No-Go” activities or sensitive areas which are not suitable for tourism

At Memories Travel, our excursions are chosen with care, and before offering them to tourists, they are evaluated on 

whether they are sustainable and comply with our internal standards. We endeavour to minimise any harm done to 

the environment, heritage, animals or social aspects of the destination we bring our tourists to. Memories Travel is 

dedicated to protection of animal welfare and assures that the company only works together with suppliers that treat 

their animals properly. Any signs of negative animal welfare will lead to a termination of contract. Guides are trained on 

sustainable practices related to animal welfare, while customers are advised to not to purchase certain items and avoid 

certain excursions.

In FP2020, Memories Travel has increased the number of community-based tour operators in Magyeekan Village in Salay 

near Bagan, and Panpet in Loikaw. The number of local artisan crafts in our programmes have also increased to include 

painting in a lacquerware workshop in Bagan and hands-on activities in a wooden pipes workshop in Mawlamyaing. 

With this approach, we are also able to upskill local labour, build local capacity and contribute to economic growth in 

the local communities. We had in the previous Sustainability Report set a target in FP2020 of increasing the number of 

community-based tour operators by 10%. However, we were unable to meet this target due to a significant decrease in 

tourism during Covid-19 which in turn resulted in decreased demand for such programs.

WHAT WE PLAN TO DO

In FY2021, we will continue to communicate with our suppliers and tour operators about sustainability including the 

need to preserve local heritage and culture. Memories Travel’s Supplier Code of Conduct also ensures all suppliers and 

tour operators that we work with adhere to our sustainability guidelines.

EMPLOYABILITY AND

MSDP Goal 3:

Job Creation &amp; Private Sector 

Led Growth 

OUR APPROACH

Memories Group promotes equal access to employment. We recruit and develop individuals solely on the basis of their 

suitability for the job, regardless of gender, age, nationality, religion or disability. Hiring, training and retaining the right 

people, a majority of whom are local, is instrumental in shaping the experiences of our guests. As our hotels, resorts 

and experiences are usually located in a historical parts of the city and at the heart of a vibrant community, we create 

value to the surrounding districts and businesses by attracting customers, further contributing to the local economy.

Embedding the principles of diversity and inclusion in the way we do business gives us a better understanding of 

the needs of our employees, partners, suppliers and customers. A diverse workforce and an inclusive environment 

that respects and nurtures different people is a way to improve our business performance. Our diversity and inclusion 

approach focuses on hiring, developing and retaining the best. We provide equal opportunity in recruitment, career 

development, promotion, training and rewards for all employees. We also hold regular meetings in the communities 

in which we live and work to foster relationships with individuals and companies, build connections and expand 

collaboration.

Our Vision: Employee Satisfaction

We invest in our people to build careers around a shared culture of fairness, diversity, empowerment and 

recognition.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE

Diversity of workforce and inclusivity (GRI 405-1)

Memories Group believes that by having employees from a range of backgrounds work together while respecting 

one another’s values, new concepts and ways of thinking are created which lead to greater value for the Company. 

We currently do not have any female representation on our Board, however, as of FP2020, 29% of our Management 

(including business functions) is female.

Memories Group’s employees come from many different backgrounds and cultures. As of 30 September 2020, we had 

580 full-time employees from 12 countries. To build a diverse team and induce a sense of belonging, non-locals employed 

by Memories Group in Myanmar are provided with a comprehensive induction programme that includes familiarisation 

with the local culture and norms. This helps the individuals who are new to Myanmar to better understand, accept and 

be comfortable with their local colleagues and the local culture.

Employee skills training and development (GRI 404-1, GRI 404-2)

We provide all of our people with ongoing support and training; new staff benefit from a comprehensive induction 

programme. We encourage all our employees to set personal development goals as part of their yearly performance 

management plan, which is then tracked by their manager and Human Resources. Our frontline staff, in particular, 

those that interact with our customers, are provided with English language classes and customer service skills to 

facilitate communication with our customers who speak predominantly English or other European languages. Training 

in Management Skills, Project Management, Basic Fire Fighting Skills and First Aid Skills are examples of the training 

provided to our employees.

As part of a longer-term training and development program for our staff, we constantly send them for Business English 

speaking and writing classes. In FP2020, 18 staff attended a 30-hour Business English Class, while another 185 staff from 

Balloons over Bagan and Balloons over Inle were enrolled on a 16-hour Basic Conversational English Class.

We have achieved a total of 26,871 hours of training across our various business segments in FP2020, with an average 

of 46 training hours per employee. We also reached our FY2020 target of training at least 80% of our managers on the 

topic of anti-harassment. In FP2020, 100% of our managers have completed training on Code of Conduct and on the 

topic of anti-harassment.

At the Memories Group level, the ratio of average remuneration for managerial and executive staff is almost equal, with 

the ratios of basic salary of women to men at 1: 0.85 respectively. One of Memories Group’s main priorities is to increase 

recruitment of women into management and leadership roles and increase retention of senior female leaders. As of 30 

September 2020,  24% of senior management roles in Memories Group were comprised of females.

Employee Engagement

Our employees have continuous face-to-face feedback with their supervisors to help drive engagement. This is in addition 

to the monthly group meetings held with the General Manager for that business unit. A high level of engagement is 

increasingly important for attracting and retaining talented people and, ultimately, for the delivery of business results. 

A Group-wide employee engagement survey was conducted in FP2020 and we have achieved an overall participation 

rate of 89% from employees in Memories Group. The employee engagement score of 89% obtained generally indicates 

that 89% of our employees are happy to work with the company. From the survey conducted, we also obtained an 

Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) of 48.9 which reflects that employees would strongly recommend Memories 

Group as a place to work in. More than 80% of our employees also indicated that they intend to stay with the company 

for at least the next 3 years.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, close communication with our Group employees was done through online meetings as 

well as webinar trainings provided by the various Heads of Departments. These webinar trainings covered 26 unique 

topics ranging from soft skills to technical skills and allowed employees to use this opportunity for upskilling.

WHAT WE PLAN TO DO

Memories Group has made diversity and inclusion part of our corporate strategy and is promoting them in all 

workplaces. At Yoma Strategic, a Diversity Council comprising representatives from different business units and 

different nationalities of staff was established in FY2019. Representatives from Memories Group are also part of the 

Diversity Council since its inception.

A Leadership Programme is currently being established by Yoma Group*. This would also include Memories Group 

employees. Through mentorship with senior management, and working on assigned case studies over a six-month 

period, this Leadership Program has the key objective of building future key business leaders and 50 staff from Memories 

Group have been invited to participate in the Leadership Programme.

We set a FY2020 target of 25 training hours per employee, but have instead achieved an average of 46 training hours 

per employee. Our FY2020 target of having 80% of managers trained on the topic of anti-harassment has also been 

achieved. In FP2020, 100% of our managers have received anti-harassment training.

For this purpose, Yoma Group comprises Yoma Strategic, FMI and Memories Group.

OUR SOCIAL 

CONTRIBUTIONS

MSDP Goal 3:

Job Creation &amp; Private Sector 

Led Growth 

In doing our business, our focus is to offer positive travel experiences that benefit customers, communities and 

the Company. This means that while we do our business, we have a responsibility to protect the environment and 

benefit the communities that we work with. These communities provide the resources, infrastructure and markets 

that our businesses rely on. It is essential that these communities benefit from having us there. We believe we have a 

responsibility to deliver positive, lasting impacts that contribute shared and sustained value for all our stakeholders. It 

is our aim to support the development of our communities by leveraging the strengths in our operations. We hope that 

through our community partnerships, we can address pressing social needs and reinforce our commitment to enduring 

positive impact.

Due to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, many of our community activities and programmes scheduled in 2020 were 

cancelled or postponed, however we donated approximately US$23,000 for various community initiatives and provision 

of personal protective equipment (PPE) during COVID-19. We have also contributed to community hours before the 

lockdowns. During the 12 months ended 31 March 2020, we have collectively achieved a total of 15,620 of community 

hours, or approximately 22 volunteer hours per employee. This is above our FY2020 target which was to achieve on 

average at least 2 volunteer hours per employee.

Working together with local communities

Through partnerships with local social enterprises in Yangon and Bagan, the Group’s Hotels and Experiences provide a 

platform for social enterprises to sell their handcrafted products. Seafood for the restaurant at Awei Pila is purchased 

from local fishermen and the resort employs local communities living at nearby villages. Burma Boating provides Moken 

youths with learning opportunities on handcrafting of traditional boat models from the elder Moken population, and 

the sales of these boat models are available on Burma Boating trips. Burma boating also provides schooling supplies for 

Moken children as well as basic photography skills trainings.

Environmental conservation

From May to September 2020, during the low tourist season, the team from Shwe Lay Ta Gun Travel &amp; Tours Company 

Limited, comprising Balloons Over Inle and Balloons Over Bagan actively participate in clearing of plastic waste every 

Friday and Saturday. Working with other hotels and restaurants in the area, as well as Nyaung Oo football club, banks 

and tour guides, our employees are deployed each weekend to work with the external organisations to clear the plastic 

waste for recycling. A total of 2,700 hours was contributed by the employees over five months for this activity.

Education

Balloons over Bagan continues to play an important role in contributing to community projects throughout the Bagan 

region of Myanmar and to other causes in more remote areas of the country. Their projects focus on three main areas: 

Education (Rehabilitation of school and facilities), Health and Conservation (Protecting trees, animals, natural heritage, 

land, etc.). As an active player in the sustainability of the Bagan area, they participate in plastic free projects with other 

non-governmental organizations (NGOs), with a goal to for this archaeological zone to become a plastic free area. 

Balloons over Bagan also provides cash donations and school supplies for schools in the neighbouring villages each year 

– in July 2019, school stationary was distributed to 3 schools in the Nyaung Shwe (Inle) region, while in August 2019, 

school stationery was similarly distributed to 12 schools in the Bagan/Nyaung Oo regions.

OUR SOCIAL 

CONTRIBUTIONS

Providing emergency relief

Nyaung Oo region, which is located in the Mandalay Region where Balloons Over Bagan has their ballooning operations, 

is a dry zone area. These rural areas are highly reliant on rain and collected rainwater in the lakes for their daily water 

usage. During the dry season from February to May, the lakes occasionally run dry and villagers have difficulties to get 

access to clean water. During the last dry season from May to August 2019, Balloons over Bagan donated 79,200 gallons 

of water to villages in the Bagan/Nyaung Oo region.

During the floods in Hpa-An in August 2019, Keinnara Hpa-An donated 310 rice boxes, 500 loaves of bread and 360 

packs of dried noodles, as well as 5,500,000 MMK for the affected families who had to be evacuated to temporary 

shelters.
