longevity

We also share in the enduring heritage 

of the Boustead Group under Boustead 

Singapore Limited, which has contributed 

almost two centuries of progress and holds 

the longstanding position as Singapore’s 

oldest continuous organisation – a 

practical and symbolic reflection of 

longevity.

Even as sustainability reporting takes 

centre stage among the world’s latest 

corporate reporting initiatives, we feel 

that being deeply rooted in the enduring 

heritage of the Boustead Group, the 

term ‘Longevity Reporting’ is more all-

encompassing and appropriate than 

‘Sustainability Reporting’.  This past year, 

we also began tackling the challenging 

environment posed by the onset of the 

COVID-19 pandemic, an existential threat 

to the longevity and wellbeing of the world.

Regardless of how COVID-19 or any 

other major crises may change the way 

we operate, one thing is indelible – our 

distinct brand of entrepreneurialism, 

institutionalised in a corporate culture 

that links back to the Boustead Group’s 

earliest days of trading.  We embrace 

the Boustead Way, which prioritises 

the pursuit of business with a greater 

purpose.  It is about creating sustainable 

shared socio-economic value instead of 

maximising short-term profit; promoting 

adaptability and resilience; and favouring 

longevity over sentimentality.  It is also a 

position, a value, a commercial sensibility 

that runs through every layer of our 

organisation.

As you read this report, we hope that you 

gain an in-depth understanding of how we 

remain resilient, ensure our longevity and 

Welcome to the Boustead Projects 

Limited FY2020 Longevity Report.

solutions provider for smart eco-

sustainable business park and industrial 

developments, we have demonstrated over 

two decades of pioneership in industrial 

real estate solutions including the design-

and-build and development of advanced 

eco-sustainable facilities serving some 

of the world’s best corporations.  Our 

contributions to transforming Singapore 

and Asia’s industrial landscape have 

been accompanied by transformative 

technologies that are shaping all aspects of 

our business in an even more sustainable 

manner and enabling clients with future-

ready, custom-built developments founded 

upon progressive eco-sustainable and 

Industry 4.0 transformation standards.

BOUSTEAD PROJECTS LIMITED FY2O2O LONGEVITY REPORT



LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

Despite record revenue, profit 

attributable to shareholders was 27% 

lower year-on-year at S$22.2 million, 

mainly due to lower gross margins, 

lower quantum of cost savings, higher 

overhead costs and the absence of 

a one-off gain from a property sale 

recorded in FY2019.  After adjusting for 

the after-tax gain on property sale and an 

impairment loss, comparative net profit 

would be 10% lower year-on-year.

In FY2020, we made significant progress 

on our largest public and private sector 

projects to date, respectively the 

S$242 million contract for JTC Kranji 

Green (“Kranji Green”), Singapore’s 

first multi-storey recycling facility, and 

the over S$200 million contract for 

Surbana Jurong Campus, an iconic 

global headquarters designed by 

Safdie Surbana Jurong that is the first 

large-scale industrial development to 

be awarded the Green Mark Platinum – 

Super Low Energy, an exemplary project 

on how building design can mitigate 

climate change.

During FY2020, we continued our 

journey to consolidate our position as 

Singapore’s leading design-and-build 

partner for smart eco-sustainable 

business park and industrial 

developments.  Further building 

upon our integrated digital delivery 

(“IDD”) approach, guided by Industry 

4.0 transformation standards and 

incorporating 7D building information 

modelling (“BIM”), virtual design 

and construction, and design for 

manufacturing and assembly (“DfMA”), 

we achieved significantly higher internal 

adoption rates for game-changing 

methodologies such as 3D scanning, 

artificial intelligence and machine 

learning, data analytics and virtual reality.

Our transformative methodologies 

are best displayed at our project for 

Kranji Green.  Extensive use of DfMA 

prefabrication for Kranji Green has 

demonstrated our capability to work with 

some of the largest DfMA prefabricated 

components involved in any industrial 

project.  We were able to achieve a very 

high level of IDD adoption within this 

Dear Fellow Stakeholders,

As we present our Boustead Projects 

FY2020 Longevity Report to you, our 

credible performance for the financial 

year ended 31 March 2020 has been 

overshadowed by extremely challenging 

circumstances.

Our performance was achieved in a 

challenging industry environment which 

has been aggravated by trade wars, de-

globalisation movements and towards 

the end of the financial year, the onset 

of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Revenue 

was 82% higher year-on-year at a record 

S$426.2 million, driven by conversion 

of our strong design-and-build order 

backlog carried over from FY2019 and 

higher real estate revenue.

project, which includes:

• Improving project planning 

and tracking by aggregating all 

construction and scheduling data into 

a single Cloud-based platform;

• Significantly optimising design 

approvals through virtual walkthroughs 

of BIM with relevant stakeholders; and

• Working towards a digital operations 

and maintenance manual for the 

development, which will see the final 

as-built BIM used for multi-decade 

facilities management – a first of its 

kind in Asia.

Towards the end of FY2020, the 

pandemic struck, leading to an 

unprecedented level of lockdowns and 

travel restrictions, resulting in massive 

socio-economic disruptions.  During 

the pandemic’s initial stages, we moved 

quickly to safeguard the wellbeing of 

our stakeholders including our team, 

subcontractors and their employees, 

clients and surrounding communities 

by implementing strict health checks, 

safe distancing measures, split team and 

telecommuting arrangements.

As an organisation, we continue to 

develop resilient partnerships to manage 

the dynamic challenges that are ahead 

and to bounce back stronger when 

the global economy recovers.  Our 

resilient strategic partnerships and 

in-built resilience are further supported

by our strong balance sheet, healthy 

order backlog and expanding leasehold 

portfolio, positioning us to continue 

pursuing growth opportunities and 

initiatives that advance and shape Asia’s 

built environment sector.

Developing Resilient Partnerships

Resilient partnerships come in all forms 

in the ecosystem we are part of – from 

our team and subcontractors to clients 

and strategic partners.

Among those most badly affected by 

the pandemic are our subcontractors 

whose many employees reside at foreign 

worker dormitories where infection 

levels were high.  Throughout this crisis, 

we have continued to closely engage 

with our subcontractors on the situation, 

enabling us to better appreciate the 

challenges they face and allowing us to 

render them appropriate assistance and 

support where possible.  The resilience 

of our supply chain partnerships will be 

critical to our collective efforts to resolve 

the issue of worker resource availability 

even as we have restarted and continue 

to scale up our Singapore project sites.

To better protect and track the 

movement of our subcontractors’ 

employees within our project sites and 

facilitate contact tracing as part of safe 

management requirements, we are 

partnering a local nominee of TraceSafe 

to deploy its wearable devices and Cloud 

management software at our Singapore 

project sites.  The first deployment will 

be at a single project site and once 

the relevant government approvals 

and support are obtained, we will work 

towards expanding this deployment 

across all Singapore project sites.

In a separate effort to minimise human 

exposure to onsite activities that can 

be automated, we are partnering 

with Airsquire – a startup specialising 

in image analytics for construction 

design – to automate the validation of 

construction progress scans against 

BIM through the use of 3D scanning, 

AI and machine learning, and drones.  

This will reduce inspection times by up 

to 40% compared to manual inspection 

methods, automate construction 

verification to minimise updating errors 

in the final BIM and limit the need 

for our team to expose themselves 

unnecessarily.

As we push forward with expansion 

plans, another area of developing 

resilient partnerships is with strategic 

capital partners.  Selecting resilient 

strategic capital partners is vital, since 

they can affect our ability to continue 

financing developments that are in 

the pipeline and critical to our future 

success.  Our strong collaborations 

include the Boustead Development 

Partnership, Echo Base-BP Capital, 

Perennial Real Estate and most 

recently, The Platform-Hanwha.  The 

entry of The Platform-Hanwha as our 

strategic partner for 351 on Braddell has 

enhanced our current pool of strong, 

synergistic development partnerships 

that have enabled us to undertake a 

wider range and greater number of 

developments across more real estate 

sectors and geographic markets.  

We also recognise that our provision of 

smart eco-sustainable business park and 

industrial developments is dependent 

on resilient technology partnerships that 

address both Industry 4.0 transformation 

standards and climate change.  With 

regards to smart building capabilities, 

we have partnered with Getronics – a 

leading global infocommunications 

technology service provider – to help 

future-proof our developments with 

a flexible and scalable platform for 

new and ever-changing technologies, 

allowing us to manage smart 

developments in our leasehold portfolio 

through a single integrated technology 

platform.

On the renewable energy front, we have 

partnered with Sunseap – the largest 

and most established integrated clean 

energy solutions provider in Singapore 

– which is intended to better utilise 

the rooftop space of our leasehold 

properties through the potential 

installation of rooftop industrial solar 

energy systems and offer lower-cost 

clean energy solutions to our clients and 

tenants.

We also invested S$4.2 million for a 

25% shareholding in DSCO Group 

Holdings Pte Ltd (“DSCO”), a provider 

of specialised building engineering 

consulting services in the Asia Pacific, 

with a strong reputation as a leading 

designer in data centres.  We expect 

our strategic partnership with DSCO 

to support our future expansion and 

augment our design-and-build and 

development capabilities in high-tech, 

high value-added projects and intend to 

leverage DSCO’s expertise, experience 

and reputable position in the high-

growth data centre industry to jointly 

pursue data centre projects.

FY2021 – Prevailing Over the ‘New 

Normal’

The Circuit Breaker imposed by the 

Singapore Government from 7 April to 

1 June 2020 led to the suspension of 

all non-essential construction activities 

in Singapore, resulting in the closure 

of our headquarters and design-

and-build project sites.  Although we 

managed to conduct most of our project 

management activities through secure 

Cloud-based technology platforms and 

telecommuting, nearly all of our physical

OTHER INFORMATION

construction activities were halted in 

April 2020, resulting in at least four 

months of delay per project.

Post-Circuit Breaker, the Building &amp; 

Construction Authority (“BCA”) has 

administered a gradual, controlled 

reopening of Singapore’s construction 

industry in multiple phases, further 

delaying the resumption of the majority 

of construction projects in Singapore, 

including our own.  We have received 

approvals to restart our design-and-build 

projects and will continue to work closely 

with the BCA and relevant authorities to 

ensure the wellbeing, health and safety 

of all stakeholders as we resume and 

scale up operations.

As we move forward in FY2021, project 

completion delays are expected 

as productivity will be impacted by 

the need to comply with new safe 

management measures, along with the 

serious shortage of worker resources 

– a problem affecting Singapore’s 

entire construction industry due to the 

high infection levels among foreign 

workers.  This will lead to slower 

revenue conversion, accompanied by 

associated acceleration, compliance, 

prolongation and resumption costs 

which are still being ascertained given 

the fluidity of the situation.  Later 

completion of development projects 

will also correspondingly delay the 

commencement of leasing income.

We have proactively taken several 

measures to mitigate the impact of 

these delays and to protect the viability 

and long-term value of our businesses.  

Our implemented cost management 

measures include organisation-wide cost 

reviews, a salary freeze for our entire 

team and a reduction in Board fees and 

senior management salaries since June 

2020.  Our Board and executive directors 

have taken 10% reductions in directors’ 

fees and base salaries respectively, 

while the rest of our senior management 

team has been subjected to tiered 5% 

to 7.5% reductions in base salaries.  

Our significantly impacted businesses 

in Singapore have been somewhat 

mitigated by our geographic expansion 

efforts, which yielded a significant 

contract win in Malaysia in FY2021, as 

well as ongoing projects in China and 

Vietnam.

While we expect an increasingly 

manpower-lean, more closely regulated, 

dynamic and higher operating cost 

environment will form part of the ‘new 

normal’ in the future, our collaborative 

and progressive approach in staying 

ahead of the industry transformation 

curve has competitively positioned 

us as a design-and-build partner well-

equipped to execute projects under 

challenging conditions.  Although split 

team and telecommuting arrangements 

necessitated by the pandemic have 

slightly impacted our team’s overall 

productivity, they also demonstrate 

that our business continuity activities 

are functioning, with our ability to 

conduct many of our activities remotely 

and effectively through secure Cloud-

based collaboration and productivity 

platforms that we have invested in 

and implemented organisation-wide.  

Our transformative technologies are 

contributing in-built resilience that 

will help us prevail in the Singapore 

construction industry’s greatest crisis in 

history.

As you read this report, we hope that 

you gain an in-depth understanding 

of how we remain resilient, ensure 

our longevity and protect the viability 

and long-term value of our businesses 

and the wider ecosystem that we are 

interconnected with.  We also share how 

we strive towards what the Boustead 

Group has achieved in longevity over 

almost two centuries and how this 

translates to delivering sustainable 

shared socio-economic value and 

progress to key stakeholders, along with 

the communities that we reside in and 

our collective home – Planet Earth.  Our 

performance, policies and practices on 

material economic, environmental, social 

and governance topics are explained.  A 

section on the COVID-19 pandemic has 

also been added.

Thank you for entrusting us with the 

role of being a trustworthy corporate 

citizen, one which we hope to honour 

for many more decades to come, as we 

continue to be highly reflective about 

how our actions ‘ripple upon the pond 

of life’.  This journey is an ultramarathon, 

which we will continue running in the 

Boustead Way and hope to have you 

join, even if only for part of the way.  Have 

an enjoyable and insightful read.

May you and your loved ones stay 

well, healthy and safe during these 

tumultuous times.

1.2.3 Board Longevity Statement

Our Board is committed to ensuring 

our longevity including reviewing our 

performance, policies and practices in 

relation to material ESG topics.

Our Board is assisted in this by our 

existing robust systems including audit, 

compliance, enterprise risk, financial, 

environmental, health and safety, human 

resource, information technology and 

operational management systems, along 

with the implementation of our Longevity 

Reporting Framework.

Our Board assesses opportunities and 

risks presented by material ESG topics.  

This helps our Board to determine 

the appropriate strategies, policies 

and practices that will provide us with 

the adaptability and flexibility to seize 

opportunities to deliver sustainable 

shared socio-economic value and 

progress to key stakeholders, while 

being well-supported by sound risk 

management.  Our risk appetite 

considers material ESG topics that may 

affect reputational risk, ethical and moral 

considerations, and have significant 

financial and non-financial implications.

1.2.4 Overall ESG Recognition

While gaining overall ESG recognition 

from our key stakeholders is not an end 

in itself, it indicates that we are moving 

in the right direction as a trustworthy 

corporate citizen.  Since our listing 

on the SGX Mainboard in April 2015, 

we have been recognised for our 

performance, policies and practices in 

relation to overall management of ESG 

topics as shown here.

FRAMEWORK

2.1 ABOUT THIS REPORT

2.1.1 Report Period &amp; Scope

This is the Boustead Projects FY2020 

Longevity Report, an annual publication 

dedicated to providing a more holistic

covering non-financial areas such as 

environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) topics that are material to our 

business and key stakeholders.

This report contains at least three full-

2019 (“FY2019”) and issued on 30 

August 2019.  Our inaugural report was 

issued on 22 November 2018.

This report should be read in conjunction 

with the Boustead Projects FY2020 

Annual Report for context.  It should

long-term objectives to be adaptable 

and resilient, deliver sustainable shared 

socio-economic value and progress to 

key stakeholders, and make a positive 

impact economically, environmentally 

and socially on the world.  The views of 

both external and internal stakeholders 

are taken into account when determining 

the material ESG topics that should be 

included in this report.

To ensure that material ESG topics 

remain up-to-date, we periodically review 

current and emerging megatrends, 

changes in the economic, political, 

regulatory and ESG landscape in the 

geographic markets and industry 

clusters that we operate in, along with 

the views of key stakeholders.  These 

are then updated in our assessment 

process.

2.2.1 Key Stakeholder Engagement

We define key stakeholders as being 

groups that our business may have 

a significant impact on or vice versa, 

and who have a vested interest in the 

way that we conduct business.  After a 

thorough review, nine key stakeholders 

were identified, along with their 

significance and conversations, as 

shown here.

engineering, project management, construction management, 

development management, asset management and property 

management and the application of proprietary domain 

expertise that extends over a regional network of key stakeholder

thrive in will eventually translate to the delivery of sustainable 

shared socio-economic value and progress to key stakeholders.

In 2017, we conducted a materiality

team members including our senior 

management team and department 

heads in Singapore, who acted as 

proxies for the nine key stakeholders that 

have been identified, and highlighted 

and prioritised material ESG topics of 

relevance to these key stakeholders.  

Following the completion of the 

materiality assessment workshop, we 

were able to consolidate and validate 

12 material ESG topics for inclusion in 

this report.  Community development 

was not material but has been reported 

due to its significance to the business 

environment.

In addition, due to the onset of the 

COVID-19 pandemic during FY2020 

and its material impact on our business 

and key stakeholders, COVID-19 and

2.2.3 Opportunities &amp; Risks

We are vigilant in ensuring that our 

strategies to enhance stakeholders’ 

shared socio-economic value are well-

supported by sound risk management.  

Our material ESG topics present us with 

both opportunities (if we embrace the 

right approaches to managing these ESG 

topics) and risks (if we neglect these ESG 

topics), which are supplemented by our 

existing robust systems and Enterprise 

Risk Management Framework.

In addition, on 1 January 2016, the 

United Nations (“UN”) officially rolled 

out 17 Sustainable Development 

Goals (“SDGs”) of the 2030 Agenda 

for Sustainable Development.  The 

SDGs universally apply to all countries 

with the ultimate aim of mobilising 

all stakeholders – governments, civil 

societies, the private sector and 

others – to collectively contribute to 

ending poverty, fighting inequality and 

tackling climate change through three 

dimensions of sustainable development: 

economic growth, social inclusion and 

environmental protection.

We have summarised opportunities 

and risks from material ESG topics 

here, including how we can contribute 

to achieving the SDGs through our 

business and performance, policies and 

practices in relation to material ESG 

topics.

INTRODUCTION

As mentioned earlier, in order to ensure 

that material ESG topics remain up-to-

date, we periodically review current and 

emerging megatrends, changes in the 

economic, political, regulatory and ESG 

landscape in the geographic markets 

and industry clusters that we operate in, 

along with the views of key stakeholders 

and update these in our assessment 

process.  This includes the review of 

publicly available information and global 

surveys generated by credible sources 

such as the International Monetary Fund, 

UN, World Bank and World Economic 

Forum (“WEF”), among other sources.

One such report, the WEF’s Global Risks 

Report 2020 shared in detail about the 

extreme geo-economic, geo-political and 

ESG challenges that the world faces.

The report’s shareable infographics are 

illustrative of the views of two highly-

aware and highly-educated stakeholder 

groups on the top 10 risks over the next 

10 years in terms of both likelihood 

and impact as based on the Global 

Risks Perception Survey, completed 

by 800 members of the WEF’s diverse 

communities.  One group consists of 

multi-stakeholders including academic, 

business and government leaders to 

non-profit stakeholders, while the other 

group consists of 200 members of the 

Global Shapers Community, a generation 

of emerging global social entrepreneurs

and leaders.  The report’s shareable 

infographics are shown on page 27.1

Both stakeholder groups had common 

views on environmental risks, which 

featured and dominated the top five 

risks in terms of likelihood and also 

appeared as having greater impact 

among the top 10 risks, compared to 

other types of risks.  While the top 10 

risks would have been apparent based 

on a thorough assessment of the global 

environment over the past few years, 

one risk stands out in particular on 

hindsight.  Bearing in mind that this 

survey was conducted before the onset 

of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is striking 

to note that both stakeholder groups did 

not view infectious diseases as among 

the top 10 risks in terms of likelihood 

but did view infectious diseases among 

the top 10 risks in terms of impact.  This 

striking observation could in part explain 

the inability and unpreparedness of 

most governments to control the rapid 

spread of the pandemic, given that 

multiple stakeholders’ acknowledged 

the potential severe impact of infectious 

diseases but believed the likelihood of 

occurrence to be slim.

Shortly before the end of FY2020, the 

onset of the pandemic and its rapid 

spread in a very short period of time took 

the world by surprise, representing the 

greatest risk to the world in recent times.

INTRODUCTION

OVER TWO DECADES OF 

PIONEERSHIP AND TRANSFORMING 

ASIA’S BUILT ENVIRONMENT

Over Boustead Projects’ more than two 

decades of pioneership and contributing 

to the transformation of Asia’s built 

environment through the design-and-

build and development of smart eco-

sustainable business park and industrial 

developments, we have performed our 

role as a trustworthy corporate citizen, 

building businesses with a greater 

purpose – creating sustainable shared 

socio-economic value in the process – 

and developing trusting relationships 

with key stakeholders internationally.

Regardless of how COVID-19 or any 

other major crises may change the way 

we operate, one thing is indelible – our 

distinct brand of entrepreneurialism, 

institutionalised in a corporate culture 

that links back to the Boustead Group’s 

earliest days of trading.  Being deeply 

rooted in the enduring heritage of 

the Boustead Group, we embrace 

the Boustead Way, which prioritises 

the pursuit of business with a greater 

purpose.  It is about creating sustainable 

shared socio-economic value instead of 

maximising short-term profit; promoting 

adaptability and resilience; and favouring 

longevity over sentimentality.  It is also a 

position, a value, a commercial sensibility 

that runs through every layer of our 

organisation.

We have generated and distributed 

tremendous direct economic value 

and environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) benefits to key 

stakeholders including our team, 

clients, strategic partners, suppliers, 

lenders, shareholders, the media, 

governments and communities.  Since 

our establishment in 1996, we have 

registered continuous profitability 

every year which has enabled us to 

reinvest in creating sustainable shared 

socio-economic value and delivering 

progress to key stakeholders, laying the 

cornerstones for our long-term success 

and longevity.

A common consideration in evolving 

our business model, pioneering 

new methodologies and investing 

in new acquisitions, developments 

and geographic markets in real 

estate sectors has been based on 

assessing whether specific business 

expansions provide sustainable profit 

and simultaneously also serve a greater 

purpose through the direct and indirect 

benefits shared with as many key 

stakeholders in as many economic 

and ESG facets as possible.  We have 

refrained from specific business 

expansions that could be highly 

profitable but yet are questionable on 

ethical and moral grounds, considered 

exploitative in nature, deemed as short-

term and unsustainable to begin with or 

violate the sanctity of life.  The long and 

short of it is that business expansions 

must make good sense and instil a sense 

of good.

In line with this, our team, organisational 

ecosystem, and engineered products 

and services – primarily smart eco-

sustainable industrial real estate 

solutions (“solutions”) – have to 

inherently uphold the high honourable 

“Not all profit is equal.  Profits involving a social purpose represent a higher form of capitalism, one 

that creates a positive cycle of company and community prosperity.”

conduct and quality standards that have 

been associated with the Boustead 

Group for almost two centuries.  In 

addition, we embrace transformation 

or aim to be transformative where 

possible, in order to promptly adapt to 

new megatrends and the prevailing 

global landscape that has emerged over 

time.  Our pioneering achievements 

in the industrial real estate sector are 

summarised here.

In FY2020, our business was categorised 

into two key revenue-generating 

segments: Design-and-Build and Real 

Estate.  A third segment, Strategic 

Partnerships &amp; Investments generated 

activities which fed directly into Design-

and-Build and Real Estate.  These 

segments are shown on page 30.

This section covers how we are pursuing 

business with a greater purpose through 

our integrated industrial real estate 

solutions model, smart eco-sustainable 

solutions, quality, transformative 

technologies initiatives and generation 

of direct economic value, which are 

derived from the combined depth of all 

six capitals – financial, manufactured, 

intellectual, human, social and 

relationship, and natural – and ultimately 

deliver positive net effects for all six 

capitals.

3.1 INTEGRATED INDUSTRIAL REAL 

ESTATE SOLUTIONS PROVIDER

As the only generally acknowledged 

integrated industrial real estate solutions 

provider listed on the SGX Mainboard 

with integrated capabilities covering 

most of the industry value chain, we 

provide development, design-and-build, 

leasehold portfolio asset management 

and ownership, and facilities 

management for business park and 

industrial developments, and business 

and industrial parks as shown on page 

31.

Our main market is in Singapore with 

a growing international presence in 

overseas markets including China, 

Malaysia and Vietnam, as shown on

INTRODUCTION

Our integrated capabilities are 

reinforced by our excellent quality 

and environmental, health and safety 

(“EHS”) track records, transformative 

technologies and outright market 

leadership in delivering advanced eco-

sustainable business park and industrial 

developments.

Our capabilities are aimed at helping 

clients to achieve highly effective 

and cost competitive solutions that 

raise efficiency and sustainability.  

Furthermore, our full-fledged IDD 

platform brings various development, 

design and building disciplines under 

one roof and eliminates significant 

additional costs, coordination, time and 

wastage for clients, with 7D BIM as the 

centrepiece digitalisation technology for 

significantly enhanced productivity.

One of our key design-and-build offerings 

is value engineering, the systematic 

design or redesign of a custom-built 

development to ensure that clients enjoy 

greater or similar facility performance, 

function and quality at significantly 

reduced costs.  We eliminate potential 

over-design and over-construction 

that is usually present where multiple 

independent third-parties are involved.  

Through value engineering, we continue 

to unlock value for clients with significant 

savings in cost, coordination, equipment, 

materials and time as compared to 

conventional construction projects 

and have changed the norms by which 

developments are delivered.

Our capabilities now include pioneering 

the introduction of smart building 

capabilities and proven transformative 

technologies for smart eco-sustainable 

developments in line with Industry 

4.0 transformation standards 

and the Singapore Government’s 

Industry Transformation Programme 

(“ITP”),1 which lays out 23 Industry 

Transformation Maps (“ITMs”) under six 

industry clusters to build a Future-Ready 

Singapore.  Our direct contributions 

to the ITP are made within the ‘Built 

Environment’ industry cluster, while we 

provide indirect contributions to support 

transformations in other industry clusters 

– essential domestic services, lifestyle, 

manufacturing, modern services, and 

trade and connectivity – through the 

smart eco-sustainable solutions that we 

provide to the key players within these 

industry clusters.

3.2 SMART ECO-SUSTAINABLE 

SOLUTIONS

Our smart eco-sustainable solutions are 

experiential and extremely functional 

spaces that are designed around clients’ 

key processes and requirements, where 

talented client teams from the world’s 

best corporations are placed in the ideal 

built environment to collaborate and:

• Give birth to new ideas and innovations 

– R&amp;D and technology centres;

• Produce solutions and technologies 

that drive the global economy – high-

tech engineering and manufacturing 

facilities;

• Distribute solutions and technologies 

globally – logistics facilities; and

• Provide for the flow and storage of vast 

amounts of data – data centres.

To do so, we continue to develop 

solutions that are smart and eco-

sustainable, meaning that they have 

a positive ecological impact.  ‘Eco-’ 

based on the root word ‘ecological’ is 

defined as ‘relating to or concerned 

with the relation of living organisms 

to one another and to their physical 

surroundings.’2   Our smart eco-

sustainable solutions are expected to 

deliver primary benefits to clients, usually 

economic in nature, and secondary 

benefits to clients and other key 

stakeholders, which transcend economic 

value into ESG benefits, with an overall 

positive bottomline for the entire 

ecosystem that our solutions fit into.

This is extremely important given that 

the United Nations’ 2019 Global Status 

Report for Buildings and Construction 

states that buildings and construction 

together accounted for 36% of global 

final energy usage and 39% of energy 

and process-related carbon dioxide 

emissions in 2018.3   Furthermore, 

83% of energy-related carbon dioxide 

emissions related to buildings and 

construction are generated by the 

energy consumed when completed 

buildings are in use4 or what is referred 

to as operating energy.  As such, 

our smart eco-sustainable solutions 

which are already directly influencing 

and reducing energy loss, emissions, 

pollution, and energy and water 

consumption have the potential to do so

in the future as well during the highest 

emissions period in the multi-decade 

building lifecycle.

The primary and secondary benefits, 

industry diversification and long-term 

market outlook for our solutions are 

shown here.

3.2.1 Solutions Supporting Economic 

Activities

Our smart eco-sustainable solutions 

have been implemented to support 

niche segments of hard infrastructure, 

primarily business and industrial parks 

that form the backbone of economic 

activities in both developed and 

emerging markets.  Today, our smart 

eco-sustainable solutions integrate 

Industry 4.0 transformation standards 

that increasingly support clients 

with their business activities and 

transformations.

3.2.2 Solutions With Additional ESG 

Benefits – Smart Green Buildings

Outside of the direct economic 

value that clients receive, our smart 

eco-sustainable solutions also offer 

significant secondary benefits in ESG 

facets.  With the eco-sustainability 

practices of clients coming under 

increased scrutiny from their key 

stakeholders, we have been delivering 

smart eco-sustainable solutions that 

help them to match their global growth 

strategies with better management of 

their ecological footprints, compliance 

with environmental regulations and 

the potential collection of building 

data that can enhance operations and 

productivity.  Clients who embrace our 

smart eco-sustainable solutions also 

receive social benefits through the ESG 

benefits that accrue to surrounding 

communities and natural ecosystems, 

serving to boost and protect their 

relationships and reputations with their 

key stakeholders.

Our smart eco-sustainable solutions 

have helped clients to significantly 

reduce energy loss, emissions, 

pollution, waste, and energy and water 

consumption throughout the multi-

decade building lifecycle.  Our smart 

eco-sustainable built environment 

is conducive to create a healthy and 

productive internal environment for 

clients, while reducing the ecological 

impact on the natural environment and 

surrounding communities.

Reporting to the Singapore 

Government’s Ministry of National 

Development, the Building &amp; 

Construction Authority (“BCA”) is the 

agency responsible for championing 

the development of an excellent 

built environment for Singapore and 

launching the Green Mark Programme in 

2005, as shown on page 35.

In 2009, we broke new ground with 

the delivery of Singapore’s first 

Green Mark Platinum-rated industrial 

development in the heavy industry 

category for a Fortune 500 corporation, 

Applied Materials under the BCA’s 

Green Mark Programme.  Since then, 

we have proceeded to become the 

outright market leader in delivering 

Green Mark Platinum-rated industrial 

developments and also delivered LEED-

rated industrial developments under the 

US Green Building Council (“USGBC”)’s 

internationally-recognised Leadership 

in Energy &amp; Environmental Design

During FY2020, our landmark largest 

private sector project for Surbana Jurong 

Campus (“SJC”) became Singapore’s first 

large-scale business park and industrial 

development to be awarded the GMP-

SLE at the BCA Green Mark Awards 

2019 held in May 2019.  SJC is a huge 

step towards minimal to zero carbon 

footprints and an exemplary project on 

how building design can mitigate climate 

change.  Introduced in 2018, the GMP-

SLE rating is the BCA’s latest higher 

benchmark for best-in-class green 

buildings in Singapore.  SJC achieved 

the GMP-SLE with significant eco-

sustainability features geared towards 

the highest levels of energy efficiency 

and huge reductions in energy usage.  

Separately, Bolloré Blue Hub and Veolia 

Singapore Office@Tuas View Circuit 

were awarded the Green Mark Platinum.

Shortly after the end of FY2020, at the 

BCA Green Mark Awards 2020 held 

in August 2020, our fourth project 

for DB Schenker in Singapore – DB 

Schenker Shared Logistics Center 

(ALPS) – was awarded the Green Mark 

Platinum.  Separately, ASM Front-End 

Manufacturing and Razer SEA HQ were 

awarded the Green Mark Gold Plus, 

while Bombardier Singapore Service 

Centre Phase 2 was awarded the Green 

Mark Gold.

As the outright market leader in 

the design-and-build of smart eco-

sustainable industrial developments, we 

are taking our commitment further to 

attain higher Green Mark ratings in our 

role as a developer for multi-tenanted 

developments that we intend to own 

and lease out in Singapore.  In line with 

this, we designed and built our global 

headquarters – Edward Boustead Centre 

– to attain Green Mark Platinum in 2015, 

leading by example and showcasing to 

clients how extensive green building 

features can be incorporated into the 

design of all future buildings.  Similarly, 

the same path was taken for ALICE, 

which was awarded the Green Mark 

Platinum in 2018.  In addition, our latest 

multi-tenanted smart development – 

351 on Braddell – under construction at 

Braddell Road is planned to incorporate 

a number of smart eco-sustainable 

features.  Moving forward, we will 

continue to explore ways to further 

introduce smart eco-sustainable 

solutions into our leasehold portfolio 

including the introduction of the Green 

Lease Scheme at our multi-tenanted 

developments in Singapore.

features.  Many of the Green Mark 

Platinum-rated developments we have 

delivered incorporate the smart eco-

sustainable features shown here.

3.2.3 Strategic Technology 

Partnerships to Strengthen Smart 

Eco-Sustainable Solutions

During FY2020, we continued to 

strengthen our smart eco-sustainable 

solutions through new collaborations 

with three strategic technology 

partners: DSCO Group Holdings Pte Ltd 

(“DSCO”), Getronics Solutions (S) Pte Ltd 

(“Getronics”) and Sunseap Leasing Pte 

Ltd (“Sunseap”).

Acquired at the beginning of FY2020 for 

S$4.2 million for a 25% shareholding, 

DSCO is a provider of specialised 

building engineering consulting services 

in the Asia Pacific, with a strong 

reputation as a leading designer in 

data centres.  We expect our strategic 

investment in DSCO to support future 

expansion and augment design-and-

build and development capabilities in 

high-tech, higher value sectors and 

intend to leverage DSCO’s expertise, 

experience and reputable position in 

the high-growth data centre industry to 

jointly pursue data centre projects.

We commenced our collaboration 

with Getronics – a leading global 

infocommunications technology 

service provider – which is intended 

to enable us to deliver next generation 

smart industrial buildings by leveraging 

Getronics’ technologies and to augment 

our integrated suite of transformative 

digital real estate solutions addressing 

the entire multi-decade lifecycle of 

buildings.  Getronics’ smart technologies 

will help future-proof our development 

projects with a flexible and scalable 

platform for new and ever-changing 

technologies, allowing us to manage 

smart developments in our leasehold 

portfolio on a single technology platform.

We signed a framework agreement 

with Sunseap – the largest and most 

established integrated clean energy 

solutions company in Singapore – on the 

potential installation of rooftop industrial 

solar energy systems at our real estate 

projects and potential provision of 

lower-cost clean energy solutions to our 

clients and tenants.  This partnership is 

intended to better utilise rooftop space – 

an important asset within our leasehold 

portfolio.  Promoting eco-sustainability 

through greater use of renewable energy 

aligns with our position as the market 

leading builder and developer of smart 

eco-sustainable business park and 

industrial developments.

3.3 QUALITY

Quality has always been a defining 

factor in the total client experience.  

As part of our Quality Management 

System (“QMS”) which includes 

quality assurance and improvement 

programmes, we first embarked on ISO 

9001 certification in 1999 and have had a 

QMS in place ever since.  In March 2016, 

our major design-and-build subsidiary in 

Singapore, Boustead Projects E&amp;C (“BP 

E&amp;C”) received an upgrade to the latest 

ISO 9001:2015 standard and in April 

2018, recertified under the standard.

LONGEVITY REPORTING 

FRAMEWORK

INTRODUCTION

Our QMS sets out quality management 

system enablers, commitments, targets 

and responsibilities for our team, with 

overriding responsibility belonging to 

our Audit &amp; Improvement Team headed 

by our Director of Audit &amp; Improvement, 

a member of our senior management 

team.  Our QMS is both externally 

and internally audited, and ensures 

quality management performance at all 

workplaces and project sites under our 

control on a daily basis.

As the delivery of quality is emphasised 

throughout all potential client touch 

points, our solutions are not always 

the lowest priced among competing 

solutions but do consistently deliver 

high quality client experiences and 

outcomes.  Due to positive client 

experiences and outcomes, numerous 

clients have become repeat clients 

which is important in the context where 

almost all client relationships are 

business-to-business arrangements 

involving a smaller client base but larger 

transactional value as compared to what 

is typically seen in business-to-consumer 

arrangements.  The embedding of quality 

into all potential client touch points is 

extremely important since a client team’s 

project journey together with us typically 

lasts for over one year and is made up 

of thousands of interactions between 

key stakeholders, especially between 

our team and clients, strategic partners, 

suppliers, lenders, government agencies 

and regulators, all within a single project.

3.3.1 Quality, Domain Expertise &amp; 

Project Track Records as Client Pre-

Qualifiers

Our clients range from reputable small 

and medium-sized enterprises to global 

clients including Fortune 500, S&amp;P 500 

and Euronext 100 corporations.  Given 

the strong brand reputation of our clients 

and potential clients, there are usually 

more stringent expectations on quality, 

domain expertise and project track 

records since our solutions have such a 

significant impact on the achievement 

of clients’ global growth strategies 

and their relationships with their key 

stakeholders.  Many clients conduct 

financial, quality, EHS and project track 

record reviews on our business and at 

times, those of our suppliers, before 

pre-qualifying and inviting us to submit 

proposals, bids and tenders for potential 

projects.  Once we become a pre-

qualified main contractor to a specific 

client, we are routinely invited to submit 

proposals, bids and tenders for potential 

projects whenever the specific client 

reviews a potential new investment or 

project in Singapore and sometimes 

internationally.

In addition, BP E&amp;C is approved by the 

BCA for Grade CW01-A1 and General 

Builder Class 1 Licence6 to execute 

building construction contracts of 

unlimited value in the private and public 

sectors.  This removes the limit on the 

size of contracts that we can undertake 

in Singapore.

3.3.2 Construction Awards &amp; 

Construction Quality Assessment 

System

We are a regular feature at the BCA 

Awards, an annual awards programme 

hosted by the BCA to recognise the best 

in building and construction practices 

and projects.

During FY2020 at the BCA Awards 

2019 held in May 2019, we received 

the Construction Productivity Award – 

Projects (Gold) for Continental Building 

Phase 3.  Separately, SJC was awarded 

the distinguished GMP-SLE, while 

Bolloré Blue Hub and Veolia Singapore 

Office@Tuas View Circuit were awarded 

the Green Mark Platinum.

Shortly after the end of FY2020, at the 

BCA Awards 2020 held in August 2020, 

DB Schenker Shared Logistics Center 

(ALPS) was awarded the Green Mark 

Platinum.  Separately, ASM Front-End 

Manufacturing and Razer SEA HQ were 

awarded the Green Mark Gold Plus,

3.4 TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVES

With shorter business cycles due 

to disruptive technologies, we need 

to embrace transformation or be 

transformative where possible, in 

order to adapt to new megatrends 

and the prevailing global landscape 

that emerges over time.  Two new 

megatrends that are having a profound 

effect on our respective industries are 

Industry 4.0 and climate change.  In 

addition, the COVID-19 pandemic 

has exponentially accelerated the 

necessity of transformation globally, with 

those unable to adapt and transform 

immediately, facing an existential threat 

greater than any seen in recent memory.

3.4.1 Industry 4.0

According to Boston Consulting Group 

(“BCG”), Industry 4.0 – the fourth 

industrial revolution – is a transformation 

that makes it possible to gather and 

analyse data across machines, enabling 

faster, more flexible and more efficient 

processes to produce higher quality 

goods at reduced costs.  This will 

increase productivity, shift economics, 

foster industrial growth and modify the 

profile of the workforce and ultimately 

change the competitiveness of 

corporations and regions.8   BCG went 

on to name nine technologies that are 

transforming industrial production.  We 

have overlaid our already implemented 

technologies in seven of these areas as 

shown here.

For over two decades, we have been a 

pioneering force in Singapore’s industrial 

real estate sector, demonstrating 

pioneership and transformation in 

business model and activities including 

design-and-build (1996), design-build-

and-lease (2003), advanced eco-

sustainable buildings (2009) and IDD 

(2017), among others.

As the latest capability in our pioneering 

approach, our IDD platform deploys 

digitalisation and Cloud-based 

technologies, and transformative 

methodologies like BIM, virtual design 

and construction (“VDC”), and design 

for manufacturing and assembly

(“DfMA”).  Our progressive game-

changing methodologies include 3D 

scanning, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and 

machine learning, data analytics, drone 

technology and virtual reality (“VR”).

Many of these methodologies were 

extensively adopted in ALICE, our largest 

development, with ALICE’s design, 

construction, project management 

and delivery, further complemented 

by use of drones for aerial imaging, 

site progress and surveillance, and 

eventually the deployment of VR 

technologies for collaboration across 

project stakeholders.  ALICE was 

constructed virtually using BIM and 

VDC (before the actual construction) so 

that most issues could be anticipated 

during construction, operations and 

maintenance, and proactive solutions 

could be generated, thereby significantly 

boosting productivity.  Another first 

in the industry, ALICE adopted large-

scale prefabricated bathroom units 

(“PBUs”) using prefabricated, prefinished 

volumetric construction (“PPVC”), 

moving beyond the norm of small PBUs 

in the residential sector.

On the operational side, an ALICE mobile 

app designed as a collaboration between 

us and a leading homegrown proptech 

firm, is driven by big data analytics and 

Internet of Things (“IoT”) for a tenant 

interface tied to ALICE’s smart building 

management system.  The single and 

comprehensive backend system for 

operations and facilities management 

greatly automates processes and 

reduces manual tasks.

Please review our Industry 4.0 Future 

Feature on ALICE as shown on page 

45, along with a summary of how we are 

converging the ideals of the Singapore 

Government’s ITP and ITMs for three 

industry sectors: construction, real 

estate and infocomm media as shown on 

page 46.  Simultaneously, we are using 

IDD and proven technologies to reshape 

smart eco-sustainable developments for 

clients shifting into Industry 4.0 under 

their respective ITMs.

During FY2020, as part of our 

continued efforts at business and 

technological transformation, we 

progressed with the implementation 

of our digital transformation roadmap, 

further building upon our Industry 4.0 

transformation standards and game-

changing methodologies.  Internal 

adoption rates significantly increased 

for our new progressive game-changing 

methodologies including 3D scanning, 

AI and machine learning, data analytics 

and VR.  We also pushed for greater 

integration between the different 

platforms and technologies that have 

enabled our digitalisation journey, 

supported by our dedicated and fast-

growing digital delivery team.

We continue to observe and document 

positive results from our digitalisation 

efforts including:

• Better coordination between different 

project stakeholders and higher 

productivity achieved through 

redesigning conventional work 

processes around our use of BIM as 

the single-point-of-truth;

• More effective project management 

through Cloud-based, common data 

environment solutions.  For instance, 

the implementation of the Lean PlanDo 

app has improved project planning 

and tracking by aggregating all 

construction and scheduling data into 

a single platform;

• Better and faster decision-making in 

VDC, through our use of BIM and VR 

technology to simulate immersive 

virtual environments in life-size 

proportions;

• Better management and tracking 

of DfMA prefabricated elements 

under manufacturing, delivery and 

installation, and faster and better 

identification, tracking and remediation 

of defects through our customisation 

of mobile digital management 

solutions; and

validation through our use of 3D 

scanning, AI and machine learning, 

automation and drones.  Our 

collaboration with Airsquire – a startup 

specialising in image analytics for 

construction design – has helped 

automate the validation of construction 

progress scans against BIM, reduced 

inspection times by up to 40% 

compared to manual inspection 

methods and minimised updating 

errors in the final BIM.

During FY2020, our transformative 

methodologies were best displayed at 

our largest project on record for JTC 

Kranji Green (“Kranji Green”).  Extensive 

use of DfMA prefabrication for Kranji 

Green has demonstrated our capability 

to work with some of the largest DfMA 

prefabricated components involved in 

any industrial project.  We were able to 

achieve a very high level of IDD adoption 

within this project, which includes:

• Improving project planning 

and tracking by aggregating all 

construction and scheduling data into 

a single Cloud-based platform;

• Significantly optimising design 

approvals through virtual walkthroughs 

of BIM with projects stakeholders; and

• Working towards a digital operations 

and maintenance manual for the 

development, which will see the final 

as-built 7D BIM used for multi-decade 

facilities management – a first of its 

kind in Asia.

With significant investments in 

transformative technologies, we expect 

higher productivity, more effective 

project management, and better quality 

and defects management to ultimately 

translate into greater savings for our 

projects over the long-term.

3.4.2 Climate Change

Opening for signatures on 22 April 2016 

– Earth Day – at the UN Headquarters in 

New York, the Paris Agreement entered 

into force on 4 November 2016 and has 

been ratified by 189 out of 197 parties 

to the Convention to date.  The Paris 

Agreement brings together all nations 

in an extremely important common goal 

to combat climate change and adapt to 

its effects, with the aim of keeping global 

temperature rise this century at well 

below 2°C above pre-industrial levels 

and pursue efforts to limit temperature 

increase even further to 1.5°C.9   The 

Singapore Government ratified the Paris 

Agreement on 21 September 2016.

In line with this, we acknowledge 

that we have a shared responsibility 

as a responsible corporate citizen to 

work towards uplifting our business in 

material ESG topics, especially in relation 

to the building, construction and real 

estate industries.  Given the high energy 

intensity and emissions contributed by 

these industries, we aim to promote 

our smart eco-sustainable solutions as 

previously shown on pages 33 to 38.

As mentioned earlier, we provide smart 

eco-sustainable solutions that have the 

potential to directly influence and reduce 

energy loss, emissions, pollution, and 

energy and water consumption in some 

of the most energy-intensive sectors, and 

work towards the extremely important 

common goal to combat climate change, 

build climate resilience and protect our 

environment.

More information on our performance, 

policies and processes in relation to 

climate change will be shared in Section 

5 of this report.

In 2018, we secured Kranji Green, 

earmarked to achieve the Green Mark 

Platinum.  Kranji Green has been touted 

as one of the Singapore Government’s 

landmark projects to shift the nation 

increasingly towards the circular 

economy, where maximum value is 

extracted from resources through 

recovery, recycling and regeneration.  

With extremely limited space and landfill 

capacity – currently confined to Semakau 

Island – the Singapore Government 

has been reviewing major initiatives 

to boost recycling infrastructure in the 

most efficient and cost-effective manner.  

We are proud to be participating in a 

national project of strategic importance 

in Singapore’s contributions to combat 

climate change, build climate resilience, 

protect the natural environment and 

solve a pressing waste storage problem.

3.4.3 COVID-19 &amp; Infectious Disease 

Outbreaks

Shortly before the end of FY2020, the 

onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and 

its rapid spread in a very short period 

of time took the world by surprise, 

representing the greatest risk to the 

world in recent times.  While some 

countries have successfully contained 

COVID-19 through extremely strict 

lockdowns, safe distancing measures 

and travel restrictions, these countries 

remain in the minority, with many 

countries still struggling to contain 

COVID-19 and bring average daily 

infections under control.

COVID-19 is unlikely to be categorised 

as a megatrend.  However, the scale of 

the disruption caused by the pandemic 

already entails long-term implications 

for the world, from the strategies and

activities of governments, industries 

and organisations right through to 

communities and individuals, many who 

may be our stakeholders in countries 

where we operate.  Lessons from the 

pandemic are likely to be applied to 

the control of future infectious disease 

outbreaks.

In line with this, we acknowledge 

COVID-19 and infectious disease 

outbreaks as a material ESG topic, which 

is directly impacting our businesses and 

those of our stakeholders.

More information on our performance, 

policies and processes in relation to 

COVID-19 will be shared in Section 4 of 

this report.

3.5 FY2020 DIRECT ECONOMIC 

VALUE GENERATION &amp; 

DISTRIBUTION

Our continuous profitability every year 

has enabled us to reinvest in creating 

sustainable shared socio-economic 

value and delivering progress to key 

stakeholders, laying the cornerstones for 

our long-term success and longevity.

In FY2020, we generated S$425.7 million 

in direct economic value (“EV”), a 75% 

increase year-on-year as compared to 

S$243.0 million in FY2019, which was 

distributed among key stakeholders as 

shown on page 50.

We have built a fundamentally-sound 

balance sheet, reinvested in business 

expansions and our growing leasehold 

portfolio and continue to have the 

capability to make new acquisitions and 

investments.

Wholly-owned properties under our 

leasehold portfolio contribute relatively 

stable leasing revenue and profit that has 

gradually grown over time and provides a 

base to our financial performance, along 

with complementing our design-and-

build activities.

In the future, we expect jointly-owned 

properties under our investments in 

associated companies and joint ventures 

to grow as well and contribute to 

leasing profit, once major jointly-owned 

properties reach asset stabilisation.

FY2017 was our first complete financial 

year following our listing on the SGX 

Mainboard in April 2015 and also 

marked our inaugural dividend payments 

to shareholders.  Since then, we have 

made annual dividend payments to 

shareholders, which has continued for a 

fourth consecutive year.

Our five-year financial performance 

summary is shown on page 51.

INTRODUCTION

A PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE BUSINESS

An organisation is only as good as its 

people.  At Boustead Projects, this is 

absolutely true.

We are a knowledge-driven, business-

to-business and people-to-people 

organisation, where achieving our 

mission, vision and long-term objectives 

are highly dependent on the values, 

conduct and performance of our best 

asset – our team.

Our team is expected to demonstrate 

our five human-centric corporate 

values – integrity, professionalism, 

perseverance, flexibility and passion – 

in interactions with key stakeholders.  

Developing a high-performance team 

capable of delivering our technology-

driven engineered products and 

services, primarily smart eco-sustainable 

business park and industrial real 

estate solutions (“solutions”) aligned 

with our fundamental principles and 

strong human-centric corporate values, 

strengthens our trusted partnerships 

with client teams at many of the 

world’s best corporations, helping 

them to transform their industry, build 

their next stage of growth, derive true 

value from their sizeable investments 

and deliver direct economic value 

and environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) benefits to their key 

stakeholders, while keeping us at the 

forefront of the industry.

A client team’s project journey together 

with us typically lasts for over one 

year and is made up of thousands of 

interactions between key stakeholders, 

especially between our team and clients, 

strategic partners, suppliers, lenders, 

government agencies and regulators, all 

within a single project.  As our business 

ambassadors, our team is the first 

ranking enabler of developing trusted 

relationships with key stakeholders and 

the main contributor to our long-term 

success and longevity.  All systems, 

policies and processes (together “system 

enablers”) are there to support a high-

performance team capable of meeting 

the expectations of key stakeholders.

Being rooted in the enduring heritage of 

the Boustead Group, the Boustead Way 

and other fundamental principles have 

been passed down from generation to 

generation that continue to guide our 

daily actions and decisions.  We believe 

in acting honourably in the way that we 

conduct business and staying true to our 

strong human-centric corporate values.  

We have zero tolerance for accidents, 

bribery, corruption, fraud and violence.  

We do not condone the use of child or 

forced labour, whether at project sites 

under our direct control or project sites 

under our fabricators, subcontractors 

and suppliers (together “suppliers”)’s 

control.  We believe in providing our 

team with fair employment and human 

rights.

This section covers our Code of Conduct, 

Team Development Programme, positive 

work environment and supply chain 

management which are mainly derived 

from the combined depth of three 

capitals – intellectual, human, and social 

and relationship – and ultimately deliver 

positive net effects for all six capitals.  

In addition, the topic of COVID-19 and 

infectious disease outbreaks has been 

included.

INTRODUCTION

4.1 CODE OF CONDUCT

We are highly committed to building 

a climate of fairness, honesty, trust 

and sincerity with key stakeholders, 

beginning with our team’s honourable 

conduct.  Our Code of Conduct (“COC”) 

sets the foundation for our daily actions 

and decisions, and helps our team to 

adhere to the highest standards of 

honourable conduct.

Our team members are inducted in, 

updated on and expected to adhere to 

our COC as a condition of employment, 

with orientation briefings when new 

team members join, followed by annual 

acknowledgements and reviews of our 

COC.  Policies on anti-bribery and anti-

corruption (“ABAC”), fair dealing and 

competition, proper use of corporate 

positions and resources, confidentiality 

and privacy obligations, insider trading 

and whistle-blowing are covered in our 

COC, among other guidance areas on 

honourable conduct as shown here.

4.1.1 Anti-Bribery &amp; Anti-Corruption

We have zero tolerance for bribery and 

corruption.  We expect our team and all 

third parties whom we have business 

dealings with to comply with Singapore’s 

Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 

241) and all applicable ABAC laws 

and regulations in countries where 

we operate.  Our team members are 

bound by our ABAC Policy regardless of 

whether they are employed in Singapore, 

stationed overseas or employed outside 

of Singapore.  We may also be required 

to comply with applicable foreign 

ABAC laws and regulations imposed 

in business dealings with multinational 

clients who are headquartered in a 

foreign country where we have no 

operational presence.

4.1.2 Fair Dealing &amp; Competition

We engage only in fair and vigorous 

competition.  We expect our team 

members to fairly deal and interact 

with fellow team members, clients and 

competitors, and not to take unfair 

advantage of all third parties whom 

we have business dealings with.  This 

includes avoiding abuse of confidential 

or privileged information, concealment, 

illegal conduct, manipulation, 

misrepresentation of material facts, 

undue influence or any other unfair 

dealing practices.

4.1.3 Proper Use of Corporate 

Positions &amp; Resources

We expect our team members to 

apply and use corporate positions and 

resources in a responsible manner, 

which broadly includes duties to act in 

good faith and in our best interests as a 

whole.

4.1.4 Confidentiality, Data Protection 

&amp; Privacy

Information is a valuable asset, 

particularly in our knowledge-driven 

business model.  In the ordinary course 

of business, we may receive clients’ 

confidential data, in which case we may 

be subject to various non-disclosure 

agreements and confidentiality 

clauses.  Clients expect us to abide by 

confidentiality obligations, exposing 

us to a wide range of risks from non-

compliance.  In addition, we have to 

comply with Singapore’s Personal 

Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) that 

requires organisations that collect, use 

or disclose personal data to abide by 

PDPA requirements, again exposing 

us to a wide range of risks from non-

compliance.  We have also been 

briefed on the General Data Protection 

Regulation, which regulates the 

processing by any individual, corporation 

or organisation of personal data relating 

to individuals in the EU.

We are highly committed to adhering 

with all confidentiality obligations, 

applicable data protection, privacy laws 

and regulations in countries where we 

operate.  Our data protection and IT 

system enablers ensure that information 

assets are properly governed, managed 

and secured both in digital and physical 

environments.  This allows us to 

effectively comply with confidentiality, 

data protection and privacy obligations 

over the long-term.

FRAMEWORK

INTRODUCTION

In data protection, we have implemented 

a Data Protection Governance 

Framework (“DPG Framework”) that 

covers governance principles, structure 

and system enablers.  We opted for a 

governance structure with centralised 

formulation of system enablers and 

decentralised implementation of 

system enablers.  Our Data Protection 

Committee (“DPC”) comprising our 

senior management team, department 

heads and key executives has 

overall responsibility for the effective 

implementation of system enablers, 

while appointed Data Protection Officers 

(“DPOs”) coordinate activities.  Our DPOs 

also act as the external interface with the 

general public.  Other than our DPC and 

DPOs, team members are also briefed 

and trained to understand the PDPA 

and our DPG Framework including any 

department data and information flows 

that may require protection.

Policies for IT, information security, 

external data protection, internal data 

protection, document retention and 

third-party outsourcing are covered in 

our DPG Framework and reviewed by 

our senior management team and DPC 

at least once every two years.

In addition, we took a further step to 

implement an Information Security 

Management System (“ISMS”).  In 

2019, our major design-and-build 

subsidiary in Singapore, Boustead 

Projects E&amp;C (“BP E&amp;C”) first embarked 

on and received ISO/IEC 27001:2013 

certification.  Our ISMS sets out 

information security management 

system enablers, commitments, targets 

and responsibilities for our team, with 

joint overriding responsibility belonging 

to our IT, Human Resource (“HR”) 

and Environmental, Health and Safety 

(“EHS”) Teams.  Our IT, HR and EHS 

Teams manage all aspects of our ISMS 

which is both externally and internally 

audited, and ensure information security 

management performance at all of our 

workplaces and project sites under 

control on a daily basis.

During FY2020, we had no substantiated 

complaints on breaches of client privacy, 

which was the same in FY2018 and 

FY2019.

4.1.5 Insider Trading

We expect our team members with 

access to price-sensitive information to 

comply with Singapore’s Securities &amp; 

Futures Act (Chapter 289) and insider 

trading laws and regulations.  Team 

members with access to price-sensitive 

information are not allowed to trade 

in Boustead Projects’ securities on 

short-term considerations and in the 

one month before half-year and full-

year financial results announcements, 

ending only after release of relevant 

announcements.  Team members are 

reminded on a semi-annual basis to 

comply with trading black-out periods 

and insider trading laws and regulations.

4.1.6 Whistle-Blowing Mechanism

Implemented in 2008, our whistle-

blowing mechanism allows our team 

members and all third parties to 

raise and report in good faith and in 

confidence, any concerns about possible 

misconduct in financial reporting matters 

or suspected bribery, corruption, fraud 

and dishonourable conduct.  Procedures 

are in place to ensure that whistle-

blowers are protected.

More information on our Whistle-Blowing 

Policy is available within the Boustead 

Projects FY2020 Annual Report on page 

80.

During FY2020, we had no reported 

incidents of whistle-blowing.

COC violations will result in appropriate 

disciplinary actions being taken against 

the violating team member including 

potential dismissal and referral to legal 

authorities for serious violations that may 

be illegal.  A compliance plan sets forth 

how our COC is to be implemented and 

monitored including how violations are 

detected, reported and investigated, as 

well as follow-up actions to be taken.

4.2 TEAM DEVELOPMENT 

PROGRAMME

The purpose of our Team Development 

Programme (“TDP”) is to attract, 

develop, motivate and retain team 

members with values, attitudes, skillsets 

and work practices aligned with our 

mission, vision, strong human-centric 

corporate values and high-performance 

team culture.  Our TDP is structured 

to create a work environment that 

promotes creativity, excitement and 

growth, and make team members feel 

cared for, challenged, empowered 

and respected.  Our TDP sets out 

human resource management (“HRM”) 

system enablers, commitments, targets 

and responsibilities for our team, 

with implementation responsibility 

belonging to our HR Team headed by 

our Deputy Director of HR, a member of 

our management team.  Our HR Team 

provides HRM leadership and support to 

all subsidiaries regionally.

We have always embraced diversity in 

our team, a trait we inherited from the 

Boustead Group.  This diversity has not 

just been in terms of gender balance but 

also in age, race, religion, marital status, 

family responsibilities, work experience 

and nationality, with a multi-cultural 

and multi-faceted team mainly from 

Singapore and other parts of South East 

Asia.

During FY2020, our overall team size 

grew 29% or 63 team members to 277 

team members, compared to 214 team 

members in FY2019, the breakdown 

as shown on page 57.  Most of the 

overall growth year-on-year was due to 

significant increases in team sizes for 

our design-and-build business across 

Singapore, China and Malaysia, and real 

estate business in Singapore.

The overall team gender balance ratio 

deteriorated 3% year-on-year, with 

female team members making up 29% 

of our overall team, which was in the 

mid-range of the comparable industries 

(between 20% to 30%) gender balance 

average but below the Asia Pacific (34%) 

and global (36%) averages in 2019.  In 

terms of the managerial gender balance 

ratio, female team members made 

up 16% of our total managerial team 

members, which was in the mid-range 

of the comparable industries (between 

10% to 20%) senior management gender 

balance average, compared favourably 

to the Asia Pacific (14%) average but 

below the global (21%) average in 2019.1

4.2.1 Talent Attraction

As part of our TDP, we are highly 

committed to complying with 

Singapore’s Employment Act and 

all applicable employment laws and 

regulations in countries where we 

operate.  We are further committed 

to fair, responsible and progressive 

employment practices and strive to 

adopt the latest HRM best practices, 

which is essential to attracting the 

right talent to contribute to our long-

term success and longevity.  Our team 

members are considered to be employed 

by us only within the context and terms 

of their employment contracts.

a) The Employers’ Pledge of Fair 

Employment Practices

Singapore’s Tripartite Alliance for Fair 

&amp; Progressive Employment Practices 

(“TAFEP”) promotes the adoption 

of fair, responsible and progressive 

employment practices among 

employers, employees and the general 

public. Boustead Projects E&amp;C, our 

principal design-and-build subsidiary 

and also the management services 

arm of the Boustead Projects Group is 

among the over 11,000 signatories to 

the TAFEP’s Employers’ Pledge of Fair 

Employment Practices (“Pledge”).2

Under the Pledge, we have committed to 

work towards fair employment practices 

including:

• Recruiting and selecting employees on 

the basis of merit, regardless of age, 

race, gender, religion, marital status 

and family responsibilities or disability;

• Treating employees fairly and with 

respect, and implementing progressive 

HRM systems;

• Providing employees with fair 

opportunity to be considered for 

training and development based on 

their strengths and needs to help them 

achieve their full potential;

• Rewarding employees fairly based on 

their ability, performance, contribution 

and experience; and

• Complying with the labour laws and 

adopting the Tripartite Guidelines on 

Fair Employment Practices.

Apart from the Pledge, we promote 

gender equality at the workplace.  

In terms of talent attraction, this 

means that we offer the same basic 

remuneration package to all interviewing 

job candidates for a specific role and 

scope, regardless of gender or whether 

a job candidate has served Singapore’s 

mandatory national service.

b) Other Talent Attraction Practices

We generally advertise available 

positions both externally and 

internally, although recruitment for 

certain sensitive key positions may 

be conducted anonymously through 

professional recruitment agencies.  

Where possible, we seek to employ 

citizens from countries where we 

operate.  Since 2014, we have also 

adhered to Singapore’s Ministry of 

Manpower (“MOM”)’s Fair Consideration 

Framework that requires available 

positions – unless exempted – to be 

advertised on MyCareersFuture for at 

least 14 days, thereby giving citizens fair 

and non-discriminatory consideration for 

all job opportunities before hiring foreign 

professionals to fill these positions.3

INTRODUCTION

Adding to our potential talent pool, 

through Boustead Singapore Limited, we 

are one of 16 sponsoring organisations 

within the engineering industry 

participating in the Singapore-Industry 

Scholarship (“SgIS”) Programme.4 

Launched in 2012 and co-funded by 

both the Singapore Government and 

private sector organisations, Boustead 

Singapore Limited is a founding 

private sector organisation within the 

SgIS, a multi-industry undergraduate 

scholarship programme that aims to 

groom future Singaporean industry 

leaders in strategic sectors that are 

critical for the country’s development.  

To date, we have given scholarships to 

three individuals, all of whom have since 

completed their local university degree 

programmes and joined us in full-time 

capacities.

As mentioned earlier, during FY2020, 

we experienced 29% growth year-on-

year in overall team size, significantly 

above year-on-year increases in both 

Singapore’s comparable industries 

(2.7%) and national (1.9%) employment 

averages in 2019.  Similarly, our team 

monthly hiring rate of 4.8% compared 

favourably with both Singapore’s 

comparable industries (2.3%) and 

national (2.2%) monthly hiring averages 

in 2019, as shown here.5  Our growth in 

overall team size was led by the hiring of

57% overall team hires rate, compared 

to 131 new team members equating to 

a 76% overall team hires rate in FY2019, 

the breakdown as shown on page 59.  

Most new team members joined our 

design-and-build teams in Singapore, 

China and Malaysia, and real estate 

team in Singapore, where business 

activities have been steadily increasing, 

especially in relation to the capturing of a 

record high S$633 million in design-and-

build contracts and strong pipeline of 

development projects in FY2019.

4.2.2 Talent Development, 

Management and Retention

As part of our TDP, we embrace 

a holistic talent development, 

management and retention strategy. 

a) Conditions of Employment

We believe in treating our team fairly, 

with respect and an entitlement to 

human rights.  We offer conditions of 

employment and benefits that are in 

line with applicable employment laws 

and regulations, and prevailing market 

practices in countries where we operate 

including:

INTRODUCTION

packages, team members also receive 

our payments to defined contribution 

plans.  Salary benchmarking exercises 

are also conducted to ensure that 

remuneration packages are equitable 

with what the industry offers.

There is a profit sharing bonus scheme 

for eligible full-time team members that 

is pegged to a predetermined formula 

based on our overall and respective 

subsidiaries’ financial performance.  

Individual bonus payments and annual 

salary increments are determined after 

each team member’s performance 

appraisal (“appraisal”) is objectively 

assessed by our senior management 

team.

There is also a Boustead Projects 

Restricted Share Plan 2016 (“RSP”) that 

incentivises key team members to work 

towards department and individual key 

performance indicators (“KPIs”) and 

helps to align their interests with our 

long-term success.  Team members who 

are selected to participate under the RSP 

and subsequently meet their KPIs for a 

specific financial year may be eligible 

to receive Boustead Projects’ shares, 

which are vested and issued in tranches 

over four years.  More information on the 

RSP and earlier restricted share plans 

is available in the Boustead Projects 

FY2020 Annual Report on pages 55 to 

56, 72 to 76, 119 and 143.

During FY2020, we distributed a total of 

S$23.7 million in direct economic value 

to our team, a 35% increase year-on-year 

compared to S$17.5 million in FY2019.

c) Performance Appraisal

As part of our TDP, full-time team 

members are appraised at least 

once a year under our Performance 

Management System (“PMS”), with 

the exception of team members who 

are re-employed beyond the statutory 

retirement age, have resigned, are 

serving notice or under probation during 

the relevant appraisal period.  Team 

members who are under probation 

will receive a confirmation appraisal 

at their time of confirmation.  Team 

members are evaluated on their 

achievement of quantitative department 

and individual KPIs and qualitative 

skillset competencies relevant to their 

respective roles and scope, which are 

defined and set at the beginning of the 

period under review.

Team members who consistently 

outperform are offered opportunities 

to take up higher challenges, while 

team members who underperform 

are assisted in identifying and 

addressing the root causes behind their 

underperformance.   Our PMS allows 

us to identify team members with high 

leadership potential, feeding into our 

Succession Planning System (“SPS”).

INTRODUCTION

Whenever possible, we promote team 

members internally into available 

senior positions.  In addition, our Team 

Recognition Programme includes long 

service awards and specific achievement 

awards given to recognise project 

teams and individual team members 

for excellent achievements and 

performance in specific areas.

During FY2020, 74% of our team 

received appraisals, a slight 

improvement compared to 72% in 

FY2019, the breakdown as shown 

here.  However, this was still lower 

than FY2018, due to having a much 

larger proportion of team members 

who were under probation at the end 

of FY2020.  There was no difference in 

the percentage of appraisals conducted 

by gender, while the percentage of 

appraisals conducted for executive team 

members significantly improved year-

on-year, compared to managerial team 

members.

d) Communication &amp; Engagement

We encourage open communication 

and engagement.  With an open door 

policy, our team members may provide 

feedback or raise concerns with direct 

supervisors and our senior management 

team.  Appraisals also provide team 

members with an opportunity to 

provide and receive feedback on their 

performance and any other important 

matters.

As part of our communication and 

engagement, we strive to organise 

townhall sessions on at least an annual 

basis, serving as an organisation-wide 

communication session between our 

senior management team and team 

members.  Townhall sessions are 

typically facilitated by external trainers 

and include team-building activities to 

promote cohesion and teamwork.  For 

FY2020, our townhall session which 

was scheduled for the end of FY2020 

was cancelled due to the onset of the 

COVID-19 pandemic.

We have procedures to address and as 

much as possible, satisfactorily resolve 

team members’ grievances.  This is 

complemented by our whistle-blowing 

mechanism.

e)  Career Development &amp; Training 

Opportunities

We have pledged to provide our team 

members with equal opportunity to be 

considered for career development and 

training based on their strengths and 

needs, and to help them to achieve their 

full potential.  We aim to nurture and 

professionally develop team members 

by investing in their career development 

and training, offering them growth 

opportunities through promotions, job 

rotations and overseas assignments.  

Team members can also upgrade 

skillsets and are generally encouraged to 

undergo professional training that may 

help their performance.  This includes 

sponsoring or subsidising the cost of 

approved career development and 

training courses, and may also include 

granting paid leave to attend these 

courses.

We also have an Education Assistance 

Scheme under which we may sponsor 

team members who desire to attend 

job-related courses on their own initiative 

and for personal development.  While 

we identify the career development and 

training needs of team members at least 

once a year during appraisals, we also 

assess such needs on an ad-hoc basis.

As we continue to pioneer new solutions 

and make investments in procuring 

and implementing transformative 

technologies, methodologies and system 

enablers, we have also made necessary 

investments in training team members 

so that they can realise the full benefits 

of these transformative technologies, 

some of which are shown on page 61.

FRAMEWORK

INTRODUCTION

With the COVID-19 pandemic 

and technological advancements 

accelerating the pace of disruption and 

shortening business cycles, we believe 

that investments in training need to be 

adaptable, flexible and timely.

During FY2020, our team underwent a 

total of 1,896 training hours, compared 

to 2,241 hours in FY2019, the breakdown 

as shown here.  This equated to an 

average of 7.5 hours per team member 

in FY2020, a significant deterioration 

year-on-year compared to 13.0 hours 

per team member in FY2019.  There 

was only a slight difference in average 

hours by gender.  While training was 

emphasised across our team, especially 

with newer team members – many of 

them at the executive level – in order to 

familiarise them with our transformative 

technologies, methodologies and system 

enablers, the significant deterioration 

year-on-year in average hours per 

managerial and executive team member 

also coincided with the hiring of new 

team members with greater working 

experience.

f) Health &amp; Wellness

Other than the conditions of employment 

and benefits mentioned earlier, we 

have also implemented team wellness 

programmes including sponsorships and 

subsidies for selected social, sports and 

recreational activities, health screening 

sessions and health talks.  In addition, 

other types of lunchtime talk sessions 

on various topics of interest have been 

organised on a regular basis.

During FY2020, our team members took 

a total of 986 medical leave days due to 

sickness or hospitalisation, compared to 

241 days in FY2019, the breakdown as 

shown on page 62.  This equated to an 

average of 3.9 days per team member 

in FY2020, a significant increase year-

on-year as compared to 1.4 days per 

team member in FY2019.  None of 

this medical leave was in relation to 

workplace safety and health incidents 

or occupational diseases among team 

members at administrative offices 

and project sites.  15 team members 

received hospitalisation leave given for 

non-workplace-related health issues, 

accounting for 30% of the total medical 

leave days.  There was also a major non-

workplace safety and health incident, 

with long medical leave given in the 

case.

g) Employment Beyond Statutory 

Retirement Age

We may offer our team members 

re-employment beyond Singapore’s 

statutory retirement age of 62 years, 

as guided by applicable laws and 

regulations, and our policies on 

retirement and re-employment.  Any 

re-employment and extension of re-

employment depends on whether a 

retiring team member’s services are 

required, the team member is medically 

certified to be fit for employment and is

INTRODUCTION

able to perform at an acceptable level.  In 

general, we try to provide re-employment 

whenever possible, given that retiring 

team members have decades of 

experience and can still be highly 

productive and motivated.

During FY2020, we had four team 

members under re-employment beyond 

the statutory retirement age equating to 

2% of our overall team size, which was 

the same in FY2019.

h) Succession Planning

We recognise that having adequate 

succession planning is a key priority and 

essential to our business continuity.  We 

have a SPS for our senior management 

team and key executives.  Core 

leadership positions are covered by 

deputies or experienced potential 

replacements, who are identified 

through our PMS as being team 

members with high leadership potential 

to be developed and nurtured into next-

generation leaders.

At the end of FY2020, 100% of our senior 

management team and key executive 

positions – a total of 11 team members 

– were covered by a named deputy or 

designated successor, which was the 

same in FY2018 and FY2019, as shown 

here.  Our Managing Director also had at 

least two named deputies or designated 

successors.

i) Termination of Employment &amp; 

Turnover

Our team members are entitled to 

compensation according to severance 

clauses in their employment contracts 

if we terminate their services.  Under 

all circumstances, we seek to ensure 

that any termination of employment is 

conducted in a fair and lawful manner.  

We have also implemented procedures 

to ensure that affected team members 

are properly compensated and may also 

receive job placements or other forms 

of assistance in addition to monetary 

compensation if we retrench them.

As with any corporation, we have not 

been spared from natural attrition and 

turnover of team members.  During 

FY2020, we had turnover of 75 team 

members equating to a 30% overall team 

turnover rate, compared to 56 team 

members equating to a 33% overall team 

turnover rate in FY2019, the breakdown 

as shown on page 63.  Despite our 

rapidly expanding team experiencing 

some new team members leave shortly 

after joining, our team monthly turnover 

rate showed significant improvement 

from FY2018 to FY2020 but remained 

slightly above both Singapore’s 

comparable industries (1.8%) and 

national (1.8%) monthly turnover 

averages in 2019.

4.3 CREATING A POSITIVE WORK 

ENVIRONMENT

We are highly committed to creating a 

positive work environment, where we 

are able to safeguard the wellbeing, 

health and safety of our team, clients, 

suppliers and other key stakeholders 

and make them feel comfortable, safe 

and secure within and around our 

operations internationally.  Our positive 

work environment is designed and 

organised to be conducive for delivering 

our solutions in a productive, safe and 

secure manner, and facilitating positive 

interactions with key stakeholders, 

along with meeting applicable laws 

and regulations in countries where we 

operate.

4.3.1 Workplace Health &amp; Safety 

Above All

Of utmost importance, we care deeply 

about safeguarding the wellbeing of 

our team, beginning with our workplace 

safety and health (“WSH”) management 

performance and system enablers 

that apply to our team and all key 

stakeholders who are affected by our 

operations internationally.

From a WSH standpoint, the United 

Nations’ International Labour 

Organization has estimated that there 

are over 2.78 million deaths every year 

due to occupational accidents and 

work-related diseases.  In addition, there 

are 374 million non-fatal occupational 

accidents and work-related diseases, 

many which result in extended work 

absences.  The human cost of this daily 

adversity is vast with the economic 

burden of poor WSH practices costing 

an estimated 3.94% of GDP each year.6

In Singapore, although the incidence of 

occupational accidents, fatalities and 

diseases are much lower than the global 

average, the local construction industry 

remains a major contributor to such 

incidents, with the industry having the 

highest number of fatalities in 2019.

As part of our WSH Management 

System (“WSHMS”), we first embarked 

on SS506 Part 1:2009 and OHSAS 

18001:2007 certifications in 2006 and 

have had a WSHMS in place ever since.  

During FY2020, our major design-and-

build subsidiary in Singapore, Boustead 

Projects E&amp;C (“BP E&amp;C”) received an 

upgraded certification to the latest ISO 

45001:2018 standard.

Our WSHMS sets out WSH management 

system enablers, commitments, targets 

and responsibilities for our team, with 

overriding responsibility belonging to 

our Environmental, Health and Safety 

(“EHS”) Team headed by our Director 

of EHS, a member of our senior 

management team.  Our EHS Team 

manages all aspects of our WSHMS

INTRODUCTION

which is both externally and internally 

audited, and ensures WSH management 

performance at all workplaces and 

project sites under our control on a daily 

basis.

We have zero tolerance for accidents 

and are committed to saving lives 

through safe work.  This is encapsulated 

in our safety slogan ‘Safe Work, Save 

Lives’ which has become a daily mantra 

among team members and suppliers 

who undertake work at our project sites.  

Although we outsource construction 

trades to suppliers and do not directly 

hire any construction workers, we take 

responsibility to ensure their wellbeing, 

health and safety at our project sites and 

the general public’s wellbeing, health 

and safety in the communities around 

our project sites.

Through our Total WSH Policy, we are 

committed to:

• Preventing injury and ill health for our 

team, workers and key stakeholders at 

our project sites;

• Complying with applicable legal 

requirements and with other 

requirements relating to WSH hazards;

• Creating better wellbeing and 

health for our team, workers and key 

stakeholders at our workplaces;

• Providing sufficient and appropriate 

resources to carry out the 

implementation of our WSHMS to 

ensure sustainable WSH standards for 

our team, workers and stakeholders at 

our project sites; and

• Continuous improvement in WSH 

management and performance.

Our WSHMS is supported by 

investments in technologies.  Internally, 

we developed an Integrated Boustead 

Online Safety System (“iBOSS”), 

which provides us with a centralised 

platform to manage all permit-to-work 

applications and safety induction course 

bookings.  Through digitalisation, 

iBOSS has replaced time-consuming 

administrative processes and provides 

us with data governance, traceability 

and tracking capabilities in documenting 

administrative and safety records.  The 

current iteration of iBOSS also includes 

a biometric facial recognition system 

used to administer project site access 

and security.  Further technologies are 

in the process of being implemented 

or have already been implemented due 

to the COVID-19 pandemic and will be 

shared in more detail under the topic 

of COVID-19 and infectious disease 

outbreaks.

The tone for WSH performance is set at 

the top, where our senior management 

team ‘walks the talk’ when it comes 

to prioritising WSH issues and system 

enablers.  In terms of engagement, a 

monthly safety management meeting is 

conducted with our senior management 

team, EHS Team, all WSH professionals 

and project site teams.  Weekly safety 

management meetings are also 

conducted with our EHS Team engaging 

with respective project site safety 

committees and WSH professionals on 

safety inspections.  WSH professionals 

also carry out daily project site toolbox 

talks and safety inspections with the 

safety supervisors from all suppliers.

Specific measurable WSH targets are set 

under our WSHMS, which are tracked 

and reviewed at least during monthly 

safety management meetings.  While 

our perpetual WSH target is to achieve 

zero accidents or safety incidents at all 

workplaces and project sites, we also 

set short-term WSH targets to address 

adverse safety trends.  Our current short-

term WSH targets include eliminating 

incidence of personnel or objects falling 

from height.

4.3.2 Continuous WSH Education &amp; 

Training

Nowhere else do we emphasise 

continuous education and training more 

than in WSH education and training, 

in order to immerse our team and key 

stakeholders in the right WSH culture 

and improve our WSH performance.

Our training programmes include a 

Centralised Safety &amp; Quality Induction 

Training Course conducted for team 

members, suppliers and visitors to our 

project sites and an Enhanced Safety 

Induction Course in partnership with 

external training centres to provide 

safety training in relation to working at 

heights awareness for team members 

and suppliers.

Our EHS Team, WSH professionals and 

project site teams have the responsibility 

of ensuring that suppliers conduct 

appropriate in-house safety training for 

their workers before deploying them to 

our project sites and that such training 

is properly documented.  We also 

have a Safety Awareness Promotion 

Programme that gives widespread 

recognition to the efforts of WSH 

professionals, safety supervisors, 

suppliers and workers in achieving WSH 

milestones.

Continuing our WSH performance in 

FY2020, we had no reportable accidents 

or safety incidents at our administrative 

workplaces, and zero fatalities, high 

consequence injuries and occupational 

disease incidents within our team 

and suppliers’ employees across our 

operations, which was the same in 

FY2018 and FY2019, as shown on page 

65.  Our accident frequency rate (“AFR”) 

and accident severity rate (“ASR”) for our 

team and suppliers of 0.5 accidents and 

12 lost man days per million man-hours 

respectively also compared favourably 

with both Singapore’s comparable 

industries (AFR of 1.5 accidents and ASR 

of 117 lost man days per million man-

hours) and national (AFR of 1.6 accidents 

and ASR of 66 lost man days per million 

man-hours) AFR and ASR averages in

4.3.3 bizSAFE Mentorship

In 2008, we initiated our participation in 

Singapore’s Workplace Safety &amp; Health 

Council (“WSHC”)’s bizSAFE Programme 

by becoming a bizSAFE Partner.  In 

2009, we achieved the bizSAFE Star, the 

highest qualification that can be attained 

in recognition of a corporation’s WSH 

management programmes.

By 2011, we opted to take a national 

leadership role in advocating and 

promoting excellent WSH practices in 

the construction industry by becoming 

a bizSAFE Mentor; currently one of only 

eight bizSAFE Mentors in Singapore 

and the only one among our direct 

competitors.8  bizSAFE Mentors are 

corporations that have excellent WSH 

performance and track records, and are 

qualified and invited only by the WSHC 

to take this national leadership role.  

bizSAFE Mentors incorporate WSH as 

an integral part of their business model 

that benefits the wider community and 

also actively work with the WSHC to 

promote the WSH agenda on various 

industry and national platforms.  As a 

bizSAFE Mentor, we have been one 

of the key contributors in helping the 

bizSAFE Community to expand from 

10,000 corporations in 2011 to over 

33,000 corporations presently.9

As part of our WSH advocacy and 

promotion efforts, and uplifting the WSH 

practices of the construction industry as 

a whole, we have made it compulsory 

for all of our suppliers to be part of 

the bizSAFE Programme and further 

encourage them to strive for bizSAFE 

Star, the highest qualification achievable.  

Excellent WSH performance is priceless 

when all lives are safeguarded and when 

people everywhere go home safely to 

their families from their workplaces 

everyday.

Continuing our WSH advocacy and 

promotion efforts in FY2020, 100% of 

our suppliers are certified as at least 

bizSAFE Level 3, while 81% of our 

suppliers are certified as bizSAFE Star as 

shown here.

4.3.4 WSH Awards

We are a regular feature at the WSH 

Awards, an annual awards programme 

hosted by the WSHC and MOM to 

recognise excellent WSH performance.

During FY2020 at the WSH Awards 

2019 held in July 2019, we received the 

Safety &amp; Health Award Recognition for 

Projects (“SHARP”) for Bolloré Blue Hub 

and Veolia Hazardous Chemical Waste 

Treatment Complex.

To date, our excellent WSH performance 

has been recognised with the highest 

achievements under the bizSAFE 

Programme and 20 awards at the WSH 

Awards as shown on page 67.

4.4 SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

We are committed to managing the 

impacts and risks associated with our 

supply chain.  Supplier-related impacts 

and risks are identified, addressed 

and managed under our various 

management systems, Enterprise Risk 

Management Framework, internal 

controls, and external and internal audits.

Our procurement includes products and 

services from a network of suppliers 

regionally based on a list of approved 

suppliers for various construction 

equipment services, materials and trade 

services.  Supplier costs and other 

construction costs typically make up the 

bulk of our total cost of sales.

Operationally, we manage our 

procurement through our procurement 

system enablers and list of approved 

suppliers, which are subject to regular 

review as well as external and internal 

audits.

Potential new suppliers are evaluated on 

their reputation, technology solutions, 

financial health, operations, quality 

and EHS performance for inclusion on 

our list of approved suppliers.  Existing 

suppliers are regularly evaluated on their 

bizSAFE Programme

upkeep of their holistic performance with 

routine engagement and inspections 

throughout projects.  As mentioned 

earlier, all suppliers are required to attain 

at least a bizSAFE Level 3 in order to 

qualify for our list of approved suppliers. 

We also ensure that approved suppliers 

are inducted in our Green &amp; Gracious 

Programme, which is shown on pages 

73 to 74.

Supplier violations of our holistic 

standards will result in appropriate 

disciplinary actions taken against 

violating suppliers including potential 

permanent removal from our list of 

approved suppliers and referral to legal 

authorities for serious violations that may 

be illegal in nature.  On the other hand, 

suppliers that display performance that 

consistently meets our expectations 

may receive reward points that can be 

used to bolster their bids to us on future 

projects, thereby incentivising good 

performance.

During FY2020, we distributed a total of 

S$369.9 million in direct economic value 

to suppliers, a 97% increase year-on-

year as compared to S$187.4 million in 

FY2019.

4.5 COVID-19 &amp; INFECTIOUS 

DISEASE OUTBREAKS

Shortly before the end of FY2020, the 

onset of the COVID-19 pandemic took 

place and impacted all of our operations 

regionally.

The scale of the disruption caused by 

the pandemic already entails long-term 

implications for the world, from the 

strategies and activities of governments, 

industries and organisations right 

through to communities and individuals, 

many who may be our key stakeholders 

in countries where we operate.  Lessons 

from the pandemic are likely to be 

applied to the control of future infectious 

disease outbreaks.

In line with this, we acknowledge 

COVID-19 and infectious disease 

outbreaks as a material ESG topic, which 

is directly impacting our businesses and 

key stakeholders.

We explain how the pandemic has 

impacted our operations, as well as 

the measures we have implemented to 

mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on 

our operations and key stakeholders.

INTRODUCTION

4.5.1 Singapore Government’s 

COVID-19 Circuit Breaker

Although taking place shortly after 

the end of FY2020, the Singapore 

Government’s COVID-19 Circuit Breaker 

(“Circuit Breaker”) from 7 April 2020 

to 1 June 2020 deserves discussion in 

this report.  The Circuit Breaker saw the 

suspension of all non-essential business 

activities in Singapore – including our 

own – which resulted in the closure of 

our headquarters and project sites in 

Singapore.  Similar prolonged lockdowns 

took place in all countries where we 

operate, resulting in the closure of all 

administrative offices regionally for 

different periods of time.  The situation 

was aggravated by the suspension of 

almost all construction activities at our 

Singapore project sites during the Circuit 

Breaker, followed by further post-Circuit 

Breaker delays due to the phased 

resumption of the built environment 

sector administered by the Building &amp; 

Construction Authority (“BCA”).  This has 

resulted in at least four months of delay 

per project, which is already impacting 

our design-and-build performance for 

FY2021.  While all of our Singapore 

project sites have resumed work, further 

delays to the projects may be expected 

as productivity has been affected by 

compliance with strict safe management 

measures, especially the BCA’s COVID-

Safe Restart Criteria, along with a serious 

shortage of foreign worker resources – a 

problem affecting Singapore’s entire 

built environment sector due to the high 

infection levels in dormitories housing 

foreign workers.  We will continue to 

work closely with the BCA and relevant 

authorities to ensure the wellbeing, 

health and safety of all stakeholders as 

we resume and scale up operations.

As expected, delays in revenue 

conversion have materially lowered 

our design-and-build performance for 

FY2021 year-to-date and have also 

resulted in associated acceleration, 

compliance, prolongation and 

resumption costs.  The full quantum 

of costs associated with these delays 

cannot be reasonably determined at this 

point given the fluidity of the COVID-19 

situation and our ongoing assessment 

of contractual obligations with clients 

and suppliers, as well as potential partial 

mitigation provided by the Singapore 

Government’s COVID-19 business 

support and relief measures.

Notwithstanding the closure of our 

headquarters and project sites regionally 

during the Circuit Breaker and other 

lockdowns occurring elsewhere in the 

world, we were able to successfully 

execute our business continuity activities 

and securely conduct business activities 

remotely – except for construction 

activities – through secure Cloud-based 

technology platforms, virtual private 

network (“VPN”), telecommuting and 

work-from-home (“WFH”) arrangements, 

enabling continuous collaboration not 

just between team members but also 

with most key stakeholders.

4.5.2 Health Safeguards &amp; First 

COVID-19 Infections

Almost at the immediate onset of the 

pandemic, we had already implemented 

robust health safeguards across our 

administrative offices and project 

sites including compulsory health and 

travel declarations, health screening 

procedures, twice-a-day temperature 

monitoring, safe distancing of at least 

one metre apart in all workplace settings, 

suspension of all mass activities and 

meetings, and compartmentalisation 

of construction trades at project 

sites.  Following the end of the Circuit 

Breaker, we implemented additional 

health safeguards to further align with 

additional safe management measures 

as mandated by Singapore’s Ministry 

of Health, MOM and BCA.  Our key 

health safeguards which have been 

implemented are shown on page 69.

Despite our robust health safeguards, 

we were not spared from cases of 

COVID-19 infection among our suppliers’ 

employees.  In February 2020, at our 

Seletar Aerospace Park project site 

for Bombardier Singapore Service 

Centre Phase 2, we immediately halted 

construction activities and proceeded 

with full disinfection activities after the 

detection of a COVID-19 infection of 

a supplier’s employee working onsite, 

with four more supplier’s employees 

subsequently testing positive for 

infections shortly afterwards.  We are 

heartened to share that all five of these 

suppliers’ employees have subsequently 

recovered, with the first detected 

case having bravely battled through 

two months in the intensive care unit 

and spending a total of five months in 

hospital.  He was finally discharged at the 

end of June 2020, an acknowledgement 

of his enduring willpower to live, 

supported by Singapore’s high-quality 

healthcare system and under the care of 

extremely proficient frontline healthcare 

professionals.

4.5.3 Direct Impacts of COVID-19

The direct impacts of COVID-19 and 

potential financial implications on our 

operations are shown on page 70.

4.5.4 Mitigating Direct Impacts of 

COVID-19

Apart from the health safeguards 

mentioned earlier, we continue to 

proactively implement strategic 

measures to safeguard the wellbeing, 

health and safety of our stakeholders, 

mitigate the impact of project delays 

and protect the viability and long-

term value of our businesses.  These 

measures are aimed at developing 

resilience and include the execution of 

our business continuity activities, cost 

management measures, supply chain

management measures and technology 

implementations, as shown here.

Other mitigation measures include 

our efforts to geographically diversify, 

yielding a handful of new projects in 

China, Malaysia and Vietnam.  Shortly 

after the end of FY2020, we secured 

a significant contract in terms of 

scope and size to design-and-build 

an advanced integrated high-tech 

manufacturing and office facility in 

Penang for a Fortune 500 technology 

corporation.  Our new client was highly 

impressed by our safety track record, 

safe work practices and adoption of 

transformative technologies including 

the use of integrated digital delivery and 

building information modelling (“BIM”) 

to significantly shorten the project 

timeframe – technologies not commonly 

deployed by Malaysia’s construction 

industry – which allowed our core team 

in Singapore to secure the contract from 

decision-makers in Malaysia and the US, 

even as all three countries remained in 

lockdowns or partial lockdowns at the 

time the contract was secured.

4.5.5 Additional Business Support 

Measures

The Singapore Government’s COVID-19 

business support and relief measures 

have also provided us with much-needed 

partial relief, particularly through the 

Jobs Support Scheme (“JSS”) and foreign 

worker levy waivers and rebates.

The JSS will provide wage support to 

cover 75% of wages, with a S$4,600 

wage ceiling for eligible team members – 

Singaporeans and permanent residents 

– in the built environment sector from 

April 2020 to October 2020, with wage 

support subsequently lowering to 30% of 

wages up to March 2021.10

The BCA also announced additional 

support measures for the built 

environment sector including co-

funding certain safe management 

implementations.  In addition, the 

Singapore Government will continue 

to bear the costs of COVID-19 testing 

for the built environment sector until 31 

March 2021.11

4.5.6 Future Infectious Disease 

Outbreaks

We will continue to safeguard the 

wellbeing of key stakeholders through 

this pandemic, and adapt to and evolve 

in the ‘new normal’, whatever that 

may be.  Our measures to mitigate the 

impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic 

have been integrated into our business 

continuity activities and operations so 

that these measures can be applied 

to manage future infectious disease 

outbreaks.

PLANET EARTH

For all global stakeholders and all known 

life, Earth is our collective home and 

the only home we know.  Nature in all 

forms – both organic and inorganic – is 

the nurturer and provider of all that is 

necessary to sustain life.  Over the past 

two centuries, the world’s population 

has grown exponentially with one billion 

people1 when the Boustead Group was 

first established in 1828 to 7.7 billion 

people today and an expected 8.5 billion 

people by 2030.2   This has placed 

tremendous resource strains on our 

planet’s natural ecosystem.

Furthermore, close to four billion people 

live in urban centres and this is expected 

to increase to five billion people by 2030.  

Rapid urbanisation will lead to enormous 

challenges in government planning 

across all infrastructure, economic and 

environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) facets.

INTRODUCTION

Simultaneously, climate change – 

driven by greenhouse gas emissions 

contributed by human activities 

and agreed upon by 97% of actively 

publishing climate scientists3  – 

continues to result in natural disasters 

and extreme weather events that have 

disrupted national economies and 

hurt lives, people, communities and 

countries.4   Tackling these complex 

issues has been further complicated by 

the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accompanying expected rapid 

urbanisation, demand for construction 

activities and infrastructure will continue 

to grow.  As a trustworthy corporate 

citizen, we plan to do our part in 

minimising our ecological footprint and 

contributing to ESG initiatives that transit 

beyond our organisational ecosystem to 

our planet’s natural ecosystem.

This section covers our environmental 

stewardship, legal and regulatory 

compliance, and community 

development, which are derived from 

the combined depth of all six capitals 

– financial, manufactured, intellectual, 

human, social and relationship, and 

natural – and ultimately deliver positive 

net effects for all six capitals.

5.1 ENVIRONMENTAL 

STEWARDSHIP

Construction activities and buildings 

exert considerable impact on the 

environment during their multi-decade 

building lifecycles, from the embodied 

energy of materials and construction to 

the operating energy of operations and 

maintenance, and finally demolition at 

the end of buildings’ useful lives.  This 

also presents significant opportunities 

to mitigate ecological footprints of 

construction activities and buildings in 

general.

As mentioned earlier, we shared on 

pages 33 to 38 about how our smart eco-

sustainable solutions have the potential 

to directly influence and reduce energy 

loss, emissions, pollution, and energy 

and water consumption in some of the 

most energy-intensive sectors, and 

work towards the extremely important 

planetary goal to combat climate change.  

Under this part of environmental 

stewardship, we will share our processes 

in environmental management.

5.1.1 Environmental Management

We are highly committed to complying 

with all applicable environmental laws 

and regulations in countries where we

operate.  As part of our Environmental 

Management System (“EMS”) aimed 

at protecting the environment and 

preventing pollution at our operations, 

we first embarked on ISO 14001 

certification in 2006 and have had an 

EMS in place ever since.  In 2018, our 

major design-and-build subsidiary in 

Singapore, Boustead Projects E&amp;C (“BP 

E&amp;C”) received an upgraded certification 

to the latest ISO 14001:2015 standard.

Our EMS sets out environmental 

management system enablers, 

commitments, targets and 

responsibilities for our team, with 

overriding responsibility belonging to 

our Environmental, Health and Safety 

(“EHS”) Team headed by our Director 

of EHS.  This same team also oversees 

workplace safety and health (“WSH”) 

performance.  Our EHS Team manages 

all aspects of our EMS which is both 

externally and internally audited, and 

ensures environmental management 

performance at all workplaces and 

project sites under our control on a daily 

basis.

We are also committed to raising 

environmental awareness through our 

adoption of green practices.

5.1.2 Green &amp; Gracious Builder 

Scheme

We are a voluntary participant in the 

Building &amp; Construction Authority 

(“BCA”)’s Green &amp; Gracious Builder 

Scheme (“GGBS”), a programme 

launched to promote environmental 

protection and gracious practices during 

construction activities.

In 2018, for our commendable efforts 

and improvements under the GGBS, we 

received the Green &amp; Gracious Builder 

Award (Excellent) for overall excellent 

environmental, professional and 

sustainability practices, an upgrade from 

the Green &amp; Gracious Builder Award 

(Merit) attained in 2015.

Having achieved a Green &amp; Gracious 

Builder Award (Excellent), we are 

committed to fulfilling our responsibility 

to the environment and the general 

public in terms of addressing 

environmental concerns and mitigating 

potential inconveniences to the general 

public in construction activities.  Our 

Green &amp; Gracious Programme (“GGP”) 

is a subset of our EMS and sets out how 

we should fulfil our role as a Green &amp; 

Gracious Builder.

INTRODUCTION

Under the GGBS and our GGP, 

we periodically review and update 

construction processes and key 

performance indicators on ESG topics 

such as those shown here.  Increasingly, 

there are overlaps in ESG topics, with 

fulfilment in one area contributing to 

benefits in the other areas.

Our GGP includes monitoring, 

performing and improving on internally 

set targets that cover areas such 

as reductions in concrete and re-

bar wastage, waste disposal, direct 

energy and water consumption from 

construction operations, effluents, dust, 

noise and vibrations.  Our targets are 

set at realistically achievable levels that 

are significantly better than Singapore’s 

construction industry and national 

averages in these same topics, in which 

it was found that the construction 

industry contributed to about 20% 

of all waste generated in Singapore 

in 2019.  Although eventually 99% of 

construction waste generated and 59% 

of Singapore’s waste generated were 

recycled,5 it is more important to reduce 

waste generation before the recycling 

phase since resources – albeit a lower 

quantum – are still required for recycling 

activities. We also require potential new 

fabricators, subcontractors and suppliers 

(together “suppliers”) to be evaluated on 

their reputation, technology solutions, 

financial health, operations, quality and 

EHS performance for inclusion on our 

list of approved suppliers, with approved 

suppliers being inducted in our GGP.

Due care is taken to ensure that 

businesses, residents and visitors 

within communities neighbouring our 

project sites are communicated to and 

not unnecessarily inconvenienced by 

ongoing projects.  These efforts include 

keeping our project sites clean and 

organised, protecting pathways and 

sidewalks that run along project sites, 

minimising dust, noise and vibrations, 

and putting up communications and 

signages where appropriate, including 

ways to contact us should there be 

any major inconveniences.  We have 

taken the additional step to appoint a 

dedicated Public Relations Officer to act 

as an external interface with the general 

public on any major inconveniences.

During FY2020, we met all targets in 

terms of reducing concrete, re-bar 

wastage and waste disposal costs.

5.1.3 Energy &amp; Water Efficiency

We have worked hard to improve the 

energy and water efficiency of our 

operations in order to optimise the use 

of natural resources and mitigate our 

ecological footprint.  Improving energy 

and water efficiency has also translated

to lower operating costs and conversely 

higher profitability.  Such gains have 

been achieved in two areas of our 

operations: during the construction 

phase of design-and-build projects 

and during the operational phase of 

multi-tenanted buildings that we have 

developed and continue to own and 

lease out.

a) Energy &amp; Water Intensity of Design-

and-Build Projects

Our design-and-build projects use 

diesel as a fuel for onsite diesel power 

generators, electricity drawn from the 

national power grid and water drawn 

from the national water network.  We 

also collect rainwater which is treated 

and recycled for use in activities such as 

project site cleanliness and washing of 

vehicles leaving project sites.

We continue to measure our average 

energy and water intensity per square 

metre (“sq m”) of constructed gross 

floor area (“GFA”) – not including 

recycled water – for all significant 

design-and-build projects in Singapore 

as shown here.  During FY2020, average 

energy and water intensity per sq m of 

constructed GFA significantly improved 

year-on-year compared to FY2019, 

although this was partly due to the 

timing of design-and-build projects in 

various phases.  It is recommended that 

the three-year rolling average is used for 

a more accurate gauge of this measure.

INTRODUCTION

In addition, it should be noted that in 

2019, Singapore’s annual total rainfall 

was measured as being 37% below the 

1981 to 2010 long-term average6 and 

20% below 2018,7 meaning that our 

rainwater collection and recycling points 

at both design-and-build project sites 

and leasehold properties with rainwater 

harvesting systems used for landscape 

irrigation and toilet flushing, were 

collecting significantly less rainwater for 

recycling in 2019, resulting in more water 

being drawn from the national water 

network.

b) Energy &amp; Water Intensity of 

Administrative Workplaces

Our administrative workplaces regionally 

draw on electricity from the national 

power grid and water from the national 

water network.

We actively track the electricity 

consumption at all administrative 

workplaces regionally to provide a 

baseline for comparison against our 

future usage.

During FY2020, our average energy 

intensity per employee at administrative 

workplaces of 489.4 kWh improved 

year-on-year compared to 559.7 kWh in 

FY2019, continuing a positive trend from 

FY2018 to FY2020.  Our average water 

intensity per employee at administrative 

workplaces of 9.2 cu m deteriorated 

year-on-year compared to 7.7 cu m in 

FY2019 but remained in line with the 

three-year average from FY2018 to 

FY2020, as shown on page 78.

c) Energy &amp; Water Intensity of 

Edward Boustead Centre &amp; ALICE@

Mediapolis

Our leasehold properties draw on 

electricity from the national power grid, 

electricity generated by solar power and 

water from the national water network.

We actively track the electricity 

consumption at our multi-tenanted 

developments in Singapore constructed 

after the launch of mandatory 

submission under the BCA’s Green 

Mark Programme in 2008, to provide 

a baseline for comparison against 

our future usage.  Presently, Edward 

Boustead Centre and ALICE@

Mediapolis (“ALICE”) are the only two 

developments under this category that 

were fully operational for the whole of 

FY2020.  We do not track the energy 

and water usage at other developments 

within our leasehold portfolio as they

are mainly single-tenanted properties 

and hence, energy and water usage is 

driven by tenants’ processes, which can 

significantly differ based on respective 

tenants’ business activities.

Our headquarters is Edward Boustead 

Centre, a Green Mark Platinum–rated 

development with a high-efficiency 

building envelope design and some of 

the highest ratings in energy and water 

efficiency.  In terms of energy efficiency, 

Edward Boustead Centre uses double 

glazed low-emissivity glass to reduce 

heat flow into the building, more efficient 

T5 lighting, motion sensors that activate 

lighting at staircases and toilets, and 

a signature central skywell that allows 

plenty of natural lighting to penetrate 

even central areas of the building.

In terms of water efficiency, Edward 

Boustead Centre uses extremely efficient 

water fittings and has a rainwater 

harvesting system to recycle captured 

rainwater towards water-intensive 

horticultural and toilet flushing purposes.  

Edward Boustead Centre also has air 

handling unit condensate recycling, sky 

terraces and a rooftop garden to reduce 

heat island effects, which together with 

the green features mentioned earlier, 

have been estimated to result in carbon 

dioxide emissions savings of 264 tonnes 

annually, equivalent to removing the 

emissions of 56 cars for a year.

Our latest completed multi-tenanted 

development is ALICE, a Green Mark 

Platinum-rated development which 

is also Singapore’s first truly smart 

business park development.  In terms 

of energy efficiency, ALICE uses double 

glazed low-emissivity glass to reduce 

heat flow into the building, a full LED 

lighting system, motion sensors that 

activate lighting at staircases and toilets, 

variable voltage variable frequency lifts 

with sleep mode feature, a daylight 

design for the atrium, a 100 kilowatt-

peak rooftop solar panel array and 

sub-metering systems that can be 

accessed real-time on a mobile app so 

that individual tenants can keep track of 

all types of utilities usage.

In terms of water efficiency, ALICE uses 

extremely efficient water fittings and has 

a rainwater harvesting system to recycle 

captured rainwater towards water-

intensive horticultural and toilet flushing 

purposes.  80% of ALICE’s constructed 

floor area used greener building 

methodologies including prefabricated

building systems and prefabricated 

bathroom units (“PBUs”), the first large-

scale PBUs in the built environment 

sector.  ALICE also accesses district 

cooling to gain greater efficiencies and 

has several sky terraces to reduce heat 

island effects, which together with the 

green features mentioned earlier, have 

been estimated to result in carbon 

dioxide emissions savings of 842 tonnes 

annually, equivalent to removing the 

emissions of 179 cars for a year.

The energy use intensity (“EUI”) of 

Edward Boustead Centre and ALICE 

continued to compare extremely 

favourably with both Singapore’s 

comparable buildings and national 

EUI averages for 2018, with Edward 

Boustead Centre just breaking into the 

top performing quartile for comparable 

buildings, while ALICE is in the second 

best performing quartile for comparable 

buildings, as shown on page 80.8

The water use intensity (“WUI”) of 

Edward Boustead Centre was poorer 

than Singapore’s comparable buildings 

median WUI for 2017, affected by 

Singapore’s lower annual total rainfall, 

with the rainwater harvesting system 

used for landscape irrigation and toilet 

flushing collecting less rainwater for 

recycling in 2019, resulting in more 

water being drawn from the national 

water network.  The WUI of ALICE was 

significantly better than Singapore’s 

comparable buildings median WUI for 

2017.9  It should be noted that ALICE 

has yet to reach full asset stabilisation 

and that tenants progressively moved 

into ALICE throughout FY2020, hence 

the EUI and WUI for ALICE in FY2020 

may not be an accurate gauge of future 

performance.

5.1.4 Waste Reduction

Under environmental stewardship, we 

believe that waste reduction should be 

undertaken in both big and small ways.  

We encourage our team to reduce paper 

usage and to reuse or recycle non-

sensitive paper waste where practicable.  

In 2015, building on our green initiative, 

we adopted a paperless electronic 

format for annual reports and in 2018, 

further phased out CD copies of annual 

reports altogether to reduce plastic 

waste as well.

We have also digitised most of our 

previously hard copy-based records 

where appropriate and continue to 

use secure Cloud-based technology 

platforms and software solutions to 

improve our data governance and 

productivity, which helps to reduce yet 

another form of waste – time waste.

In fact, our investments in integrated 

digital delivery and building information 

modelling (“BIM”) have significantly 

improved digitalisation and productivity 

efforts, and almost eliminated paper 

usage while drastically reducing 

potential human errors in projects where 

BIM is applied.

The added advantage of our earlier 

investments in technological 

transformation has been our capability 

to immediately and successfully execute 

our business continuity activities since 

the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, 

ensuring that other than for construction 

activities, our team was able to maintain 

reasonable productivity, even under full 

telecommuting and work-from-home 

arrangements.

5.1.5 Strategic Technology 

Partnership for Environmental 

Sustainability

During FY2020, we signed a framework 

agreement with Sunseap Leasing Pte 

Ltd (“Sunseap”) – the largest and most 

established integrated clean energy 

solutions company in Singapore – on the 

potential installation of rooftop industrial 

solar energy systems at our real estate 

projects and potential provision of 

lower-cost clean energy solutions to our 

clients and tenants.  This partnership is 

intended to better utilise rooftop space – 

an important asset within our leasehold 

portfolio.  Promoting eco-sustainability 

through greater use of renewable energy 

aligns with our position as the market 

leading builder and developer of smart 

eco-sustainable business park and 

industrial developments.

Our partnership with Sunseap 

encourages our tenants to install rooftop 

industrial solar energy systems on top of 

our leasehold properties, should tenants 

find that direct solar power generation 

can benefit their operations located at 

our leasehold properties.

Tenants do not have to fund capital and 

operating expenditures for these rooftop 

industrial solar energy systems, instead 

purchasing the generated solar power 

from Sunseap at commercially agreed 

tariff rates.

For tenants who wish to offset their 

greenhouse gas emissions and attain 

their energy and environmental 

sustainability goals, Sunseap also offers 

renewable energy certificates, which are 

tradeable green energy attributes that 

represent units of electricity generated 

from renewable energy generation 

facilities.

INTRODUCTION

5.2 LEGAL &amp; REGULATORY 

COMPLIANCE

We are highly committed to fully 

complying with applicable laws 

and regulations in countries where 

we operate.  Often, these laws and 

regulations cross the boundaries of 

economic and ESG topics, covering 

almost all aspects of our business 

and are governed under the scope 

of different government ministries, 

agencies and regulators.

In Singapore, the main government 

stakeholders and regulators that we 

regularly communicate with are shown 

on page 82.  In other countries where we 

operate, we regularly communicate with 

government stakeholders and regulators 

that are similar in scope.

Government stakeholders and regulators 

give us our business licences to 

conduct our operations regionally.  

Full compliance with applicable laws 

and regulations cannot be overstated 

and is inherent in all system enablers.  

Relevant on-the-job training is provided 

to team members to ensure that they 

comprehend and meet the requirements 

of laws and regulations that apply to their 

job scopes.  In addition, professional 

training may also be extended to 

specific team members in order for 

them to better comprehend and meet 

the requirements of applicable laws and 

regulations in high-risk economic and 

ESG topics.  Other than government 

stakeholders and regulators, we may at 

times also have to comply with laws and 

regulations embedded within contractual 

terms set by clients and lenders, who 

have to ensure compliance with laws 

and regulations which are specific to 

their countries and industries.

In FY2020, we had four minor fines 

(defined as being between S$1,001 

to S$10,000) in environmental areas, 

with zero major fines or cases 

brought against us through dispute 

resolution mechanisms by government 

stakeholders and regulators in economic 

and ESG facets.  We also had zero 

substantiated complaints received 

from external parties and regulators 

or identified leaks, thefts or losses of 

customer data under the customer 

privacy area.  Our suppliers paid all four 

minor fines, namely for four instances of 

excessive noise at project sites.

Going forward, we expect legal and 

regulatory compliance related to 

COVID-19 and infectious diseases may 

become much more prevalent, given the 

extremely huge costs already incurred by 

governments, industries, organisations, 

communities and individuals, who 

have been impacted in all facets of life, 

covering general wellbeing and health to 

economic and ESG facets.  Governments 

will be keen to learn from the pandemic 

and enforce new legal and regulatory 

compliance to pre-empt and protect the 

world from future infectious diseases.

BOUSTEAD PROJECTS LIMITED FY2O2O LONGEVITY REPORT

Boustead Group, and our reputation as a 

trustworthy corporate citizen.

Officially unveiled on the cover of this 

Boustead Projects FY2020 Longevity 

Report, our new refreshed brand, look 

and feel is the culmination of all this and 

much more – essentially reflecting the 

Boustead Way.

Hand-in-hand with our stakeholders, 

we intend to continue our role as a 

trustworthy corporate citizen, one 

which we hope to honour for many 

more decades to come.  Join us in this 

ultramarathon, run the Boustead Way.

The Boustead Way prioritises the 

pursuit of business with a greater 

purpose.  It is about creating 

sustainable shared socio-economic 

value versus maximising short-term 

profit; promoting adaptability and 

resilience; and favouring longevity 

over sentimentality.  It is a position, 

a value, a commercial sensibility 

that runs through every layer of our 

organisation.

5.3 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

We are committed to community 

development and selecting an 

appropriate externally-managed 

community development programme to 

support on a long-term basis.  At times, 

we also undertake philanthropic fund 

raising through our own fund raising 

platforms in collaboration with our 

suppliers.  Communities in countries 

where we operate benefit directly from 

our donations both in monetary terms 

and in-kind to organisations that run 

community development programmes 

and also indirectly through the projects 

that we undertake for end-user clients, 

which provide jobs to those communities 

and ESG benefits.

In 2018, we formally inaugurated 

our ‘Boustead Cares’ Community 

Partnership Programme with 

Singapore’s North East Community 

Development Council (“NECDC”), and 

helped raise S$50,000 in support of 

NECDC’s community activities, with our 

first year contributions going towards 

NECDC’s Community Give Back Month, 

when two dozen volunteers from our 

team worked with staff from NECDC 

and Bizlink Centre Singapore Ltd 

(“Bizlink Centre”) to organise a trip to 

the Singapore Zoo for Bizlink Centre’s 

beneficiaries, primarily disadvantaged 

and disabled individuals.

During FY2020, we continued 

our ‘Boustead Cares’ Community 

Partnership Programme with NECDC 

through fund raising activities in 

conjunction with our annual Boustead 

Projects Lunar 7th Month Charity 

Dinner, where we raised over S$161,000 

(including pledged donations).

Part of the funds raised through our 

annual charity dinner were committed to 

several NECDC community development 

programmes including the sponsorship 

of critical renovation works for Kheng 

Chiu Loke Tin Kee Home (“Kheng Chiu 

Happy Lodge”), a registered charity 

in Singapore.  The renovation works 

comprised elder-friendly improvements 

including the installation of anti-slip 

treatment to toilet entrances, grab bars 

in toilet cubicles and anti-slip tiles in 

washing areas.

In April 2019, 20 volunteers from our 

team visited Kheng Chiu Happy Lodge 

to engage with and entertain residents 

during the ceremonial completion of the 

renovation works in an occasion that 

was also graced by NECDC’s Mayor, Mr 

Desmond Choo.

Separately in another event in 

September 2019, over a dozen 

volunteers from our team worked with 

staff from NECDC to organise a trip to 

Turf City’s Red Dynasty Paintball Park for 

marginalised children and teens to have 

an enjoyable and meaningful time in an 

action-packed day out.

In FY2020, we distributed a total of 

S$143,000 in direct economic value to 

community investments, a 99% increase 

as compared to S$72,000 in FY2019.  

Moving forward, we intend to continue 

building on our ‘Boustead Cares’ 

Community Partnership Programme 

as a fruitful and uplifting long-term 

philanthropic programme after its 

successful launch in 2018.

5.4 CONCLUSION

Although we have achieved respectable 

performance in material ESG topics, 

we recognise that we can and must 

do better.  Having collected and 

reported on at least three years’ worth 

of data on material ESG topics, we are 

progressively setting targets in material 

ESG topics where feasible to do so.

This past year, the Boustead Group 

saw long-term investments in people, 

technologies and possibility all come 

together to deliver an empowering 

window into their future.  Together 

with the Boustead Group, Boustead 

Projects embarked on refreshing our 

brand for the future, aligned with the 

global and progressive nature of the
