CEO MESSAGE

Sustainability is the future. The recent COP26 summit in Glasgow 

demonstrated a rapidly growing number of private sector actors 

have embraced the urgent need to address environmental and social 

challenges. So although some may have wished for more ambitious 

national commitments, it really was a glass half full. And while much 

more action is needed, this was promising. 

We have been thoughtful around our own sustainability agenda 

because we not only want to create a healthy planet, but also to 

ensure that the transition to accomplish this is just. It is clear that both  

environmental and social challenges are tightly intertwined in a knot 

that can only be untied by developing both environmental and social 

domains, instead of focusing on one to the exclusion of the other.

Environment

There are many environmental challenges in front of us, but we have 

chosen to prioritise action on climate change as the most immediate 

issue given the urgency and how it is interrelated with other 

environmental and social concerns.  

Engaging with and empowering our clients to reduce their carbon 

footprint is an important part of our contribution, but change always 

starts at home. This is why we have established a Board Sustainability 

Committee to oversee a deep and complex adjustment as we weave 

ESG into the fabric of our business.

Our first major adjustment was to establish a taxonomy that we have 

embedded in our Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework 

(Framework). It precisely categorises transitional and sustainable 

activities by sector, helping us identify what we want to do more of 

and what we want to do less of. At the same time, the Framework 

guides our engagement with customers as we help them establish 

transition strategies to decarbonise and build resilience to climate 

change. In fact, we have ceased accepting new customers who derive 

more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal and have pledged 

to progressively phase out thermal coal financing by 2039. We have 

also decided to exit customers who do not commit to the principles 

of either NDPE (No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation) or 

RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) by a fixed date.

Next, our risk management framework and strategic planning 

are also being enhanced with the integration of ESG, and we are 

developing quantitative methods to assess climate-related risks. 

We have already observed how allocating capital to low-carbon 

businesses has reduced the likelihood of stranded assets and 

opened doors to fresh opportunities.

And to measure and communicate our progress on all our efforts 

more clearly, we became the first Singapore bank to adopt the 

enhanced disclosures recommended by the Task Force on Climate-

related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in 2017. We also joined the 

There are many environmental challenges  

in front of us, but we have chosen to  

prioritise action on climate change as  

the most immediate issue given the  

urgency and how it is interrelated with  

other environmental and social concerns.

Chief Executive Officer 

DBS Group Holdings

Forum established by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial 

Disclosures (TNFD) to lay the groundwork for action to preserve the 

environment and biodiversity.

We are also on track to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from our 

own operations by 2022.

Our customers agree with us and our portfolios are rebalancing 

towards low-carbon. In 2021 we committed SGD 12.4 billion of 

sustainability-linked loans and SGD 6.9 billion of green loans. 

Cumulatively we have committed SGD 39.4 billion in sustainable 

financing transactions, moving us closer to our sustainable 

financing target of SGD 50 billion by 2024. This was also the second 

consecutive year that we topped the Asia Pacific (ex-Japan) league 

table for arranging green and sustainability-linked loans.

Weaving ESG into our business showed us that more ambitious goals 

were feasible. And so, having deliberately waited until we had a good 

line of sight over the journey, in October 2021 we became the first 

Singapore bank to sign the NZBA commitment letter. We view this 

pledge to align our business with pathways limiting carbon emissions 

to net-zero by 2050 as an important down payment for the future. 

We have also created infrastructure to enable and empower 

businesses to achieve their climate impact goals. Climate Impact X 

(CIX), a carbon exchange and marketplace for high-quality carbon 

credits that is expected to go live in early 2022, will help enable this  

by leveraging satellite monitoring and blockchain technology – a world’s  

first. CIX is currently helmed by our former Chief Sustainability Officer. 

Social

Being socially-conscious involves doing the right thing by our 

customers. This includes being committed to fair dealing. DBS 

continually reviews our sales processes, training and disclosure 

standards to ensure that we act with our customers’ best interests at 

heart. 

Cognisant of our responsibility to society, the bank also gives back 

to the community in various ways. We provide inclusive banking to 

those who might otherwise not be able to access the formal financial 

system, advocate for and nurture small businesses that create social 

impact, and support community causes such as those that are 

championing education, the environment, and the elderly. 

We also seek to multiply our impact by empowering others to create 

positive change. We do this particularly through the DBS Foundation, 

which was established in 2014 to champion social entrepreneurship. 

By coming alongside businesses that are driven to create social and 

environmental impact, we can reach more beneficiaries than if we 

travel this journey alone. In 2021, the Foundation awarded close to 

SGD 3 million to 19 social enterprises in Asia via its flagship grant 

programme. This was double the usual quantum disbursed in past 

years and reflected our commitment to help more businesses to 

make a difference. 

Additionally, as Covid-19 cases surged in India and Indonesia in 2021, 

we donated oxygen supplies to these markets to help meet urgent 

healthcare needs. 

To enable us to drive greater impact beyond banking on a sustained basis, 

the Board recently approved setting aside an additional SGD 100 million  

to champion social enterprises and other community causes. 

Responsible stewardship

Climate change and social inequality are issues that can only be 

addressed with collective resolve and action. To pull all these into 

place, we architected our broader sustainability agenda around our 

three pillars – responsible banking, responsible business practices, 

and impact beyond banking. With bold commitment, expertise, 

and leadership, I am confident we will be able to make significant 

contributions to decarbonisation, drive the transition to a net-zero 

world, and be a responsible steward of natural resources, while 

building and securing a sustainable future.  

Being socially-conscious involves doing the right thing 

by our customers. This includes being committed to fair 

dealing. DBS continually reviews our sales processes, 

training and disclosure standards to ensure that we  

act with our customers’ best interests at heart.

APPROACH

As we advance further along our sustainability journey, we dialled  

up focus on climate impact at the core of our strategy. In 2021,  

we became the first Singapore bank, and among the first 100 banks  

globally, to sign up to the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), committing  

to align our lending portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050. 

We believe we can make a real contribution in accelerating the 

transition towards a net-zero future while making a meaningful  

shift to our business by: 

• Elevating governance

• Strengthening climate risk management

• Aligning our portfolio

• Empowering and supporting clients in their transition  

We see sustainability as an active value driver where new 

opportunities could be gained, in addition to managing ESG risks as a 

necessary license to operate.

TRACKING OUR PERFORMANCE 

As a member of the United Nations Global Compact, we believe we have  

a role to play in promoting sustainable development. We are 

committed to drive progress towards achieving the sustainable 

development goals (SDGs). All 17 interrelated goals represent an 

ambitious sustainability agenda by 2030. 

We have chosen to focus on the following six SDGs which we believe 

we can make meaningful contributions to, taking into account the 

markets in which we operate.

OUR STRATEGY 

Our commitment to embed sustainability in the fabric of our business is strategically centred around our three sustainability pillars: 

Responsible banking

Our responsible banking practices support 

our customers’ transition towards lower-

carbon business models, enhance their 

access to ESG investments, and deliver 

customised retail solutions to meet their 

specific needs. 

Responsible business practices

We believe in doing the right thing by our 

people and embedding environmental and 

societal factors in our business operations. 

Impact beyond banking

We seek to be a force for good by 

championing social enterprises – 

businesses with a double bottom line 

– and supporting community causes 

such as those that are driving positive 

environmental and social impact.

The Board has overall responsibility for sustainability and integrates ESG matters in the formulation of DBS’ strategy. The Board provides over-

sight on DBS’ sustainability agenda and directs its efforts in managing material ESG matters, and is guided by the objective to create long-term 

value by managing our business in a balanced and responsible way. Given the heightened expectations among external stakeholders on DBS’ 

sustainability agenda and commitments, a new Board Sustainability Committee was established to better focus on sustainability matters.

Governance Structure

The structure outlines how our sustainability governance operates across the Board, Board Committee, the Management, and specialised

Roles and responsibilities

To ensure full oversight and accountability for our sustainability 

strategy, the Group Sustainability Council (GSC), through regular 

updates and reporting to the Group Management Committee (GMC), 

supports the CEO and the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) on 

ESG matters. 

The BSC is chaired by the Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 

and oversees DBS’ overall plans and approves its strategies, goals, 

and targets in relation to climate and the broader ESG matters, 

strategically centred around our three sustainability pillars. The BSC 

will meet quarterly and as and when required. 

The GSC is chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) and 

consists of senior management members from various business and 

support units. The GSC serves as an executive forum for discussions 

and operational decision-making on sustainability matters. These 

include the setting, tracking, and reporting of key performance 

indicators in consultation with stakeholders, as well as overseeing the 

execution of sustainability initiatives across the bank. 

The GSC also advises the BSC on material ESG matters that 

contribute to the overall materiality assessment, which is utilised 

for strategic planning and long-term value creation. The GSC meets 

every two months and provides periodic updates to the BSC. 

During 2021, we focused our initiatives and programmes on building 

knowledge and deepening subject-matter expertise, clarified roles 

and responsibilities, and integrated climate change – identified as a 

top priority and most immediate issue – within our strategic and risk 

management framework, that is aligned with our overall aspiration 

and ambition. As such, updates on climate-related developments, 

our climate ambitions, and risk management approaches regularly 

feature on the Board and Board Committees’ agendas. 

In April 2021, the Climate Steering Committee, co-chaired by the 

Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Head of Institutional Banking Group 

(IBG), and the CSO, was established to further strengthen DBS’ 

climate risk management. A dedicated working team has also been 

formed at the Group level and is managed by senior members from 

IBG, Risk, Finance and the CSO office. 

The Climate Steering Committee meets monthly to coordinate 

the multi-year climate roadmap and oversees the analyses 

and implementation of disclosures in alignment with the TCFD 

recommendations updated in 2021 and the Environmental Risk 

Management Guidelines issued by the Monetary Authority of 

Singapore in 2020. As a specialised function, the Climate Steering 

Committee also acts as an expert group that will inform the GSC  

on the progress made in managing our climate risk.  

Across our core markets, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,  

and Taiwan, we have also established Local Sustainability Councils 

to ensure sustainability is embedded consistently across the 

organisation. These Local Councils follow a similar structure as  

the GSC and have a broad mandate to execute initiatives in line  

with the Group’s sustainability approach while adapting to local 

market conditions.

Read more about “Corporate Governance” in the Annual Report.  

Performance measurement

We use a balanced scorecard approach to measure how successful 

we are in serving our key stakeholders and executing our long-term 

strategy, including driving our sustainability initiatives. Progress 

against the scorecard is monitored and measured regularly. The

2.  We responded to investor queries through various 

engagements and highlighted our Sustainability Report 

which explains our three-pillar approach to ESG: 

responsible banking, responsible business practices, 

and creating impact beyond banking. The details on our 

approach to responsible financing and managing climate 

risk attracted the most interest.

1.  We approved over 4,200 loans that totalled SGD 1.1 billion 

to SMEs, with over 95% of the loans going to micro and 

small businesses. 

2.  We made multiple enhancements across different fronts 

to elevate the customer experience and safeguard the 

interests of our customers. For example, we incorporated 

our customers’ feedback in the design of the bank’s 

products and services. Using customer journey maps, we 

reviewed our existing banking journeys end-to-end, and 

harnessed our digital leadership and data capabilities to 

close the gaps and protect against fraud and scams. 

3.  We enabled clients to integrate a sustainable lens to 

their investments and create their own portfolio based

ways of volunteering through an array of in-person and 

virtual volunteer programmes, overcoming limitations 

arising from the pandemic.

2.  We provided a record SGD 3 million in grant funding to 19 

SEs through the 2021 DBS Foundation Grant Programme. 

These SEs have demonstrated strong business traction 

and meaningful impact outcomes. With the grant, we aim 

to catalyse positive social and environmental change, and 

tackle issues spanning healthcare, nutrition, employability 

and income disparity, education, energy, environment 

protection and waste management - all of which are 

pertinent and increasingly prevalent today.

1.  We implemented additional controls and innovative solutions to address 

the risks of remote working and enhanced our data usage surveillance to 

detect the removal of critical information. We deployed digital solutions to

TOPICAL ISSUES IN FOCUS

Climate Impact X

Mobilising capital for the transition to a net-zero world 

The challenge: realising a low-carbon future

Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time. Limiting 

global warming to 1.5°C is possible but requires transformational 

changes to the global economy, which will include the pricing of 

greenhouse gases. Well designed and functioning carbon markets 

are an essential tool in enabling an efficient marketplace for 

deploying carbon pricing, which in turn has the potential to unlock 

the significant amounts of capital needed for the global economy’s 

transition. 

The solution: a blockchain-based global marketplace

At DBS, we recognise there are many environmental challenges in 

front of us, but we have chosen to prioritise action on climate change 

as the most immediate issue, given the urgency and how climate 

change is interrelated with other environmental and social concerns. 

We have been focusing on helping our clients transition to a low-

carbon economy. 

To provide greater support to accelerate the sustainability agenda,  

we partnered Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered and Temasek 

to set up Climate Impact X (CIX) in May 2021 – a global exchange and 

marketplace for the trading of tokenised high-quality carbon credits. 

By facilitating a well-functioning marketplace with strong impact and risk  

data, CIX aims to enable the efficient price discovery of carbon credits  

and catalyse the development of new carbon credit projects worldwide.

CIX has an initial focus on natural climate solutions (NCS), which 

will involve the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems 

such as forests, wetlands, and mangroves. This adds impetus to 

address global biodiversity loss and protects the livelihoods of local 

communities who heavily rely on these ecosystems. This is especially 

important in Southeast Asia where ecosystems are among the most 

threatened in the world due to immense pressures that include high 

deforestation rates for plantations and mining activities.  

As such, the CIX well complements our sustainability efforts and net-

zero ambitions.  

The journey: what’s next?  

In October 2021, CIX successfully completed a pilot auction of a curated  

portfolio of high-quality carbon credits sourced from several NCS 

projects globally. The auction attracted strong interest from many 

global companies, and the final group of buyers represented different  

industry segments and active market participants eager to scale 

the voluntary carbon market by successfully clearing carbon credits 

equivalent to 170,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

The NCS projects used for the first auction span reforestation and 

avoided deforestation initiatives which are located across Africa, 

Asia, and Latin America. They demonstrate high-performance of 

carbon sequestration, carbon avoidance, and high levels of verified 

co-benefits, such as supporting biodiversity, along with social and 

economic development in local communities. 

These pilot projects collectively support more than 55,000 jobs, 

improve education for more than 35,000 students, and help fund 

60 medical facilities and infrastructure projects, including efforts to 

protect over 250 threatened species. 

Moving forward, CIX will continue to leverage its expertise and 

experience from this pilot and will go live in early 2022. 

Towards Zero Food Waste

Galvanising stakeholders into action

One-third of the world’s food is lost or wasted each year, yet one in 

nine people still go hungry today. As the world’s population expands 

and environmental pressures increase, the global food waste crisis 

becomes increasingly dire. This has been further exacerbated 

by the pandemic that has upended supply chains and negatively 

impacted food security for many. Food loss and waste is also a key 

contributor to climate change, amounting to almost 10% of global 

greenhouse gas emissions – if food waste were a country, it would be 

the third largest emitter in the world according, to the UN Food and 

Agriculture Organisation (UNFAO). 

At DBS, we believe businesses have a role to play in helping to 

find solutions to these challenges. As part of our commitment to 

a sustainable and climate-resilient future, we started a regional 

movement in 2020 to galvanise multiple stakeholders into action 

towards zero food waste, thereby creating collective impact.

Our Towards Zero Food Waste (TZFW) initiative comprises three 

dimensions: 1) Advocacy efforts to build awareness of the issue;  

2) Employee engagement and activations, and working towards 

reducing food waste in our own operations; and 3) Partnerships with  

like-minded organisations to scale our impact. In doing so, this initiative  

unifies our three sustainability pillars of Responsible Banking, 

Responsible Business Practices and creating Impact Beyond Banking.

This initiative has generated more than 600,000 kg of food impact 

across Asia (such as food waste reduced and recycled, or food 

redistributed) in 2021. We intend to scale this up further in the 

coming years as part of our commitment to championing a more 

sustainable tomorrow.

Advocate – Changing Mindsets

 

We engaged the public and created awareness on the issue of food 

waste across all our key markets, leveraging both media partnerships 

and our owned platforms. The two most recent episodes of our 

online mini-series Sparks ‘A Call to Action’ (episode 7 in 2020) and 

‘One from the Heart’ (episode 8 in 2021) are inspired by DBS-

supported social enterprises (SEs) tackling the issue of food waste, 

and portray how our teams at DBS rally to support these SEs in their 

TZFW mission amidst the pandemic

In Indonesia, our #MakanTanpaSisa (Eat Without Leftovers) social 

media campaign to raise awareness of food waste in a market 

with low awareness levels and high per capita food waste, went 

viral, garnering more than 21 million video views and 3.3 million 

engagements in 2021 alone. Over 30,000 kg of food was donated 

through this campaign since launch. 

As a sponsor of MasterChef Singapore (Season 2), we leveraged 

the popular cooking competition programme as a vehicle for broad-

based public engagement on food waste. In one of the episodes, 

contestants were asked to prepare a meal using the three most 

commonly wasted household ingredients. Overall, our campaign 

resulted in 6.3 million video views and 2.3 million engagements.

Activate – Walking the Talk

In 2021, we continued to engage and empower our employees 

to take action towards zero food waste through unique internal 

activations and initiatives. Some examples include:

• Our annual Hungry for Change Ideation Challenge, where we 

continued to partner with SEs working towards zero food waste. 

Since 2020, more than 2,600 employees have participated in this 

programme, contributing over 600 new ideas to solve business 

challenges faced by these SEs.

 

• Our very own urban farms at our offices in Singapore and Hong 

Kong, both of which were conceptualised in partnership with 

SEs supported by the DBS Foundation, and involve employees 

volunteering as urban farmers to grow various varieties of edible 

plants and herbs.

• In Taiwan, employee group buys from social enterprise Buy Directly  

From Farmers, and a partnership with the Food Bank, helped reduce  

food loss and redistribute food to support the food insecure.

 

During the year, we had over 15,000 employees participating in over 

250 activations regionally. Collectively, over 78,000 kg of food were 

either donated, recycled, or redistributed. 

Ally – Partnering for Impact 

Across our core markets, we continued to partner with government 

bodies, social enterprises, corporates and NGOs to scale the impact 

of our TZFW efforts. 

• DBS was the first bank to be appointed a collaborating partner in 

Singapore’s national ‘Say Yes to Waste Less’ campaign organised 

by the National Environment Agency in both 2020 and 2021.  

In 2021 we partnered with both WhyQ and foodpanda on ‘Last 

Hour Deals’ where diners get dining discounts at participating  

F&amp;B outlets in the final hours before closing to collectively reduce 

food waste. 

• In India, we engaged with DBS Foundation-supported social 

enterprise S4S Technologies to support the set up of dehydration 

units as part of a livelihoods project for rural women in Maharashtra.  

The programme resulted in 24 microentrepreneurs being trained, 

and prevented over 240,000 kg of Grade B &amp; C vegetable produce 

from being lost.

• In China, we partnered with the largest dining guide app Dianping 

to launch a “Clean up your Plate” campaign, and with participating 

restaurants to create customised #Eat-up Sets using surplus 

ingredients, resulting in over 110,000 kg of food impact.

Our approach

Banks have a two-way relationship with the climate, whereby climate 

change has risk implications on the portfolio of banks and bank 

lending affects the climate via the financing provided. Our climate 

strategy accounts for this two-way relationship by strengthening 

climate risk management capabilities and ensuring portfolio 

alignment with our net-zero commitment into a single cohesive 

framework. This opens new opportunities for us and helps empower 

our customers to achieve their decarbonisation targets.  

• Aligning our portfolio 

Building on the foundation we have laid since 2018 when we first 

began measuring our financed emissions across selected carbon-

intensive customers, we continue to make progress in measuring 

and steering our IBG lending portfolio to align with our climate 

commitments. 

• Empowering and supporting clients in their transition  

We are well-positioned to reap new opportunities through 

financing a green and just transition.  

We see sustainability as an active value driver where new 

opportunities could be gained, and as a way to manage ESG risks 

as a necessary license to operate. By combining our deep sector 

knowledge, strong client relationships, and financial expertise, 

we continue to offer seamless end-to-end advisory and financing 

solutions to support our clients in their decarbonisation journeys. 

As an early adopter of the Task Force on Climate-related 

Financial Disclosures (TCFD), DBS has been reporting under the 

recommendations since 2018. We remain committed to being 

transparent about our efforts and progress.

As we work towards becoming the Best Bank for a Better World, we 

seek to innovate and be thoughtful around our sustainability agenda 

to create a healthy planet, while ensuring a just transition. 

Of the many sustainability challenges facing us, we prioritise climate 

action given its urgency and how climate change is interrelated with 

other environmental and social concerns. Climate-related risks and 

opportunities affect the way we do our business and how we make 

investing and financing decisions. 

Our progress

In 2021 we became the first Singaporean bank, and among the 

first 100 banks globally, to sign up to the Net-Zero Banking Alliance 

(NZBA), committing to align our lending portfolios with net-zero 

emissions by 2050. 

The following section under Responsible Financing describes our 

strategic priorities:  

• Elevating governance  

We have put in place a robust governance structure to oversee 

environmental, social, and governance ESG matters (including 

climate), pertaining to our financing activities.

• Strengthening climate risk management  

Our ESG risk assessment for the Institutional Banking Group 

(IBG) lending portfolio covers a suite of sector-specific factors by 

identifying, assessing, and quantifying ESG risks; we have started 

to explore the integration of transition and physical climate risks 

more explicitly.

Our Responsible Financing Standard and Policies

Our policies and standards govern our efforts and approach to sustainable  

finance and confirm our commitment to responsible banking practices. 

Our Group Core Credit Risk Policy incorporates principles and 

approaches to managing ESG issues. They are supplemented by the 

Group Responsible Financing Standard and our nine Sector Guides 

pertaining to sectors with elevated ESG risks. Our Group Responsible 

Financing Standard applies to all lending, capital market products 

and services, and treasury/ corporate investments within DBS and 

forms an integral part of our credit approval process governed by 

the Group Core Credit Risk Policy. Our ESG standards also extend to 

promoter share financing in Private Banking.  

As part of our periodic review process, we updated our Group 

Responsible Financing Standard in 2021, which included the 

tightening of ESG-related prohibited transactions to specifically 

highlight no financing towards activities that involve deforestation 

of High Carbon Stock (HCS) and High Conservation Value (HCV) 

forests, in addition to illegal logging and land clearance by burning. 

Furthermore, our latest commitment to zero thermal coal exposure 

by 2039 was reflected in the latest Group Responsible Financing 

Standard, as well as the Power and Metals &amp; Mining Sector Guides. 

We continue to apply our nine Sector Guides that outline the ESG 

standards we expect of our customers. These cover Agricultural 

Commodities, Palm Oil, Chemicals, Oil &amp; Gas, Mining &amp; Metals, Power, 

Infrastructure, Animal Husbandry &amp; Feed, and Apparel, Footwear &amp; 

Textile sectors. 

Read more about the Group Responsible Financing Standard and Sector Guides 

in Our Approach to Responsible Financing. 

Elevating governance 

We have put in place a governance structure to oversee ESG risks 

and opportunities of our financing activities at IBG since 2017. 

More recently, we established a Board Sustainability Committee to 

provide greater governance and oversight into climate-related risks 

and opportunities, as well as our broader sustainability agenda. 

This elevates the existing oversight at the board level, where the 

Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) approves DBS’ overall 

risk governance frameworks, policies, and processes, including the 

approach to responsible financing.

Read more about our “Governance” on page 11. 

 

At the management level, IBG sustainability team oversees the ESG 

risk management processes, reviews transactions with high ESG risks 

and recommends financing conditions and covenants to mitigate 

ESG risks where required, before submitting for credit approval. The 

team also updates policies and Sector Guides and reports material 

ESG issues and trends to the Group Credit Risk Committee (GCRC) 

biannually. Where appropriate, material issues are escalated for 

discussion with the Group Risk Executive Committee. The team also 

leads the sustainable finance business and helps originate, structure, 

and execute the transactions aligned with best practices to ensure 

integrity of the green and sustainability attributes of the financing.

In 2021, a total of 30 ESG risk assessments were escalated as the 

customers had engaged in ‘No-Go’ or prohibited transactions. Out of 

these escalations, eight were later clarified not to be in breach of our 

policy and 21 were identified as pure-play thermal coal transactions.

Building ESG Expertise 

To enhance the integration of ESG considerations in our financing, 

we stepped up our efforts in building our ESG expertise. 

In relation to ESG risk management, RMs and CRMs are required to 

undergo mandatory training designed to ensure compliance and 

consistency in implementation of our policies and standards.  In 

2021, 87% (2020: 83%) of our RMs and CRMs have undergone the 

mandatory Responsible Financing e-Learning.  

To capture sustainable finance opportunities, we have mobilised a 

network of colleagues, which are members of the IBG Sustainability 

Solutions Group, across markets to multiply the impact of the 

central IBG Sustainability team. We have offered training programs 

to enhance knowledge of our sustainable finance products to 

our RMs in 2021. The objective of the trainings is to enhance 

their understanding of the different sustainable finance products, 

the workflow, and relevant industry best practices such that we 

promote credible transaction attributes and minimise the risk of 

greenwashing. About 200 RMs have attended the courses. 

In 2022, we plan to increase the number of sustainable finance 

trainings to a wider group of audience beyond RMs. The training 

programs will cater to sectoral characteristics including coaching 

approaches to determine net-zero pathways for various carbon-

intensive industries. 

We also launched training courses to educate RMs, investment 

consultants and product managers in our Wealth Management  

and Private Banking arm on the full suite of sustainable investments 

offered for further engagement with our clients. 

Our Know Your Customer (KYC) team continues to up-skill our RMs 

and CRMs on modern-day slavery and its manifestations, including 

forced labour, debt bondage, money laundering and human trafficking  

and trained 804 (2020: 153) RMs in 2021. Our objective is to continually  

raise internal awareness, while enhancing our understanding of the  

early-warning signals and relevance of modern slavery to our business  

and how these issues can be identified during the KYC process. 

As part of the on-going efforts to build ESG expertise at Global 

Transaction Services (GTS), a learning session on sustainable trade 

finance was organised and close to 300 participants attended across 

all locations. A specialised ESG portal has also been launched for 

the GTS staff to ensure the team can refer to the cash and trade 

products, trends, and client pitchbooks.

Our ESG Risk Assessment

ESG due diligence is an integral part of our credit and capital markets 

deal engagement process. It entails monitoring our customers’ 

adherence to our standards through tracking progress in addressing 

past incidents, following negative media coverage and activist 

campaigns, engaging customers in establishing practices that  

align with international standards, and following up on agreed 

mitigating measures. 

If there are incidents that require a deeper engagement, we request 

further ESG information from our customers and advise a strategy 

that satisfies our standards. If a customer is unwilling to adequately 

manage and mitigate the identified risks, we are prepared to decline 

the transaction or reassess the banking relationship altogether.

We adopt three lines of defence to manage our ESG risk in line 

with DBS’ internal controls framework.  Forming the first line of 

defence is our Relationship Managers (RMs) who conduct ESG risk 

assessments of our customers as part of the credit application 

or capital markets deal engagement process.  Whenever the ESG 

risk assessment requires escalation, the assessment is further 

evaluated and reviewed by the IBG Sustainability team.  Where 

appropriate, enhanced due diligence may take place in the form of 

site visits, independent reviews and/ or certification requirements. 

Our Credit Risk Managers (CRMs) provide the second line of defence 

by reviewing the ESG assessments as part of the credit approval 

process.  Finally, Group Audit serves as the third line of defence 

through periodic audit on the effectiveness of our overall ESG risk 

management.

In 2021, a total of 8,927 ESG risk assessments were completed as 

part of credit applications, annual reviews or in the event there is 

some negative ESG news about the borrower. The figure below 

depicts the completed ESG risk assessments across the various risk 

levels (“Low”, “Medium Low”, “Medium”, “High” and “No-Go”) over the 

year.  More than 94% of the completed assessments fall under the 

overall risk levels of “Low” and “Medium Low”, reflecting that most of 

our transactions adhere to our responsible financing standards.   

Separately, among the ESG risk assessments conducted, 7.3% (2020: 

7.7%) were escalated for further due diligence.The escalations 

were due to reasons such as the carbon-intensive nature of the 

transactions, labour practices and community grievances amongst 

others. The following chart shows the proportion of ESG risk 

assessments escalated by sector.

On the other hand, operational risk – arising from inadequate or 

failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events – may 

be triggered by potential physical climate risks, resulting in business 

disruptions and creating negative impacts on workplace, personnel, 

systems, vital records and dependencies. Mitigation programmes 

such as a robust business continuity management and group 

insurance programmes are put in place to ensure that operational 

risks are managed and essential banking services can continue  

in the event of unforeseen events and that significant financial 

impacts are abated. 

Finally, reputational risk is a consequence of the failure to manage 

other risk types. At DBS we have policies in place to protect the 

consistency of our brand and to safeguard our corporate identity and 

reputation, which are further reinforced by our corporate values that 

reflect ethical behaviours and practices. 

Frameworks suitable for translating climate-related risks into financial 

risks relevant for market and liquidity risk quantification 

remain relatively nascent. To this end, we will continue to explore 

methodologies to enhance the quantification approach.

Integrating climate risks into overall credit risk  

management framework

Climate change credit risk quantification is challenging because its 

impact is far-reaching in breadth and magnitude, over an uncertain 

and extended time horizon over decades, while also depending on 

short-term actions. As a result, current industry best practice involves 

the use of scenario-based climate change credit risk modelling 

and analysis to quantify the transmission of physical and transition 

climate risks to potential credit risks. 

Physical risk scenario analyses 

Our physical risk scenario analysis mainly leverages locational hazard 

mapping methodologies to develop initial insights on the potential 

physical risk impacts to our assets and business operations.  

We started this analysis with a focus on the DBS Hong Kong property-

secured lending portfolios, which piloted in the 2021 Hong Kong 

Monetary Authority (HKMA) Climate Risk Stress Test.

Initial insights from the assessment indicated that the potential 

physical risk impacts to the property securing the DBS HK lending 

portfolios, under a High Emission Future scenario, are likely limited. 

Transition risk scenario analyses 

Over the past 12 months, we have also embedded climate risks in 

our overall risk management framework by identifying, assessing, 

and quantifying these risks, and began exploring the integration 

across our credit risk policies and sector strategies. Our climate 

risk assessment for the IBG lending portfolio has evolved to a suite 

of sector-specific models. We aim to build models for nine priority 

sectors, initially focusing on power, automotive, oil &amp; gas, and real 

estate. Our power and automotive sectors are selected as pilots to 

deep dive our transition risk scenario analyses, and we share the 

preliminary assessment under the Sectors in focus sections.  

Further details of the findings and methodologies to our scenario-based climate 

change credit risk modelling  can be found in the Appendix on page 87.

Strengthening climate risk management

Since we started reporting on our climate disclosures in 2018, 

we have made steady progress in enhancing our climate risks 

management. We began with conducting pilot studies on transition 

risk assessment, where we analysed via a bottom-up approach, 

the potential cost impact to a sample population of IBG customers 

using scenarios reflecting different carbon prices as advised by the 

International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organisation for Economic 

Cooperation and Development then. In 2020, we expanded our 

methodology to introduce a top-down, portfolio-level approach 

for the entire portfolio, leveraging the forecasts of macroeconomic 

variables to supplement our bottom-up borrower level assessment 

based on impact on company financials. 

Separately, we also embarked on our inaugural pilot assessment of 

physical risk in 2019 for a sample population of IBG customers across 

the selected carbon intensive sectors, namely energy and metals &amp; 

mining, referencing three future climate change scenarios that are 

based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 

representative concentration pathways then. 

Collectively, these pilot studies represent our initial steps in 

delivering our climate commitments. We continue our journey in 

2021 and made steady progress to identify, assess, measure, and 

integrate climate-related risks into our customer and portfolio 

management strategies. More significantly, we established a Climate 

Steering Committee, co-chaired by the Group Chief Risk Officer, 

Group Head of IBG and the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), with 

representatives from IBG, Risk, Finance, and the CSO office, to put 

together a comprehensive climate risk roadmap through several 

key workstreams, such as governance, client engagement, credit 

underwriting and integration, risk appetite, scenario analysis and 

disclosures.

Identifying the impact of climate risks  

DBS views climate risk as a material risk that can manifest across the 

mainstream risk types. Among the many other risk types, such as 

market, liquidity, operational, and reputation, credit risk, which mainly 

arises from lending activities to corporate, institutional, and retail 

customers, represents the most significant quantifiable risk impacted 

by climate change. The relatively longer time horizon over which 

climate change risk impact is manifested also renders credit risk most 

significant amongst the above risk types.

For example, climate change can have credit risk implications via 

two transmission channels:

• Transition risk – potential impact of changes in public policies, 

disruptive technological developments, and shifts in consumer 

and investor preferences, due to decarbonisation transition, on 

borrowers’ profitability, cashflows and asset values.

• Physical risk – potential impact of event driven (acute) climate 

events and longer-term shifts (chronic) in climate patterns, 

on borrower’s operations (such as supply chain disruption), 

profitability, and potentially, their viability, and the value of assets 

taken as collateral.

Preliminary estimates of financed emissions

To date, we have completed the preliminary estimates of our 

financed emissions for five of our nine priority sectors, and we 

continue to work on the remaining sectors, paving the way to develop 

credible decarbonisation pathways to engage with our customers. 

The table below shows our preliminary results for the five sectors 

based on work to-date, which illustrates DBS’ estimates of Scope 3 

financed emissions in emission intensities and compares with the 

2020 reference baseline scenarios, in line with the NZBA guidelines. 

In general, the estimated emissions are within the limits of the 

respective reference scenarios, except the aviation sector, as the 

baseline emissions intensity was distorted due to reduced passenger 

air travel as a result of the pandemic. 

Aligning our portfolio

Building on the foundation we have laid since 2018 when we first 

began measuring our financed emissions across selected carbon-

intensive customers, we continue to share our progress in measuring 

and steering our IBG lending portfolio to align with our climate 

commitments. We have expanded the scope of our assessment to 

cover the nine priority sectors, based on their relative exposure in 

our IBG portfolio and their significance with regard to heightened 

climate risks. 

In 2020, we studied a sample population of 414 customers that 

accounted for no more than 10% of our total IBG portfolio. In 

2021, we expanded our Scope 3 financed emissions quantification 

by adopting a bottom-up activity-based approach to cover close 

to 3,000 listed and non-listed companies across our nine priority 

sectors, representing approximately 34% of IBG portfolio as at 

August 2021, a marked increase from the previous year.

Portfolio alignment

For customers relying on fossil-fuel power generation, the bulk of 

carbon emissions is generated from thermal combustion resulting 

in Scope 1 GHG emissions. In contrast, for renewable equipment 

manufacturers, Scope 3 emissions arising from use of raw materials 

such as metals and minerals, represented more than 90% of the 

total GHG emissions. For the segment of renewable equipment 

manufacturers, only Scope 3 emissions were accounted for.  

In accordance with our plan to phase out thermal coal financing 

completely by 2039, we have started to reduce the emissions 

intensity of our power portfolio, hence we are well positioned to meet 

the net-zero pathway. As per our commitments, we will stop financing 

customers who derive more than 50% of revenue from thermal coal 

from 2026, except for their non-thermal coal or renewable energy 

activities. The graph below shows different scenarios under which 

our power portfolio could be benchmarked against both IEA net-zero 

global pathway and a localized Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) 

pathway covering China, India, and Southeast Asia through to 2030 

and 2050.  While both of the reference pathways converge to net-

zero, IEA NZE presents a more ambitious glidepath likely reaching 

net-zero around 2040.

Sectors in focus: Power sector 

Transition risk scenario analyses 

The power sector has been one of the earliest and fastest to 

decarbonise, yet not all companies within the sector have taken 

sufficient action. Companies that have already started greening their 

power generation today are best placed to do well under multiple 

climate transition scenarios. 

The power generation model focuses on the impact of a given 

company’s adaptive response, whether the company invests in 

renewables in a manner that maintains its current market share of 

generation in an increasingly green landscape. Company transition 

performance is heavily dependent on its energy type, regulation 

status, baseline generation carbon intensity, and baseline financial 

position.

For example, renewable power companies are expected to 

transition better, given their head start on low carbon footprints at 

the baseline year as well as their emission status, decarbonisation 

strategies, and other external regulatory requirements in a net-zero 

transition. As the volumes of renewables are projected to grow 

steadily with the market over the projection horizon amid increases 

in electricity prices, upgrades in ratings are expected due to the 

improved financial performances over time, indicated by improved 

assets, cash, and increased earnings.

On the other hand, conventional power companies in regulated 

markets are expected to perform worse than peers. These companies  

are generally reliant on conventional sources (e.g., coal) at the baseline  

and usually operate in regulated environments. Analysis suggests 

that these companies would have difficulty maintaining their volumes 

with decarbonisation of the power market. These companies are 

expected to see reductions in profits and earnings. This, along with 

increased liabilities, inabilities to pass-on costs amid higher carbon 

price and increased debts over the horizon, will likely result in rating 

downgrades from the baseline.

Portfolio alignment

For the Automotive sector, in line with the IEA reference scenarios, 

our approach focuses on Scope 3 emissions associated with 

passenger vehicles only, whose emissions profile is largely made up 

of tailpipe emissions (&gt;80%). The graph below shows the different  

scenarios under which our automotive portfolio could be benchmarked  

against the IEA net-zero pathway through to 2030 and 2050.  With 

increasing production and sales of Battery Electric Vehicles and Fuel 

Cell Electric Vehicles, the automotive sector has begun its transition.

1

Portfolio continues to perform at status quo

2

Partial fulfilment of commitments by countries and OEMs

3

Fulfilment of all public targets announced by OEMs and countries

4

Industry matches pace of decarbonisation set by market-leading OEM

Sectors in focus: Automotive sector 

Transition risk scenario analyses 

The automotive model focuses on Original Equipment Manufacturers 

(OEMs) of passenger and light commercial vehicles. OEMs are 

exposed to climate risk primarily due to the transition away from 

internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and towards electric 

vehicles (EVs). This is driven by the confluence of (i) declining EV 

battery costs which will lead to more competitive EV prices and 

greater adoptions of EVs, and (ii) higher ICE total costs of ownership 

(TCO) as fuel prices rise under the scenario carbon prices, as well as 

higher ICE manufacturing costs due to rising fuel economy standards. 

Companies with significant current EV volumes or growth trajectory 

see smaller impacts as increased EV sales offset declining ICE vehicle 

sales and they achieve EV scale more quickly. Companies lagging in 

EV production or without strong financials to fund EV growth see 

larger negative impacts.

Based on a sample of companies analysed, companies with higher 

total R&amp;D/ revenues, strong financial positions and positive EV 

margins at the baseline year are expected to transition better. This is 

broadly due to the improved profitability of these companies as they 

transition to EVs due to lower incremental R&amp;D spends, improved EV 

margins as the unit costs of EV come down with reduction in battery 

pack costs, and strong starting financial positions that enable these 

companies to fund the transition to EVs without accruing significant 

debt.

Meanwhile, our preliminary results, suggests that companies with 

lower R&amp;D/ revenues and lower EV gross margins are expected to 

perform worse than their peers. While EV gross margins are also 

expected to improve with time due to lower battery pack costs, 

these companies risk making losses, especially during the transition 

to adopting EVs where EV prices may be held lower and there are 

requirements to fund investments, thereby in general worsening the 

financial strength of these companies.

Portfolio in focus – Palm Oil 

At DBS, we serve customers who demonstrate alignment with no 

deforestation, no peat, and no exploitation (NDPE) commitments 

and/ or to the principles and criteria of the Roundtable on 

Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). All our palm oil customers have aligned 

themselves with either NDPE or RSPO, or both. We expect our 

borrowers to achieve these commitments and certifications fully 

within a defined timeframe. 

The chart below shows our palm oil exposure breakdown by our 

customers’ activities along the value chain: upstream, midstream, 

trading and integrated. 

*Notes: Upstream refers to customers involved in cultivation and harvesting. 

Midstream includes customers involved in buying fresh fruit bunch from other 

parties, milling and palm kernel crushing and refining facilities. Integrated 

customers are those with material business activities across multiple stages of 

the value chain and scale. Trading customers are primarily engaged in buying 

and selling of palm oil and its derivates.  

In the past few years, we have deepened our monitoring and 

engagement for palm oil customers to allow us to better gauge their 

sustainability performance – for example, their forestry risk policies, 

supply chain issues, community rights and grievance mechanisms 

they make available for their communities and stakeholders. After 

our initial risk assessments, where necessary, extensive due diligence 

is conducted on customers’ operations. Several avenues are used 

by our sustainability team to review evidence of sustainability 

performance and commitments. We review standard operating 

procedures, certifications, permits and approvals, conduct site visits 

where possible and sometimes seek independent third-party expert 

opinion to identify environmental and social impacts.  

Where there are gaps in meeting our ESG criteria, the sustainability 

team along with the RM and relevant credit teams welcome open 

dialogue with our customers. In 2021, we have had customers 

coming under scrutiny for allegations on labour issues and 

environmental damages. Where investigation of these concerns and 

engagement with the customers still leads to the conclusion that our 

ESG requirements are not being met, they will be placed on an exit 

pathway, or we will have to decline extending new facilities for them. 

For others, time-bound action plans may be agreed upon to mitigate 

the risks. During the year, we have placed three customers under 

review to evaluate an appropriate exit strategy should they not be 

able to meet our ESG requirements. 

As of December 2021, our exposure to the Palm Oil sector remained 

at SGD 1.6 billion [2020: SGD 1.6 billion], representing 0.3% [2020: 

0.3%] of total IBG exposure.

Portfolio in focus: Thermal Coal 

Our exposure to thermal coal-fired power plants and thermal coal 

mining at the end of 2021 were SGD 1.52 and SGD 1.14 billion, 

respectively, representing 0.26% and 0.20% of total IBG exposure. 

In view of our latest commitment to stop financing customers who 

derive more than 50% of revenue from thermal coal from January 

2026, we expanded our reporting scope for 2021 to include facilities 

at the corporate level that fall within this criterion and threshold, 

resulting in a slight increase in our exposure to coal-fired power plants. 

Without the expansion of the reporting scope, our exposure to coal-

fired power plants would have decreased year-on-year.

As a comparison against our coal-fired power exposure, the 

exposure to renewable energy developments continued to increase, 

such that at the end of 2021, our exposure was SGD 5.87 billion, 

representing 1% of total IBG exposure.

Since we made a commitment to completely phase out thermal  

coal financing by 2039, we expect our exposure to this portfolio  

to steadily shrink over time (see time series charts below).

An illustration: Tapping energy transition opportunities  

in Australia

Australia is at the forefront of a global energy transition, with a clear 

commitment to phase out thermal coal power that is supported 

by both government and businesses. In Australia, the pathways to 

decarbonization include a significant build-up of renewable energy 

generation capacity to replace fossil fuels, as well as commercializing 

new technologies such as hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels for 

domestic use and exports. 

During 2021, our Australian franchise has more than halved its exposure  

to existing thermal coal related customers. The remaining exposure 

has been placed on an orderly exit pathway to be stepped down over the  

coming years. This year, DBS has continued to support our customers  

in Australia as they lead the energy transition process. We have 

funded the development of our customers’ wind farms, solar farms 

and industrial-scale battery storage facilities. We have also financed 

institutional investors who have acquired greenfield and operating 

renewable energy assets to advance their environmental agenda.

The two immediate charts below illustrate the total sustainability 

financing transactions (excluding renewables) breakdown by markets 

and industry types. 

Our sustainable financing target also includes facilitating the 

development of renewable energy projects that will help mitigate 

the effects of climate change and deliver the essential growth in 

energy supply. We committed close to SGD 1.1 billion of renewable 

and clean energy financing comprising a mix of solar, wind and 

dedicated transmission lines.  

Empowering and supporting clients in their transition

As we empower our customers along their decarbonisation journeys, 

we are able to reap new financing opportunities to accelerate the 

transition to net-zero. These opportunities for our large corporate 

and institutional customers can be categorised into (1) sustainable 

financing, (2) sustainable trade financing, (3) capital market financing, 

and 4) other green financing schemes for smaller businesses. Details 

are highlighted in the four sections below. 

1. Sustainable financing 

In 2021, a total of SGD 20.5 billion of sustainable finance transactions(1) 

were committed, representing 3.5% of total IBG financing. 

Cumulatively we have committed SGD 39.4 billion in sustainable 

financing transactions, and we are on track to exceed our sustainable 

financing target of SGD 50 billion by 2024. The sustainable finance 

transactions are in alignment with our Sustainable and Transition 

Finance Framework and Taxonomy, as well as other international 

best practice guidelines, such as the Loan Market Association, Social 

Loan Principles, Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles, among others.

Sustainable Finance transactions showing cumulative amount of DBS’ portion  

of financing from 2018 to 2021

Notably, our sustainable finance transactions in 2021 continued to 

be dominated by sustainability-linked loans, which amounted to 

about SGD 12.4 billion, almost triple the amount compared to the 

previous year. Green loans followed closely amounting to about 

SGD 6.9 billion. 

During the year, we saw a continued trends of strong sustainable 

finance products uptake in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, while 

in Korea we observe a rising interest in decarbonisation financing.

(1)  Sustainable financing transactions include-

2. Sustainable trade financing 

While the pandemic has caused widespread supply chain disruptions, 

we witnessed a remarkable increase in interest in sustainable supply 

chain financing(3).  Sustainable supply chain financing not only fulfils 

key sustainability objectives of anchor buyers but also incentivises 

contributors in their value chains (i.e., suppliers) to do good. There 

are intangible benefits, such as cementing the mutually beneficial 

relationship between anchor buyers and suppliers, building resilience 

in supply chain in today’s volatile environment and driving industry-

wide ripple effect promoting positive changes across the industry.   

In 2021, close to SGD 1.6 billion of assets were delivered in new 

green and sustainable trade finance deals covering green Bank 

Guarantees and Letter of Credits supporting the renewable energy 

project and equipment companies. 

Last year, Green Fixed Deposits were launched as a pilot project in 

China and India for corporate clients who want to make purposeful 

deposits to address long-term environmental challenges. We are 

guided by our commitment to achieve a positive impact through 

our products for our clients. Increasingly, as more customers are 

aware of the importance of ESG and want to direct their long and 

short-term assets towards financial solutions that have a positive 

environmental and societal impact. Our goal is to expand this pilot to 

other markets in which we operate. The total green deposits in 2021 

amounted to SGD 33 million from markets such as China and India. 

Sustainable trade finance, SGD millions (2019 to 2021)

Cementing our position in the market, we were recognised by ranking 

first as Mandated Lead Arranger for green and sustainability-linked 

loans in Debtwire’s Loans League Table. We were also recognised on  

Bloomberg League Tables by ranking first for green loans for the Green  

Use of Proceeds (UOP) loan category in APAC excluding Japan and 

first for sustainability-linked loans as a participant in APAC. Our efforts  

in driving direct sustainable financing also resulted in us being recognised  

in Global Finance’s inaugural Sustainable Finance Awards. We swept  

eight categories both globally and regionally, including overall “Outstanding  

Leadership in Sustainable Finance for Asia Pacific”, in August 2021.  

Transition financing: Sustainability-linked loans with  

performance metrics tied to low-carbon transition 

Transition financing is designed to drive decarbonisation and 

accelerate the shift to a low-carbon future. As an NZBA member 

committed to net-zero financed emissions by 2050, we motivate 

our customers to come onboard on this important journey. Our 

approach to transition financing balances economic development 

with climate action urgency. 

In 2021, some of the notable transition finance transactions we 

completed were: 

•   The proceeds from a sustainability-linked facility totalling SGD 

150 million for Toyota Financial Services are used to  

grow Toyota’s Electrified Vehicle(2) sales in Singapore. 

Supporting the transition of the automotive sector towards a 

lower carbon future is an enormous opportunity in Singapore. 

•  A SGD 500 million sustainability-linked loan supports Sembcorp 

Marine’s strategic transformation to increase revenue from 

innovative engineering solutions to the global offshore, marine 

and energy industries, with a focus on cleaner, greener and 

renewable energy solutions.  

•  In India, Reliance Industries is transitioning into using more 

renewable energy to power its operations. It has initiated a 

pilot project of co-firing biomass with coal that addresses the 

problem of farmers in managing organic waste which creates 

extensive air, water and soil pollution. DBS has joined Reliance 

in this pilot project which is expected to grow over the next 

year to support Reliance’s conversion away from coal. 

•  Going beyond Singapore and ASEAN: A total of seven deals  

were concluded in Korea, including a sustainability-linked loan  

with SK Telecom and the transition-labelled deal with Korea 

Railroad Corporation.

(2)  

 Toyota has established a full line-up of electrified vehicles―namely, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs),  

plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs)

(3)  

 Sustainable trade finance include: Letter of credits, Bank guarantees, Supplier Payment Services (SPS)

(4)  

 Sustainable trade finance transaction includes: 

 

 

 -  Green Trade Finance: Instruments such as Banker’s Guarantee, Letters of Credit and Confirmation for projects or transactions that has positive contribution to environment.

 

 

 -  Sustainability-linked Trade Finance: Adjusting our financial conditions to achieve pre-defined sustainability performance targets agreed with clients. For 

example, Sustainability-linked Supply Chain Financing includes differential pricing to incentivise supplier base to work towards joint sustainability goals.

 

 

 -  Transition Trade Financing: To support our customers move towards less carbon intensive options by financing their ‘transition’ activities as defined by DBS’ 

Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework and Taxonomy leveraging our trade finance instruments.

Project finance transaction details for Category A projects

 Adani Green Energy Limited is a hybrid wind-and-solar power project 

in India. A detailed Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) 

was conducted to identify, manage, and mitigate the environmental 

and social risks of the project in accordance with IFC Performance 

Standards, World Bank’s (WB) General and Sector specific EHS 

Guidelines, as well as the WB’s EHS Guidelines for Wind Energy 

projects. Additional studies such as Critical Habitat Assessment and 

a Bird-Bat monitoring study were conducted as such projects could 

pose a risk to biodiversity in the area. 

PT Halmahera Persada Lygend Nickel-Cobalt Processing Plant 

in Indonesia conducted an Environment and Social Impact 

Assessment (ESIA) to identify and mitigate concerns related to 

air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, amongst others. Since the 

project is situated within a habitat with the presence of species of 

biodiversity value, a Biodiversity Action Plan has been developed 

for conservation and sustainable management of species. The ESIA 

has identified potential concerns with regard to tailings discharge, 

typical wastewater produced by the mining sector, thus a hydrology 

and hydrogeology study was also conducted to provide additional 

information on managing and protecting freshwater in the vicinity.

The following charts provide further breakdown of the ESG bonds 

DBS underwrote and distributed in 2021 by industry and type:  

In November 2021, DBS was selected into the International 

Capital Market Association’s (ICMA) 2021/ 2022 Advisory Council 

of the Green Bond Principles and Social Bond Principles Executive 

Committee, the only Asian lead manager in the 40-member Advisory 

Council. The selection is a recognition of DBS’ continual efforts and 

strong commitments in promoting sustainable finance and market 

adoption of the ICMA Principles.

4. Other green financing schemes for smaller businesses

Despite growing interest and demand in going green, building a 

sustainability agenda is challenging for time and resource-strapped 

small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To help them realise 

their ambition, we also offer other green financing schemes to 

empower SMEs through sustainability-linked initiatives. 

For example, DBS is one of the partner institutions in the Enterprise 

Financing Scheme-Green, a programme to support Singapore 

companies that develop green technologies. DBS has committed 

to lending funds to these companies by undertaking risk sharing 

of 70%. These will help lift sectors including clean energy, circular 

economy, infrastructure, and clean transportation. 

One SME customer who has taken up the Enterprise Financing 

Scheme-Green loan is Terrenus Energy, a Singapore-based 

renewable energy solutions provider. As the sole principal banker, 

DBS provided a loan of SGD 13.6 million to Terrenus Energy to install 

40,000 portable solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on available land and 

linkways in Changi Business Park, spanning an area of 116,000m2 and 

3,200m2 respectively.

DBS is also one of the banks that provided a SGD 85.8 million green 

loan to Sunseap, a Singapore-based solar energy solutions provider, 

to enable the company to build a solar PV system across more than 

1,200 public housing apartments and 49 government sites.

3. Capital markets financing

Given the significant financing required to reach net-zero as we 

support a green recovery and just transition, we are expanding the 

suite of solutions to scale up such financial flows. Through the use 

of green, social and sustainable bonds (collectively we define as ESG 

bonds), we aim to unlock institutional investors’ balance sheets to 

channel more capital markets financing towards sustainable and 

climate-resilient projects and businesses.

Leveraging our extensive fixed income franchise, DBS continued to 

promote and drive the Asia ESG bond markets, raising close to SGD 

23.5 billion for our customers in 2021. This is more than double the 

proceeds raised in the previous year. Cumulatively, over the last five 

years, DBS has facilitated the issuance of over SGD 41 billion in ESG 

bonds to support various sustainability initiatives of our customers.

We have also expanded our product innovation to cater to the 

different sustainability and financial strategies of issuers. Beyond 

bond underwriting and placement services, DBS acted as the 

sustainability advisor for many of these ESG bond transactions, 

providing expert advice to structure ambitious and innovative 

sustainability elements that take into account their unique business 

and sustainability conditions as well as investors and other 

stakeholders’ expectations. 

In 2021, some of the notable transactions that DBS was involved in as 

a bookrunner or sustainability advisor include:

• National Environment Agency SGD 1.65 billion green bonds, 

the first green bonds issued by a Singapore statutory board 

and the longest tenor unrated public green bond in Asia ex-

Japan, where proceeds will be used to finance sustainable waste 

management projects in direct support of the Singapore Green 

Plan 2030. 

• PT Japfa Comfeed Indonesia USD 350 million sustainability-

linked bond, the first sustainability-linked bond from the global 

agri-food industry, which entails commitments made by our 

customer to construct eight water recycling facilities to address 

material water impacts within the next four years.

• New Development Bank’s two series of sustainable 

development goals (SDG) bonds issued in the China Interbank 

Bond Market. These SDG bonds were structured in alignment 

with UNDP Sustainable Development Goals Impact Standards for 

Bonds and China’s Technical Report on Sustainable Development 

Goals Finance Taxonomy, and the proceeds raised from their 

issuances will be used to finance infrastructure and sustainable 

development projects in the emerging markets that are members 

of New Development Bank.

• CPI Ronghe Financial Leasing RMB1,038 million factoring 

contract-based green asset-backed securitisation, with the 

raised fundings used to support the business development of the 

issuer group in green industries. Our newly established securities 

joint venture in China, DBS Securities (China), acted as a joint global  

coordinator for the transaction. Notably, this transaction marks 

the first green ABS completed in the exchange market in China.

• Green car loan  

Against the backdrop of having more electric vehicles entering 

the market, DBS introduced Singapore’s first green car loan in 

February 2021. The green car loan offers an attractive rate (i.e., 

1.68% p.a., or an effective interest rate of 3.20% p.a. based on a 

7-year loan tenure) to all customers purchasing both new and 

used electric and hybrid vehicles.  

• Green renovation loan 

Another key component to the package is the green renovation 

loan catered for property owners seeking more eco-friendly 

homes. Our rate of 3.68 % per annum is one of the industry’s 

lowest for such a loan, compared to the average market rate of a 

non-green loan at about 4% per annum. Evidenced by the strong 

demand, these green loans comprise more than 80% of DBS’ new 

renovation loans as of December 2021.  

• Rewards for eco-friendly purchases 

We also launched our first eco-friendly credit card, DBS Live Fresh 

Card, which rewards cardmembers when they patronise selected 

eco-friendly and sustainable businesses. As of December 2021, it 

is the only card in Singapore offering more attractive cashback 

rewards on sustainable spend (for example, an average of 5% as 

compared to the average market cashback of 2%). 

 

Currently, there are a total of 30 sustainable merchants, consisting 

of seven Singapore-based social enterprises (SEs) championed 

by the DBS Foundation. We continually seek to onboard more 

SEs within our Green Cashback programme, which includes eco-

friendly categories such as eateries, retailers, and transportation 

services.  

Nurturing healthy savings and investment habits

We leverage strategic partnerships and digital platforms to afford 

retail customers in Singapore a consolidated view of their assets and 

liabilities and help nurture healthy savings and investment habits. At 

DBS, we aim to democratise wealth and lower the barrier to entry 

by making our retail products and services accessible to the masses 

through digital banking, robot-assisted portfolios, regular savings 

plans, and budgeting tools.

NAV Planner 

To encourage more efficient financial planning, we improved the 

capability and functionality of DBS NAV Planner. The new offering 

leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time hyper-personalised 

experience to generate over 30 million insights, empowering eight in 

10 retail customers to take their first steps in investing. 

Alongside NAV Planner that allows customers to view their financial 

health at a glance, the SGFinDex afforded these features to become 

even more comprehensive. First launched in December 2020, the 

SGFinDex has enabled NAV Planner users to consolidate their 

Our approach

We aim to deliver accessible consumer banking solutions tailored to 

meet the needs of our customers, while making positive impacts by: 

• Setting customers on the path of sustainable living 

To encourage more sustainable lifestyles among customers,  

we  provided accessible green offerings that are highly competitive 

and easy to adopt.  

• Nurturing healthy savings and investment habits 

To enhance accessibility to financial planning resources and tools, 

we lowered the barrier to entry to banking services and wealth 

management through digital platforms and strategic partnerships.  

• Empowering sustainable and ESG investing   

To increase sustainable investing and create impact through 

financing among private banking and wealth clients, we curated a 

suite of sustainable portfolios that consider ESG risks and ratings. 

Initiatives

Setting customers on the path of sustainable living

In Singapore, we encourage the cultivation of a sustainable mindset 

of our retail customers by making green finance products and 

sustainability knowledge easily accessible. We actively engage with 

them to understand their aspirations and what they want from green 

solutions. 

DBS LiveBetter platform 

In October 2021, DBS launched a new sustainability initiative, 

LiveBetter, a platform to build a better world together with our 

retail customers. Insights from our research and customer surveys 

indicated that majority (73%) are willing to change lifestyles and take 

sustainable actions, citing convenience as the major pull factor. 

Initial key offerings under this new platform include:

1)  Invest Better – Easy access to funds that invest in renewable 

energy and other eco-friendly initiatives 

2)  Give Better – Donate to organisations that support 

environmental and social causes 

By the end of the year, LiveBetter has attracted more than 100,000 

customers, who invested approximately SGD 2.5 million in green funds  

and donated over SGD 60,000 towards environmental and social causes.

DBS Green Solutions package 

In the same year, we also introduced DBS Green Solutions package, a 

holistic suite of sustainable living solutions that comprises innovative 

offerings for customers to integrate green practices into their 

lifestyles, such as transportation, payments, and purchases. Some 

noteworthy offerings include:

With this in mind, we define Sustainable Investments as those with 

MSCI ESG-ratings of BBB and above, and carry this throughout our 

in-house portfolios as with our flagship products. Some noteworthy 

examples include DBS CIO Barbell Income Fund, DBS CIO Barbell 

Index Note, DBS I.D.E.A. Fund (A-rated), and DBS ESG Focus Note 

(AA-rated).

We strive to grow our Sustainable Investment AUM (SI AUM) as 

embodiment of this philosophy in our advisory process with clients 

and we set a target to reach 50%, as well as to ensure we maintain 

this as a baseline and grow it further. We started this target with a 

baseline end 2020 of 46.8% and are proud to have exceeded 50% 

within the 12 months, reaching 53% by end 2021.

To keep us focused on growing our SI AUM, we have adopted a data-  

driven operating model (DDOM) with an ESG Control Tower and  

Dashboard (see figure below) to track and monitor the performance  

of the corresponding levers, drivers, and desired outcome. 

Adopting more sustainable business practices 

More than 80% of Southeast-Asian businesses are family-owned(5), 

which places our clients at the privileged position of being able to 

bring sustainable change to their businesses and communities. 

We aim to advocate for sustainability and bring them along in this 

journey of managing ESG risks and transitioning their businesses 

to more sustainable practices by collaborating with our IBG 

Sustainability champions. We believe this synergistic engagement 

will be an extension of our capabilities in bridging the personal and 

business needs of our wealth clients, while leveraging our cross 

departmental and collaborative efforts. 

Encouraging venture philanthropy

An increasing area of passion for our clients is to be able to leave a 

legacy in their communities. While Asian clients are more traditionally 

used to cash donations, we aim to marry their passion with our belief 

in building value chains of impact by supporting businesses focused 

on creating impact outcomes for societies and the environment. To 

do so, we actively support the social enterprises (SEs) in partnership 

with the DBS Foundation, and offer our clients the options of 

supporting SEs via grants or by creating meaningful partnerships with 

the SEs to mentor and scale their businesses.

gain a more holistic view of their finances and investment. This is 

the nation’s first open banking use case in collaboration with the 

Monetary Authority of Singapore and Govtech, with the goal of 

helping Singaporeans better plan and manage their finances. 

In recognition of the bank’s digital efforts, DBS was awarded the 

“Recognition of Excellence” award for “Map your money” interactive 

dashboard during the annual Singapore Recognition of Excellence 

Awards 2021.

DBS digiPortfolio

Driving the democratise of investing, our DBS digiPortfolio remains a 

key cornerstone of the bank’s efforts to make portfolio management 

services accessible to the masses.  

Since its launch in 2019, investments through digiPortfolio 

continue to demonstrate strong growth, fuelled by demand from a 

predominately Gen Z and Millennial demographic. With the minimum 

investment at SGD 1,000, these investors typically start with smaller 

amounts before progressively topping up their portfolios. Comparing 

year on year, asset under management (AUM) in digiPortfolio has 

also doubled. 

Empowering sustainable and ESG investing

In the past year, we saw growing awareness and interest among 

our private banking clients on sustainability and its related issues. 

Our close relationship with them helps open conversations around 

how they can leave a legacy of good with a holistic approach for 

embracing sustainability across their personal investments, their 

businesses, and via a more thoughtful and deliberate act of venture 

philanthropy.

Creating sustainable portfolios

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings reflect the 

resilience of a company in managing and addressing ESG risks. 

Our sustainable investing philosophy places ESG as one of the 

important selection criteria for investments products, while primary 

consideration remains a sound investment case and potential for 

investment returns.

to avail bank accounts as part of the Work Pass Issuance process for 

WPHs. The bank holds 81% market share of the MW accounts and 

66% market share of the MDW accounts, which are mainly opened 

through MOM’s portal for the purpose of salary payment.  

In recognition of our efforts made and impact created for the migrant 

workers, the Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM) awarded DBS 

the MOM Valued Partner Award at the inaugural MOM Partners’ 

Appreciation Event in November 2021. We are humbled to be the 

only bank to receive this award among nine other recipients.  

Simple Mode Interface – An enhanced digibanking feature 

The DBS digibank app introduced a new feature that allows 

users to switch between the full digibank interface and a simpler 

user interface. This includes having a choice of bigger fonts and 

icons for easier viewing. This feature has enabled customers with 

simpler banking needs to customise their user interfaces with 

the relevant applications to focus on their priority banking and 

financial needs. 

First launched in 2020, the Simple Mode Interface has reduced 

digital barriers to entry and allowed quick access to commonly 

used services among our MDWs. In 2021, the feature was 

enhanced to boost digital confidence among our senior retail 

customers. With the rapid digitalisation of banking services, we 

are committed to ensure that the less digitally savvy communities, 

such as the elderly, are not left behind.

Hawkers 

The pandemic has widened the income and wealth gap, which 

marginalises certain segments of the community, weakens social 

cohesion and undermines prospects for an inclusive recovery. To 

support and safeguard the livelihoods of local hawkers and small 

food stallholders impacted by the pandemic in Singapore, DBS has 

rolled our various programmes in 2021 to create a more enabling 

digital environment and help them gain better online discovery as 

they embark on the journey of digitalisation.

For example, the Makansutra Food Initiative, initiated by CBG 

Singapore, supports local hawkers by purchasing meals and drinks 

from them and re-distributing them to hospital staff, migrant 

domestic workers, and other lower-income WPH and residents. 

Meanwhile, the DBS PayLah! banking app introduced a new feature, 

Hawkerpedia, which includes a suite of promotions, reviews, and 

other initiatives to rally support from retail consumers and drive 

businesses to local hawker and food stallholders. 

Our approach

We want to ensure more segments of the community have access to 

useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their 

needs and are delivered in a responsible and sustainable manner. 

We aim to democratise wealth by: 

• Creating an enabling environment for the underbanked 

To expand our reach to low-income individuals or groups who are 

typically excluded from traditional banking

• Addressing the financing gap for small businesses 

To improve financing for underserved local small- and medium-

enterprises (SMEs) and social enterprises (SEs) to build capabilities 

and capacities and scale businesses

Initiatives 

Creating an enabling environment for the underbanked

Financial inclusion involves increasing the number of individuals 

with access to formal financial systems mainly through owning bank 

accounts, which empowers them and contributes to better overall 

economic growth. While the cost of access has been very high in the 

past, the rapid advancement in digital technologies today is changing 

the way we democratise wealth efficiently.

Leveraging digital tools and services, we increase the accessibility  

of the underbanked to transaction accounts. We believe that this  

is a necessary first step towards greater financial inclusion, as 

transaction accounts serve as a gateway to many other banking  

and financial services. 

Work Permit Holders

In Singapore, Work Permit Holders (WPH), which comprise Migrant 

Domestic Workers (MDW) and Migrant Workers (MW), keep many 

of our businesses, services, and households running; however they 

are considered among our most vulnerable residents. We continue 

to onboard WPHs into the formal banking system through our 

collaboration with the Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM), 

especially as the pandemic entered its second year.  

Through POSB, we assist WPHs in setting up accesses to digital 

banking services (for salary payments, remittance, and online 

purchases). Digital guides are provided in their native languages to 

ensure that the WPHs are not impeded by language barriers. 

We also partner the Singapore Ministry of Manpower’s Assurance, 

Care and Engagement (MOM ACE) group in offering free physical and 

virtual awareness-raising workshops, and share the basics of digital 

banking to protect against online scams and fraud. POSB also works 

with online communities, such as Indonesian Family Networking 

Singapore (IFN Singapore) and Filipinos In Singapore (FIS), promoting 

digibanking, safe online banking, and cashless payments. 

POSB partners the Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) to set up physical 

booths and dedicated helplines at the Migrant Workers Centre

Capability and capacity building 

Given the limited access to financing typically, SME owners and 

SEs often lack financial resources and time to organically build 

capabilities and upskill their employees. As such, DBS continues to 

run free training programmes for our SME banking customers and 

DBS BusinessClass members, as well as mentorship programmes for 

our SEs. 

Through DBS BusinessClass, our regional business community 

programme, we scale our efforts in helping SME owners upskill their 

employees on topics such as accounting and Human Resource (HR) 

and digital marketing. DBS BusinessClass turned six in 2021, and by 

the end of the year we have engaged with over 200,000 members 

across our six core markets. 

As one of the pioneers of the Start Digital programme, we believe 

that every start-up should have access to affordable tech-driven 

solutions to support their business growth and expansion, and that 

SMEs can easily kickstart their digitalisation journeys. In 2021, almost 

900 SMEs have signed up for our Start Digital package. 

In 2021, we also rolled out the SE mentorship programme, which 

benefitted over 50 SEs across our core markets. We believe that 

the pairing of a senior and junior relationship manager instils a 

deeper sense of purpose in our younger staff, and we believe those 

experiences will shape their mindsets as they grow and develop 

professionally with us. 

Digitalisation is also becoming the norm for many small businesses 

and SEs, and increasing their exposure to cybercrime. To help 

businesses mitigate these risks, DBS has availed a free online 

cybersecurity training programme to SMEs, SEs, and charities in 

2021. To date, over 50 companies and their 3,500 employees have 

undergone training. 

In particular, DBS launched the pilot programme, Adopt a Hawker 

Centre, in September 2021 to tap on the concept of “group buys” 

from affected hawkers to raise the online discoverability of their 

businesses. Food stallholders, who operated among the inaugural 

hawker centres under the programme, have seen earnings improve 

by 15 to 30 per cent. Encouraged by the strong demand, DBS has 

committed to scaling up the programme in 2022 by adding more 

hawker centres to support. Ultimately, we strive to boost the income 

of pandemic-hit hawkers and grow their business presence on 

social media and other online platforms as we leverage the rapid 

advancement in digital technologies today. 

Addressing the financing gap of small businesses

Providing working capital financing

As the pandemic heavily impacted lives and livelihoods, small local 

businesses are increasingly focusing on ensuring sufficient cash 

flow and manpower, while trying to pivot to new income streams. In 

2021, we doubled down on our support for our SME customers and 

social enterprises (SEs) across our core markets, ensuring they have 

seamless access to capital and resources. In support of SEs, we have 

disbursed over SGD 13.4 million in loans at preferential rates. We 

strive to provide them with the necessary working capital support 

and ecosystem partnership opportunities to not only tide through 

this challenging period, but grow beyond the pandemic and adopt 

sustainable practices to scale their businesses more effectively. 

Improved quality and availability of credit information is a key factor 

for SMEs to access formal financing, including reduced collateral 

requirements and borrowing costs. Through our online platform, 

the loan application process of green lane customers – SMEs that 

provide the necessary credit information digitally and can easily apply  

for a loan within minutes – has been accelerated. In 2021, we have  

approved over 4,200 loans totalling SGD 1.1 billion to SMEs in Singapore,  

with over 95% of the loans going to micro and small businesses.

Case study

In addition to offering rewards and promotions for PayLah! users 

when they buy their meals from hawkers, PayLah! further helped 

hawkers who may be struggling during the pandemic or may not be 

savvy enough to market themselves. The DBS PayLah! Hidden Gem 

Hawker Awards was created to champion and appreciate underrated 

hawkers that have worked hard to serve delectable food which have 

contributed to our unique local hawker culture. 

We have also partnered with Hawkers United, the largest hawker 

Facebook group in Singapore, to bring awareness to the awards &amp; to 

rally support from fellow hawker food lovers.

The awards campaign included three phases:

1.  Nomination: Users shared their favourite hawkers and 

nominated them via PayLah!

2.  Voting: Shortlisted hawkers were featured and members of the 

public were asked to support and vote for winners

3.  Winners’ announcement: Winning hawkers won a grand cash 

prize of SGD 3,000, and were assisted with onboarding onto WhyQ. 

They also gained marketing exposure sponsored by PayLah!

The campaign garnered a total of 4.1 million video and posts 

impressions, 1,914 nominations, 4,018 votes, and positive verbatim 

from winning hawkers and social media influencers.

employee movement to galvanise and help employees remain 

connected during the pandemic. With the pandemic becoming 

more protracted, we further energised our TOGETHER movement 

in 2021 with a series of new initiatives focused on getting our 

employees to take care of their own well-being and show care and 

concern for one another.

• A year-long iHealth Festival was launched to encourage our 

employees to live well, eat well, stay well and save well.  Over 50 

bank-wide events were organised, including webinars, challenges 

and workshops that covered a range of topics such as food and 

nutrition, health and fitness as well as personal financial planning.

• Sharing of personal experiences on overcoming mental health 

issues by our senior leaders in a bank-wide virtual conference, 

to reduce social stigma on this topic. More employees were 

subsequently encouraged to step forward as role models, sharing 

their own stories on the employee intranet, Life@DBS.

• The DBS Wellness App continues to be made available at no cost 

to all employees, offering a personalised experience where each 

employee can learn and participate in various physical and mental 

wellness activities, as well as to track their personal health goals.

• Regular sentiment surveys were conducted, and we used 

these data to calibrate strategies to engage our employees. 

Providing continual upskilling and reskilling opportunities 

With job disruption set to continue in the new normal and employees 

having to embrace new ways of working, we accelerated efforts 

to transform employees to be relevant and future ready through 

continual upskilling and reskilling opportunities. 

In November 2020, we announced that over 7,300 employees will be 

upskilled over the next few years and in 2021, over 3,000 employees 

were upskilled/ reskilled in line with changing business needs. We 

offered over 290 programmes covering data and digital, functional, 

as well as people and leadership skills so that employees can be 

equipped with the necessary skills to be future-ready.

Availing multiple career growth opportunities

We are committed to building long-term careers for our employees. 

This is done through our “Triple E” approach by providing the right 

education, exposure, and experience opportunities.

In addition to learning programmes, we offer an array of 

opportunities under the Be My Guest programme that includes 

job shadowing, workshops, and offsites of other departments for 

participating employees to gain greater exposure.

In 2021, DBS launched a pilot programme Opportunity Marketplace 

using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to help 

individuals identify their future career aspirations and skills needed 

to reach those goals, and suitable roles they can move into as part 

of the bank’s internal mobility programmes – similar to what a career 

coach would do. We are encouraged by the early success of the 

programme when our internal mobility rate improved from 6.3% (of 

our employees) 2020 to 7.6% in 2021.

Our approach

Across the world, the protracted pandemic crisis in its second year 

has left a profound impact on the psyche of how people view work in 

the context of the lives they wish to lead moving forward.

As we continue to address the more immediate needs of our 

employees impacted by the pandemic and support national 

programmes such as vaccination drives across our network, we also 

made sure to take a long-term view in enabling employee well-being 

and growth and addressing evolving employee needs and aspirations 

in the following ways: 

• Supporting employees through flexible work arrangements 

To meet the evolving needs of our employees depending on their 

life stages and personal circumstances

• Introducing a series of holistic well-being initiatives  

To galvanise and help employees remain connected and focusing 

on employee well-being during the pandemic

• Providing continual upskilling and reskilling opportunities 

To accelerate efforts in transforming employees to be relevant 

and future ready

• Availing multiple career growth opportunities 

To provide the right education, exposure, and experience 

opportunities

• Advancing our Transformational Leadership journey  

To drive efforts in building great leaders, great teams, and an 

empowering culture 

Initiatives 

Supporting employees through flexible work arrangements

We recognise that the needs of an employee evolve depending on 

life stage and personal circumstances. This was why we launched a 

range of flexible work arrangements (FWA) in 2021 to better support 

employees in remaining invested in their careers, including:

• Work-from-home (WFH) for up to 40% time, launched in February

• Up to 100% WFH for six months for parents with young children 

and caregivers, launched in August

• Job Sharing Programme, where one full time role can be 

performed by two employees, with over 100 participants 

To familiarise and build energy around these new ways of working, 

DBS also launched an internal Future of Work, Workforce and 

Workplace (F3W) campaign to raise employee awareness and 

encourage them to embrace hybrid working through fun activities 

and learning programmes. 

Introducing a series of holistic well-being initiatives

The pandemic has resulted in the blurring of lines between work 

and personal life with employees having to work from home for 

prolonged periods. Back in 2020, DBS launched the TOGETHER

II.  Average training hours(7) per year per employee by gender 

and employee category

 

 The average training hours for permanent employees increased 

slightly from 38.9 in 2020 to 39.2 in 2021.

Advancing our Transformational Leadership journey 

External emerging forces as well as new ways of working that have 

been accelerated during the pandemic will demand a different way 

of leadership. DBS began our Transformational Leadership 

journey back in 2019 to drive our efforts in building great leaders, 

great teams, and an empowering culture, and we have made further 

progress this year:

• Anytime Feedback, was launched since July 2019. We continued 

to inculcate a culture of active feedback, with employee feedback 

doubling to over 120,000 (of which 50,000 were developmental 

feedback) from 2020. 

• T-Sprints, a series of team leadership workshops launched 

for our top 50 leadership teams across the bank in 2020, was 

extended to another 50 leadership teams in 2021. In addition, 

we introduced T-circles, a social learning platform where senior 

managers lead mentoring conversations with next-generation 

managers to share experiences and discuss best practices to 

enable change at wider and deeper levels across the organisation. 

To date, over 500 managers have benefitted from T-circles.

• Building Great Managers, our flagship managerial skills 

program since 2019 saw a refresh this year with enhanced 

content around managing remote teams and embracing diversity. 

The refresh in programme reflects our agility in recognising new 

skills required by managers in this new normal.

Support programmes for employees impacted by Covid-19 

With the evolving nature of the pandemic affecting the lives and 

livelihoods of people around the world, we have also responded 

quickly to ensure the well-being of our colleagues who are 

adversely impacted by Covid-19. Some examples of our support 

include the following: 

•  Sourcing for access to Covid-19 treatment including 

ambulance services, hospital beds, oxygen concentrators and 

Covid-19 testing in locations such as India and Indonesia where 

resources were scarce at the height of the pandemic

•  Supporting national vaccination programmes across the 

region, providing vaccination leave so that employees can rest  

and recuperate after each vaccination dose, availing of vaccination  

facilities on-site in some locations such as India and Indonesia

•  Offering salary advance for employees in India to cover for 

medical emergencies

•  Practicing safe management measures and personal 

hygiene, together with key personnel appointed across 

departments to ensure that these measures are strictly 

adhered to

Prompt communication to all employees is also key to inform 

of updates on the pandemic situation and safe management 

measures, and we leveraged new means to keep everyone 

involved and informed. For example, Indonesia launched its 

“TOGETHER FM” music programme blending entertainment with 

important messages to employees; while in India, messages are 

pushed through an internal messenger platform “One Bot” to 

remind employees on the various safety measures and to take 

regular breaks.

Case Study: Taking Care of employees’ mental  

well-being

Like many other organisations, DBS has been driving new ways of 

working since Covid-19 struck. In November 2020, we announced  

a permanent hybrid work model and a formal job-sharing scheme  

to provide employees more flexibility. We also put in place a suite  

of programmes under our TOGETHER employee movement to  

help our people better manage their physical, emotional, and  

mental well-being. 

With the pandemic being more protracted than we had hoped for, 

our employees had to manage the blurring of lines between work 

and home due to prolonged remote working. This is something we 

picked up in our employee pulse checks, and we wanted to address 

this proactively before it takes a toll on employee mental health: 

•  We started Focus Friday Afternoons, where Friday afternoons are 

kept free from internal calls or meetings. We made a conscious 

effort as an organisation to ensure that our employees have a few 

hours of protected time for focused work, learning or even quiet 

reflection before transiting to the weekend. 

 

 

•  We granted employees with a newborn or a newly adopted child, 

or those who needed to care for family members recovering from 

critical illness or injury, the flexibility to work from home 100% of 

the time for up to six months. This is to better support employees 

going through different life stages.

•  We launched a bank-wide mental wellness campaign to better 

equip our people with practical tools to combat burnout 

and protect their mental well-being. We rolled out a series of 

programmes and sharing sessions around mental health, all 

with the aim of normalising employees saying, “I’m not OK” 

and encouraging frank conversations on mental well-being to 

destigmatise this topic. 

Our people are our greatest asset, and this was evident in the way 

our employees went the extra mile for our customers and the 

community during the pandemic. As the battle against Covid-19 rages 

on, we are committed not only to safeguarding the physical well-

being of our employees, but also to help fight the invisible scourge of 

workplace burnout. 

III. Percentage of positions filled internally

 

 We are committed to building long-term careers of our people 

by providing them with various career opportunities within the 

organisation. Through our talent management processes as well 

as initiatives to encourage employees to take ownership of their 

professional growth and development, including Be My Guest, 

Opportunity Marketplace, and internal job portal, our internal 

mobility rate improved from 6.3% (of our employees) in 2020 to

Our approach

Embracing diversity and inclusion is important to enable us to attract 

the best people, build the best teams and produce the best work 

which is also reflected in our Board Diversity Policy and Resource 

Management Policy. By strengthening diversity in our workforce, 

we are able to access a greater range of talent and their varied and 

valuable experiences, perspectives and skills. By building a culture 

of inclusion, we can harness the power of our diverse workforce to 

succeed in this complex, interconnected world and create impactful 

outcomes for our businesses, customers, and communities. 

There are many dimensions of diversity which is why our approach 

is to raise employee awareness of unconscious bias, and equip 

our employees with the necessary knowledge and skills to reduce 

implicit bias because of different qualities and social categories. 

In addition, we are also committed to the following:

• Promoting gender diversity and ensuring that 

opportunities and choices are accessible to all  

To ensure choices are made available to both women and men,  

at various life stages during their career with DBS.

• Supporting our new foreign hires in adapting  

to the local way of life 

To help them better understand the local culture and social 

norms, we have created common spaces and provide platforms 

for them to interact with locals. 

Initiatives 

Raising employee awareness of unconscious bias

In line with International Women’s Day in March 2021, we hosted 

a special edition of our very own Leadership Perspectives virtual 

conference featuring remarkable women leaders to share stories of 

their leadership journey to inspire and ignite our passion to create a 

more inclusive world. 

In November 2021, we also organised a Celebrating Gender Diversity 

virtual conference to raise awareness on the importance and benefits 

of gender diversity as well as to learn from personal sharing of our 

DBS leaders comprising both women and men.

Besides bank-wide events, our learning programmes and workshops 

also saw over 3,000 employees participated in the Unconscious 

Bias programme since its launch in October 2020. The programme 

consists of three modules, including e-learning and team-  

based workshops.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES  

Building an inclusive culture

Promoting gender diversity and ensuring that opportunities 

and choices are accessible to all

Hack2Hire is into its 4th year running with the same commitment 

to increase female workforce in technology.  Our signature 

programmes, My Persona, Woman 3.0 and ReImagine, which 

are launched in our technology hubs in Hyderabad and Singapore, 

continue to be well-received by new hires who have just returned to 

the workforce, and we aim to continue empowering more women to 

take on leadership roles.

In collaboration with Lean In, we launched the DBS Lean In Circles  

in October 2021 where we trained 24 DBS employees from Singapore  

and India to be equipped with skills to lead their own community 

circles where they meet regularly to mentor and support one 

another, have honest and open conversations on topics such  

as balancing work and family, challenging gender bias, and  

personal leadership. 

Supporting our new foreign hires in adapting to the local  

way of life

In Singapore, over 90% of our workforce are Singaporeans and we 

are committed to building a strong pipeline of local talent. That said, 

we also welcome foreign talent for roles where supply of local talent 

is limited. By facilitating the formation of friendships and shared 

experiences among Singaporeans and non-locals, we are fostering 

mutual understanding and acceptance. Through those opportunities, 

we are also deepening the emotional attachment and a sense of 

belonging to Singapore among our new foreign hires.

Supported by the National Integration Council (Singapore Ministry of 

Community, Culture and Youth), we launched a 12-month Singapore 

Immersion Programme for our new foreign hires. The programme 

consists of an initial orientation session, followed by a rigorous series 

of discussions on Singapore society and culture. New foreign hires 

are also matched with a Singaporean buddy and will participate in 

volunteering programmes to contribute to the community.

Case study

DBS has partnered Lean In, a global community dedicated to helping 

women achieve their ambitions, as we continue to build a respectful 

and inclusive culture that embraces diversity.

Fostering a sense of community has become more crucial, with the 

Covid-19 pandemic disrupting lives, leading to feelings of anxiety 

and stress. Kicking off the partnership was the official launch of the 

DBS Lean In Circles Programme, which aims to connect groups of 

employees at similar career stages or with similar interests, creating 

safe spaces for them to provide mutual support, share personal 

struggles, provide and receive advice, and celebrate one another’s 

wins. 

We are committed to supporting gender diversity, as we build strong 

communities throughout the bank, so employees can come together 

and find a way forward towards a more inclusive workplace.

Our approach

DBS is committed to achieving net-zero operational carbon 

emissions across our markets by the end of 2022, with Singapore’s 

operations to rely solely on renewable energy by 2030. We are 

structured to achieve these goals in a way that has lasting benefits 

to the environment rather than focusing on purchasing offsets as a 

mitigation method. 

Our strategy is a four-lever-approach to manage our carbon, energy 

and water consumption, and waste reduction, in order of priority:  

• Lever 1: Reduce consumption 

• Lever 2: Generate renewable energy

• Lever 3: Purchase green energy 

• Lever 4: Purchase Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)  

and carbon offsets 

Initiatives 

Reducing consumption

Our first priority is to reduce the energy we consume through our 

operational footprint. In 2021, we began retrofitting one of our oldest 

office buildings into Singapore’s first net-zero energy building, and 

one of only 500 such commercial buildings globally.

This is the first example of our commitment to build more carbon  

or energy-neutral spaces by using net-zero technologies and  

design features to ensure our buildings produce as much energy  

as they consume.

Across our offices in Singapore, we have replaced fuel in three of 

our seven diesel generators with 100% recycled cooking oil and are 

planning to implement this initiative to all generators across all our 

markets. We also used more climate-friendly refrigerants with lower 

Global Warming Potential(8) in all our new air conditioning systems 

across the markets we operate in, reducing warming effects by more 

than 60% in the long run.

Along with our flexible work arrangements, employees are given 

flexibility to work remotely up to 40% of the time. We are targeting to 

reduce our operational footprint in Singapore by 20% and in varying 

degrees across all markets. Across our workspaces in Singapore and 

in the markets to come, we have started to install sensors to guide us 

in optimising energy according to occupancy. In working remotely, we 

have also consequently enabled the reduction of business travel.

Generating renewable energy

In maximising our operational renewable production, we have 

adopted an ‘Everything Solar Everywhere’ initiative, which entails 

ensuring that every appliance installed in our workspaces runs 

on renewable energy, where possible. This has led to installations 

of solar arrays on our buildings, along with solar-powered air 

conditioners, exhaust fans, walkway lights, parking lamps, ATM kiosks, 

fountain pumps, and fans on our premises, across the markets we 

operate in. 

Newly-installed solar installations in our portfolio in 2021:

India – 

Chennai 

Solar

In August 2021, DBS commissioned solar installation 

at our branch in Chennai. It generates energy at peak 

performance of 380 Wp and is expected to produce 

24,624 KWh per year, or 11.5% of the branch’s 

electricity needs. 

Singapore 

– UE Bizhub 

Solar

In November 2021, DBS commissioned solar installation 

at our UE Bizhub office. It generates energy at peak 

performance of 41.04 KWp and is expected to 

produce 47,935 KWh per year, or 11.5% of the office’s 

electricity needs.   

Singapore –  

DAH  

Augmentation 

Solar

In June 2021, DBS commissioned solar installation at 

our DAH/ Academy Office Building. It generates energy 

at peak performance of 179.08 KWp and is expected 

to produce 216 MWh per year, or 1.8% of the expected 

building consumption.   

Indonesia – 

Juanda Solar

In October 2021, DBS commissioned solar installation 

at our Juanda branch in Indonesia. It generates energy 

at peak performance of 145.96 KWp and is expected to 

produce 180 MWh per year, or 18.7% of the expected 

branch consumption.    

Purchasing green energy

While we are committed to reducing our consumption and pursuing 

renewable energy sources, there is still a need for us to purchase 

energy at this stage. Despite not securing a virtual power purchase 

agreement (VPPA), given major market fluctuations in Singapore in 

2021, we have signalled to the market our preference to purchase 

only 100% green energy and carbon-neutral products. 

Purchasing RECs and carbon offsets 

We recognise the need for offsets through the purchase of RECs 

or carbon credits to achieve our net-zero operational carbon goals 

despite best efforts in our strategy. In Hong Kong, we met 100% of 

the market’s RE100 goals by purchasing RECs last year. In November 

2021, we also purchased carbon credits, equivalent to 10,000 tonnes 

of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, during the pilot auction of Climate 

Impact X - a global exchange and marketplace for high-quality  

carbon credits.

Additional initiatives to supplement our four-lever-approach

Water Reduction and Management 

We continue to manage our water consumption through 

implementing building standards like Greenmark throughout 

our bank branches and offices in Singapore. In 2021, we began 

innovative water management through waste condensate water 

reclamation in three of our buildings in Singapore: DBS Asia Hub 

(DAH), Newton, and DBS Asia Central (DAC). In each of these 

buildings, we captured condensate water and used it for irrigation 

at Newton and DAH, and cleaning at DAH and DAC.

Waste Reduction and Management 

DBS has implemented eWaste tracking across all markets, and 

eWaste collection points for employees in several markets. In our 

DAH cafeteria, an AI-food waste tracking and reduction system is 

being deployed to record how and what foods are being wasted 

through smart meter technology attached to food waste bins. 

This real-time data is used to analyse trends and better anticipate 

production quantity in a bid to decrease overall waste. Starting in 

2022, we will also institute the use of ‘home compostables’ in all 

food providers, allowing disposable table wares to be composted 

on site and used as fertiliser for our urban office gardens.

Measuring and reporting to close process performance gaps

DBS will continue to improve environmental indicator measuring 

and capture systems. We have closed more data gaps in 2021, 

adding consumption data for various outsourced chilled water 

systems in several markets. Moreover, we have added the carbon 

impact of our waste disposal and recycling efforts, including 

electronics waste, when totalling up operational Scope 3 

emissions. We have added carbon data from several outsourced 

transportation operations including self-service banking (where we 

also started an electric vehicle programme), limo fleets, executive 

fleets, storage fleets, and other business travel-related footprints.

We have also added carbon data from our smaller international 

centres including Australia, London, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, 

Vietnam, South Korea, Myanmar, and The Philippines.  

Although these new centres account for no more than 3%  

of overall operational carbon footprint, we have included  

them for completeness.

Case study

Singapore’s first energy self-sufficient bank building

Setting the pace for our sustainability efforts, DBS is retrofitting 

one of our oldest office buildings into Singapore’s first energy 

self-sufficient bank building, and one of only 500 such commercial 

buildings globally. Working closely with the Building and Construction 

Authority of Singapore with a grant awarded under the national 

Green Buildings Innovation Cluster programme, DBS is engineering 

to bring down the building’s net energy consumption from 845,000 

kWh annually to zero, leveraging cutting-edge net-zero technologies 

to reduce energy consumption, while generating renewable energy 

via an on-site solar panel array. 

In addition to net-zero technologies such as intelligent occupancy-

based lighting and air-conditioning systems, the building will 

 

 

encapsulate innovative design features, including a slatted facade  

that shades the building while encouraging natural ventilation,  

and a biophilic exterior with flora to reduce heat absorption.  

In collaboration with the Nature Society of Singapore, the external 

biophilia facade will be specially curated and nurtured to provide  

a space for threated native butterfly and bird species to thrive.  

This retrofit will be completed in the second quarter of 2022 and  

will house over 400 consumer banking employees.

This will be an important step forward in understanding how best  

to deploy net-zero technologies towards DBS’ objective of achieving 

net-zero operational carbon emissions, and to collectively realise  

a greener, more sustainable future for Singapore.

Our approach

At DBS, we believe we have the responsibility to build a sustainable 

supply chain and ensure that our procurement processes are 

conducted in a balanced manner. As a leading financial services 

group in Asia with a growing global presence, we purchase a 

diverse range of products and services, including professional, 

software, real estate, and corporate services. It is imperative that our 

procurement decision-making also includes environmental and social 

considerations, alongside financial factors. 

At DBS, we are continually innovating and improving our supply chain 

management programme, which includes:  

• Building a restorative enterprise 

To grow restorative procurement together with our  

ecosystem partners

• Adopting a risk management approach 

To utilise a comprehensive set of processes and tools in an 

iterative manner to govern our supply base

• Managing our resource use responsibly  

To reduce our environmental impacts

• Investing in capacity building for a more resilient supply chain   

To ensure a diverse global supply base and enable sourcing for 

goods and services in an efficient manner

DBS’ procurement is managed in accordance with our 

formal processes and policies:

i. Group Procurement Policy 

 

 Outlines our strategy for the purchasing of goods and services 

to meet DBS’ requirements while ensuring minimum risks and 

maximum value

ii. Group Procurement Standard

Initiatives

Building a restorative enterprise 

Since 2018 when we started our Circular Procurement practice, 

we have embedded concepts of circularity in our procurement 

processes and the department’s balanced scorecard. We have 

made substantial progress in this journey where we shared and 

documented in the Circular Procurement Playbook.

APPROACH

SUSTAINABILITY PILLARS

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES


In 2021, we built on that foundation and evolved the practice into the  

Restorative Procurement Framework (Framework) that aims at building  

a restorative enterprise through our supplier partnerships (see figure  

on the previous page). This new framework brings together various 

sustainability aspects – circularity, carbon, biodiversity, and the broader  

social agenda. It also provides a more holistic approach in the way 

we think about sustainability. In particular, the notion of doing “more 

good” versus “doing less harm” is also more pronounced in the 

various sustainability aspects as we retained a points system in our 

balanced scorecard, which encourages our sourcing managers and 

suppliers to collaborate on incremental improvements as well as 

projects of larger sustainability impact. 

To kickstart this initiative, we trained all our sourcing managers on 

restorative procurement and fast-tracked real-life application by 

identifying new projects aligned to the Framework.

Given key sourcing decisions are typically conducted by tender 

evaluation committees consisting of multiple stakeholders, we 

invited external C-suite executives to share their visions and insights 

on decarbonisation, biodiversity protection, and the social agenda. 

Through these sharing sessions, we hope to inspire a broader 

audience to reimagine ways we can be more restorative as a bank. 

Over 500 DBS staff attended these internal Restorative Procurement 

webinars in 2021.  

We have since completed 25 Restorative Procurement projects and the 

more notable projects include:   

• AETOS Cash and Valuables transport fleet electrification, where we 

rolled out our first electric vehicle (EV) for our Cash and Valuables 

Escort (CVE) services in Singapore. We are committed to convert 

the rest of our CVE vehicles by the end of 2023, and eventually to 

all our operational vehicles by 2026. The switch to EV is expected 

to reduce our carbon emissions by up to 17 tonnes CO2e per 

vehicle annually.

• Partnering Engineering Good, a non-profit organisation, to refurbish  

old DBS laptops for donation to lower-income families in Singapore.  

Over 700 laptops have been “rescued” and donated to date.  

We believe that in the longer term, restorative procurement will  

scale further in DBS and become a key driving force in making  

DBS a restorative enterprise. 

Adopting a risk management approach

At DBS, we adopt a risk-based approach to govern sustainability in 

our supply chains (see figure below). We utilise a comprehensive set 

of processes and tools in an iterative manner to govern our supply 

base, which consists over thousands of regional suppliers that span 

across diverse spend categories.

Since 2017, we have utilised DBS’ Sustainable Sourcing Principles 

(SSP) as the primary mechanism to screen our suppliers. Our SSP 

outlines DBS’ expectations of our suppliers across these key areas: 

(1) human rights, (2) health &amp; safety, (3) environmental sustainability 

as well as (4) business integrity and ethics. In 2021, all 100% of our 

new suppliers have committed to our SSP. 

With thousands of suppliers in our supply base, we needed to 

prioritise and focus our attention on the most important areas, 

using the right levers and tools to achieve optimal governance 

outcomes. This is done primarily through our annual supplier 

segmentation exercise.  

Conducted biennially, our 2021 review of sustainability risk resulted 

in 18 high-risk categories in Singapore. For these categories, we 

require sustainability requirements to be incorporated in the 

competitive tendering process. Similar processes were conducted 

across all of our six core markets. 

In 2021, we embarked on a project to assess and quantify the carbon 

emissions along our supply chains, which would provide us the 

necessary baseline to pursue a credible, science-based emission 

reduction pathway in the coming years. As part of our masterplan, 

we plan to closely engage with key suppliers to test our methodology, 

especially in categories with the highest carbon emission intensities 

per dollar spend.

We have performed annual supplier assurances since 2018 as 

part of our evidence-based approach to assess the sustainability 

capability of our supply chains. This year, we started to leverage 

external sources of supplier sustainability ratings (refer to case study 

for additional information). In 2021, we assessed over 150 suppliers 

and preliminarily concluded that one of them require critical 

improvements in its labour, health and safety aspects. However, 

instead of terminating the contract with said supplier, we engaged 

with their team and suggested methods for change. Following several 

conversations, the supplier made changes to their company’s policy 

to commit to regulatory labour, health, and safety compliance for 

their employees, amongst their future plans for DBS.

Our governance approach is not complete without the creation 

and promotion of a culture of sustainability where we engage 

with suppliers on a regular basis through formal programmes 

and informal conversations. We found that many of our suppliers 

welcome such engagements about sustainability and its related 

issues, which have helped foster stronger working relationships and 

more desirable sustainability outcomes. 

One such initiative is our supplier training and development 

programme where we provide knowledge support in the sustainability  

journey of our suppliers. Since 2020, we have trained 34 suppliers 

from our regional supply chains.

Other initiatives such as Supplier Day and Supplier Excellence Awards 

provide additional avenues for DBS to engage suppliers, recognise 

their efforts, and encourage the open-sharing of industry best 

practices to further drive positive change.

Managing our resource use responsibly

Reducing paper utilisation

We continue to deliver positive momentum in our reduction efforts 

on paper consumption as many employees continue remote working. 

The digitalisation of work has reduced manual processing and paper 

printing. This provided the tail wind for our sustainability initiatives 

that further reduced our paper consumption annually. In 2021, we 

reduced office paper consumption further by 100 tonnes year-on-

year, representing over 50% reduction from our 2018 baseline. In 

particular, our continual digitalisation efforts for customer statements 

yielded a year-on-year cost saving of SGD 1 million. In instances 

where we are not able to reduce the absolute quantity of paper 

purchased and utilised, we source for more eco-friendly options such 

as those certified with Forest Stewardship Council labels.

Reducing plastics utilisation

Similarly, we have made progress in several areas in reducing our 

plastic usage. In 2021, we further reduced the consumption of 

DBS branded bottled water by 100 kg year-on-year, representing 

over 96% reduction from our 2018 baseline. In 2021, we were also 

the first in market to launch an eco-friendlier DBS Live Fresh card 

in Singapore, which was made of 85.5% rPVC  recycled plastic, 

instead of 100% PVC. In areas where we are not yet able to reduce 

the absolute quantity of plastics purchased, we are constantly 

researching and sourcing for more eco-friendly alternatives as they 

become available.

Read more about our DBS Live Fresh credit card in Sustainable Living on page 32.

Investing in capacity building for a more resilient supply chain

Through the years, we have made significant investments in our 

procurement capabilities, allowing us to build a more resilient supply 

chain.

This includes sourcing for goods and services from a diverse global 

supply base in an efficient manner. For example, at the height of the 

pandemic, we activated our global teams and successfully secured 

critical Personal Protection Equipment and other medical supplies to 

protect our staff and customers.

We also perform advance planning of contract renewals, that provide 

sufficient time to put in place diversification plans where appropriate.

In the past 12 months, we have strengthened supplier due diligence 

and monitoring capabilities with tightened processes and new tools. 

One example is the increased focus on the consideration of track 

records, reputation, and financial soundness as part of our supplier 

evaluation process. 

Case study

DBS partnered a global sustainability assessment leader in 2021 to 

leverage its sustainability assessment capabilities and monitor the 

sustainability performance of suppliers against our expectations. This 

is an integral part of our iterative risk-based approach in governing 

sustainability across our supply chains.  

By diving deeper into the suppliers’ operations, we can have 

meaningful conversations based on independently reviewed 

information and international standards. We will then be able to 

benchmark our most critical suppliers against the industry standard, 

identify the gaps, and focus on leveraging best practices and working 

with our suppliers on improvement opportunities.

At the moment, we have only been able to focus on our Tier 1 

suppliers, which are our direct vendors. We recognise this is an area 

of our sustainable procurement practice that requires enhancements 

as it is integral to our supplier engagement strategy in the longer term. 

As shown by the figure below, moving forward, we will also be able  

to chart the long-term sustainability progress of our supply chains  

by undertaking this reassessment.

Our approach

We believe that building trust is a journey, not a destination. 

Therefore, we continue to strengthen our overall data governance 

capabilities to ensure that data with us is safe and secure, staying 

attune to regulatory developments in data privacy, and ensuring our 

use of data is ethical and responsible. We do so by:  

• Keeping data safe and secure 

To strengthen our data protection capabilities, data access 

controls, and dialling up data surveillance to reduce the risk  

of data leakage and misuse. 

• Using data responsibly 

To build trust through fair, ethical, and responsible use of data 

and Artificial Intelligence (AI), by continuously enhancing our  

DBS PURE (Purposeful, Unsurprising, Respectful, Explainable) 

framework and AI Governance frameworks and controls. We also 

invested in training our people and led an industry initiative on 

how data sharing between banks and ecosystem partners may be 

done in a secure and lawful manner.

• Upholding trust through our privacy posture 

To place privacy at the heart of our design of products and 

services, we rigorously protect the privacy and confidentiality of 

data to keep it safe. 

Initiatives

Keeping data safe and secure

In 2021, we introduced the following major initiatives to further 

strengthen our data access and security capabilities: 

• Arculus: Our next-generation data policy engine was built in-

house. It serves as a data security fabric to enable expansion to 

the public cloud with the ability to develop enhanced data security 

and privacy engineering capabilities, as well as to enforce data 

access controls across the analytics hybrid-cloud ecosystem. 

• Enterprise Data Security Framework (EDSF): A homogenous, 

platform agnostic data-security-as-a-service that can be leveraged 

by any application/ platform requiring data security. During 2021,

• We explored additional data protection measures and 

identified synthetic data as a capability which will be 

implemented in 2022

• We strengthened security in data isolation through micro-

segmentation, enabling us to segregate the data environment 

in a more granular way.

• With data surveillance, we added further use cases that identify 

potential incidents of unusual behaviour, as well as workflows 

to manage those alerts by the data governance community. 

As remote working becomes the norm, more confidential systems 

are made available for remote access. To address the incremental 

risk of remote working, we accelerated the implementation of key 

controls and experimentation of innovative solutions. Data protection 

controls were implemented on DBS’ workstations to encourage 

accountability and deter sharing of onscreen confidential information 

via photo taking. Innovative data usage surveillance solutions were 

also implemented to provide high fidelity detection of the removal 

of DBS’ information from critical data stores. We further engaged 

independent cybersecurity subject matter experts to validate our 

internal control environment against cyber threats posed by external 

and insider threats, and assessed our key systems for vulnerabilities 

that could expose DBS’ environment to third-party risks. We also 

stepped up our efforts to raise the awareness of emerging cyber 

threats and security best practices of our employees.

Using data responsibly

As the global digital economy grows exponentially, AI-driven solutions 

are more rapidly adopted with increased data sharing between 

entities. The themes of trust, ethics and fairness are increasingly 

pervading societal, governmental, regulatory and industry 

sentiments, guidelines, and policies.

There is no doubt that such a global focus is beneficial for building 

public trust and transparency in how organisations use data and AI. 

On the downside however, it is also generating a plethora of different 

approaches, frameworks, guidelines, methodologies, and principles, 

with no obvious convergence at present. As such, we continue to 

take a measured and incremental approach when designing and 

deploying governance and control solutions in this space.

DBS PURE framework

• With regard to ensuring ethical and responsible use of data, we 

continue to build on our DBS PURE (Purposeful, Unsurprising, 

Respectful, Explainable) framework. In 2021, we implemented 

a bank-wide standard and followed up with rigorous compliance 

testing (2nd line of defence) and an internal audit (3rd line of 

defence). These independent assessments have further fine-

tuned our controls to improve end-to-end governance processes. 

PURE is now fully operationalised in DBS and is supported by over 

1,700 trained practitioners who administer this process across 

the organisation. Additionally, over 20,000 colleagues across DBS 

have also completed PURE awareness training since its inception 

in 2019.

 

AI Governance

• Apart from strengthening our PURE framework and controls, 

we have progressed well in developing our approach to AI 

Governance. Our overall approach and progress are heavily 

influenced and deliberately synchronised with emerging 

regulatory guidelines. In Singapore, we are working closely with 

both MAS and the Infocomm Media Development Authority 

(IMDA) and actively participating in their respective initiatives 

(MAS Veritas &amp; IMDA’s AI Governance Testing Framework). We 

will also continue to stay abreast and include in our development 

the emerging perspectives and requirements from the other 

jurisdictions that we operate in.

development workflow tool, developing our approach to assess 

AI solution materiality, piloting operating models and governance 

structures to support our federated analytics functions, and 

participating in MAS’ thematic study to better understand and 

embed MAS FEAT principles into our AI development lifecycle.

Training our people 

• We understand that a critical component in driving better data 

governance and responsible data usage is to ensure that our 

people are aware of what needs to be done and how to do it. To 

support this, we continued to invest in training, driving bank-

wide awareness and broadening our data steward community. 

Our data management learning curriculum now consists of 

twelve digital modules covering each of our core pillars of data 

management. In 2021 alone, more than 31,000 modules have 

been successfully completed by over 11,000 employees. We have 

also onboarded and trained a new cohort of data stewards in 

our Technology and Operations department to support our data 

management processes. 

Guardrails for sharing data securely

• As organisations look for opportunities to improve or create new 

products and services for their customers, there is an increasing 

trend of data and insights sharing across entities. While this 

continues to be another emergent space that is at a fairly nascent 

stage across the region, the Association of Banks Singapore 

(ABS) initiated a project to develop a set of guidelines that would 

foster purpose-driven, secure and lawful data sharing between 

banks and ecosystem partners. DBS led this initiative and worked 

alongside a small consortium of banks and other stakeholders to 

produce an industry first publication in this area. 

• The publication itself sets out clear guidance on the key regulatory 

considerations, as well as technical, legal and data protection 

safeguards to be put in place, when seeking to share data for 

ecosystem partnerships. As this trend in cross entity data sharing 

matures, having strong practices and guardrails will be critical in 

safeguarding data trust. The guide was published in August and 

launched at an industry wide event in September 2021.  

Upholding trust through our privacy posture

At DBS, we take an empathetic and respectful approach towards data 

privacy. We are committed to use data to forge trusted relationships 

with our customers and improve their quality of lives. To uphold 

this commitment, we use data in a way that is consistent with 

consumers’ expectations and in accordance with all relevant laws and 

regulations.  

Our Privacy Policy lays the foundations of how we collect, use, and 

care for personal data. This is overlaid with our obligation as a 

regulated financial institution to ensure the confidentiality of our 

customers’ information, including personal data. We set anchoring 

principles and firmly commit to see that data is always handled for 

legitimate and lawful purposes. 

To this end, privacy risk assessment is consciously embedded within 

our governance review processes for new products and services as 

well as outsourcing and procurement arrangements. This helps to 

inculcate and embed sensitivities of how data, including personal 

data, will be properly handled and managed as it goes through its 

lifecycle within DBS. 

At a macro level, we see privacy and data protection regimes across 

jurisdictions as contiguous relationships and expect their trends 

to continually evolve even as we stay agile in adapting to new 

requirements. In surveying these emerging regulatory requirements 

and developments, we pay attention to material developments 

related to data governance risk themes and updates in data 

protection standards or controls implementation. Such updates are 

reported to the Group Operational Risk Committee, Risk Executive 

Committee (Exco) or our Board Audit Committee. 

Additionally, we seek to participate and lend our voice to shape 

regulatory thinking in the formulation of data protection and privacy 

legislation, as well as development of data governance themes. To 

name a few: 

• As a member of the Singapore Personal Data Protection 

Commission’s Business Innovation Review Committee, we 

were engaged to develop enhancements to the Personal Data 

Protection Act (PDPA) consent framework. This is to enable a 

balanced and broader use of data for societal and legitimate 

business purposes with safeguards in place. These have since 

been passed into legislation and came in effect in February 2021.

• DBS contributed to the revisions in the Code of Banking Practices 

for the PDPA issued by the ABS. The updated Code sets out 

application of changes to the PDPA to the banking industry in 

Singapore. This was updated in June 2021.

• Our CEO Piyush Gupta remains a council member of the 

Singapore IMDA Advisory Council on the Ethical use of Artificial 

Intelligence and Data. 

Being established in Singapore, we have long-standing controls and 

processes to scrutinise and respond to production orders from 

local law enforcement agencies. Hence, we are able to ascertain that 

the requests conform to the scope and validity of their applicable 

laws. This includes participation in designated information exchange 

channels where such requests are securely authenticated.  The same 

discipline to carefully review any received requests to fulfil our legal 

and regulatory requirements whilst ensuring our duty to protect 

customers’ confidentiality extends to requests received across our 

footprint jurisdictions as well.

DBS - Data Protection Trustmark re-certified 

In January 2022, DBS was re-certified with the Data Protection 

Trustmark (DPTM) by the Singapore Infocomm Media 

Development Authority (IMDA).

DBS was the first bank in Singapore to be DPTM certified. The 

DPTM certification is an independent external validation that we 

have robust data protection practices in place, and this gives 

further reassurance to our customers and stakeholders that they 

can confidently place their trust in us with their data. This re-

certification is testament to our ongoing efforts and commitment 

to protect and manage our customers’ personal data in a 

responsible manner.

Case study 

In 2021, an internal project was initiated that resulted in the creation 

of our in-house data access product – Arculus. Arculus is aptly 

named after the Roman god of chests and safes, which replaced a 

discontinued vendor data access product.   

By building Arculus from scratch, we were in a position to ensure that 

we focused on enhanced data privacy engineering techniques to help 

protect our sensitive data and establish a solid security foundation 

for data access that includes the fabric to support multi-hybrid cloud 

environments.

At its core, Arculus is able to orchestrate the dynamic protection of 

sensitive data using certified encryption methodologies to safeguard 

our most important data. Furthermore, Arculus enables data access 

at a persona-level, with datasets fully secured and instantly accessible  

 

to analytics users based on the profile of their personas. This enables 

the delivery of the right data to the right people and at the right time 

in a safe manner.

Another critical feature of Arculus is its increased ability to capture 

logging information of data accessed by analytics users as well as the 

contents of the queries performed. These enable us to significantly 

uplift our surveillance capabilities with more sophisticated use cases.  

We believe that Arculus has industry leading capabilities. Over the 

course of 2022, Arculus will continue to be enhanced to enable 

further additional data security features, including the use of 

synthetic data to provide a secure alternative to production data 

whilst giving users the same level of utility.

Our approach

Fair dealing is the foundation of our business. Our customers trust 

us to put their interest first when we conduct business and interact 

with them. We believe in inculcating a strong culture of fair dealing 

across DBS to ensure we operate in a transparent, ethical, and sound 

manner with our customers. We do so through:  

• Consistent delivery of fair dealing outcomes 

• Empowering employees to deliver quality  

customer experience

• Embedding fair dealing principles in  

our governance framework  

 

We ensure that customers are always treated as we would expect 

ourselves to be treated. In this regard, we take a customer-centric 

approach to constantly improve the way we deliver our products and 

services to serve their needs. 

Initiatives 

Consistent delivery of fair dealing outcomes

We play an important role in supporting our customers in making 

their financial decisions. Our customers rely on us for relevant 

information, quality advice and appropriate recommendations. In 

focusing on acting in the best interest for our customers, we are 

committed to conducting our business in a responsible manner. This 

is demonstrated through our fair and transparent interactions with 

our customers: 

• Responding honestly to our customers’ needs and requests

• Tailoring appropriate financial outcomes for our customers

• Deepening competencies of our financial advisors

• Communicating with our customers in a clear  

and transparent manner 

Over the years, we have strengthened our financial advisory 

processes and suitability controls to serve our customers well. We 

also continually refine and improve the safeguards to protect our 

customers and ensure that they receive quality advice and relevant 

information to make informed financial decisions.

Digital Investment Advisory

In 2021, we fortified our NAV Planner with a new AI-powered 

digital investment advisory feature to help retail customers 

make better investment decisions. This feature can determine 

individualised investment risk profiles to make specific investment 

recommendations.

As our customers increasingly take a self-directed approach to 

investing digitally, we adopted a multi-dimensional approach to help

Driving good conduct and fair outcomes

investors determine their investment profiles before investing amid 

market volatility. This provides them additional peace of mind so that 

they can make more informed investment decisions and boost their 

personal finances.

Valuing Customer Feedback

We are a customer-obsessed organisation. We value our customers’ 

feedback and strive to improve our customers’ banking experiences 

by listening to them. We also ensure our customers’ feedbacks are 

handled effectively and resolved in a fair and consistent manner.

We maintain open channels for our customers to share their 

concerns with us, as we believe these are valuable indicators of 

potential issues which need to be addressed. In addition, service 

standards are put in place for complaints handling and resolution, 

including reasonable timeframes to acknowledge our customers’ 

complaints and conducting independent investigations. We also 

devote sufficient resources to resolve our customer concerns 

promptly, without compromising the quality of review.

Empowering our employees to deliver quality customer 

experience

We believe in training our employees to forge deep relationships with  

our customers by serving them well. We also constantly provide financial  

solutions that meet our customers’ needs and improve their lives.

As the pandemic changed the world and took a toll on livelihoods, 

our employees have been actively helping customers navigate these 

challenging times, which included offering relief measures to ease 

the financial pressures they may face. Even as the need for these 

relief measures tapers off, our employees remain on the lookout for 

vulnerable customers in the community who may need a helping hand.

In the area of financial advisory, our financial advisors are certified to 

conduct financial planning in accordance with the highest standards. 

We also trained our financial advisors and their supervisors on how 

to exercise empathy to understand the underlying emotions of our 

customers in conflict. We have also maintained a close partnership 

with the Financial Industry Dispute Resolution Centre, and focused 

on achieving win-win outcomes during conflict resolutions with our 

customers.

Read more about “Employee well-being and managing talent” in page 39.

 

Embedding fair dealing principles in our governance framework 

Our board and senior management set the tone from the top to 

inculcate a strong culture of fair dealing across DBS. This is to ensure 

that we conduct ourselves in an ethical and sound manner. We 

believe that a robust governance framework that maintains a strong 

focus on fair dealing and conduct is essential to instil a strong sense 

of trust in the organisation.

Banking Trust Index for Singapore (BTIS)

The BTIS is the first standardised means of measuring public trust 

towards banks in Singapore. It is commissioned by the Association 

of Banks in Singapore to understand consumers’ trust in banks and 

areas for improvement. The annual survey allows participating banks 

to monitor shifts in public sentiment, solicit feedback and identify 

areas for improvement.

The results released in March 2021 showed that banks in Singapore  

are trusted by the public and highlighted a few areas for improvement.  

The survey found that respondents’ trust in banks were positively 

influenced by the banks’ ability to offer a variety of products and 

services, their use of reliable and innovative technologies, as well as 

their financial resilience. Respondents also trusted the banks’ ability 

 

 

to handle customers’ data with integrity, and that their leadership 

and employees operate professionally and ethically.

The results also indicated a high level of trust in DBS, with many 

of our performance indexes placing strongly above industry 

average. We are committed to preserving the high level of trust 

from customers through prioritising customers’ needs and strong 

management and leadership.

We strongly believe that trust is earned by continuously serving our 

customers with integrity, fairness, and transparency. We will continue 

to focus on raising our culture and conduct standards and contribute 

towards sustaining the strong reputation of Singapore banks.

Our approach

We recognise our responsibilities towards financial crime prevention, 

as our strength and resilience would contribute towards protecting 

the integrity of the financial system. We are committed to conducting 

our businesses professionally and in accordance with all applicable 

laws, rules, regulations, and the highest ethical standards. This 

commitment is embodied in our Group Code of Conduct, and 

supported by:  

• Strengthening our governance framework 

To safeguard our businesses and customers against financial crime

• Maintaining strong oversight on financial crime matters  

To ensure financial crime risks are readily identified and 

sufficiently mitigated

• Raising awareness through continual training  

To empower employees with the knowledge to identify financial 

crime risks and take swift actions to mitigate such risks

• Leveraging technology and partnerships 

To carry out surveillance and protect our customers from  

financial crimes

Initiatives

Strengthening our governance framework

We continually strengthen our governance framework to safeguard 

our businesses and customers against financial crime. The Financial 

Crime and Security Services team is responsible for and oversees the 

financial crime compliance activities for the Group. Our governance 

framework incorporates training, advisory, enforcement and 

compliance with bank-wide policies and procedures around anti-

money laundering (AML), combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), 

proliferation financing, sanctions, fraud, bribery, and corruption. 

Our key policies and standards include: 

• Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and Standard 

Our Anti-Bribery and Corruption Program embodies risk 

assessment, due diligence, books and records, controls and 

monitoring, reporting, gifts and entertainment requirements. The 

bank and senior management are also committed to adopting 

a zero-tolerance approach towards bribery and corruption in 

connection with any of our business dealings.

PREVENTING FINANCIAL CRIME

Protecting customers from financial crime

• Anti-Fraud Policy and Standard  

Our Fraud Management Program comprises the following 

components: Identification and Assessment of Fraud Risks, 

Fraud Controls and Monitoring, Investigation, Remediation, and 

Reporting and Analysis. These are underscored by our strategy, 

governance, and risk culture.

• AML, CFT and Sanctions Policy and Standard  

The prevention and detection of money laundering, terrorist 

financing, and sanctions evasions, and proliferation financing risks 

are managed by appropriate standards and controls that are 

embedded in front line business processes, with the support of 

effective advisory capabilities. Our risk management framework 

encompasses customer due diligence, enterprise-wide risk 

assessment, customer name screening, transaction screening and 

monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and ongoing training. 

 

In addition to a strong board and senior management oversight, 

the bank is committed to sustaining risk outcomes through ongoing 

review and enhancement of existing processes, including the 

deployment of new techniques and technologies to facilitate risk 

detection. Contravention of these policies and standards could 

necessitate investigation and disciplinary action. Such incidents may 

also be escalated to the authorities and lead to prosecution of the 

parties involved.

Maintaining strong oversight on financial crime matters  

Our Group Operational Risk Committee regularly reviews metrices 

and reports on financial crime to ensure that financial crime risks are 

identified and sufficiently mitigated. Material issues are escalated to 

the Risk Executive Committee and Board Risk Management Committee. 

Read more about our operational risk management under “Risk management” 

in our Annual Report. 

Raising awareness through continual training

Training and awareness are instrumental in our financial crime 

programmes. We equip our employees with the knowledge to 

identify financial crime risks and empower them to take the 

necessary actions to mitigate such risks. In this regard: 

• All new hires are required to complete mandatory training on AML 

and Sanctions, Anti-Fraud, Anti-Bribery &amp; Corruption, and Code of 

Conduct.

• All existing employees are required to complete mandatory 

refresher training on AML and Sanctions annually. They are also 

required to acknowledge that they understood our Code of 

Conduct annually, including our stance on anti-corruption.

DBS Speak Up

DBS Speak Up is our whistleblowing programme. It provides a 

safe environment for genuine concerns to be raised on possible 

misconduct. The programme offers various channels for 

whistleblowing, as well as anonymity upon request. Our employees 

are strongly encouraged to report any misconduct or concerns in 

a safe environment without reprisal or recrimination. Incidences 

reported are duly and independently investigated for appropriate 

follow-up action. 

In 2021, we refreshed our Speak Up campaign by leveraging on both 

physical and digital mediums to raise staff awareness on our Speak 

Up programme. We emphasised to our employees that we do not 

tolerate any reprisals when disclosures are made in good faith.

Leveraging technology and partnerships 

Our financial crime risk mitigation programme has been enhanced 

over the years by leveraging heavily on technology and data analytics. 

We now use an array of artificial intelligence and machine learning 

(AI/ ML) capabilities to supplement rules-based engines to carry 

out surveillance at many levels and protect our customers from 

financial crime. Customer due diligence has been further enhanced 

with dynamic analytical reviews based on changes in static data or 

transactional behaviour.  

We also focus on public-private sector collaborations, participating 

actively in initiatives between financial institutions and law 

enforcement agencies, and contributing our thought leadership.

Improving risk surveillance and controls execution

Money launderers and terrorist networks are highly sophisticated 

in their methods to conceal their transactions and activities. We 

strive to detect them from micro to macro levels, by deploying our 



suite of risk surveillance tools through the pervasive use of data 

analytic solutions. We have been strengthening our risk surveillance 

tools over the years to enable more robust detections of suspicious 

transactions and identification of bad actors.

We have matured the use of our Macro Payment Flow Dashboard, 

which monitors fund flows between markets and between banks. 

This enables us with a holistic overview of funds flows that are of 

significant amounts or exhibited unusual patterns. When a suspicious 

flow is identified, we leverage additional data analytics tools to flag 

out customers and transactions for further investigations. Bad actors 

are comprehensively detected and removed in a shorter time frame 

compared to traditional monitoring at the customer transaction level. 

We have also expanded the deployment of our case management 

system – Customer Regional Unified Surveillance Enterprise (CRUISE) 

across our regional footprint. CRUISE is our in-house intelligent case  

management system designed to support our transaction surveillance  

teams in effectively reviewing suspicious activities flagged by rule-based  

systems. Most of our transaction surveillance teams at our core locations  

are now supported by CRUISE. This has uplifted our effectiveness 

and efficiency in reviewing and reporting suspicious transactions.  

To further improve our effectiveness, we operationalised Dynamic 

Review Assessment (DRA), which leverages data analytics to detect 

behavioural red flags based on changes in customer profiles 

and activities. DRA enables us to conduct targeted customer due 

diligence with a risk-based approach. This is a significant departure 

from the industry norm of performing time-bound periodic customer 

due diligence reviews with outcomes driven mainly by assessing static 

customer information. DRA takes into consideration a combination of 

risk criteria, including transaction activities and more recent financial 

crime typologies. This solution gives our analysts opportunities to 

perform a deep dive into the specific risks by evaluating the criteria 

triggering the review.

Protecting our customers from scams

The increased adoption of digital channels to perform financial 

transactions have heightened the risk of fraud. In light of this, we take 

a multi-prong approach to provide a secured banking environment 

for our customers and safeguard the confidence in digital payments. 

One of the key pillars of our anti-scam programme is #BSHARP,  

an awareness programme that continually educate our customers on 

protecting themselves from scams.

We have also strengthened our digital controls for online banking 

with new features. These security features complement other 

controls such as transaction notifications to enhance the security of 

our mobile and internet banking services.

Our fraud surveillance systems are subjected to a rigorous regime of 

calibrations and enhancements to sustain the desired effectiveness 

for fraud detection, as fraudsters constantly deploy new scam tactics 

to perpetuate fraud. With improvements in our anti-scam controls, 

the total amount of fraud losses that we prevented and recovered  

for our customers in 2021 was more than double of the previous 

year. A large part of our improvements can be attributed to the  

use data analytics.

We also recognise that the fight against scams requires the combined 

effort of the financial industry, consumers, and law enforcement 

agencies. We have been championing various industry initiatives with 

the Association of Banks in Singapore and the MAS Payment Council. 

This includes working on a fair and transparent framework for the 

allocation of responsibility and loss between financial institutions and 

consumers to incentivise the right behaviours.

transaction alert being filed as Suspicious Transactions Reports, so 

that lower risk alerts can be hibernated and allow higher risk alerts 

to be prioritised.

Our approach

Although there were no material instances of customer data loss 

or cyber incidents in 2021, it is evident that we are expanding our 

ecosystem and technology footprint. New risks have emerged 

as cyber threat actors exploit gaps in the broadening technology 

environment amidst the changing business and operational 

environment. In 2021, there was a 3% increase in the number of 

phishing attacks targeted at our staff. The number of phishing 

websites targeting our customers also went up by five times. 

DBS recognises the gravity of these cyber threats and the importance 

of keeping our customers, employee, and communities safe. Cyber 

security remains one of our key priorities, and we are increasingly 

focused on the following:  

• Investing in our cyber defence capabilities 

To safeguard internal assets from emerging threats and 

strengthen our ability to detect and respond to threats

• Staying vigilant through knowledge sharing and ecosystem 

partnerships 

To create a safe and secure cyberspace for our customers

• Enhancing board and management governance 

To maintain oversight of the cybersecurity programme  

at the technology, operational, executive and board levels

• Maintaining trust and resilience 

To uphold our customers’ trust and protect their information  

and assets entrusted in our care 

Initiatives

Investing in our cyber defence capabilities

Cyber security risk is evolving as the bank and our customers have 

defaulted to remote working. We accelerated the digitalisation of 

our internal processes while streamlining and standardising our 

employees’ journey for remote working. New ecosystem partnerships 

were established, and innovative technologies were introduced as 

the bank seeks to expand our services and offerings to customers. 

This introduced new cybersecurity threats and risks to our critical 

assets and services.

Correspondingly, we continued to invest in cyber defence capabilities 

to safeguard internal assets from emerging threats and strengthen 

our ability to detect and respond to threat actors’ modus operandi. 

Additional assessment was commissioned to evaluate cyber threat 

exposure from our technology supply chain and ensure that 

cyber security risks from our suppliers are adequately managed. 

Recommendations from the assessments were implemented to 

further strengthen our cyber resilience.

Inside Is the New Outside cyber security strategy

In response to the incremental risks from our expanded ecosystem 

and technology footprint, we reinforced our Inside Is the New Outside 

cyber security strategy by extending our layered cyber security 

controls within the enterprise technology environment. We engaged 

external subject matter experts to validate the efficacy of our 

controls against external threats and within the bank’s internal and 

external technology environments in equal measures.

Granular access controls were implemented to provide conditional 

role-based control to our applications while network micro-

segmentation further restricted access and reduced attack surface 

of our servers. One-Tap, Multi-factor authentication was further 

extended across all supported internal applications to mitigate 

the risk of credential theft while minimising user friction. Near 

real-time monitoring was also introduced to proactively detect 

misconfiguration in our cloud environment while enterprise controls 

were implemented to detect and manage IoT devices.

As we implemented more controls, the volume of security events and 

alerts generated also increased. This increased the volume of cases 

needed to be reviewed, analysed, and followed-up by our security 

operation centre. Automating voluminous and repetitive tasks for 

our security analysts not just allowed them to better manage their 

workload, but also resulted in a 30% improvement in time taken to 

detect the problem and respond accordingly.

As the cyber threat landscape evolves, the bank continues to 

explore innovative security solutions such as behavioural biometric 

as continuous authentication, and data detection and response 

(DDR) to improve our cybersecurity capabilities. These solutions will 

be considered for adoption when they mature and are ready for 

widespread commercialisation.

Staying vigilant through knowledge sharing and ecosystem 

partnerships

DBS recognises the contagion effect of cyber security risks and 

actively collaborates with our institutional customers, peer banks, 

technology partners and financial industry associations, exchanging 

cyber threat intelligence, sharing security know-how, and developing 

guidelines and best practices together improve our collective 

cyber resiliency. We actively participated in of cybersecurity risks 

discussions with regulators, law enforcement and government 

agencies to create a safe and secure cyberspace for our customers.

Broad-based security awareness programme

In view of the heightened cyber threats targeting our staff, we 

developed a broad-based security awareness programme for them. 

This includes inculcating a sense of personal responsibility when it 

comes to being cyber secure, and driving the adoption of good cyber 

hygiene. In 2021, our annual mandatory training on cybersecurity 

threats, policies and practices was delivered to more than 26,000 

employees via our online eLearning platforms. In-between annual

mandatory trainings, regular security awareness trainings were 

also held to raise the awareness of our employees on the emerging

awareness effort with Cybrfit, an in-house gamified eLearning 

platform that delivers bite-sized security trainings. The two month-

long programme saw more than 7,000 staff actively participating in 

the various challenges. 

Targeted specialised security trainings

The bank also conducts specialised security trainings for technology 

staff. Staff who are responsible for system administration activities 

on our critical systems and infrastructure are trained in relevant 

legislation, regulations, and code of practices. We have also been 

developing and improving our software security design and 

development curriculum to cater to our staff according to their 

proficiency levels. In 2021, 8,335 of our staff completed the basic 

Software Security Awareness and Development modules while a 

further 1,612 completed and attained certification for intermediary 

proficiency in secure software development.

Protecting our customers from cyber threats

DBS also doubled down on our efforts to protect customers from 

the latest cyber scams. Timely security advisories were posted on 

customer digital touchpoints to warn them, while security best 

practices were delivered to our consumer and SMEs in the form of 

light-hearted videos. 

Enhancing board and management governance

Maintaining trust and resilience

DBS is committed to upholding our customers’ trust, and protecting 

their information and assets entrusted in our care. To proactively 

manage cyber risks, our cybersecurity programme is based on widely 

adopted security frameworks and practices. In 2021, to ensure 

continued compliance, we adopted new cybersecurity regulatory 

expectations and guidelines as a baseline for our cybersecurity 

framework. We regularly assess developments in the cyber threat 

space and continue to improve our control environment in tandem 

with the ever-increasing sophistication of such attacks.

Case study

DBS continues to do our part for the community. We participated in 

the Technology in Finance Immersion Programme to train individuals 

and mid-career aspirants in emerging technology areas such as 

artificial intelligence, cloud computing, cyber security, data analytics 

and full stack development. We have also offered traineeship 

positions under the SGUnited Traineeships Program to provide real 

life work experience for graduates who are affected by the Covid-19 

economic downturn. This provides a pipeline of professionals to 

alleviate the technology manpower crunch experienced in various 

industries. 

 

DBS also embarked on a skills-based volunteering initiative, Cyber 

Wellness programme, for employees of local social enterprises and 

charities. In view of restrictions on in-person classroom-style training, 

we invested in an online platform to deliver the training content on 

cyber risks, threats, and security best practices, remotely. In 2021, 

more than 2,800 individuals completed the training, marking a 

fourfold increase year-on-year.

Our efforts were recognised as DBS continues to win accolades from 

industry associations for our cyber security programme. In 2021, 

the bank received the cybersecurity award from the Associations of 

Information Security Professionals, for the second year running. 

In addition, DBS received international recognition from The Banker, 

a publication by the Financial Times, for our secure access and 

remote working initiative under the cyber security category.

Our Approach

We believe that maintaining a fair and transparent approach to tax 

management is the foundation to conducting a responsible business. 

This underpins our continual commitment to pay our fair share of 

taxes in the locations where we operate and comply with all relevant 

tax laws and regulations. We do so by: 

• Conducting our business in an ethical and professional 

manner 

Adopt ethical and professional business practices and ensure 

our tax policy and tax risk management framework are effectively 

implemented.

• Strengthening relationships based on the principles of 

transparency and fairness 

Build and enhance trust with tax authorities based on strong tax 

governance and transparency.

• Actively contributing to industry efforts on tax rules and 

practice development 

Participate in industry feedback on key tax regulations and policies  

with the objective of achieving the policy objectives and outcomes.

Governance and Framework

Tax governance

The Board of Directors’ responsibility for sustainability includes 

responsible tax management with the Board Audit Committee 

reviewing tax matters. The Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO), 

supported by the Head of Group Tax, oversees the tax function 

which is responsible for tax compliance and the management  

of tax risks and exposures. 

DBS has low-tolerance for tax risk and adopts a clearly defined tax 

risk management framework that promotes transparency, fairness, 

and accountability. This is implemented through our Group Tax 

Policy, which is approved by the Group CFO. The Policy is further 

supplemented by standards and guides to ensure continued 

adherence with the framework. 

Risk management framework

Our tax risk management framework is based on the  

following principles: 

• We only undertake transactions which are underpinned by strong 

commercial motivations that can withstand public scrutiny.

• We carefully consider the potential tax sensitivity of transactions 

and are guided by a set of established escalation and  

approval procedures.

• We have sufficient skilled employees where we have significant 

operations, and we will seek independent advice on transactions 

with significant tax uncertainty.

• We take our tax compliance responsibilities seriously and fulfil all 

our obligations as a responsible taxpayer

These principles allow us to align our tax contributions in any 

tax jurisdiction with the value created in those locations. Our 

approach to transactions with clients is guided by our Tax Sensitive 

Transactions Standard. We will not knowingly engage in tax 

structures that aim to evade tax. In addition, we have a process in 

place to ensure that transactions that may lead to tax avoidance are 

escalated and reviewed by risk and control functions as and when 

required. 

Evolving Tax Landscape

Today, the global tax landscape is transforming rapidly, with greater 

focus on tax transparency and tax governance. The introduction of 

the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) Framework is a clear 

signal of the conviction to put an end to tax avoidance strategies that 

exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to 

low- or no-tax locations. DBS operates in a highly regulated industry. 

We maintain economic substance and conduct businesses in places 

where we have a physical presence(9). As domestic tax laws and 

international tax standards continue to evolve, we will continue to 

discharge our role as a responsible and compliant taxpayer through 

consistent implementation of the BEPS measures. 

BEPS 2.0

Since the implementation of the BEPS Project, the OECD has 

continued its work to address the tax challenges arising from the 

digitalisation of the economy(10). The proposed solutions to these 

challenges are encompassed in two pillars and are likely to take effect 

in 2023(11). As at 4 November 2021, 137 member jurisdictions  

have agreed to the OECD/ G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS’s  

two-pillar solution.

Pillar One aims to adapt the international tax system to the increasingly 

globalised and digitalised economy, through changes to the allocation 

of taxing rights and profits. This is done by establishing a new tax nexus 

on sales that is not dependent on physical presence, and reallocating 

profits to jurisdictions in which sales originate (i.e. market jurisdictions). 

Certain industries, including regulated financial services sector, are 

scoped out. In scope companies for Pillar One are the multinational 

enterprises with global turnover above EUR 20 billion and profitability 

above 10% (i.e. profit before tax/revenue). The turnover threshold 

would be reduced to EUR 10 billion following a review which is intended 

to begin 7 years after the agreement comes into force. Given the 

current design, scope and available information, Pillar One would likely 

not have a material impact on DBS for the first phase. Nonetheless, 

there remains some uncertainty as the OECD has not defined the 

scope of regulated financial services and the implications of a reduction 

in the revenue threshold is unclear.

Pillar Two aims to put a floor to international tax competition 

through a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. We remain an 

active participant in the ongoing engagement on Pillar Two through 

feedback to the local tax authorities and various industry forums.

Our approach

In 2014, DBS Foundation (DBSF) was launched with an SGD 50 

million fund to mark the bank’s commitment to champion social 

entrepreneurship in Asia. With the pandemic upending livelihoods 

and casting a spotlight on a wide range of social issues, the bank 

has recently set aside an additional SGD 100 million to further our 

efforts to improving lives in Asia. The funds will go towards catalysing 

the work of the DBSF, as well as the bank’s various philanthropic and 

crisis relief measures. The existing ‘Business for Impact’ chapter will 

expand its efforts in helping social enterprises (SEs) – also known as 

businesses for impact – to grow from ideation stage to full-fledged 

businesses and empower them to tackle social and environmental 

issues. There will be a new ‘Community Impact’ chapter to bolster the  

bank’s contributions to the community through giving and volunteerism.

Our early support for SEs resonates with our heritage as a 

‘development bank’ helping build businesses and industries, 

leveraging our expertise in serving the small and medium-sized 

enterprises (SME) sector. We believe that businesses need to 

consider not only short-term shareholder returns but also the long-

term interests of the communities that we serve. 

Through the work of DBS Foundation, we want to catalyse the growth of  

an ecosystem of purpose-driven businesses that does business differently  

and in doing so, scale the impact that we can make by addressing the 

myriad of social and environmental challenges that confront a rapidly 

growing Asia, made worse by the effects of the pandemic. 

DBS Foundation adopts a one-bank approach to catalyse the growth 

of these businesses for impact through the following:  

• Advocate – Increase awareness of SEs

• Nurture – Enable SEs to scale up through grants and loans, 

capacity building, publicity and networking

• Integrate – Walk the talk by embedding SEs into the culture and 

operations of DBS  

Initiatives

Advocate

We want to inspire people to join the journey of supporting, starting 

and being a business for impact by amplifying inspiring stories of SEs 

and their beneficiaries across Asia.

views and 19 million engagements.

SUSTAINABILITY PILLARS

Our approach 

At DBS, purpose is at the heart of what we do, and we encourage 

our employees to volunteer their time and skills to support the 

community, and truly be People of Purpose. 

People of Purpose (PoP) is DBS’ employee volunteer movement that 

brings our values to life.

We aim to inculcate a spirit of volunteerism in all our employees. Our 

commitment is instituted in having two official volunteer-leave days 

for each employee. We continue to undertake multiple service-based 

and skills-based volunteering activities that allow our employees 

to leverage their time and skills to better connect with and make 

meaningful contributions to the communities we live and work in, 

across our core markets. 

Amidst the pandemic, our employees contributed more than 100,000 

volunteering hours in 2021, a 75% increase from the previous year, 

demonstrating our commitment to serve the community through  

challenging times. We continued the pivot to virtual ways of volunteering  

amidst restrictions across most of our markets, with these virtual 

programmes making up 66% of our total volunteering hours.

This year, we:  

• Scaled up our volunteering efforts 

To build on our efforts in the thematic areas of elderly, education, 

and the environment 

• Developed a hybrid approach to volunteering 

To engage based on the needs of the communities and unique 

skillsets of our employees 

• Dialled up focus on skills-based volunteering 

To leverage our employees’ time and skills to give back meaningfully

In 2021, the pandemic continued to impact lives and livelihoods 

globally. The needs of the community became more varied and 

severe, with many of our core markets facing second waves of 

infection and large-scale impacts. We recognise that there is a 

greater need to support the communities in these challenging times 

through our volunteerism and giving efforts. 

Initiatives

Scaling up on our volunteering efforts

Our volunteering efforts across our core markets have been focused on  

three areas – the elderly, education, and the environment. We continue  

to focus on the elderly as Asia is aging fast and about a quarter of Asians  

will be 60 years old and above by the middle of this century. Hence there  

is a growing and urgent need to address the socio-economic needs  

of this segment. We also continue to grow our volunteering in education  

with a priority on financial and digital literacy, mentoring and empowering  

students, and supporting  vulnerable segments in the communities such 

as children, migrant domestic workers, and single mothers. 

As food waste is a key contributor to climate change and accounts 

for almost 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, we continued to 

build on the regional movement to galvanise multiple stakeholders 

into action towards zero food waste. This is a part of our 

commitment to the environment and to a sustainable and climate-

resilient future. In 2022, we will continue our focus in these areas, 

and strengthen our efforts even further.

Developing a hybrid approach to volunteering   

As the world continues to battle the pandemic, the needs of the 

communities have evolved to include both social and emotional ones, 

in addition to the more immediate economic and medical challenges.

In-person volunteering remains a challenge with pandemic restrictions  

in place for most markets where we operate in. Our volunteering 

programmes are customised based on the needs of the community 

and we remain committed to best support these needs as the 

world seeks to live in the new normal. In 2021, we adopted a hybrid 

approach, with both in-person and virtual volunteering programmes. 

Improving the volunteering journey for our employees 

We are also always looking at ways to enhance the volunteering 

journey for our employees, making volunteering simple, seamless 

and accessible. 

We launched PoP Connect as a central one-stop digital platform 

for all our volunteering programmes regionally last year, making 

volunteering programmes easy to search and sign up for. The 

platform also enables consistent tracking of all PoP programmes 

regionally. To date, over 15,600 employees have registered on 

PoP Connect, and in 2021 alone, we listed over 1,300 volunteering 

opportunities on the platform. We continue to make enhancements 

to the platform as we strive to constantly improve the volunteering 

journey for our employees.  

We recognise that the PoP employee movement helps to inculcate a 

spirit of giving back in our employees, thus creating a workforce that 

thinks and operates with purpose amidst a changing world inundated 

with challenges. It is our desire to continue to cultivate a culture of 

giving and a company aware of the needs in the community. 

Dialling up skills-based volunteering programmes

Approximately one-fifth of our 2021 volunteering activities were 

skills-based. This was rolled out through programmes where our 

employees used their knowledge and skills to serve the community. 

These included financial and digital literacy programmes for the elderly,  

children, and youth, mentoring and career conversations, and audiobook  

recording for the visually impaired. There was also an increase in regional  

volunteering programmes for social enterprises supported by DBS 

Foundation, which leveraged the expertise of our employees to solve 

business challenges. These programmes include the DBS Foundation 

Grant Evaluation, Done in A Day, and Hungry for Change Ideation 

Challenge.

Singapore

#TeamDBSGives Food Donation Drive

During movement restrictions in Singapore, more than 

900 Singapore PoP volunteers answered the call for the 

#TeamDBSgives Food Donation Drive, preparing and donating 

non-perishable food bundles to the Food Bank Singapore. We 

also matched donations from DBS volunteers to enhance fresh 

food support for the beneficiaries. Through this initiative, not 

only was the number of beneficiaries doubled, but families were 

also provided fresh produce for nutritious meals. Collectively,  

the bank was able to support over 1,800 individuals and families 

in need.

Commitment to Skills-based Volunteering

DBS is always on a lookout for opportunities for our employees 

to volunteer their skills. We partnered with the National Youth 

Council and Empact in the YouthTech Programme, which aims 

to support digitalisation efforts within the social sector and the 

upskilling of youth in Singapore. 

Over 3 sessions, our PoP volunteers dedicated their time to 

provide individual “consultations” with 27 unique non-profit 

organisations and social enterprises across a spectrum of 

social causes. The topics covered included digital knowledge 

and skills, digital marketing, and data analysis. Our employees 

provided third-party perspectives that helped the organisations 

assess their current digitalisation challenges.

Hong Kong Spreading Care Eco-Enzymatically

More than 400 PoP volunteers took part in an online 

workshop by Fruit Peels Family, a social enterprise which 

promotes environmental protection and sustainable lifestyles. 

The volunteers learnt how to upcycle fruit peels into eco-

enzymatic detergents, together with participants from Hong 

Kong Federation of the Blind &amp; Direction Association for the 

Handicapped.

In total, more than 550 bottles were made and given out 

together with hand-written message cards to elderly-in-need, 

spreading love and care in the community.

Extending Skills-based Volunteering to Social Enterprises 

Supported by CUHK 

DBS partnered with Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), 

which provides a wide range of support to assist its professors 

to translate their research into community-based social impact 

projects with a sustainable model. 

Through a business “clinic”, we offered our expertise to 

overcome some of their business challenges. For example,  

a team of DBS subject matter experts shared about marketing 

and customer experience management with 4 CUHK-supported 

social enterprises. The sharing was beneficial and well-received. 

Taiwan

Upcycling for Good

In celebration of DBS’ anniversary, DBS Taiwan partnered with 

social enterprise, A Time of Glass and non-profit organisation,  

Dr. Rednose for two mass sewing programmes. 169 PoP 

volunteers upcycled old t-shirts and transformed them into 

puppets. These puppets were then donated to Dr. Rednose, 

which were used during performances by therapy clowns for 

children at hospitals during the pandemic. 

iLab Workshop for Social Enterprises 

DBS Taiwan partnered with social enterprise, Insights, to roll 

out incubator and accelerator programmes for other social 

enterprises in Taiwan. Four workshops were hosted, focusing 

on customer relationship management, financial and funding 

for startups, leadership management, and public relations. 

13 PoP volunteers served as mentors for the workshops, and 

they shared their knowledge and expertise with over 160 

participants from social enterprises.

Case Study

China

Connecting through Curling

35 PoP volunteers from our Treasury &amp; Market team in China 

paired up with 15 special buddies from the World of Art Brut  

Culture (WABC). WABC is a social enterprise that works with 

persons with autism to enhance their development, education 

and quality of life. A curling race was planned, which filled the 

day with meaning, sweat and laughter. 

Through this initiative, the students had opportunities to  

connect with the volunteers and the wider community. 

Virtual Teaching for Rural Children 

DBS China Tianjin branch partnered with Chi Heng Foundation 

(CHF), a non-profit organisation that aims to advocate for equal 

opportunity and eliminate discrimination against minority 

groups and under-privileged members of society. 

Through this partnership, DBS volunteers spent their weekends 

to virtually teach rural children from thousands of miles away, 

increasing their access to education.

Indonesia

Daily Breakfast Distribution with Foodbank of Indonesia 

In conjunction with the World Food Day 2021, DBS Indonesia 

employees partnered with The Foodbank of Indonesia to 

prepare and cook breakfast from the “Public Kitchen”, and 

distributed the meals to daily wage workers in Indonesia.  

This programme ran for six weeks from November to December 

2021, with 2,528 meal portions prepared, benefiting 632 daily 

wage workers and their families.

Stellar performance for Skills-based volunteering in 

Indonesia 

As part of the DBS Foundation Social Enterprise Bootcamp in 

Indonesia, which was organised in partnership with Instellar, 

PoP volunteers moderated three masterclasses for social 

enterprises, SMEs, and the public. In addition, four intensive 

classes for selected social enterprises were held. 

Each social enterprise was matched with at least one mentor 

from DBS Indonesia, who then supported the completion of 

tasks and assignments during the bootcamp.

India

Interning with Purpose 

Gaining more than practical corporate experience and skills, 

a group of DBS interns also volunteered their time to virtually 

teach over 25 students from the SOS Children’s Village shelter 

home in Maharashtra, India. 

The interns worked in groups of four to five volunteers and 

shared on topics including air, water, and soil pollution. Those 

sharing sessions were enhanced with the use of slides,  

pictures and videos.

Audiobooks for Visually Impaired Children

In 2021, DBS PoP volunteers in India supported four different 

non-profit organisations, by recording close to 450 audiobooks 

over more than 15 audiobook recording sessions. Those 

audiobooks were recorded in English and in India’s regional 

languages. They are used as educational resources to support 

more than 5,000 visually-challenged children.

 As with previous years, we report Scope 2 emissions based on both location-based and market-based approaches. Under the market-based approach, our 

Scope 2 emissions were reduced from purchased RECs in Hong Kong only.

(7)  

 Scope 1 emissions include direct carbon emissions from backup diesel generators, LPG from kitchens, and fugitive emissions from fire retardants and 

refrigerants including FM200, SF6, R-410a, R-22, R-134a, R132, R-32, and NOVEC-1230 - all converted to CO2 equivalent. We also include both fossil fuel diesel, 

used cooking oil (UCO) biodiesel genset fuel (new this year), and LPG for cooking in Singapore.

(8)  

 Scope 2 emissions include purchased electricity, purchased chilled water energy - converted using efficiencies from the central chilled water suppliers, and 

energy for cooling offices and branches. They are converted to CO2 equivalents using NEA GHG Emissions Measurement and Reporting Guidelines 2021, IEA 

Energy Statistics Manual, IGES_Grid_EF2021 OMEF for India Grid, Singapore Energy Statistics OMEF 2019 Bureau of Energy Ministry of Economic Affairs, GHG 

Protocol GWP 2016, ACP.Copernicus 2018, GOV.UK

(9)  

 Scope 3 emissions include outsourced shuttle bus travel, inter-office mail transport for Singapore, limousine service (new in 2021), cash loading transport (new 

in 2021), executive transport (new in 2021), carbon equivalent from electric vehicle transport in China (new in 2021), employee air travel as arranged by travel 

agencies Ctrip and Egencia, energy used in outsourced data centres, carbon equivalent from waste disposal (new in 2021) including incineration, landfilling, 

composting, general recycling, and e-waste recycling; carbon equivalents from storage facilities (new in 2021). We do not include any carbon footprint from 

items that were repurposed, gifted, or sold.

(10) 

Carbon emission intensity is reported as tCO2e/SGD million in total income, excluding our LVB portfolio

(11) 

 All water consumption reported is considered freshwater according to GRI 303, and as per the GRI requirement, 1,000 cubic metres (m3) is equivalent to 1 megalitre. 

(12) 

 Water stress was assessed using WRI.org tool ‘aqueduct water risk atlas’ where “stressed” is defined as &gt;40% at risk

(13) 

Printing paper includes A3, A4 and A5 paper used in our offices and branches

(14) 

 Eco-friendly paper sources are defined as those with certifications such as Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest 

Certification (PEFC) or equivalent.

(15) 

 Bottled water refers to plastics bottled water purchase by DBS, either DBS branded or other brands, used in our operations, or for our customers. All bottled 

water used are from non-renewable sources.

METHODOLOGY FOR TCFD

Methodologies to climate change credit risk modelling 

Physical risk scenario analyses

Physical risk scenario analysis mainly leverages locational hazard 

mapping methodologies to develop initial insights on the potential 

physical risk impacts to DBS Hong Kong property-secured lending 

portfolios, which has been piloted in the 2021 Hong Kong Monetary 

Authority (HKMA) Climate Risk Stress Test.

The pilot analysis leveraged the historical weather event data from 

the Hong Kong Observatory, and the projected financial impacts are 

overlaid to the GPS coordinates of the property collaterals in DBS 

Hong Kong portfolios. Key drivers of potential physical risk impacts 

arise from the estimated economic damage to the property valuation 

arising from acute weather events like cyclones and chronic climate 

changes such as sea level rise. 

The climate scenario used was prescribed by the HKMA calibrated on 

historical data from the Hong Kong Observatory, and adapted from 

the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario from 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The map illustrates the likelihood of frequency of acute weather 

events across the locations projected under the High Emission 

scenario by 2060. Properties located in certain coastal areas of 

Hong Kong Island, Lantau Island, West Kowloon are forecasted to 

experience acute physical risk impacts once in a 5-year return period 

(i.e. 20% probability of occurrence).



High likelihood: 1:5 year return period

Medium likelihood: 1:10 year return period

Low likelihood: Less than 1:10 year return period

Transition risk scenario analyses 

Transition risk scenario analysis is conducted in DBS using a suite 

of Climate Scenario Analysis (CSA) models. The CSA translates the 

effects of policy and regulation changes, technology development 

and changes in consumer preferences as defined by a set of 

standard climate scenarios (for example, from the Network of 

Greening the Financial System (NGFS)) into impacts to key financial 

drivers identified for each sector.

The NGFS scenarios employed in this analysis may be classified into 

the following categories:

The CSA is based on a bottom-up approach where relevant company 

and industry information such as company financials and emissions 

data are used to determine the impact on the company’s credit 

rating, leveraging on the NGFS scenarios described above. 

Scenario data include primary, secondary, and final energy 

consumption, emissions data, carbon price, price indices for key 

energy variables. The data used are sector specific and may be 

further expanded to capture key dynamics of specific sectors. A total 

To stress the rest of the portfolio not covered by the CSA models, a 

top-down analysis is conducted whereby companies were selected 

based on their materiality, data availability and representativeness of 

i.  Orderly scenarios assume climate policies are introduced 

early and become gradually more stringent. Both physical and 

transition risks are relatively subdued. 

ii.  Disorderly scenarios explore higher transition risk due to policies 

being delayed or divergent across countries and sectors. For 

example, carbon prices would have to increase abruptly after  

a period of delay. 

iii.  Hot house world scenarios assume that some climate policies are  

implemented in some jurisdictions, but global efforts are insufficient  

to halt significant global warming. The scenarios result in severe 

physical risk, including irreversible impacts such as sea level rise.

of nine sectors, selected based on its significance in the IBG portfolio 

and to carbon emissions, were included in the transition risk scenario 

analyses, including Power and Automotive.

We used relevant company financials and industry-specific data 

to perform the bottom-up modelling for each company. The 

methodology identifies and assesses how key drivers such as 

production volume, unit cost of production, selling price, capital 

expenditure and asset value, translates into impact to the company’s 

financial statements, and finally into changes to credit ratings over 

the forecast horizon.

Limitations of climate risk scenario analysis

Climate risk scenario analysis is an important tool to assess the 

resilience of a bank’s business models and strategies to a range of 

plausible climate related pathways, and to determine the impact 

of climate related risk drivers on overall risk profile. Outcome of 

scenario analysis can also be used to assess the risk implications of 

various decarbonisation pathways and deviations therefrom.

Meanwhile, since the area of climate scenario analysis and the 

associated modelling is still at a relatively early stage of development 

and an industry standard is yet to emerge, it is important that 

the uncertainties and limitations associated with climate scenario 

analysis are understood to ensure that the results are interpreted 

and used appropriately:

1)  Extended horizon: Time horizon of over 30 years is typical of 

scenario analysis (e.g. transition risk analysis typically goes to 

at least 2050 to align with net zero goal horizon, while physical 

risk analysis can be of longer horizon). This is much longer than 

typical business planning horizon, with uncertainties arising from 

technological development, demographic change and climate tipping 

point events etc.

2)  Scenario Definition: Granularity of climate scenarios from common 

sources such as NGFS or IEA for various sectors and countries 

differs, thus necessitating the use of further assumptions to 

down-scale the scenarios to suit the bespoke exposure profile of 

different bank.

3)  Data: Bottom-up firm level analysis requires granular data such 

as absolute emissions or intensity for various scope of a firm’s 

activities, which currently varies in terms of availability, granularity, 

and accuracy.

With the focus on climate risk scenario analysis by the industry and 

regulators, it is expected that significant effort will be invested to 

address such limitations over the next couple of years.

Practitioner’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information based on the procedures we have 

performed and the evidence we have obtained. We performed our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Singapore Standard 

on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) – Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and, 

in respect of greenhouse gas emissions included in the Identified Sustainability Information, Singapore Standard on Assurance Engagements 

3410 – Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (“SSAE 3410”) (collectively the “Standards”). These      Standards require 

that we plan and perform our work to form the conclusion about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is free from material 

misstatement. The extent of our procedures depends on our professional judgment and our assessment of the engagement risk. 

A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Reporting Criteria as the 

basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability 

Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall 

presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable 

assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures 

performed in response to the assessed risks.

The procedures selected included inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, analytical procedures, evaluating 

the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records. Given the 

circumstances of the engagement, we also performed the following:

• interviewed management and personnel in Group Procurement Services, Group Human Resources and Corporate Real Estate Strategy &amp; 

Administration in relation to the Identified Sustainability Information; 

• obtained an understanding of how the Identified Sustainability Information is gathered, collated and aggregated internally;

• performed limited substantive testing, on a selective basis, of the Identified Sustainability Information (i) to verify the assumptions, 

estimations and computations made in relation to the Identified Sustainability Information; and (ii) to check that data had been 

appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported, to the extent we considered necessary and appropriate to provide sufficient 

evidence for our conclusion; and

• assessed the disclosure and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.  

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable 

assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that 

would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance 

opinion about whether the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the 

Reporting Criteria.

Inherent Limitations 

In designing these procedures, we considered the system of internal controls in relation to the Identified Sustainability Information and 

reliance has been placed on internal controls where appropriate. Because of the inherent limitations in any accounting and internal control 

system, errors and irregularities may nevertheless occur and not be detected.

The absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established practice on which to draw to 

evaluate and measure subject matter allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between 

entities. 

The quantification of the greenhouse gas emissions data underlying the Identified Sustainability Information is subject to inherent uncertainty 

because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different 

gases, and the estimation uncertainty from the measurement and calculation processes used to quantify emissions within the bounds of 

existing scientific knowledge. This can affect the ability to draw meaningful comparison of the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions over time. 

Conclusion

Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 

believe that the Identified Sustainability Information for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 is not prepared, in all material respects, in 

accordance with the Reporting Criteria.

Purpose and Restriction on Distribution and Use

This report, including our conclusion, has been prepared solely for the Company in accordance with the letter of engagement between us. To 

the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company for our work or this report.

Yours faithfully
