Listing Rule 711(B), and in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, 

Core option, for the financial year ended 30 September 2021, which highlights the Group’s 

commitment to undertaking business responsibly and sustainably. We have chosen to report 

using the GRI Standards because it is an internationally recognised reporting framework that 

covers a comprehensive range of sustainability disclosures. Moreover, the structured 

framework promotes reporting a full and balanced picture of the Group’s material matters 

and the management of its impact. This report represents the industry practice for tracking 

performance on a range of economic, environmental, social and governance indicators.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

 

The Group is committed to creating long-term value for the stakeholders. The sustainability 

strategy is to assess and manage the most material economic, environmental, social and 

governance impacts, risks and opportunities arising from the business operations to support 

the sustainable growth of the business. 

 

Materiality assessment is essential to the sustainability strategy. We performed a peer 

benchmarking assessment of sustainability-related disclosures to generate a list of potential 

material matters. Subsequently, each business and department head deliberated and 

prioritised on the most material sustainability matters.  

 

The sustainability focus areas identified as integral to our business are outlined in the table 

on the next page.

ENVIRONMENT 

(i) 

ENERGY CONSERVATION 

 

Energy conservation plays an important role in the environment and ways of utilisation 

of non-renewable resources would also impact the environment. Conservation of 

electrical energy can help to lessen pollution hence the Group has taken the necessary 

steps to reduce it.  

 

Pok Brothers  

 

Our Energy Conservation Management Initiative: 

 

- 

New plant in Pulau Indah has better energy consumption than the Glenmarie plant 

as it contributed to energy saving of approximately 57,831 KwH in FY2021 

compared to FY2020.This new plant is installed with inverters,  has better 

optimization of cold rooms space and temperature control in cold rooms. 

 

- 

Replacement with LED lights: Glenmarie factory has been replaced with energy-

saving light such as LED to lower electricity costs.  

 

- 

Operations and maintenance: Perform preventive maintenance in plant to identify 

for any potential issues and correct it promptly for efficiency and energy saving. 

These include conducting earthing calibration, power factors, loose wiring or 

connection. 

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for Financial Year (“FY”) 2021 

Continue to replace current 

lights in Glenmarie plant with 

LED 

lights. 

Targeted 

to 

complete all by 2021. 

At the end of 2021, we have completed the 

replacement of lights to LED lights in Glenmarie 

plant. 

 

 

 

Gourmessa 

 

Gourmessa has engaged in electricity conservation to reduce energy consumption. It 

has shutdown unnecessary usage of electrical appliance in the building in order to 

reduce electrical consumption. Management also provide a clear definition of energy  

efficiency to educate production employees not to operate heavy duty machines such 

as ovens together with cold rooms which consume high energy. This is in order to 

reduce energy consumption by controlling on the maximum electrical charges from 

Tenaga Nasional Berhad.  

 

In addition, Gourmessa had synchronized the operation of exhaust fan with oven 

smoke discharge where the exhaust fan will automatically start running when the 

sensor senses smoke released from the oven.  This will reduce the operation hours of 

the exhaust fan and energy consumed.

ENERGY CONSERVATION (CONTINUED) 

 

Gourmessa (Continued) 

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for FY2021 

Monitoring on the maximum 

electrical charges from time to 

time to ensure production follow 

the Standard Operating 

Procedures (“SOPs”) given and 

control on the unnecessary 

electrical appliance usage. 

Electrical SOPs are being followed and this has 

resulted in energy saving by 15.3% or 

RM172,925. 

 

 

 

Texas Chicken (Malaysia)  

 

Restaurants are energy-intensive and operate for long hours. Texas Chicken 

restaurants in Malaysia are equipped with LED lighting to reduce power consumption 

by approximately 50% compared with regular fluorescent lights. 

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for FY2021 

Continue to use LED lighting for 

the new outlets opened to reduce 

power consumption. 

 

The amount of cost saving of 80 stores is 

RM240,000 

as 

compared 

to 

saving 

of 

RM222,000 for 74 stores in FY2020. 

 

 

Motivage  

 

The objective of its energy conservation project is to optimize the energy consumption 

and promote a greener environment. We upgraded our mixing control system from 

mechanical magnetic electrical control to inverter control for 4 units mixing transfer 

pump. This reduced the pump speed during CIP (cleaning in progress). With the speed 

reduction, it reduced electricity consumption and extended the shelf life of the electrical 

motor. The project commenced in February 2022. 

 

 

(ii) 

WATER CONSERVATION 

 

Motivage 

 

Water conservation is important to protect our water resources.  We recycled the 

condensate water from evaporation process at sweetened condensed milk (“SCM”) 

plant and channelled it for boiler usage. The SCM evaporator process generates water 

which will be collected and stored by stainless tank with 1500 m3 capacity.  We will 

drain the condensate water from the tank and transfer it to boiler feed water tank. This 

helped to reduce water usage by the boiler and reduce water discharge to waste water 

treatment plant. The project commenced in January 2022.

(iii) 

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

 

We believe proper waste management is essential to develop a nationwide long-term 

strategy for environmental protection. We also believe it is our responsibility to 

contribute to this agenda and help promote Malaysia’s Green Technology Master Plan. 

This has been actively promoted and implemented by the Ministry of Energy, Science, 

Technology, Environment and Climate Change (“MESTECC”).  

 

We are determined to conduct our business in a responsible manner and aim to 

reduce the waste generated. We engage with responsible and ethical waste 

management contractors to ensure proper collection and disposal of the waste 

generated according to the Department of Energy and a recycle management 

contractor for all the recyclable items. 

 

 

Pok Brothers  

 

In an effort to become more sustainable, we are taking appropriate measures to make 

our premises more eco-friendly with the 3”R” principles.   

 

The success of 3R program could be used to convince stakeholders involved in waste 

management about the overall benefits of recycling and its influences on social and 

environment sustainability for promoting and strengthening recycling activities within 

the organisation.  

 

REDUCE the use of single-use Plastic Bags. 

 

Selangor Government’s initiatives to reduce the use of Single Use Plastic 

have created awareness among our customers. Customers are using 

reusable bag and carton boxes for their purchases. 

 

REUSE packaging materials and plastic pallets in our warehouse.  

By reusing, we can reduce solid waste disposal and the cost of 

purchasing packaging materials.  

 

 

 

 

RECYCLE wooden pallets, broken pallets and other packaging materials 

to minimize solid waste. 

 

 

 

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for FY2021 

Reduce solid waste collection 

by separation of recyclable 

packaging material 

Reduced solid waste collection by 106 trips (83 trips 

in FY2021 compared to 189 trips in FY2020) 

Generate income to company 

through recyclable materials   

Approximately RM12,224 has been collected from 

the recyclable materials

(iii)  WASTE MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) 

 

Pok Brothers (Continued) 

 

This year, we had generated a total of 24 tons of waste in the form of paper, cardboard, 

metal and plastic, an increase by 84% compared to FY2020 due to consolidation of 

recycled items from Glenmarie and Pulau Indah plants and scrap metal from damaged 

mobile racking, pipes and gutters. 28% of waste comprise of scrap metal whereas 

balance of 72% comprise of waste generated from carton boxes from incoming 

shipment, plastic and wooden pallets. Even though the consumption of paper in the 

office is not much, we strive to reduce our paper consumption by promoting digital 

reporting of documents and reports in the near future. 

 

With the reduction in solid waste, we have a saving in waste disposal expenses. We 

have recorded a saving of RM11,000 in waste disposal services in FY2021 compared 

to FY2020. 

 

Gourmessa 

Food Technologist Department helps to develop healthy, halal and safe food for 

human consumption in Gourmessa. It needs to ensure and control the cleanliness of 

operation area, machines, equipment and personal hygiene of operator including the 

visitor, contractor and service provider. Hygiene and cost savings can be carried out in 

tandem without neglecting any of them. 

 

Gourmessa continues the waste management process on the solid waste to turn trash 

into cash.   

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for FY2021 

Reduce cost and cut solid waste 

generation by substituting 

disposable isolation gown with 

reusable gown. 

Change of disposable isolation gown to reusable 

gown for visitors, contractors and service 

providers when entering production area since 

FY2020. No new purchases of reusable gown in 

2021 due to low number of visitors. 

 

The cost saving for one year is about 60.9%. 

 

Dry waste (e.g. plastic, 

cardboard, metal, wood and 

stainless steel) from facilities 

production are sorted and sold to 

recycling centre 

Total amount earned from October 2020 to 

September 2021 is RM 1,252.20 for chemical 

plastic drum. This is an on-going project. We are 

no longer recycling wood pallet as we are now 

using reusable plastic pallet. We are also no 

longer recycling cardboard/carton due to storage 

and hygiene issue as the waste carton is wet all 

the time with meat blood which will lead to 

hygiene and bacteria issue.  Therefore, we stop 

this project to ensure compliance with audit and 

product quality with best hygiene practice. There 

were no stainless steel item for recycling from 

our maintenance side for year 2021.

(iii)  WASTE MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) 

 

De-luxe Food Services 

 

Our Waste Management Initiatives: 

 

- 

Food waste recycling: food waste is recycled into animal feed instead of sending 

directly to the landfill. The objective is to reduce food wastage below limit line of 

3%. 

 

- 

Carton waste recycling: carton waste originated from finished goods packaging 

from various sources eg: damaged carton from production line or warehouse. The 

objective is to reduce carton waste recycling below limit line of 1.20%. 

 

- 

Plastic waste recycling: plastic waste originated from production line processes. 

We aim to reduce plastic waste recycling below limit line of 1.80%.  

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for FY2021 

To reduce food wastage 

below limit line of 3% 

Food waste increased by 0.11% due to increase in 

production level. 

 

Overall, the food wastage was still below the limit 

line of 3%. 

 

To reduce carton waste 

recycled below limit line of 

1.20% 

 

Carton waste recycled slightly lower by 0.66% 

compared to FY2020. This was due to MCO in 

FY2020 where production had to repack and relabel 

finished good into smaller portion for hotel and home 

assortment. 

 

Overall, the carton recycled still below the limit line 

of 1.20%. 

 

To reduce plastic waste 

recycled below limit line of 

1.80% 

 

Plastic waste recycled slightly higher by 0.008% 

compared to FY2020 due to increase in production 

volume. 

 

Overall, the plastic recycle still below the limit line of 

1.80%. 

 

 

 

Texas Chicken (Malaysia) 

 

Our Waste Management Initiatives: 

 

- 

Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) - certified paper packaging: Our boxes and 

paper cups are made from FSC. This means that the paper has been sourced in 

an environmentally-friendly, socially responsible and economically viable manner. 

FSC-certified products go through a “chain of custody” from the forest to the 

manufacturer to the merchant and finally to the printer.  

 

It also requires a “management plan” that outlines the scale and intensity of 

logging and renewal operations, in addition to long-term objectives for maintaining 

the health of the forest.

(iii)  WASTE MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) 

 

Texas Chicken (Malaysia) (Continued) 

 

 

- 

During the financial year, we have purchased 22 million (FY2020: 32.2 million 

pieces) pieces of FSC - certified packaging for our restaurants nationwide.  The 

reduction is mainly due to reduction in dine-in in our restaurants during Covid-19 

pandemic.  

 

- 

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (“RSPO”) - certified palm oil: The palm oil that 

we use for frying at restaurants is RSPO – certified. This means that the palm oil 

producer complies with good agricultural, social and environmental practice, as 

dictated by the RSPO. During the financial year, our restaurants nationwide used 

803,000 kg (FY2020: 798,000 kg) of RSPO certified palm oil. 

 

- 

Biodegradable plastic bags: We give out biodegradable plastic bags instead of 

regular plastic bags at our restaurants in the Federal Territories. Biodegradable 

plastics are proven to be more environmentally-friendly, as they are able to 

breakdown more quickly when exposed to the elements. During the financial year, 

we have given out 1.78 million (FY2020: 1.7 million pieces) pieces of 

biodegradable plastic bags at our restaurants in Federal Territories. The 

management aims to extend the usage of biodegradable plastic bags to our stores 

in other states in the year 2022.  

 

- 

Straws Upon Request Campaign – rolled out the “straws upon request” campaign 

at all the restaurants in Klang Valley effective January 2019 in support of the 

government’s initiative in reducing plastic waste. During the financial year, our 

restaurants have reduced the usage of plastic straws by 25% compared to the 

usage in FY2020. 

 

- 

Document Management System (DMS) is a digitalization initiative that has been 

adopted in Texas Chicken (Malaysia). It is a new methodology of storing 

documents digitally which helps to reduce physical storage space, file cabinets, 

boxes and storage bins. This digitalization helped to increase security and 

productivity. Faster and more efficient document retrieval through the use of DMS 

eliminated the need of physical document transfers or approval.   

 

- 

E-Leave and E-Claim have been deployed for Texas Chicken (Malaysia)  and this 

has reduced the need of physical forms to be used. All forms are digitally 

submitted through Orisoft system.  This helped to increase the efficiency of the 

approval process and also reduced the overall cost of physical forms and logistics 

to transfer the forms.  

 

- 

E-Vouchers provides the same benefits as physical vouchers. It provides the 

convenience to distribute the vouchers as it does not have delivery cost and the 

need of physical space to store the vouchers. E-Vouchers are easily activated and 

redeemed. As the battle against Covid-19, social distancing is still being practiced. 

E-Vouchers are safer because it can be redeemed and distributed through 

contactless means.  

 

- 

The last three initiatives listed above had reduced the consumption of paper, 

therefore helping to preserve our forests.

solidify our efforts in encouraging tumbler use over takeaway cups, further reducing 

usage of paper and plastic cups. In FY2021, there were more than 13,000 units 

redemption for this discount showing that we are in line with the initial target.  

- 

In FY2020, SF Coffee app was launched with the functions of e-wallet and loyalty 

program. This is to reduce printing of San Francisco Coffee Best Customer Card 

(BCC), a physical loyalty stamp card. By introducing the app, we will be phasing out 

the use of 60,000 pcs of paper-based BCC.  This move is continued in FY2021. 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for FY2021  

Zero use of paper-based 

loyalty card
