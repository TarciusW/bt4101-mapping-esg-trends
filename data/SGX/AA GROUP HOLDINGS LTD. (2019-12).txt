MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

The Group conducted our first materiality assessment in 2017 to identify and prioritise relevant 

sustainability topics. Facilitated by an independent sustainability consultant, this assessment involves 

the management, key representatives from the Company’s various business units as well as internal 

and external stakeholders. Material topics have been identified based on both risks and opportunities 

arising from our business activities, the environmental, social and governance impacts that are most 

significant to our stakeholders, as well as with reference to our current risk management framework.  

 

This year, we reviewed and revalidated the existing material ESG topics, and determined that they 

remain relevant in 2019.  

The matrix below depicts the material topics that are of importance to our stakeholders in 2019: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



Step 1:



Identification

Issues were identified by

stakeholders

and

a

discussion was held to

obtain

views

on

these

issues. After consolidating

feedbacks, a list of key

issues were crafted.



Step 2:





Prioritisation

Key issues were reviewed

by

key

representatives

and management and this

allowed us to prioritise

issues

based

on

the

impact to our business.

The level of priority was

ranked from low to high.



Step 3:





Validation

A materiality matrix was

plotted, which was then

revalidated

by

the

management

and

the

Board.

The materiality assessment took into account the GRI guidelines, and the material topics that are 

significant to the Group's operations in Singapore and Malaysia are presented below. We have 

gathered feedbacks from various stakeholders across our entire value chain who are influenced by, 

and can significantly influence, the Group’s businesses and operations. By identifying material topics 

that have both positive and negative impact on stakeholders, we ensure that both risks and 

opportunities are taken into account in our strategic and business planning. 

Reporting Framework and List of Material Topics 

For each material topic, we report on its relevance to our business and stakeholders. 

 

The following sections in this Report evaluate these material topics taking into consideration the 

changing business landscape and our business direction. We will strengthen our existing sustainability 

framework, set targets for improvement and aim to reach these targets in the subsequent years. 

We look forward to further engage with our stakeholders. The perspectives of our stakeholders will 

help us evaluate and fine-tune our approach to better manage our business in a sustainable way.

GOVERNANCE  

We believe that having the right business values – good corporate governance and ethical conduct is 

crucial to the Group's growth and provides a robust foundation to the Group. The Group is committed 

to conduct our business in an ethical and responsible manner, and we do not tolerate any corruption 

or bribery within any of our businesses. 

 

Corporate Governance 

The Group understands the importance of good corporate governance, accountability and 

transparency and is committed to uphold high standards of governance and regulatory compliance. In 

FY2019, the Group ensured compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 as required 

under the Catalist Rules. The Group notes that the revised Code of Corporate Governance issued on 6 

August 2018 (the "Revised Code") is effective for the financial year commencing 1 January 2019, and 

will endeavour to comply with the Revised Code in FY2019. 

 

Please refer to pages 12 to 39 of our Annual Report 2019 for further details of our Corporate 

Governance practices and compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance 2018.  

 

The Group has a dynamic team in place to implement and execute sustainable strategies across the 

organisation. The Sustainability Committee ensures all strategies, policies and practices have been 

incorporated to strengthen its sustainability performance and reports to the Board on all sustainability 

matters.  

 

The Board oversees the Sustainability Committee and ensures that all material factors identified are 

well-managed and monitored to ensure transparency and accountability towards the Group.

Compliance 

The Group conducts its businesses in an honest and ethical manner and is committed to act 

professionally and fairly in all business dealings. 

 

The Board meets on a regular basis to ensure that the Group meets all regulatory requirements and 

ensures compliance with all relevant laws and regulations in countries we operate in. Similarly, the 

Board will also manage the Sustainability Committee to ensure that the Group is in compliance with 

the relevant rules and regulations and adheres to the policies and procedures that have been set out 

by the management and the Board. 

We have been actively engaging our continuing sponsor and we remain compliant with all reporting 

requirements under the Catalist Rules as well as other applicable rules and regulations in Singapore. 

There were no non-compliance cases recorded during the reporting year of 2019. Since there was no 

record of non-compliance, the Board believes that the Group's compliance controls remain appropriate 

and we strive to work closely with our continuing sponsor to maintain zero incident of non-compliance 

record in the subsequent years. 

 

Whistleblowing 

The Group has had a robust whistle-blowing policy in place since 2008 and it has been updated from 

time to time in order to stay relevant, with the latest review in FY2019. The updated policies and 

procedures for raising any concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or 

management were communicated to all employees of the Group via email on 1 January 2019. This will 

also be communicated to all new employees of the Group during the orientation for new employees. 

 

The policy applies to all employees within the Group and any third parties dealing with the Group, and 

provides a mechanism for employees and external parties to report concerns over alleged wrongful 

acts. Employees or external parties with complaints, concerns or issues relating to potential corrupt 

activities, are able to raise their concerns, in confidence, to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Ms. 

Amelia Vincent, and Independent Director, Mr. Andrew Bek. This is also addressed on page 33 of our 

Annual Report 2019.  

 

There have been no reported incidents of corruption in the Group during the period and we will 

continue to monitor and prevent its occurrence. We will also continue to ensure that all employees are 

fully aware of our policies and sign our anti-corruption declaration form.

SOCIAL 

Employment Practices 

We practice fair employment and provide equal opportunities to all employees, regardless of their 

race, religion, age, gender or background. The Group’s recruitment of employees and their subsequent 

annual appraisal are based on merit, work attitude, cooperation with other staff and their efficiency 

and effectiveness of work. We believe that promoting a fair workplace environment will build the 

employees’ respect and loyalty towards the Company.  

 

We are fully compliant with the Singapore Government’s Employment Practices listed under the 

Ministry of Manpower to ensure that we remain competitive against similar industry players. 

Furthermore, the Group does not discriminate according to race, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, facial 

attractiveness, physical impairments, sexual preference, political viewpoints or nationality. 

 

The Human Resource Policies and Procedures (“HRPP”) formulated by the Human Resource team have 

been updated from time to time and applied across all business units to ensure consistency of internal 

practices among all business units. The HRPP documents the employee's benefits and governs our non-

discriminatory hiring policies and merit-based promotion policies. Fair and non-discriminatory 

employment policies are put in place to attract and retain talent. 

 

➢ Valuing our employees 

The Group prioritises job satisfaction and welfare as one of its top priorities. We recognise long-serving 

employees with cash awards and the contributions made by our employees with various incentives to 

show our appreciation. Our employees are entitled to a range of benefits including healthcare, 

insurance and parental leave. Further, the Group offers competitive pay packages that are 

benchmarked to the market and rewards each employee based on their competency and performance. 

Our employees are motivated and satisfied and this results in high employee retention rates, as per 

the chart below:  

 


 

 

 

AA GROUP HOLDINGS LTD. 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

As part of our continued efforts toward providing transparent and merit-based compensation package, 

the remuneration breakdown of our Directors and our key management personnel can be found on 

page 28 of our Annual Report 2019.  

 

The Company and its subsidiaries will continue to abide to the local labour laws in Singapore to 

promote fair employment practices. In FY2019, the Group has adhered to all relevant labour laws and 

there were no records of complaints from staff or of non-compliance from the authorities as targeted 

in the previous sustainability report (FY2018: Nil). We target to maintain the current status of 

adherence to all relevant labour laws and zero records of complaints from staff or of non-compliance 

from the authorities, in FY2020.  

 

Training and development 

We ensure that our employees have access to a fair, collaborative and engaging workplace which 

allows them to provide their perspectives and concerns on the issues. In addition to workplace safety 

training, more specialised training is also held to ensure that they keep pace with the growth and 

development of the Group.  

 

Some of the courses attended by the employees are workplace safety and health, plumbing and 

pipefitting tradesman continual education training, construction safety orientation, ISO 9001:2017 

Awareness and Quality Audit, WSQ – operate forklift/lorry crane/excavator, supervisor safe lifting 

operations, perform rigger &amp; signalman tasks, first aid, traffic control course and basic concept in 

construction. 

 

In FY2019, employees attended courses and trainings amounting to 488.7 training hours as compared 

to 859.5 training hours in FY2018. The trainings attended by employees in FY2019 cover the necessary

technical and soft skill sets, as well as on-the-job trainings. The substantial decrease of training hours 

in FY2019 is due to the (i) absence of basic trainings (i.e. concept in construction) which were carried 

out in FY2018, and (ii) decrease of new hires in FY2019 (FY2019: 115 employees; FY2018: 126 

employees). 

 

 

In FY2020, we will continue to deploy our resources and offer training courses to our employees to 

enhance their professional competence. 

 

Workforce Diversity  

The Group believes in the importance of diversity that it drives innovation and increases competitive 

advantage in our organization. Our employees come from all walks of life.  

 

In FY2019, our workforce consisted of 115 employees, including 107 male employees and 8 female 

employees, as shown in the charts below. Our workforce has a higher number of male employees 

due to the nature of our business operations.

As at the date of this Report, we have 6 Directors on the Board; 5 male Directors and 1 female Director 

and they are individuals who have diverse qualifications and work experience. For more details on the 

qualification and work experience of each Director, please refer to Board of Directors on page 8 and 9 

of our Annual Report 2019.  

 

In the FY2019, there were a total of 4 new male hires and 20 male job leavers across all business units, 

as shown in the chart below. Our turnover rate for the year averages at 23.08%, largely due to the high 

turnover of foreign workers in PHH as their work permits expire. To address this issue, employees are 

encouraged to provide feedback to their reporting manager. There are also cohesive activities (such as 

team lunches, special occasion celebrations) in place for team bonding.

and all employees share responsibilities in monitoring the Group’s environmental performances. In 

FY2019, there were zero incidents of non-compliance with relevant material environmental laws and 

regulations. We aim to maintain this trend in FY2020.

➢ Energy and water efficiency 

As part of our continuing initiative, we do have stringent controls such as prompt reporting of faulty 

equipment that may result in excess waste, water or electricity consumption. Employees and relevant 

stakeholders are also reminded of the importance to save water in their daily activities and to reduce 

water usage.   

 

We monitor energy usage at the construction sites for all our projects to ensure that they are 

maintained at consistent levels, and any abnormality is immediately investigated and rectified. In 

addition to reducing energy consumption in relation to construction activities, we also implement 

various measures to minimize energy consumption in our head office building. Employees and relevant 

stakeholders are reminded regularly to switch off all lights, air conditioners and equipment when they 

leave the office or when equipment is not in use. Air conditioners within the head office buildings are 

serviced regularly, and rundown Fan Coil Units (FCUs) are replaced to maintain high efficiency.  

 

As part of our initiatives, energy saving LED lights were installed around our premises. Subsequently, 

we are looking to progressively install energy saving LED lights for all office units on our premises. We 

may also consider energy efficient equipment when purchasing new office equipment in the future.

Effluents and Waste 

We continuously strive to reduce waste from operations by encouraging employees and relevant 

stakeholders to re-use and recycle usable material. In addition, we have been enforcing stringent 

controls on the management of waste generated from our operations. These controls include proper 

segregation and disposal of waste. Our waste includes general waste, wood waste and food waste. 

There is no hazardous waste produced. Recycling bins and multiple waste segregation bins are 

available within our premises and are placed at common areas for employees and relevant 

stakeholders to segregate waste.  

We also engage environmentally responsible service provider to manage the disposal of our waste. All 

waste generated are collected from the site by a licensed waste collector. General and food waste are 

sent to the National Environment Agency (NEA) for waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration and wood 

waste are sent to our service provider's site for recycling purposes. The Group endeavours to manage 

waste sustainably by utilising technologies in the future. 

In FY2019, there were no incidence of non-compliance with laws and regulations resulting in significant 

fines. We target to maintain the same performance in FY2020. 

 

Supply Chain 

We recognise the importance of sustainable value generation and take into consideration the following 

factors - economic value of products, business ethics and reputation as a few of the criterion when 

assessing and selecting new potential suppliers. We believe that a sustainable supply chain can help us 

conserve resources, optimise processes and increase productivity. 

 

The head of each business unit conducts stringent checks on our current suppliers to ensure they are 

in compliance with local rules and regulations. Similarly, the checks include ethical practices of these 

suppliers while sourcing for raw materials and the degree of impact these processes contribute to the 

environment.  

 

In FY2019, we did not have any reported incident of non-compliance regarding product health and 

safety, environmental and social performance. In FY2020, we aim to maintain the same performance.

ensure all our products receive proper certification of compliance. We are committed to ensuring that 

our products are manufactured according to industry standards. WPC’s source of materials for the 

supply and manufacturing of ready-mix concrete, precast component and related products are from 

Building and Construction Authority (BCA) registered suppliers in Singapore.  

 

In FY2019, we did not receive any formal complaints about our product or service quality, and we 

endeavour to maintain this clean record in FY2020.
