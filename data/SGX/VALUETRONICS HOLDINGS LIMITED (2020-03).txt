Our Group has expanded our manufacturing footprint 

into Vietnam in 2019, and this report has included 

relevant information from our Vietnam operations.

been verified by an independent third-party and 

we have relied on internal data monitoring and 

verification to ensure its accuracy.

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders with 

regards to our sustainability efforts as this enables 

us to improve our policies, systems and results. 

Please send your comments and suggestions to 

contact@valuetronics.com.hk.

The key material EESG factors for the Group have 

been identified and reviewed by the top management 

of the Group, and the board of directors of the 

Company (the “Board”) oversees the management 

and monitoring of these factors and takes them into 

consideration when determining the Group’s strategic 

direction and policies. Sustainability is a part of the 

Group’s wider strategy to create long-term value for 

all its stakeholders.

As our Group embarks on our new growth dimension 

with our Vietnam expansion, sustainability will 

always be a core element for the Group. FY2020 

marks the third year in which the Group highlights 

its sustainability efforts through the publication of 

its sustainability report. We are also honoured and 

humbled by the recognition of our sustainability 

efforts with the receipt of the Sustainability Award,

Choice Award in September 2019. Our Group will 

continue to value and uphold our efforts to achieve 

business sustainability for the long term.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 
















MATERIAL ASPECTS ASSESSMENT

Our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant aspects. Relevant aspects are then prioritised as material 

factors, which are then validated. The end result of this process is a list of material factors disclosed in this sustainability report 

of which their inter-relationships are shown below:

• Economic performance

• Anti-corruption

• Environmental compliance

• Supplier environmental 

assessment

A materiality review is conducted every year, incorporating inputs from our various stakeholder engagements. The Group has 

conducted a materiality assessment during the year with the help of an external consultant.

In order to determine if an aspect is material, we assessed its potential impact on the economy, environment and society, as well 

as its influence on stakeholders. Aspects were identified and prioritised through internal workshops, peer reviews and social 

impact assessments at site level. Applying the guidance from GRI, we have identified the following material aspects:

• Sustainability governance

• Enterprise risk management

• Business Ethics

VALUETRONICS HOLDINGS LIMITED   2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT






With COVID-19 pandemic and the Sino-US trade tensions, the outlook for FY2021 is highly uncertain. This 

is the toughest business environment we have faced in our operating history and while we try to mitigate 

its impact, our FY2021 financial results are expected to be significantly lower compared with FY2020. 

Nevertheless, I have confidence in my team and our operating discipline. Our strong balance sheet has 

allowed us to build up our Vietnam capacity quickly and this will help us to cater to our customers’ 

changing supply chain needs.

Mr Ricky Tse Chong Hing

Chairman and Managing Director

Considering its FY2020 results performance, the extremely difficult business environment, and the capital expenditure needs of 

the Company given its Vietnam expansion, the Board proposed a Final Dividend of 14 HK cents per share for FY2020, which are 

subject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual General Meeting to be convened. The Company has also paid an Interim Dividend 

of 6 HK cents per share in December 2019 and in aggregate, the Interim and Final dividends amount to 20 HK cents per share 

(FY2019: 25 HK cents per share).

The aggregate dividend amount is approximately 48.5% of the net profit attributable to shareholders for FY2020 and is in line 

with the Company’s formal dividend policy of paying out between 30% to 50% of net profit as normal dividends to shareholders. 

The Company will continue to adhere to this formal dividend policy.

The Group’s FY2020 revenue decreased by 16.8% to HK$2,354.4 million from HK$2,828.8 million in the financial year ended 

31 March 2019 (“FY2019“). Gross profit correspondingly decreased by 15.7% to HK$362.8 million in FY2020 from HK$430.3 

million in FY2019, with gross profit margin up 0.2 percentage point to 15.4% for FY2020 due to a change in sales mix for the 

year under review.

As at 31 March 2020, the Group’s financial position remains stable and resilient with a net asset value per share (excluding treasury 

shares) of HK$2.8 (31 March 2019: HK$2.7). The Group has net current assets of HK$902.4 million (31 March 2019: HK$850.5 

million), total assets of HK$2,013.5 million (31 March 2019: HK$2,013.4 million) and a shareholders’ fund of HK$1,231.6 million 

(31 March 2019: HK$1,159.3 million).

ANTI-CORRUPTION

Here at Valuetronics, we do not tolerate corruption in any form. This has been made clear to our employees, suppliers and business 

partners. Valuetronics ensures that all staff (other than production line workers) sign an anti-corruption declaration when they 

join the Company. Dedicated whistleblowing hotlines using both email and electronic platforms are set up so that if anyone who 

wants to report any business ethics issue can do so confidentially, and any report of corruption is immediately escalated to the 

attention of senior management.

There have been no reported incidents of corruption in the Group during the period and we will continue to monitor and 

prevent its occurrence as targeted. We will also continue to ensure that all employees are fully aware of our policy and sign our 

anti-corruption declaration.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Valuetronics has achieved the ISO14000 accreditation and standards for environmental management since 2008 for our China 

operation. ISO14000 is based on a plan-do-check-act (“PDCA”) methodology which provides a systematic framework for the 

integration of environmental management practices by supporting environmental protection, preventing pollution, minimising 

waste, reducing energy and material use. Recyclable waste is stored, collected and processed by qualified third party recycling 

firms.

For our leased manufacturing facility in Vietnam, we have passed the environmental impact compliance inspection conducted 

by the Vietnam local authority and obtained approval to start the trial production in May 2020. To extend our company 

philosophy on environmental protection and environmental regulatory compliance to Vietnam, we will be implementing the 

ISO14000 Environmental Management System in our Vietnam leased standard factory, with the target to receive external 

accreditation by calendar year 2021.

We are committed to continue the PDCA approach to improve our environment management, targeting environmental 

protection, environmental regulatory compliance and no major non-conformities in any kind of environmental compliance 

audits in both of our China and Vietnam operations.

SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

To raise environmental awareness among our suppliers, Valuetronics encourages suppliers to be accredited with the ISO14000 

standard. With regard to raw materials that might contain environmentally hazardous substances, the Group has been working 

closely with suppliers to push forward more environmental protection awareness with suppliers required to make annual 

declaration on their ISO14000 compliance. We have extended our annual assessment outside our Printed Circuit Board (“PCB”) 

suppliers to include our top 100 suppliers in terms of purchasing amount, and they are required to make on annual environmental 

compliance declaration as well. Majority of the assessed suppliers declared that they have accredited with ISO14000 standard or 

have complied with local government laws and regulations on environmental issues.

In FY2020, we have achieved our target as the majority of the assessed suppliers declared that they have accredited with 

ISO14000 standard or have complied with local government laws and regulations on environmental issues. Out of these 

suppliers assessed, all our PCB suppliers have declared that they have accredited with ISO14000 standard or have complied with 

local government laws and regulations on environmental issues.

We will continue to raise environmental awareness among our suppliers. Our top 100 suppliers and PCB suppliers will be 

assessed and screened annually, with a focus on their compliance on environmental issues.

DIVERSITY

Valuetronics maintains a policy of providing equal opportunities to all its employees. The Group’s recruitment of employees 

and their subsequent annual appraisal are based on merit, work attitude, cooperation with other staff, and their efficiency and 

effectiveness of work.

Furthermore, the Group does not discriminate according to race, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, facial attractiveness, physical 

impairments, sexual preference, political viewpoints or nationality.

Similar to the previous year, we have maintained an almost equal ratio of male to female employees. Our objective is to have 

no incidents of discrimination and there has been no reported discrimination issue during the period.

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND CHILD LABOUR

The Group considers its employees the most valuable asset and offers them fair and competitive remuneration packages. 

Discretionary incentives are granted to eligible employees based on the performance of the Group as well as the individual 

employee. We continue to provide employment opportunities to local students by closely cooperating with local colleges and 

universities and to provide nurturing programmes for fresh graduates. Valuetronics will continue to provide a fair employment 

environment.

The Group has a strict no child labour policy and expects the same from all of our suppliers. Declaration is made on our new 

supplier application form and as a part of the annual supplier assessment. All our top 100 suppliers comply with our no child 

labour policy.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”) of our workforce has always been one of our priorities. Valuetronics is pleased 

to confirm that there has been no fatal industrial accident reported in FY2020. Our Environment, Health and Safety (“EHS”) 

department is independent from operational departments and monitors the following measures to provide a safe working 

environment for all employees:

• Identifying potential risks through routine campus patrols and drawing up and implementing preventive actions;

• Analysing each incident for its root causes and communicating with all the relevant department managers for corrective 

actions and implementing preventive measures;

• Conducting regular training for employees on safety practices;

• Conducting regular checks for emission compliance;

• Reinforcing the occupational health and safety awareness by providing trainings, putting up banners and posters in public 

areas;

• Closely following and ensuring compliance with the government’s rules and regulations on EHS;

• Ensuring fire safety management protocols are in place; performing routine check on fire safety; and

• Carrying out regular fire drills and training.





11

VALUETRONICS HOLDINGS LIMITED   2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT








OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (continued)

In addition, the EHS department chairs regular health and safety meetings with all operational department managers to 

discuss occupational health and safety issues, focusing on the risks identified above. Immediate corrective actions are carried 

out for each EHS incident, which is followed by a formal review for further prevention. The EHS department also verifies the 

implementation and effectiveness of any corrective actions.

No fatal industrial accident was reported during the year as targeted, and we will continue to ensure that there is no case of 

fatal industrial accident in the factory.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION

Valuetronics provides its employees with an orientation program and regular training.

The orientation program is organised for new employees to introduce the Company and its operations as well as its codes of 

conduct, applicable internal and external rules and regulations, and workplace safety practices.

For workers, regular training is provided for job-related skills and updates on workplace safety. For staff, in addition to workplace 

safety training, more specialised training is also held to ensure that they keep pace with the growth and development of the 

Group. Staff training records are reviewed and specific training needs are identified for the individual’s career advancement. Our 

in-house training records showed that each staff averaged 18 hours during FY2020. We will continue to deploy our resources 

and offer training courses to our employees to enhance their professional competence.









COVID-19 Safety Measures

Valuetronics initiated its corporate prevention and containment contingency plan by closely tracking the health status 

and travel history of its employees. Staff returning from provinces outside Guangdong had to go through a 14-day 

mandatory isolation period before resuming work at the factory sites. Other measures were implemented as the 

Group steadily moved towards a return to normal production. These measures included the attendance taking and 

temperature monitoring of staff using facial recognition technology, designated entrances and exits to keep track of 

human traffic, greater telecommunication use instead of unnecessary human contact, and increased frequency of 

personal sanitation and the disinfection of facilities.

Valuetronics strongly believes in being a socially responsible corporate citizen. Continuing last year’s successful corporate 

responsibility efforts, Valuetronics continued to organise activities to give back to the community, aims to at least one activity 

per quarter and encourage employees to join local community activities.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

At Valuetronics, we believe that strong corporate governance is key to a sustainable business. That is why since our listing on 

the SGX Mainboard in 2007 and all through to FY2020, we have continued to comply with the Singapore Code of Corporate 

Governance. Please refer to pages 13 to 34 of our Annual Report, for details of our compliance to the Singapore Code of 

Corporate Governance.

We will continue to ensure compliance with the SGX requirements.

As an integrated EMS provider, it is a continual challenge to successfully manage our environmental and social issues. 

Nevertheless, Valuetronics has incorporated these issues into our business model and implemented the applicable sustainable 

and responsible practices to mitigate these issues throughout the Company. Our products also meet the stringent safety and 

environmental requirements demanded by our customers.

Valuetronics pays strict attention to the implementation of good labour practices in all our operations. The Group also provides 

various training opportunities for continued employee development and this is reflected in the quality and delivery of our 

products and services. We value our relationships with our clients and the wider community in which we operate in, and these 

strong relationships have helped us through the challenging times in the past. Valuetronics strongly believes that in the long 

run, these efforts will have a positive impact on our economic performance.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (“ERM”)

ERM is an integral part of good corporate governance as well as resources management. Valuetronics has a thorough and 

comprehensive ERM framework to identify and manage its risks and exposures in an integrated, systematic and consistent 

manner. For detailed disclosure on ERM, please refer to pages 25-26 of our Annual Report.

We will perform risk assessments annually and disclose in accordance with SGX requirements.

BUSINESS ETHICS

When it comes to hiring, Valuetronics takes any possibility of conflict of interest into serious consideration. Our code of conduct 

clearly spells out our expectations from our staff and the subsequent consequences if any of the rules are violated or when 

standards not met. In addition, we also have fair grievance procedures.

The Group also takes measures to guard against cybersecurity risks in order to protect confidential information for both 

our internal and external stakeholders. This also applies to our employment process where the privacy of all applicants is 

safeguarded and access to personal data is restricted to authorised persons on a strict need-to-know basis.

All of our staff are reminded of the importance of upholding the highest standards when it comes to business ethics. We have 

incorporated business ethics and codes of conduct into our new joiner orientation program, so that all of our employees are 

fully aware that our compliance with rules and regulations is a key part of running a responsible business.

Valuetronics has complied, in all material aspects, with applicable environmental rules and regulations, anti-competitive behaviour 

laws, and requirements on health and safety. For FY2020, we have continued to comply with applicable environmental rules 

and regulations, anti-competitive behavior laws, and requirements on health and safety. There were no significant fines or  

non-monetary sanctions for any non-compliance with the aforementioned laws, regulations and requirements. There have 

also been no reported incidents of corruption during the reporting period. It is Valuetronics’ goal to maintain zero incidents of 

corruption, and we regularly review our policies on whistleblowing and anti-corruption so as to ensure that they are effective.
