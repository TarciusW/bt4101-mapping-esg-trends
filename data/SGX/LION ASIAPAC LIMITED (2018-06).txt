Board Statement 

 

Sustainability is becoming a key component for companies to promote value creation, and 

demand for increased transparency on listed companies’ environmental, social and governance 

(‘ESG”) practices has been growing among investors.  

 

At Lion Asiapac Limited (“LAP”), with support from the Board, management establishes a 

framework for its sustainability efforts before identifying, managing and addressing ESG factors 

that are material to its businesses.  

 

The Board considers sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, determines the 

material ESG factors and oversees the management and monitors the material ESG factors. 

 

Owing to its extensive global acceptance, we have adopted the globally recognised Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, which allows for comparability of 

our performance.  

 

This report, produced in accordance with the GRI Reporting Guidelines, includes the primary 

components as set out by the SGX’s requirements for sustainability reporting.  It summarises our 

effort towards sustainability with addresses made to LAP’s material ESG matters for the year 

ended 30 June 2018 (“FY 2018”).   

 

The Company will continue to make improvements to its sustainability efforts and work with its 

stakeholders towards promoting sustainability in its businesses. 

 

Statement from the Executive Director 

Welcome to LAP’s second sustainability report, which covers the financial year 2018. 

 

Our inaugural report in 2017, sets out our focus, ambition and commitment, which are 

benchmarked against those of leading peers in our industry. 

 

LAP has a corporate duty of care and responsibility towards sustainability in the countries where 

we operate.  Sustainability is a journey, and we are continuously working to improve our 

performances in all areas. 

 

I am very happy with the progress that has been made here at LAP.  I believe that we have come 

a long way in building valuable partnerships with civil society, continuing our strong engagement 

with communities and strengthening our relations with local government and business partners.  

 

The efforts of our team have been critical in achieving these successes, and I would like to thank 

each and every team member for their hard work. We look forward to continuing our journey of 

improvements and receiving feedbacks from all stakeholders.

General  

 

1.1 

Sustainability Committee 

 

In achieving its sustainability goals, LAP’s Sustainability Committee, supported by the 

operations working groups, identifies material issues before reviewing sustainability 

efforts. The Executive Director chairs the Committee, which meets annually to plan 

and review the progress of our sustainability efforts.  

 

Where necessary, frequency of meetings and discussions are increased. 

 

1.2 

Approach to Sustainability 

 

Good corporate governance, environmental sustainability and social growth are 

integral to the Group’s business strategy. 

 

Sustainability and social responsibility principles form the foundation of LAP’s 

corporate values, with regard to ethical actions and professional behaviour for 

management and employees. 

 

In addition to corporate governance activities, the Group’s risk management also 

anticipates commercial opportunities and mitigates risks to preserve value over the 

long term. Strategic, operational and commercial risks are evaluated through a 

precautionary approach. 

 

1.3 

Material Assessment 

 

Our assessment is guided by the GRI reporting framework, and reflects the Group’s 

material ESG factors.  At LAP, assessing materiality of ESG factors on our business 

operations is a continuous process.  

 

Last year, our Sustainability Committee has ascertained material ESG factors based 

on a review of our business, strategy, business model and key stakeholders, and the 

following material ESG factors were considered most relevant to LAP.

Stakeholders 

 

This is our second Sustainability Report. We expect to publish Sustainability Reports 

every year in accordance with the SGX requirements and GRI Standards. We have 

not engaged third party assurance. 

 

Report content has been determined based on ongoing stakeholder dialogue and a 

review of issues that are critical to LAP. 

 

Based on our analyses and discussions with operational management team, we have 

reviewed our materiality matrix to reflect the changes in stakeholder expectations over 

the last year.

Our Operations 

 

Established in 2004, Compact Energy Sdn Bhd (“CESB”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary 

of LAP, based in Banting Selangor, Malaysia. 

 

With 2 units of 600 metric tons per day (MTPD) twin-shaft circular Maerz limekiln, 

CESB has an annual production capacity of 420,000 MT quicklime and 1 unit of 200 

MTPD hydrated lime plant with an annual output capacity of 72,000 MT. 

 

Our raw materials are delivered to our plant by the limestone supplier.  

 

Most of our products are sold for: 

 

(a) 

Steel making: during steel manufacturing quicklime assists in the removal of 

phosphorus, silica and sulphur as calcium phosphates, silicates and sulphides 

in the slag that is tapped off from the molten steel; 

 

(b) 

Soil stabilization: the function of lime is to react with the clay fraction in the soil 

to reduce the susceptibility of the compacted soil to the weakening effect of 

increasing moisture content;  

 

(c) 

Sugar: lime and carbon dioxide added simultaneously to form precipitate of 

calcium carbonate which entraps colloidal impurities and the carbonated liquor 

is then filtered to remove the precipitate;  

 

(d) 

Portable water treatment: in water softening the function of hydrated lime is to 

remove water hardness. It is possible to purify the water against bacteria. 

Coagulating suspended solid to remove turbidity from the ‘raw water’. It serves 

to maintain the proper pH; and 

 

(e) 

Air pollution abatement: the most important role in air pollution abatement is the 

removal of SO2 gas generated by the industrial and incineration plants.

2.0 

Management Approach 

 

2.1 

Sustainability Initiatives 

 

Partnerships and good community relations are critical for our operations.  

 

Following collaboration with all relevant stakeholders, a plan has been formulated to 

ensure that their representations are appropriately identified and that adequate 

information, including both benefits and negative impacts, are conveyed to the 

affected.  

 

Our plan takes into regards for - respect for human rights in the workplace, ban on 

forced and child labour, elimination of discrimination, provision of fair wages and 

working hours, and respect for freedom of association, the provision of a healthy and 

safe working environment, ethical conduct, including efforts to eliminate corruption. 

 


9 

 

We strongly believe in responsible sourcing, where through collaboration with 

suppliers, we ensure that all limestones originates from legal and responsible sources. 

 

2.2 

Managing Sustainability 

 

In 2017, LAP prepared its first sustainability report with the intention to enhance the 

transparency of the operations and thereby increasing stakeholders’ value. The Board 

also sets up its own sustainability team which comprises key management personnel. 

While the Board is responsible for formulating corporate sustainability strategies, the 

sustainability team focuses on implementing sustainability strategies, identifying and 

addressing emerging sustainability issues 

 

Materiality Topics:  

The methodology of our materiality assessment is in accordance with the GRI 

standards.  The materiality as defined by GRI standards refers to those issues or 

indicators which reflect the organisation’s significant economic, environmental, social 

and governance impacts. The resulting material factors are plotted in the following 

diagram. 

 

 

 

The material factors allocated within the group are illustrated in the following table:

Economics 

 

2.31  Markets 

 

The market has been facing tremendous pressure from products dumping and 

has been volatile in the past years. Strengthening existing business ties with 

customers, developing broader customer base, building customer trust are seen 

as crucial factors for business sustainability. The company strives to deliver high 

quality products in order to enhance the brand loyalty.  

 

The company keeps a close scrutiny on the market through close collaboration 

with customers and other business partners. Competition is one of the main 

challenges, the company emphasises on high quality product and better 

customer services to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. 

 

2.32  Customers 

 

Our customers are placed as the top priority in our company.  we collaborate 

with our customers through regular meetings to better understand their needs.  

 

In order to maintain a good customer relationship, the company not only strives 

to improve product quality, but also commit to the shortest delivery time, the 

provision of on demand solutions, et cetera.  

 

2.33  Products 

 

Our products could be used in numerous industries including steel 

manufacturing, water treatment, soil stabilization, sugar production et cetera.  

Being a quality conscious producer, we place extra emphasis on the quality of 

our products that we offered to our customers. 

 

To ensure only high quality products leave our plant, our quality control teams 

conduct stringently inspections before deliveries are made to our customers. 

Our customer service team proactively communicate with our customers, 

customer feedback are gathered and communicated to quality control team for 

quality improvement.  

 

Our production team monitors the condition of the plant, and make every effort 

to ensure our plant is operating at its optimum level with consistent output.  

 

2.34  Suppliers 

 

In the interests of business integrity, we seek to ensure that all the materials 

inputs in our operations are responsibly and reliably sourced.   

 

To achieve this, we rely on the effective internal management systems, strong 

supplier relationships, and close customer collaborations.  The company is 

faced with limited raw material selection options, such risk is addressed through 

supplier’s long term commitments to our business.  

 

The material factors of the sustainability report were discussed at sustainability 

team meeting, and communicated to the Board for further review. These 

material factors has remained the same as those highlighted in 2017. 

 

 

 


11 

 

 

2.4 

Governance 

 

We believe that in order to uphold business integrity, we have a culture of zero 

tolerance for solicitation or bribery.  

 

In line with this, we have developed the “Code of Business Ethics and Conduct” and 

“Anti-Corruption Policy”. These policies are communicated to all levels of employees 

within the company, which basically spelled out the behavior expected of every 

members of the company.   

 

These policies are executed through the yearly declaration of conflict of interest from 

employees at all level. Declaration are expected from all relevant employees within a 

controlled period.  

 

The Audit Committee (AC), with the help of Management, reviews all the operations 

within the group and assess the risk likelihood of corruptions.  The company has an 

internal audit department, where independent investigations are conducted at the 

instructions of the AC and the Board. The AC also reviews existing policy and 

procedures for preventing the occurrence of corruption.  

 

The whistle-blowing policy is made known to all employees so as to encourage ethical 

reporting.  

 

The policy protects genuine whistleblowers from any unfair treatment resulting from 

their report, and allows the matters to be reported directly to the AC. The AC considers 

the nature of the matter, if any, and may demand an independent investigation from 

the internal audit department. 

 

LAP maintains an enterprise risk framework. Under this framework, all key operations 

are required to carry out a self-assessment exercise on a yearly basis. This risk 

assessment requires key operations to identify risks, assess risk likelihood and 

impacts, and consider the effectiveness of the existing controls. All operation heads 

of department are involved in these assessments and are required to provide a written 

assurance as to the adequacy and effectiveness of their departmental internal control 

system and risk management.  

 

2.5 

Environment 

 

We do make a conscious effort in addressing the potential environment impact arising 

from the operation of our business activities. 

 

Our plant consumes substantial amount of energy to power production line, furnace, 

petcoke grinding mill, blower motors, equipment and buildings.  Additionally, the 

production plant generates substantial amount of dusts which affect the environment.  

 

We consider emissions and energy usage as the two material factors affecting the 

group’s environmental policy.  

 

2.51  Energy 

 

Energy reduction is very critical to our efforts in keeping down our production 

costs.  

 

We strive to operate our kilns at its optimum operating conditions through 

regular maintenance and timely parts replacement.  

 


12 

 

We have initiated an energy saving program during the year, where an energy-

usage review taskforce has been set up, with Compact’s general manager, Mr 

Wong Ming Seong, chairing the taskforce.  

 

Under this program, the team aims to identify energy saving opportunities in 

areas such as motors, lighting, fuel system and other production areas, before 

formalizing an energy reduction plan, as well as setting realistic targets annually.  

The team communicates their energy reduction plan through meetings with 

departmental managers who will in turn disseminate the message to all 

operational ground staff.  

 

Under this energy saving program, ideas are collated and employees are 

rewarded when their ideals are being adopted by Compact.  

 

Energy consumption 

The total non-renewable fuel consumptions for the year and last year are as 

follows: 

 

HY 2018 

Kwh 

Petcoke 

55,700,000* 

Diesel 

914,000** 

Electricity 

2,240,000 

Total 

58,854,000 

 

While we recognize any increase in production level, there will be an impact on 

the overall energy consumptions, the Group continues to make every efforts in 

conserving energy.   

 

We intend to put in place an energy reduction plan where we will modify our pet-

coke grinding mill &amp; blower motors to include a frequency inverter.  However, 

this will be implemented when the plant is being relocated to Gopeng, Perak. 

The group expects to reduce 1% of the electricity consumption after the 

frequency inverter is installed.

2.52  Emission 

 

In the lime production industry, dusts are inevitably generated during material 

handling, crushing, milling and shipping.  We consistently monitor our emissions 

and ensure compliance at all times, with all environmental regulations such as 

Malaysia Environmental Quality (Clean Air) Regulation Act.  

 

When we have to identify location for building a new plant, we consider all 

factors surrounding the locations to ensure that the impact arising from the 

operation of our plant to the environment is kept to the minimum.  


13 

 

 

When the plant is up and running, we put in place pollution abatement measures 

such as stone wash, installing dust collection equipment, planting trees around 

the manufacturing plant, and the like.  

 

We assess our dust emissions annually through the engagement of third party 

consultants. 

 

2.6 

People 

 

Our people is most essential to the success of the company. Our emphasis on our 

employees is reflected in our dedication to building a healthy and ethical work 

environment. Our strict compliance with all labour laws, our Code of Conduct, our 

Operating Policies and Procedures are all testaments to our efforts in this regards.  

 

2.61  Occupational Health and Safety 

 

At our lime production plant, the health and safety system is a framework 

developed to systematically and methodically manage risks in all work 

processes.  It requires swift investigation of any incident, and promotes a culture 

of open reporting.  We strive for zero fatalities and accidents. 

 

As part of the system, a Safety Committee (SC), comprising the Assistant 

General Manager, Safety Officer and representatives from various departments, 

has been established to help implement and monitor the safety program. In 

order to reduce nonconformance, all production staff is expected to adhere 

strictly to the relevant Standard Operation Procedures under the Group’s 

Corporate Policies and Procedures as well as the Safety Regulations. Training 

and education about health and safety, in addition to on the job training, are 

conducted before we place new staff on the job. 

 

The SC conducts safety meeting on a quarterly basis, so as to instill and 

reinforce our staff with safety awareness, and also to review safety procedures 

and recommend appropriate actions where necessary, for our pursuit of a safe 

working environment. To ensure effectiveness, the meeting require attendance 

from all staff, and the attendance rate must be above 90%. The safety 

committee also tests the fire protection alarm system quarterly in order to 

ensure the system is running effectively.  

 

The emergent response team is set to comprise of all levels of employees from 

department managers to workers.  The team will response to any emergent 

incidents such as occupational incidents, natural disaster, or operation 

interruptions, etc.  

 

Employees are reimbursed for visits to the General Practitioner and Specialists 

at government hospital, polyclinic and private clinic. Employees are protected 

by Personal Accident Insurance, Work Injury Compensation Insurance, etc. 

 

2.62  Training and Education 

 

Lion Asiapac believes in the continuing training and development of our 

employees, who are undoubtedly our most valued assets. We invest in our 

employees, so that they could grow professionally and achieve their full 

potential. The group has developed training and development policy which 

encourages employees to improve their knowledge and skills continuously.  

 


14 

 

The training and education program is handled by the group HR department. All 

employees are accorded annual performance reviews and target setting 

sessions their supervisors who are responsible to identify lacking skills and 

knowledge for the operation of respective jobs.  

 

The HR department, based on the performance report, helps to source classes 

for those job-related knowledge and skills. Employees are also assigned, on an 

ongoing basis where needed, to attend job-related workshops, training sessions 

and seminars. All employees are entitled to a maximum of 80 hours training per 

year, which could be in the form of either internal training or external training. 

 

The company gives support for training and education in various forms such as 

reimburse course or membership fees, approve study and exam leaves, provide 

transportation claims etc.  

 

By supporting education and training, the group hopes to maintain its people, 

and build a competitive labor force for its business.
