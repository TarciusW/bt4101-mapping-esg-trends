PART I
ITEM 1.       BUSINESS 
Exxon Mobil Corporation was incorporated in the State of
New Jersey in 1882. Divisions and affiliated companies of ExxonMobil operate or
market products in the United States and most other countries of the world.
Their principal business is energy, involving exploration for, and production
of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacture of petroleum products and
transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.
ExxonMobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of commodity petrochemicals,
including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a
wide variety of specialty products. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive
research programs in support of these businesses. 
Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and hundreds
of affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso,
Mobil or XTO. For convenience and simplicity, in this report the
terms ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil and XTO, as well as terms
like Corporation, Company, our, we  and its,
are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups
of affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question. 
The energy and petrochemical industries are highly
competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other
industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial
and individual consumers. The Corporation competes with other firms in the sale
or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international
markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate
for such purposes. 
Operating data and industry segment information for the
Corporation are contained in the Financial Section of this report under the
following: “Quarterly Information”, “Note 18: Disclosures about Segments
and Related Information” and “Operating Information”. Information on oil and
gas reserves is contained in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental
Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of
the Financial Section of this report.
ExxonMobil has a long‑standing commitment to the
development of proprietary technology. We have a wide array of research
programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments.
Information on Company‑sponsored research and development spending is
contained in “Note 3: Miscellaneous Financial Information” of the
Financial Section of this report. ExxonMobil held over 12 thousand active
patents worldwide at the end of 2017. For technology licensed to third parties,
revenues totaled approximately $89 million in 2017. Although technology is
an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our Company,
the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual
patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise or concession.
The number of regular employees was 69.6 thousand,
71.1 thousand, and 73.5 thousand at years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Regular employees are defined as active executive, management,
professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for
the Corporation and are covered by the Corporation’s benefit plans and
programs. Regular employees do not include employees of the company‑operated
retail sites (CORS). The number of CORS employees was 1.6 thousand,
1.6 thousand, and 2.1 thousand at years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
Throughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing
measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on
air, water and ground. These include a significant investment in refining
infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well
as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and
greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations.
Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum
Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2017 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such
preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity
company expenditures, were $4.7 billion, of which $3.3 billion were
included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures. The total cost
for such activities is expected to increase to approximately $5 billion in
2018 and 2019. Capital expenditures are expected to account for approximately
30 percent of the total. 
Information concerning the source and availability of raw
materials used in the Corporation’s business, the extent of seasonality in the
business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of
contracts at the election of governments and risks attendant to foreign operations
may be found in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 2. Properties” in this
report. 
ExxonMobil maintains a website at exxonmobil.com. Our
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are made
available through our website as soon as reasonably practical after we
electronically file or furnish the reports to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). Also available on the Corporation’s website are the Company’s
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, as
well as the charters of the audit, compensation and nominating committees of
the Board of Directors. Information on our website is not incorporated into
this report.

ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS

ExxonMobil’s financial and operating
results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and
petrochemical businesses. Many of these risk factors are not within the
Company’s control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and
operating results, or our financial condition. These risk factors include: 
 
Supply and Demand 
The oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are
fundamentally commodity businesses. This means ExxonMobil’s operations and
earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and
petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products. Oil, gas,
petrochemical, and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional,
and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant
commodity. Any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a
material adverse effect on certain of the Company’s operations, especially in
the Upstream segment, financial condition, and proved reserves. On the other
hand, a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material
adverse effect on certain of the Company’s operations, especially in the
Downstream and Chemical segments.
Economic conditions. The demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely
with broad-based economic activities and levels of prosperity. The occurrence
of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will
typically have a direct adverse impact on our results. Other factors that
affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as
changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government
austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the
demand for energy and petrochemicals. Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults,
inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity
crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems
such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the
functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to
ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the
ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to
ExxonMobil. 
Other demand-related factors. Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas,
and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our results, include technological
improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the
demand for energy associated with heating and cooling; increased
competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not
been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies
or mandates; changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel
choices, such as technological advances in energy storage that make wind and
solar more competitive for power generation or increased consumer demand for alternative
fueled or electric vehicles; and broad-based changes in personal income levels.

Other supply-related factors. Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a
number of factors affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the
development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance
recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent
such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand.
Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing
capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the affected products.
World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors
that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to OPEC
production quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural
disasters, disruptions in competitors’ operations, or unexpected unavailability
of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can
also alter the relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil
and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals. 
Other market factors. ExxonMobil’s business results are also exposed to
potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates, inflation,
currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions. 
 
Government and Political Factors 
ExxonMobil’s results can be adversely affected by
political or regulatory developments affecting our operations. 
Access limitations. A number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, or
may place resources off-limits from development altogether. Restrictions on
foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high
commodity prices, when national governments may have less need of outside
sources of private capital. Many countries also restrict the import or export
of certain products based on point of origin. 
Restrictions on doing business. ExxonMobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed
by the United States or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may
prohibit ExxonMobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain
countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. Such
restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be
subject to comparable restrictions. 
Lack of legal certainty. Some countries in which we do business lack
well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted, or may be unable to
maintain, clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development. Lack of
legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or
unpredictable actions by government officials, and also makes it more difficult
for us to enforce our contracts. In some cases these risks can be partially
offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the
adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce
an award. 

2 



 

Regulatory and litigation risks. Even in countries with well-developed legal
systems where ExxonMobil does business, we remain exposed to changes in law
(including changes that result from international treaties and accords) that
could adversely affect our results, such as: 
  



·        
    


increases in taxes, duties, or government royalty
  rates (including retroactive claims);




·        
    


price controls;




·        
    


changes in environmental regulations or other laws
  that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business
  opportunities (including changes in laws related to offshore drilling
  operations, water use, methane emissions, or hydraulic fracturing);




·        
    


adoption of regulations mandating efficiency
  standards, the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components;




·        
    


adoption of government payment transparency
  regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive
  commercial information, or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure
  laws of other countries; and




·        
    


government actions to cancel contracts,
  re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations,
  renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets.



Legal remedies available to compensate us for
expropriation or other takings may be inadequate. 
We also may be adversely affected by the outcome of
litigation, especially in countries such as the United States in which very
large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur, or by government
enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or
regulations. 
Security concerns. Successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be
disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, cybersecurity
attacks, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may require us to
incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of
time. 
Climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions. Due to concern over the risks of climate change, a
number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of,
regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include
adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting,
increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable
energy. These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen
project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as
shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural
gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also
increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering
emissions. 
Government sponsorship of alternative energy. Many governments are providing tax advantages and
other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use
of specific fuels or technologies. Governments and others are also promoting
research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability
of alternative energy sources. We are conducting our own research both in-house
and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world,
including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, the
University of Texas, and Stanford University. Our research projects focus on
developing algae-based biofuels, carbon capture and storage, breakthrough
energy efficiency processes, advanced energy-saving materials, and other
technologies. For example, ExxonMobil is working with Fuel Cell Energy Inc. to
explore using carbonate fuel cells to economically capture CO2
emissions from gas-fired power plants. Our future results may depend in part on
the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the
strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the
future in a cost-competitive manner. See “Operational and Other Factors” below.

 
Operational and Other Factors
In addition to external economic and political
factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage
successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control. The
extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to
competition. For projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the
management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control. 
Exploration and development program. Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas
production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts.
Among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the
most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to
bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget. 
Project and portfolio management. The long-term success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream,
Downstream, and Chemical businesses depends on complex, long‑term,
capital intensive projects. These projects in turn require a high degree of
project management expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific factors that can
affect the performance of major projects include our ability to: negotiate
successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, customers,
or others; model and optimize reservoir performance; develop markets for
project outputs, whether through long-term contracts or the development of
effective spot markets; manage changes in operating conditions and costs,
including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and
shipping; prevent, to the extent possible, and respond effectively to
unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause
unscheduled project downtime; and influence the performance of project
operators where ExxonMobil does not perform that role. In addition to the
effective management of individual projects, ExxonMobil’s success, including
our ability to mitigate risk and


3 



 

provide attractive returns
to shareholders, depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio,
including diversification among types and locations of our projects. 
The term “project” as used in this report can refer to
a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same
meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. 
Operational efficiency. An important component of ExxonMobil’s competitive
performance, especially given the commodity‑based nature of many of our
businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to
manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis. This
requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost
control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio,
and the recruitment, development, and retention of high caliber employees. 
Research and development. To maintain our competitive position, especially in
light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous
efficiency improvement, ExxonMobil’s research and development organizations
must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy
environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. 
Safety, business controls, and environmental risk
management. Our results depend on
management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and
petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities, and
to minimize the potential for human error. We apply rigorous management systems
and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other
adverse environmental events. For example, we work to minimize spills through a
combined program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing
upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and
surveillance. Similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new technologies
and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in
response to government requirements but also to address community priorities.
We also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a
controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework.
Substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our
management systems and controls do not function as intended.
Cybersecurity.
ExxonMobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a
variety of threat actors. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity
disruptions prove to be insufficient, ExxonMobil as well as our customers,
employees, or third parties could be adversely affected. Such cybersecurity
disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment; damage or
destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary information
being altered, lost, or stolen; result in employee, customer, or third-party
information being compromised; or otherwise disrupt our business operations. We
could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of such a cybersecurity
disruption as well as in connection with resulting regulatory actions and
litigation. 
Preparedness.
Our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters,
human error, and similar events. For example, hurricanes may damage our
offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in
vulnerable areas. Our facilities are designed, constructed, and operated to
withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety
factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties, including
those associated with wave, wind, and current intensity, marine ice flow
patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes,
extreme rain fall events, and earthquakes. Our consideration of changing
weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the
engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially
introduce. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends
in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as
our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity
planning. 
Insurance limitations. The ability of the Corporation to insure against many
of the risks it faces as described in this Item 1A is limited by the capacity
of the applicable insurance markets, which may not be sufficient.
Competition.
As noted in Item 1 above, the energy and petrochemical industries are highly
competitive. We face competition not only from other private firms, but also
from state-owned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities
outside of their home countries. In some cases, these state-owned companies may
pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government
owners, with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private
shareholders, such as ExxonMobil. Technology and expertise provided by industry
service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may not
have the internal resources and capabilities of ExxonMobil.
Reputation.
Our reputation is an important corporate asset. An operating incident,
significant cybersecurity disruption, or other adverse event such as those
described in this Item 1A may have a negative impact on our reputation, which
in turn could make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new
opportunities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, or could reduce consumer
demand for our branded products.
Projections, estimates, and descriptions of
ExxonMobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in Items 1, 1A, 2, 7
and 7A of this report are forward-looking statements. Actual future results,
including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures, costs,
and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the
factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report.

 In the preceding reserves information,
consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately.
However, the Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity
company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries. 
The Corporation anticipates several projects will come
online over the next few years providing additional production capacity.
However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of
individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance;
performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact
of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on
production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital
investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and
other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the
requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous
technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis
of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures.
Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which
have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the
development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain
that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be
affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects,
reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer
preferences, and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price
levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of
low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation’s capital spending
and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects.
B. Technologies Used in
Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2017 
Additions to ExxonMobil’s proved reserves in 2017 were
based on estimates generated through the integration of available and
appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing
well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield
repeatable and consistent results. 
Data used in these integrated assessments included
information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well
logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure
information, production test data, and surveillance and performance
information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained
through indirect measurements including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data,
calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret
the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary
reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data
analysis packages. 
In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs
were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase
the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates. 
C. Qualifications of
Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves 
ExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves group that
provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization.
Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves
estimation process for compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the
reporting of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves. This group also maintains the
official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil’s proved reserves of crude
oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition,
the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation
and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The Manager of the
Global Reserves group has more than 25 years of experience in reservoir
engineering and reserves assessment and has a degree in Engineering. He is an
active member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). The group is staffed
with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical
experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification
and categorization of reserves under the SEC guidelines. This group includes
individuals who hold advanced degrees in either Engineering or Geology, and a
member currently serves on the SPE Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. 
The Global Reserves group maintains a central database
containing the official company reserves estimates. Appropriate controls,
including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place
to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the
system’s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the
reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well
and field performance and a rigorous peer review. No changes may be made to the
reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new
initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have
been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the
operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed
certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level
of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made
in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves group for all
proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After
all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final
endorsement.

 2. Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
At year-end 2017, approximately 7.3 billion oil-equivalent
barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved
undeveloped. This represents 34 percent of the 21.2 GOEB reported in proved
reserves. This compares to the 6.2 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves reported
at the end of 2016. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted development
activities that resulted in the transfer of approximately 0.7 GOEB from proved
undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year‑end. The largest
transfers were related to the start-up of the Gorgon field and Longford Gas
Conditioning Plant in Australia and drilling activity in the United States, the
United Arab Emirates, and Kazakhstan. During 2017, extensions and discoveries,
primarily in the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Guyana resulted
in an addition of approximately 0.9 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves. Also,
purchases, primarily in the United States and Mozambique resulted in the
addition of approximately 0.9 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves. 
Overall, investments of $8 billion were made by the
Corporation during 2017 to progress the development of reported proved
undeveloped reserves, including $8 billion for oil and gas producing activities
and in addition, nearly $100 million for other non-oil and gas producing
activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related
facilities. These investments represented 48 percent of the $16.7 billion in
total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures. Investments made
by the Corporation to develop quantities which no longer meet the SEC
definition of proved reserves due to 2017 average prices are included in the
$16.7 billion of Upstream capital expenditures reported above but are excluded
from amounts related to progressing the development of proved undeveloped
reserves. 
One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved
reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the
development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy
and many major fields require long lead‑time in order to be developed.
Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording
proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five
years for large and complex projects. Proved undeveloped reserves in Canada,
Kazakhstan, Australia, the Netherlands, the United States, and Qatar have
remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the
capacity of infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete
development for very large projects. The Corporation is reasonably certain that
these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing and amount
recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of
development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government
policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co‑venturer/government
funding, and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price levels.
Of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more
years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. In
Canada, proved undeveloped reserves are related to drilling activities in the
offshore Hebron field and onshore Cold Lake operations. In Kazakhstan, the
proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial
development of the producing offshore Kashagan field which is included in the
North Caspian Production Sharing Agreement and the Tengizchevroil joint venture
which includes a production license in the Tengiz – Korolev field complex. The
Tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will
continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress.
In Australia, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future
compression for the Gorgon Jansz LNG project. In the Netherlands, the Groningen
gas field has proved undeveloped reserves related to installation of future
compression.

Average production prices have been calculated by using
sales quantities from the Corporation’s own production as the divisor. Average
production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the
divisor. The volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production used
for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section
3.A. The volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production
volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in section 3.A.
The natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those shown in
the reserves table in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental
Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of
the Financial Section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared. Gas is
converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand
barrels.

B. Exploratory and Development Activities Regarding Oil and Gas
Resources Extracted by Mining Technologies 
Syncrude Operations. Syncrude is a joint venture established to
recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract
the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32
degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of
a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent
interest in Imperial Oil Limited. In 2017, the company’s share of net
production of synthetic crude oil was about 57 thousand barrels per day
and share of net acreage was about 63 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil
sands deposit. 
Kearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to
recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract
the crude bitumen. Imperial Oil Limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the
joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent.
Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and
a 100 percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised
of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil
sands deposit. 
Kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of Fort
McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is extracted from oil sands produced from
open-pit mining operations, and processed through bitumen extraction and froth
treatment trains. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our
refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or
other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate
transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2017, average net production at
Kearl was about 174 thousand barrels per day.

contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can
be a combination of our own production and the spot market. Worldwide, we are
contractually committed to deliver approximately 57 million barrels of oil and
2,400 billion cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2018 through 2020.
We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with production
from our proved developed reserves. Any remaining commitments will be fulfilled
with production from our proved undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases
as necessary.

ExxonMobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped
acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks and leases. The terms and
conditions under which the Corporation maintains exploration and/or production
rights to the acreage are property‑specific, contractually defined and
vary significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to
ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before
expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish acreage
in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is
complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where
additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has
generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of
leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not
expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.

D. Summary of Acreage Terms 
UNITED STATES 
Oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired
from mineral interest owners through a lease. Mineral interest owners include
the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral interest owners.
Leases typically have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years, and
a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases.
Under certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term
even if production has not commenced. In some instances regarding private
property, a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying mineral interests
are owned outright.
CANADA / OTHER
AMERICAS 
Canada 
Exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are
acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible.
These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or
leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and lease
agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the
licenses and leases. Exploration licenses in offshore eastern Canada and the
Beaufort Sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. They
are valid for a maximum term of nine years. Offshore production licenses are
valid for 25 years, with rights of extension for continued production.
Significant discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently
undeveloped discoveries, do not have a definite term. 
Argentina 
The Federal Hydrocarbon Law was amended in December 2014.
The onshore concession terms granted prior to the amendment are up to six
years, divided into three potential exploration periods, with an optional
extension for up to one year depending on the classification of the area.
Pursuant to the amended law, the production term for a conventional production
concession would be 25 years, and 35 years for an unconventional
concession, with unlimited ten-year extensions possible, once a field has been
developed. 
Guyana 
The Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act authorizes
the government of Guyana to grant petroleum prospecting and production licenses
and to enter into petroleum agreements for the exploration and production of
hydrocarbons. Petroleum agreements provide for an exploration period of up to
10 years with a production period of 20 years with a 10 year extension. 
EUROPE 
Germany 
Exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum
period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions of up to three
years each. Extensions are subject to specific, minimum work commitments.
Production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with
multiple possible extensions as long as there is production on the license.
Netherlands                                                                      
Under the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003,
exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are
issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on
the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is
issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the
Mining Law. 
Production rights granted prior to January 1, 2003, remain
subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for onshore and offshore
areas. Onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite; from
1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license,
ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976
were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued
for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to
40 years. 
Norway 
Licenses issued between 1972 and 1997 were for an initial
period of up to six years (with extension of the initial period of one year at
a time up to ten years after 1985), and an extension period of up to 30 years,
with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the
end of the initial period. Licenses issued after July 1, 1997, have an initial
period of up to ten years and a normal extension period of up to 30 years or in
special cases of up to 50 years, and with relinquishment of at least one-half
of the original area required at the end of the initial period.

 

19 



 

United
Kingdom 
Acreage terms are fixed by the government and are
periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the
first four licensing rounds provided for an initial term of six years with
relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the
initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any
such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of
production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on
a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate
in all other areas. The majority of traditional licenses currently issued have
an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four
years, and a final production term of 18 years, with a mandatory relinquishment
of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is
not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term. 
Terms for exploration acreage in technically challenged
areas are governed by frontier production licenses, generally covering a larger
initial area than traditional licenses, with an initial exploration term of six
or nine years with a second term extension of six years, and a final production
term of 18 years, with relinquishment of 75 percent of the original area after
three years and 50 percent of the remaining acreage after the next three years.
Innovate licenses issued replace traditional and frontier licenses and offer
greater flexibility with respect to periods and work program commitments.
AFRICA 
Angola 
Exploration and production activities are governed by
production sharing agreements with an initial exploration term of four years
and an optional second phase of two to three years. The production period is 25
years, and agreements generally provide for a negotiated extension. 
Chad 
Exploration permits are issued for a period of five years,
and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and
conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified
in a negotiated convention. The production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050.  
Equatorial Guinea 
Exploration, development and production activities are
governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the State
Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons. A new PSC was signed in 2015; the initial
exploration period is five years for oil and gas, with multi-year extensions
available at the discretion of the Ministry and limited relinquishments in the
absence of commercial discoveries. The production period for crude oil ranges
from 25 to 30 years, while the production period for natural gas ranges from 25
to 50 years. 
Mozambique 
Exploration and production activities are generally
governed by concession contracts with the Government of the Republic of
Mozambique, represented by the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy. An
interest in Area 4 offshore Mozambique was acquired in December
2017. Terms for Area 4 are governed by the Exploration and Production
Concession Contract (EPCC) for Area 4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block dated
December 20, 2006 and Decree Law 2/2014. The EPCC expires 30 years after the
approval of a plan of development for a given discovery area. 
Nigeria 
Exploration and production activities in the deepwater
offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs)
with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and
any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30
years, including a ten-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase
that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon
commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment
is required under the PSC at the end of the ten-year exploration period, and
OMLs have a 20-year production period that may be extended. 
Some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by
joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in
deepwater offshore areas are valid for 10 years, while in all other areas the
licenses are for five years. Demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis
for conversion of an OPL to an OML. 
OMLs granted prior to the 1969 Petroleum Act (i.e., under
the Mineral Oils Act 1914, repealed by the 1969 Petroleum Act) were for 30
years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed, effective
December 1, 2008, for a further period of 20 years, with a further renewal
option of 20 years. Operations under these pre-1969 OMLs are conducted under a
joint venture agreement with NNPC rather than a PSC. Commercial terms
applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by the
Petroleum Profits Tax Act. 

20 



 

OMLs granted
under the 1969 Petroleum Act, which include all deepwater OMLs, have a maximum
term of 20 years without distinction for onshore or offshore location and are
renewable, upon 12 months’ written notice, for another period of 20 years. OMLs
not held by NNPC are also subject to a mandatory 50-percent relinquishment
after the first 10 years of their duration. 
ASIA 
Azerbaijan 
The production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development
of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field is established for an initial period of 30
years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994. The PSA was amended in
September 2017 to extend the term by 25 years to 2049.
Other exploration and production activities are governed by
PSAs negotiated with the national oil company of Azerbaijan. The exploration
period typically consists of three or four years with the possibility of a one
to three-year extension. The production period, which includes development, is
for 25 years or 35 years with the possibility of one or two five-year
extensions. 
Indonesia 
Exploration and production activities in Indonesia are
generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a
production sharing contract (PSC), negotiated with BPMIGAS, a government agency
established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and gas activities. In 2012,
Indonesia’s Constitutional Court ruled certain articles of law relating to
BPMIGAS to be unconstitutional, but stated that all existing PSCs signed with
BPMIGAS should remain in force until their expiry, and the functions and duties
previously performed by BPMIGAS are to be carried out by the relevant Ministry
of the Government of Indonesia until the promulgation of a new oil and gas law.
By presidential decree, SKKMIGAS became the interim successor to BPMIGAS. The
current PSCs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended up
to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. PSCs generally require the
contractor to relinquish 10 percent to 20 percent of the contract area after
three years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more than 50 percent
to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending on the
acreage and terms. 
Iraq 
Development and production activities in the state-owned
oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil companies of the
Iraqi Ministry of Oil. An ExxonMobil affiliate entered into a contract with
Basra Oil Company of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for the rights to participate in
the development and production activities of the West Qurna Phase I oil
and gas field effective March 1, 2010. The term of the contract is 20 years
with the right to extend for five years. The contract provides for cost
recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production above specified
levels. 
Exploration and production activities in the Kurdistan
Region of Iraq are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated
with the regional government of Kurdistan in 2011. The exploration term is for
five years, with extensions available as provided by the PSCs and at the
discretion of the regional government of Kurdistan. Current PSCs remain in
effect by agreement of the regional government to allow additional time for
exploration or evaluation of commerciality. The production period is
20 years with the right to extend for five years.
Kazakhstan 
Onshore exploration and production activities are governed
by the production license, exploration license and joint venture agreements
negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production operations have
a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993. 
Offshore exploration and production activities are governed
by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal periods for
each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes
development, is 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the
possibility of two ten-year extensions. 
Malaysia 
Production activities are governed by production sharing
contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company. The PSCs have
exploration and production terms ranging up to 38 years. All extensions are
subject to the national oil company’s prior written approval. The production
periods range from 15 to 29 years, depending on the provisions of the
respective contract. 
Qatar 
The State of Qatar grants gas production development
project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore North Field to
permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to
satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these projects. 

21 



 

Republic
of Yemen 
The Jannah production sharing agreement has a development
period extending 20 years from first commercial declaration, which was made in
June 1995. Due to force majeure events, the development period has been
extended beyond its original expiration date, with the possibility of further
extensions due to ongoing force majeure events.
Russia 
Terms for ExxonMobil’s Sakhalin acreage are fixed by the
current production sharing agreement (PSA) between the Russian government and
the Sakhalin-1 consortium, of which ExxonMobil is the operator. 
Exploration and production
activities in the Kara, Laptev, Chukchi and Black Seas are governed by joint
venture agreements concluded with Rosneft in 2013 and 2014 that cover certain
of Rosneft’s offshore licenses. The Kara Sea licenses covered by the joint
venture agreements concluded in 2013 extend through 2040 and include
exploration periods through 2020 and 2022. Additional licenses in the Kara,
Laptev and Chukchi Seas covered by the joint venture agreements concluded in
2014 extend through 2043 and include an exploration period through 2023. The
Kara, Laptev and Chukchi Sea licenses require development plan submission
within eight to eleven years from a discovery and development activities within
five years of plan approval. The Black Sea exploration license extends through
2020, and a discovery is the basis for obtaining a license for production.
Refer to the relevant portion of “Note 7: Equity Company Information”
of the Financial Section of this report for additional information on the
Corporation’s participation in Rosneft joint venture activities. 
Thailand 
The Petroleum Act of 1971 allows production under
ExxonMobil’s concession for 30 years with a ten-year extension at terms
generally prevalent at the time. The term of the concession expires in 2021.
United Arab Emirates 
An interest in the development and production activities of
the Upper Zakum field, a major offshore field, was acquired effective as of
January 2006, for a term expiring March 2026. In 2013 the governing agreements
were extended to 2041 and in 2017 they were extended to 2051.
AUSTRALIA / OCEANIA 
Australia 
Exploration and production activities conducted offshore in
Commonwealth waters are governed by Federal legislation. Exploration permits
are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year
renewal periods. Retention leases may be granted for resources that are not commercially
viable at the time of application, but are expected to become commercially
viable within 15 years. These are granted for periods of five years and
renewals may be requested. Prior to July 1998, production licenses were granted
initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and thereafter
“indefinitely”, i.e., for the life of the field. Effective from July 1998, new
production licenses are granted “indefinitely”. In each case, a production
license may be terminated if no production operations have been carried on for
five years. 
Papua New Guinea 
Exploration and production activities are governed by the
Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum Prospecting licenses are granted for an initial term
of six years with a five-year extension possible (an additional extension of
three years is possible in certain circumstances). Generally, a 50-percent
relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial
six-year term, if extended. Petroleum Development licenses are granted for an
initial 25-year period. An extension of up to 20 years may be granted at the
Minister’s discretion. Petroleum Retention licenses may be granted for gas
resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but may
become commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15
years. Petroleum Retention licenses are granted for five-year terms, and may be
extended, at the Minister’s discretion, twice for the maximum retention time of
15 years. Extensions of Petroleum Retention licenses may be for periods of less
than one year, renewable annually, if the Minister considers at the time of extension
that the resources could become commercially viable in less than five years.

Item 3.       Legal
Proceedings
As
reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2017, on June
20, 2017, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notified XTO Energy Inc. (XTO) concerning
alleged violations of the Clean Air Act and the Fort Berthold Indian
Reservation Federal Implementation Plan regarding the alleged failure of vapor
control systems to properly route tank vapors to control devices at well pads
and tank farms on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. In January 2018, XTO,
the DOJ and the EPA agreed to the terms of a Consent Decree concerning those
alleged violations. XTO has agreed to pay a penalty of $320,000, install
automatic tank gauging on 30 well sites, and monitor and report emissions for
three years. Following signature by EPA and the DOJ, the Consent Decree is
subject to a 30-day public comment period and approval by the United States
Federal District Court for the District of North Dakota – Western Division, in
Bismarck, North Dakota, which is expected in March 2018.
As
reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2017, in late
April 2017, the State of North Dakota Department of Health (NDDOH) and the
North Dakota State Office of the Attorney General notified XTO of their
interest in settling alleged violations of the North Dakota Century Code and
implementing regulations regarding the alleged failure of vapor control systems
to properly route tank vapors to control devices at well pads and tank farms
outside the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. On February 1, 2018, the South
Central Judicial District Court in Bismarck, North Dakota, approved a Consent
Decree between XTO and NDDOH concerning those alleged violations. Under the
Consent Decree, XTO will pay a civil penalty of up to $665,000, but that amount
may be reduced if specified corrective actions are achieved by deadlines set
forth in the Consent Decree. Assuming these deadlines are met, XTO anticipates
that it will pay a penalty of approximately $440,000 in the fourth quarter of
2018. XTO will monitor and report compliance with the terms of the Consent
Decree for a period of two years.
On
July 20, 2017, the United States Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign
Assets Control (OFAC) assessed a civil penalty against Exxon Mobil Corporation,
ExxonMobil Development Company and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation for violating the
Ukraine-Related Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 589. The assessed civil
penalty is in the amount of $2,000,000. ExxonMobil and its affiliates have been
and continue to be in compliance with all sanctions and disagree that any
violation has occurred. ExxonMobil and its affiliates filed a complaint on July
20, 2017, in the United States Federal District Court, Northern District of
Texas seeking judicial review of, and to enjoin, the civil penalty under the
Administrative Procedures Act and the United States Constitution, including on
the basis that it represents an arbitrary and capricious action by OFAC and a
violation of the Company’s due process rights.
Refer to the relevant portions of “Note 16: Litigation
and Other Contingencies” of the Financial Section of this report for additional

During the fourth quarter, the Corporation did not purchase
any shares of its common stock for the treasury.
Note 1 - On August 1, 2000, the Corporation announced its
intention to resume purchases of shares of its common stock for the treasury
both to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and
programs and to gradually reduce the number of shares outstanding. The
announcement did not specify an amount or expiration date. The Corporation has
continued to purchase shares since this announcement and to report purchased
volumes in its quarterly earnings releases. In its earnings release dated February
2, 2016, the Corporation stated it will continue to acquire shares to offset
dilution in conjunction with benefit plans and programs, but had suspended
making purchases to reduce shares outstanding effective beginning the first
quarter of 2016.

Corporation’s financial reporting. Management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
this evaluation, management concluded that Exxon Mobil Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, audited the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, as stated in
their report included in the Financial Section of this report. 
Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes during the Corporation’s last fiscal

affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS 
 

 

 Listed below are definitions of several of
ExxonMobil’s key business and financial performance measures. These definitions
are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation. 
Cash Flow From Operations and Asset Sales 
Cash
flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by
operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries,
property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources
of cash from both operating the Corporation’s assets and from the divesting of
assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review
process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation’s
strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these
objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular
nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider
proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating
activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and
financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Capital Employed 
Capital
employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of
how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes ExxonMobil’s net share
of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding
both short-term and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the
sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes
ExxonMobil’s share of total debt and equity. Both of these views include
ExxonMobil’s share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the
Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure
of capital employed.

Return on Average Capital Employed 
Return
on average capital employed (ROCE) is a performance measure ratio. From the
perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings
divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and
end-of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil’s share of
segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed
definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation’s total ROCE is
net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of
financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation
has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the
best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive,
long-term industry, both to evaluate management’s performance and to demonstrate
to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long term.
Additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make
investment decisions.

OVERVIEW 
The
following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil’s financial results, as well as
the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated
financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the
management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation’s accounting and
financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving
the extracting, manufacturing and marketing of hydrocarbons and
hydrocarbon-based products. The Corporation’s business model involves the
production (or purchase), manufacture and sale of physical products, and all
commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical
movement of goods. 
ExxonMobil,
with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and
technology portfolio, is well‑positioned to participate in substantial
investments to develop new energy supplies. The company’s integrated business
model, with significant investments in Upstream, Downstream and Chemical
segments, reduces the Corporation’s risk from changes in commodity prices. While
commodity prices are volatile on a short-term basis and depend on supply and
demand, ExxonMobil’s investment decisions are based on our long-term business
outlook, using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most
attractive investment opportunities. The corporate plan is a fundamental annual
management process that is the basis for setting near-term operating and
capital objectives in addition to providing the longer-term economic
assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes. Volumes are based on
individual field production profiles, which are also updated annually. Price
ranges for crude oil, natural gas, refined products, and chemical products are
based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and are
utilized for investment evaluation purposes. Major investment opportunities are
evaluated over a range of economic scenarios. Once major investments are made,
a reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and
improvements are incorporated into future projects.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT 
Long-Term Business Outlook 
The
basis for the Long‑Term Business Outlook is the Corporation’s annual Outlook
for Energy, which is used to help inform our long‑term business
strategies and investment plans. By 2040, the world’s population is projected
to grow to approximately 9.2 billion people, or about 1.7 billion
more than in 2016. Coincident with this population increase, the Corporation
expects worldwide economic growth to average close to 3 percent per year.
As economies and populations grow, and as living standards improve for billions
of people, the need for energy will continue to rise. Even with significant
efficiency gains, global energy demand is projected to rise by about
25 percent from 2016 to 2040. This demand increase is expected to be
concentrated in developing countries (i.e., those that are not member nations
of the Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development).
As
expanding prosperity drives global energy demand higher, increasing use of
energy‑efficient technologies and practices as well as lower-emission
fuels will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and
emissions per unit of economic output over time. Substantial efficiency gains
are likely in all key aspects of the world’s economy through 2040, affecting
energy requirements for transportation, power generation, industrial
applications, and residential and commercial needs.
Energy
for transportation – including cars, trucks, ships, trains and airplanes – is
expected to increase by about 30 percent from 2016 to 2040. The growth in
transportation energy demand is likely to account for approximately
60 percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand worldwide over this
period, even as liquids demand for light-duty vehicles is relatively flat to
2040, reflecting the impact of better fleet fuel economy and significant growth
in electric cars over the period. Nearly all the world’s transportation fleets
are likely to continue to run on liquid fuels, which are abundant, widely
available, easy to transport, and provide a large quantity of energy in small
volumes.
Demand
for electricity around the world is likely to increase approximately
60 percent from 2016 to 2040, with developing countries accounting for
about 85 percent of the increase. Consistent with this projection, power
generation is expected to remain the largest and fastest‑growing major
segment of global primary energy demand. Meeting the expected growth in power
demand will require a diverse set of energy sources. The share of coal‑fired
generation is likely to decline substantially and approach 25 percent of
the world’s electricity in 2040, versus nearly 40 percent in 2016, in part as a
result of policies to improve air quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas
emissions to address the risks of climate change. From 2016 to 2040, the amount
of electricity supplied using natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables is
likely to nearly double, and account for about 95 percent of the growth in
electricity supplies. Renewables in total, led by wind and solar, will account
for about half of the increase in electricity supplies worldwide over the
period to 2040, reaching nearly 35 percent of global electricity supplies by
2040. Natural gas and nuclear will also gain share over the period to 2040,
reaching about 25 percent and 12 percent of global electricity supplies
respectively by 2040. Supplies of electricity by energy type will reflect
significant differences across regions reflecting a wide range of factors
including the cost and availability of various energy supplies.
Liquid
fuels provide the largest share of global energy supplies today reflecting
broad-based availability, affordability, ease of distribution, and fitness as a
practical solution to meet a wide variety of needs. By 2040, global demand for
liquid fuels is projected to grow to approximately 118 million barrels of
oil‑equivalent per day, an increase of about 20 percent from 2016.
Much of this demand today is met by crude production from traditional
conventional sources; these supplies will remain important as significant
development activity is expected to offset much of the natural declines from
these fields. At the same time, a variety of emerging supply sources –
including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids and biofuels –
are expected to grow to help meet rising demand. The world’s resource base is
sufficient to meet projected demand through 2040 as technology advances
continue to expand the availability of economic supply options. However, access
to resources and timely investments will remain critical to meeting global
needs with reliable, affordable supplies.
Natural
gas is a versatile fuel, suitable for a wide variety of applications, and it is
expected to grow the most of any primary energy type from 2016 to 2040, meeting
more than 35 percent of global energy demand growth. Global natural gas
demand is expected to rise nearly 40 percent from 2016 to 2040, with about
45 percent of that increase in the Asia Pacific region. Helping meet these
needs will be significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas ‑ the
natural gas found in shale and other rock formations that was once considered
uneconomic to produce. In total, about 55 percent of the growth in natural
gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources. At the same time,
conventionally-produced natural gas is likely to remain the cornerstone of
supply, meeting about two‑thirds of global demand in 2040. Worldwide liquefied
natural gas (LNG) trade will expand significantly, meeting about one-third of
the increase in demand growth, with much of this supply expected to help meet
rising demand in Asia Pacific.
The
world’s energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through 2040. Oil is
expected to remain the largest source of energy with its share remaining close
to one‑third in 2040. Coal is currently the second largest source of
energy, but it is likely to lose that position to natural gas in the 2020-2025
timeframe. The share of natural gas is expected to reach 25 percent by
2040, while the share of coal falls to about 20 percent. Nuclear power is
projected to grow significantly, as many nations are likely to expand nuclear
capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and
environmental issues. Total renewable energy is likely to exceed
15 percent of global energy by 2040, with biomass, hydro and geothermal
contributing a combined share of more 

41 



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

than
10 percent. Total energy supplied from wind, solar and biofuels is
expected to increase rapidly, growing nearly 250 percent from 2016 to
2040, when they will be about 5 percent of world energy.
The
Corporation anticipates that the world’s available oil and gas resource base
will grow not only from new discoveries, but also from reserve increases in
previously discovered fields. Technology will underpin these increases. The
cost to develop and supply these resources will be significant. According to
the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2017, the
investment required to meet oil and natural gas supply requirements worldwide
over the period 2017‑2040 will be about $21 trillion (New Policies
Scenario, measured in 2016 dollars) or approximately $860 billion per year
on average.
International
accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering greenhouse
gas emissions continue to evolve with uncertain timing and outcome, making it
difficult to predict their business impact. For many years, the Corporation has
taken into account policies established to reduce energy‑related
greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term Outlook for Energy. The
climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris
set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. Our Outlook 
reflects an environment with increasingly stringent climate policies and is
consistent with the aggregation of Nationally Determined Contributions which
were submitted by signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) 2015 Paris Agreement. Our Outlook  seeks to
identify potential impacts of climate‑related policies, which often
target specific sectors, by using various assumptions and tools including
application of a proxy cost of carbon to estimate potential impacts on consumer
demands. For purposes of the Outlook, a proxy cost on energy-related CO2
emissions is assumed to reach about $80 per tonne on average in 2040 in OECD
nations. China and other leading non-OECD nations are expected to trail OECD
policy initiatives. Nevertheless, as people and nations look for ways to reduce
risks of global climate change, they will continue to need practical solutions
that do not jeopardize the affordability or reliability of the energy they
need. 
Practical
solutions to the world’s energy and climate challenges will benefit from market
competition as well as well‑informed, well‑designed, and
transparent policy approaches that carefully weigh costs and benefits. Such
policies are likely to help manage the risks of climate change while also
enabling societies to pursue other high priority goals around the
world – including clean air and water, access to reliable, affordable
energy, and economic progress for all people. All practical and economically‑viable
energy sources, both conventional and unconventional, will need to be pursued
to continue meeting global energy demand, recognizing the scale and variety of
worldwide energy needs as well as the importance of expanding access to modern
energy to promote better standards of living for billions of people. 
The
information provided in the Long‑Term Business Outlook includes
ExxonMobil’s internal estimates and forecasts based upon internal data and
analyses as well as publicly available information from external sources
including the International Energy Agency.
 
Upstream 
ExxonMobil
continues to maintain a diverse portfolio of exploration and development opportunities,
which enables the Corporation to be selective, maximizing shareholder value and
mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil’s fundamental Upstream
business strategies guide our global exploration, development, production, and
gas and power marketing activities. These strategies include capturing material
and accretive opportunities to continually high-grade the resource portfolio,
selectively developing attractive oil and natural gas resources, developing and
applying high-impact technologies, and pursuing productivity and efficiency
gains. These strategies are underpinned by a relentless focus on operational
excellence, development of our employees, and investment in the communities
within which we operate. 
As
future development projects and drilling activities bring new production
online, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type
of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Oil equivalent production
from North America is expected to increase over the next several years based on
current investment plans, contributing over a third of total production.
Further, the proportion of our global production from resource types utilizing
specialized technologies such as unconventional drilling and production systems,
LNG, deepwater, and arctic, is a majority of production and is expected to grow
over the next few years. We do not anticipate that the expected change in the
geographic mix of production volumes, and in the types of opportunities from
which volumes will be produced, will have a material impact on the nature and
the extent of the risks disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, or result in a
material change in our level of unit operating expenses. 
The
Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few
years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will
vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups;
operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil
recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial
terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing
contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may
vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors
described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The
upstream industry environment continued to recover in 2017 as crude oil prices
increased in response to tighter supply and higher demand; gas prices also
improved with increasing demand, particularly in Asia. The markets for crude
oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility. ExxonMobil
believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply
and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic
activities and levels of prosperity. On the 

42 



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

supply
side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of
OPEC and other large government resource owners, and other factors. To manage
the risks associated with price, ExxonMobil evaluates annual plans and major
investments across a range of price scenarios. 
In
2017, our Upstream business produced 4 million oil‑equivalent
barrels per day. During the year, we added over 200,000 oil‑equivalent
barrels per day of gross production capacity through project start‑ups in
Eastern Canada (Hebron) and at our Sakhalin‑1 operation in Russia (Odoptu
Stage 2). We added 2.7 billion oil‑equivalent barrels of proved
reserves, reflecting a 183 percent replacement of 2017 production. We also
made strategic acquisitions in Papua New Guinea, Mozambique, and U.S. tight
oil, and continued to have exploration success in Guyana.
 
Downstream 
ExxonMobil’s
Downstream is a large, diversified business with refining, logistics, and
marketing complexes around the world. The Corporation has a presence in mature
markets in North America and Europe, as well as in the growing Asia Pacific
region.
ExxonMobil’s
fundamental Downstream business strategies competitively position the company
across a range of market conditions. These strategies include targeting best‑in‑class
operations in all aspects of the business, maximizing value from advanced
technologies, capitalizing on integration across ExxonMobil businesses,
selectively investing for resilient, advantaged returns, operating efficiently
and effectively, and providing quality, valued and differentiated products and
services to customers. 
ExxonMobil’s
operating results, as noted in Item 2. Properties, reflect 22 refineries,
located in 14 countries, with distillation capacity of 4.9 million
barrels per day and lubricant basestock manufacturing capacity of 125
thousand barrels per day. ExxonMobil’s fuels and lubes value chains have
significant global reach, with multiple channels to market serving a diverse
customer base. Our portfolio of world-renowned brands includes Exxon, Mobil,
Esso  and Mobil 1.  
Demand
growth remained strong in 2017, and margins strengthened during the year
drawing on previous high inventories, particularly in North America due to
Latin American demand and hurricane related refinery outages. North American
refineries also benefited from cost‑competitive feedstock and energy
supplies as the differential between Brent and WTI widened. Margins in Europe
and Asia strengthened versus 2016, with rising Asia demand and economic growth
in Europe. In the near term, we see variability in refining margins, with some
regions seeing weaker margins as new capacity additions are expected to outpace
growth in global demand for our products, which can also be affected by global
economic conditions and regulatory changes.
Refining
margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a
function of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials
(primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced
(primarily gasoline, heating oil, diesel oil, jet fuel and fuel oil). Crude oil
and many products are widely traded with published prices, including those
quoted on multiple exchanges around the world (e.g., New York Mercantile Exchange
and Intercontinental Exchange). Prices for these commodities are determined by
the global marketplace and are influenced by many factors, including global and
regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, industry refinery
operations, import/export balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal demand,
weather, and political climate. 
ExxonMobil’s
long‑term outlook is that industry refining margins will remain subject
to intense competition as new capacity additions outpace the growth in global
demand. ExxonMobil’s integration across the value chain, from refining to
marketing, enhances overall value in both fuels and lubricants businesses.
As
described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors, proposed carbon policy and
other climate‑related regulations in many countries, as well as the
continued growth in biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the
Downstream business. 
In
the fuels marketing business, margins remained relatively flat in 2017. In
2017, ExxonMobil expanded its branded retail site network and progressed the
multi‑year transition of the direct served (i.e., dealer, company‑operated)
retail network in portions of Europe to a more capital‑efficient Branded
Wholesaler model. The company’s lubricants business continues to grow,
leveraging world‑class brands and integration with industry‑leading
basestock refining capability. ExxonMobil remains a market leader in the high‑value
synthetic lubricants sector, despite increasing competition. 
The
Downstream portfolio is continually evaluated during all parts of the business
cycle, and numerous asset divestments have been made over the past decade. When
investing in the Downstream, ExxonMobil remains focused on selective and
resilient projects. At the end of 2017, construction was nearly complete on a
new delayed coker unit at the refinery in Antwerp, Belgium, to upgrade low‑value
bunker fuel into higher value diesel products. Construction also progressed on
a proprietary hydrocracker at the refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands, to
produce higher value ultra-low sulfur diesel and Group II basestocks. In addition,
an expansion in Singapore is underway to support demand growth for finished
lubricants in key markets. Finally, ExxonMobil announced plans to increase
production of ultra-low sulfur fuels at the Beaumont, Texas, refinery by
approximately 40,000 barrels per day.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

Chemical 
Worldwide
petrochemical demand remained strong in 2017, led by growing demand from Asia
Pacific manufacturers of industrial and consumer products. North America
continued to benefit from abundant supplies of natural gas and gas liquids,
providing both low‑cost feedstock and energy. Specialty product margins
moderated in 2017 with capacity additions exceeding demand growth. 
ExxonMobil
sustained its competitive advantage through continued operational excellence,
investment and cost discipline, a balanced portfolio of products, and
integration with refining and upstream operations, all underpinned by
proprietary technology.
In
2017, we completed start‑up of the polyethylene derivative lines in Mont
Belvieu, Texas, and the adhesion hydrocarbon resin plant in Singapore.
Construction continued on major expansions at our Texas facilities, including a
new world-scale ethane cracker in Baytown and expansion of the polyethylene
plant in Beaumont, to capitalize on low-cost feedstock and energy supplies in
North America and to meet rapidly growing demand for premium polymers. The
company also continued construction on the specialty elastomers plant expansion
in Newport, Wales, with start‑up anticipated in 2018. Construction of a
new halobutyl rubber unit also progressed in Singapore to further extend our
specialty product capacity in Asia Pacific. In addition, the company completed
the acquisition of a petrochemical plant from Jurong Aromatics Corporation, to
complement the existing petrochemical complex in Singapore and meet growing
demand for chemicals products in Asia Pacific.

2017 
Upstream earnings were
$13,355 million, up $13,159 million from 2016. Higher realizations
increased earnings by $5.3 billion. Unfavorable volume and mix effects
decreased earnings by $440 million. All other items increased earnings by
$8.3 billion, primarily due to the $7.1 billion non‑cash impact
from U.S. tax reform, lower asset impairments of $659 million, lower expenses,
and gains from asset management activity. On an oil‑equivalent basis,
production of 4 million barrels per day was down 2 percent compared
to 2016. Liquids production of 2.3 million barrels per day decreased
82,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower entitlements were partly
offset by increased project volumes and work programs. Natural gas production
of 10.2 billion cubic feet per day increased 84 million cubic feet
per day from 2016 as project ramp‑up, primarily in Australia, was partly
offset by field decline and regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands. U.S.
Upstream earnings were $6,622 million in 2017, including $7.6 billion
of U.S. tax reform benefits and asset impairments of $521 million. Non‑U.S.
Upstream earnings were $6,733 million, including asset impairments of $983
million and unfavorable impacts of $480 million from U.S. tax reform.
 
2016 
Upstream earnings were $196 million
in 2016 and included asset impairment charges of $2,163 million mainly
relating to dry gas operations with undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountains
region of the U.S. Earnings were down $6,905 million from 2015. Lower
realizations decreased earnings by $5.3 billion. Favorable volume and mix
effects increased earnings by $130 million. The impairment charges reduced
earnings by $2.2 billion. All other items increased earnings by $440 million,
primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by the absence of favorable tax
items from the prior year. On an oil equivalent basis, production of 4.1 million
barrels per day was down slightly compared to 2015. Liquids production of 2.4 million
barrels per day increased 20,000 barrels per day with increased project
volumes, mainly in Canada, Indonesia and Nigeria, partly offset by field
decline, the impact from Canadian wildfires, and downtime notably in Nigeria.
Natural gas production of 10.1 billion cubic feet per day decreased 388 million
cubic feet per day from 2015 as field decline, regulatory restrictions in the
Netherlands and divestments were partly offset by higher project volumes and
work programs. U.S. Upstream earnings declined $3,072 million from 2015 to
a loss of $4,151 million, and included impairment charges of $2,163 million.
Earnings outside the U.S. were $4,347 million, down $3,833 million
from the prior year.

Listed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes
reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.
 
Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of
production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume‑determining
factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production
Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically occur when cumulative investment
returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity
upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity
redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the
termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred,
it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil
prices.
 
Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of
production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational
volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices
or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of
contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending
variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes
attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are
required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from
period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and
natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net
interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.
 
Quotas are changes in ExxonMobil’s allowable production arising
from production constraints imposed by countries which are members of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in
this category would have been readily producible in the absence of the quota.
 
Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production
arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a
field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. 
 
Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational
and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may
affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not
limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities,
acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand,
natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect
entitlements.

Downstream earnings of $5,597 million
increased $1,396 million from 2016. Stronger refining and marketing
margins increased earnings by $1.5 billion, while volume and mix effects
decreased earnings by $30 million. All other items decreased earnings by
$40 million, driven by the absence of a $904 million gain from the
Canadian retail assets sale, and Hurricane Harvey related expenses, which were
mostly offset by $618 million of U.S. tax reform impacts and non‑U.S.
asset management gains in the current year. Petroleum product sales of 5.5 million
barrels per day were 48,000 barrels per day higher than 2016. Earnings from
the U.S. Downstream were $1,948 million, including favorable U.S. tax
reform impacts of $618 million. Non‑U.S. Downstream earnings were $3,649 million,
compared to $3,107 million in the prior year.
 
2016 
Downstream earnings of $4,201 million
decreased $2,356 million from 2015. Weaker refining and marketing margins
decreased earnings by $3.8 billion, while volume and mix effects increased
earnings by $560 million. All other items increased earnings by $920 million,
mainly reflecting gains from divestments, notably in Canada. Petroleum product
sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 272,000 barrels per day
lower than 2015 mainly reflecting the divestment of refineries in California
and Louisiana. U.S. Downstream earnings were $1,094 million, a decrease of
$807 million from 2015. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $3,107 million,

Total
cash and cash equivalents were $3.2 billion at the end of 2017, down $0.5
billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2017 were net income
including noncontrolling interests of $19.8 billion, the adjustment for the
noncash provision of $19.9 billion for depreciation and depletion,
proceeds from asset sales of $3.1 billion, and other investing activities
including collection of advances of $2.1 billion. The major uses of funds included
spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $15.4 billion,
dividends to shareholders of $13.0 billion, the adjustment for noncash deferred
income tax credits of $8.6 billion, and additional investments and advances of
$5.5 billion. 
Total
cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion at the end of 2016, essentially in
line with the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2016 were net income
including noncontrolling interests of $8.4 billion, the adjustment for the
noncash provision of $22.3 billion for depreciation and depletion,
proceeds from asset sales of $4.3 billion, and a net debt increase of $4.3
billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $16.2 billion, dividends to shareholders of
$12.5 billion, the adjustment for noncash deferred income tax credits of
$4.4 billion, and a change in working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $1.4
billion. 
The
Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term
liquidity. Internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial
requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required. On
December 31, 2017, the Corporation had unused committed short-term lines of credit
of $5.4 billion and unused committed long-term lines of credit of
$0.2 billion. Cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the
Corporation’s immediate needs is carefully managed through counterparty quality
and investment guidelines to ensure it is secure and readily available to meet
the Corporation’s cash requirements, and to optimize returns. 
To
support cash flows in future periods the Corporation will need to continually
find or acquire and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new
technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or
increase production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the
nature of oil and gas fields eventually to produce at declining rates for the
remainder of their economic life. Averaged over all the Corporation’s existing
oil and gas fields and without new projects, ExxonMobil’s production is
expected to decline at an average of approximately 3 percent per year over the
next few years. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a
number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid
properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field.
Furthermore, the Corporation’s net interest in production for individual fields
can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms. 

47 



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

The Corporation has long been successful
at offsetting the effects of natural field decline through disciplined
investments in quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation
anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing
additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to
year due to the timing of individual project start‑ups; operational
outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects;
regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales;
weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; and changes in
the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas
price environment. The Corporation’s cash flows are also highly dependent on
crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors
for a more complete discussion of risks. 
The
Corporation’s financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital
expenditures. Capital and exploration expenditures in 2017 were $23.1 billion,
reflecting the Corporation’s continued active investment program. The
Corporation anticipates an investment level of $24 billion in 2018.
Actual
spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and
property acquisitions. The Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of
development projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the
overall political and technical risks of the Corporation’s Upstream segment and
associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength, debt capacity and
diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay
of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation’s
liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its
fixed commitments.
 
Cash Flow from
Operating Activities
 
2017 
Cash provided by operating activities
totaled $30.1 billion in 2017, $8.0 billion higher than 2016. The major source
of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $19.8 billion, an
increase of $11.5 billion. The noncash provision for depreciation and depletion
was $19.9 billion, down $2.4 billion from the prior year. The adjustment for
deferred income tax credits was $8.6 billion, compared to $4.4 billion in 2016.
Changes in operational working capital, excluding cash and debt, decreased cash
in 2017 by $0.6 billion.
 
2016 
Cash provided by operating activities
totaled $22.1 billion in 2016, $8.3 billion lower than 2015. The major source
of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $8.4 billion, a
decrease of $8.2 billion. The noncash provision for depreciation and depletion
was $22.3 billion, up $4.3 billion from the prior year. The adjustment for net
gains on asset sales was $1.7 billion while the adjustment for deferred income
tax credits was $4.4 billion. Changes in operational working capital, excluding
cash and debt, decreased cash in 2016 by $1.4 billion.



Cash Flow from
Investing Activities
 
2017
Cash used in
investing activities netted to $15.7 billion in 2017, $3.3 billion higher than
2016. Spending for property, plant and equipment of $15.4 billion decreased
$0.8 billion from 2016. Proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries,
property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments of $3.1
billion compared to $4.3 billion in 2016. Additional investments and advances
were $4.1 billion higher in 2017, while proceeds from other investing
activities including collection of advances increased by $1.2 billion.
 
2016 
Cash used in investing activities netted to $12.4 billion
in 2016, $11.4 billion lower than 2015. Spending for property, plant and
equipment of $16.2 billion decreased $10.3 billion from 2015. Proceeds
associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales
and returns of investments of $4.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion in 2015.
Additional investments and advances were $0.8 billion higher in 2016.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 
2017 
Cash
used in financing activities was $15.1 billion in 2017, $5.8 billion higher
than 2016. Dividend payments on common shares increased to $3.06 per share from
$2.98 per share and totaled $13.0 billion. Total debt decreased $0.4 billion to
$42.3 billion at year‑end. The reduction was principally driven by net
repayments of $1.0 billion, and included short-term debt repayments of $5.0
billion that were partly offset by additions in commercial paper and other debt
of $4.0 billion.
ExxonMobil
share of equity increased $20.4 billion to $187.7 billion. The addition to
equity for earnings was $19.7 billion. This was partly offset by reductions for
distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $13.0 billion, all in the form of
dividends. Foreign exchange translation effects of $5.0 billion for the weaker
U.S. currency and a $1.0 billion change in the funded status of the
postretirement benefits reserves both increased equity. Shares issued for
acquisitions added $7.8 billion to equity. 
During 2017, Exxon Mobil Corporation acquired
10 million shares of its common stock for the treasury. Purchases were made to offset
shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with the company’s
benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding increased from 4,148 million to
4,239 million at the end of 2017, mainly due to a total of 96 million shares
issued for the acquisitions of InterOil Corporation and of companies that hold
acreage in the Permian basin.
 
2016 
Cash
used in financing activities was $9.3 billion in 2016, $2.3 billion higher than
2015. Dividend payments on common shares increased to $2.98 per share from
$2.88 per share and totaled $12.5 billion. Total debt increased $4.1 billion to
$42.8 billion at year‑end. The first quarter issuance of $12.0 billion in
long-term debt was partly offset by repayments of $8.0 billion in commercial
paper and other short-term debt during the year.
ExxonMobil
share of equity decreased $3.5 billion to $167.3 billion. The addition to
equity for earnings was $7.8 billion. This was offset by reductions for
distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $12.5 billion, all in the form of
dividends. Foreign exchange translation effects of $0.3 billion for the
stronger U.S. currency reduced equity, while a $1.6 billion change in the
funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves increased equity. 
During 2016, Exxon Mobil Corporation acquired
12 million shares of its common stock for the treasury. Purchases were made to offset
shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with the company’s benefit
plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from 4,156 million to 4,148
million at the end of 2016.

This
table excludes commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no
fixed or minimum price) which are resold shortly after purchase, either in an
active, highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts
with similar pricing terms. Examples include long-term, noncancelable LNG and
natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refinery products
at market prices. Inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in
assessing liquidity and cash flow, because these purchases will be offset in
the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions. The
table also excludes unrecognized tax benefits totaling $8.8 billion as of
December 31, 2017, because the Corporation is unable to make reasonably
reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing
authorities. Further details on the unrecognized tax benefits can be found in “Note
19: Income and Other Taxes”.
Notes: 
(1)   Includes capitalized lease
obligations of $1,327 million. 
(2)   The amount due in one year is
included in Notes and loans payable of $17,930 million. 
(3)   Asset retirement obligations are
primarily upstream asset removal costs at the completion of field life. 
(4)   The amount by which the benefit
obligations exceeded the fair value of fund assets for certain U.S. and
non-U.S. pension and other postretirement plans at year-end. The payments by
period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in 2018 and
estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years. 
(5)   Minimum commitments for operating
leases, shown on an undiscounted basis, cover drilling equipment, tankers,
service stations and other properties. Total includes $611 million related to
drilling rigs and related equipment.
(6)   Take-or-pay obligations are noncancelable,
long-term commitments for goods and services. Unconditional purchase
obligations are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or
cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to
secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or
services. The undiscounted obligations of $26,491 million mainly pertain to
pipeline, manufacturing supply and terminal agreements. 
(7)   Firm capital commitments represent
legally binding payment obligations to third parties where agreements
specifying all significant terms have been executed for the construction and
purchase of fixed assets and other permanent investments. In certain cases
where the Corporation executes contracts requiring commitments to a work scope,
those commitments have been included to the extent that the amounts and timing
of payments can be reliably estimated. Firm capital commitments, shown on an
undiscounted basis, totaled $9.6 billion, including $1.9 billion in the U.S.
Firm capital commitments for the non-U.S. Upstream of $7.2 billion were
primarily associated with projects in the United Arab Emirates, Africa, United
Kingdom, Guyana, Malaysia, Norway, Canada and Australia. The Corporation
expects to fund the majority of these commitments with internally generated
funds, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

Guarantees 
The Corporation and certain of its consolidated
subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2017, for guarantees
relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts (Note 16). Where
guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not
include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum
potential exposure. These guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources. 
 
Financial Strength 
On December 31, 2017, the
Corporation’s unused short-term committed lines of credit totaled $5.4 billion
(Note 6) and unused long-term committed lines of credit totaled $0.2 billion
(Note 14). The table below shows the Corporation’s fixed-charge coverage
and consolidated debt-to-capital ratios. The data demonstrates the
Corporation’s creditworthiness.

Management views the Corporation’s
financial strength, as evidenced by the above financial ratios and other
similar measures, to be a competitive advantage of strategic importance. The
Corporation’s sound financial position gives it the opportunity to access the
world’s capital markets in the full range of market conditions, and enables the
Corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in the pursuit of
maximizing shareholder value. 
 
Litigation and Other Contingencies 
As
discussed in Note 16, a variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Based
on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation
does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against
ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation’s
operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.
There are no events or uncertainties beyond those already included in reported
financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating
results or financial condition. Refer to Note 16 for additional information on
legal proceedings and other contingencies.

Capital
and exploration expenditures in 2017 were $23.1 billion, as the Corporation
continued to pursue opportunities to find and produce new supplies of oil and
natural gas to meet global demand for energy. The Corporation anticipates an investment
level of $24 billion in 2018. Actual spending could vary depending on the
progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.
Upstream
spending of $16.7 billion in 2017 was up 15 percent from 2016. Investments in
2017 included acquisitions in Mozambique and Brazil, U.S. onshore drilling activity
and global development projects. Development projects typically take several
years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of
production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. The
percentage of proved developed reserves was 66 percent of total proved reserves
at year‑end 2017, and has been over 60 percent for the last ten years.
Capital
investments in the Downstream totaled $2.5 billion in 2017, consistent with 2016,
reflecting global refining project spending. Chemical capital expenditures of $3.8
billion increased $1.6 billion from 2016 mainly resulting from the acquisition
of a large-scale aromatics plant in Singapore.

2017 
Total taxes on the Corporation’s income
statement were $31.3 billion in 2017, an increase of $0.3 billion from 2016.
Income tax expense, both current and deferred, was a credit of $1.2 billion
compared to a credit of $0.4 billion in 2016, with the U.S. tax reform impact
of $5.9 billion partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The effective tax
rate, which is calculated based on consolidated company income taxes and
ExxonMobil’s share of equity company income taxes, was 5 percent compared to 13
percent in the prior year due primarily to the impact of U.S. tax reform. Total
other taxes and duties of $32.5 billion in 2017 increased $1.1 billion.
 
2016 
Total
taxes were $31.0 billion in 2016, a decrease of $7.2 billion from 2015. Income
tax expense, both current and deferred, was a credit of $0.4 billion, $5.8
billion lower than 2015, reflecting lower pre-tax income. The effective tax
rate, which is calculated based on consolidated company income taxes and
ExxonMobil’s share of equity company income taxes, was 13 percent compared to
34 percent in the prior year due primarily to a lower share of earnings in
higher tax jurisdictions, favorable one-time items, and the impact of the U.S.
Upstream impairment charge. Total other taxes and duties of $31.4 billion in
2016 decreased $1.5 billion.
 
U.S.
Tax Reform
Following
the December 22, 2017, enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in
accordance with Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740 (Income Taxes)
and following the guidance outlined in the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118, the Corporation has included reasonable estimates of the income tax
effects of the changes in tax law and tax rate. These include amounts for the remeasurement
of the deferred income tax balance from the reduction in the corporate tax rate
from 35 to 21 percent and the mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed
foreign earnings and profits. ExxonMobil’s significant historical investments
in the United States have created large deferred income tax liabilities.
Remeasurement of these deferred income tax liabilities from the 35 percent rate
to 21 percent results in a one-time non-cash benefit to earnings. The
Corporation has paid taxes on earnings outside the United States at tax rates
on average above the historical U.S. rate of 35 percent. As a result, the
deemed repatriation tax does not create a significant tax impact for
ExxonMobil. The impact of tax law changes on the Corporation’s financial
statements could differ from its estimates due to further analysis of the new
law, regulatory guidance, technical corrections legislation, or guidance under
U.S. GAAP. If significant changes occur, the Corporation will provide updated
information in connection with future regulatory filings.
The 21 percent corporate tax rate will
reduce the tax cost of U.S. earnings from U.S. investments, although the
savings may be somewhat offset by other provisions that could raise the
Corporation’s future tax liability. Within the normal course of business, other
provisions of the tax law that are effective in 2018 are not expected to have a
material effect on operating results or financial condition.

Throughout
ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and
minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground. These
include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to
manufacture clean fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce
nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for
asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by
the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2017 worldwide environmental
expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including
ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenditures, were $4.7 billion, of
which $3.3 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital
expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to increase to
approximately $5 billion in 2018 and 2019. Capital expenditures are
expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total.
Environmental Liabilities 
The Corporation accrues environmental
liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the
amounts can be reasonably estimated. This policy applies to assets or
businesses currently owned or previously disposed. ExxonMobil has accrued
liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various
sites, including multiparty sites where the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency has identified ExxonMobil as one of the potentially responsible parties.
The involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty
sites could mitigate ExxonMobil’s actual joint and several liability exposure.
At present, no individual site is expected to have losses material to
ExxonMobil’s operations or financial condition. Consolidated company provisions
made in 2017 for environmental liabilities were $302 million ($665 million
in 2016) and the balance sheet reflects accumulated liabilities of $872 million
as of December 31, 2017, and $852 million as of December 31, 2016.

Crude
oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in
response to changing market forces. The impacts of these price fluctuations on
earnings from Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations have varied. In the
Upstream, a $1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized
price of oil would have approximately a $425 million annual after-tax effect on
Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings. Similarly, a $0.10 per thousand
cubic feet change in the worldwide average gas realization would have
approximately a $165 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated
plus equity company earnings. For any given period, the extent of actual
benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual
types of crude oil, taxes and other government take impacts, price adjustment
lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes.
Accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only
provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any
particular period. 
In
the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings are
primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of
products sold. Refining margins are a function of the difference between what a
refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices
for the range of products produced. These prices in turn depend on global and
regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations,
import/export balances and weather. 

 

53 



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

The global
energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are
adverse to one or more of the Corporation’s businesses. Such conditions, along
with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times
associated with many of our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining
a strong financial position. Management views the Corporation’s financial
strength as a competitive advantage. 
In
general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell and/or
purchase products to/from other segments. Instead, where such sales take place,
they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of integrated
refinery/chemical complexes. Additionally, intersegment sales are at
market-based prices. The products bought and sold between segments can also be
acquired in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity and
transportation capabilities. About 35 percent of the Corporation’s intersegment
sales represent Upstream production sold to the Downstream. Other intersegment
sales include those between refineries and chemical plants related to raw
materials, feedstocks and finished products. 
Although
price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over
the short to medium term due to global economic conditions, political events, decisions
by OPEC and other major government resource owners and other factors, industry
economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and
demand. Accordingly, the Corporation evaluates the viability of its major investments
over a range of prices.
The
Corporation has an active asset management program in which underperforming
assets are either improved to acceptable levels or considered for divestment.
The asset management program includes a disciplined, regular review to ensure
that all assets are contributing to the Corporation’s strategic objectives
resulting in an efficient capital base. 
 
Risk Management 
The
Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the
complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce
the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates, currency
rates and commodity prices. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based
contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and for
trading purposes. Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative
position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative
clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative
counterparties. The Corporation believes that there are no material market or
credit risks to the Corporation’s financial position, results of operations or
liquidity as a result of the derivatives described in Note 13. The Corporation
maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and
monitoring of derivative activity. 
The
Corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on its
short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating
interest rates. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates
affecting the Corporation’s debt would not be material to earnings, cash flow
or fair value. The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term
and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the
majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term
debt. Some joint-venture partners are dependent on the credit markets, and
their funding ability may impact the development pace of joint-venture
projects. 
The
Corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to
exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses, financing and
investment transactions. Fluctuations in exchange rates are often offsetting
and the impacts on ExxonMobil’s geographically and functionally diverse
operations are varied. The Corporation makes limited use of currency exchange
contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, and exposures
related to the Corporation’s limited use of the currency exchange contracts are
not material. 
 
Inflation and Other Uncertainties 
The
general rate of inflation in many major countries of operation has remained
moderate over the past few years, and the associated impact on non-energy costs
has generally been mitigated by cost reductions from efficiency and
productivity improvements. Beginning several years ago, an extended period of
increased demand for certain services and materials resulted in higher
operating and capital costs. Since then, multiple market changes, including
lower oil prices and reduced upstream industry activity, have contributed to
lower prices for oilfield services and materials. The Corporation monitors
market trends and works to minimize costs in all commodity price environments through
its economies of scale in global procurement and its efficient project
management practices.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
Effective January 1, 2018, ExxonMobil adopted
the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s standard, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, as amended. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry and
transaction specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The
standard was adopted using the Modified Retrospective method, under which prior
year results are not restated, but supplemental information on the impact of
the new standard must be provided for 2018 results, if material. The standard
is not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial
statements. The cumulative effect of adoption of the new standard is de
minimis.
Effective
January 1, 2018, ExxonMobil adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
Update, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The standard
requires investments in equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries
and equity method investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the
fair value recognized through net income. Companies can elect a modified
approach for equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair
value. The standard is not expected to have a material impact on the
Corporation’s financial statements.
Effective
January 1, 2018, ExxonMobil adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
Update, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the
Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement
Benefit Cost. The update requires the service cost component of net benefit
costs to be reported in the same line of the income statement as other compensation
costs and the other components of net benefit costs (non-service costs) to be
presented separately from the service cost component. Additionally, only the
service cost component of net benefit costs is eligible for capitalization. The
Corporation expects to add a new line “Non-service pension and postretirement
benefit expense” to its Consolidated Statement of Income and expects to include
all of these costs in its Corporate and financing segment. This line would
reflect the non-service costs that were previously included in “Production and
manufacturing expenses” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses”. The
update is not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial
statements. 
Effective
January 1, 2019, ExxonMobil will adopt the Financial Accounting Standards
Board’s standard, Leases. The standard requires all leases with an
initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance sheet as an asset
and a lease liability. The Corporation is gathering and evaluating data and
recently acquired a system to facilitate implementation. We are progressing an
assessment of the magnitude of the effect on the Corporation’s financial
statements.
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
The Corporation’s accounting and financial
reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving the
extracting, refining and marketing of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based
products. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. The Corporation’s accounting policies are summarized in Note 1. 
 
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves 
The
estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical
evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well
information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, among other
factors. The estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the Corporation
through long-standing approval guidelines. Reserve changes are made within a
well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and
engineering professionals, assisted by the Global Reserves group which has
significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by
senior management. Notably, the Corporation does not use specific quantitative
reserve targets to determine compensation. Key features of the reserve
estimation process are covered in Disclosure of Reserves in Item 2. 
Oil and natural
gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves. 
·        
Proved oil and natural gas
reserves are determined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) requirements. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas
which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and
operating conditions and government regulations. Proved reserves are determined
using the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices during the
reporting year.
Proved
reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves.
Proved developed reserves include amounts which are expected to be recovered
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved
undeveloped reserves include amounts expected to be recovered from new wells on
undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major
expenditure is required for completion. Proved undeveloped reserves are
recognized only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that the
reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific
circumstances support a longer period of time.

55 



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

The percentage of proved developed reserves was 66
percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2017 (including both consolidated
and equity company reserves), a reduction from 69 percent in 2016, and has been
over 60 percent for the last ten years. Although the Corporation is reasonably
certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered
can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development
projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policy,
consumer preferences and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas
prices.
·        
Unproved reserves are quantities
of oil and natural gas with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability
and include probable reserves. Probable reserves are reserves that, together
with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 
Revisions in previously estimated volumes of proved
reserves for existing fields can occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation
of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data,
(2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the
average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are
used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant
changes in development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity. 
Unit-of-Production
Depreciation
Oil and
natural gas reserve quantities are used as the basis to calculate
unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets. Depreciation is
calculated by taking the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves or proved
developed reserves applied to actual production. The volumes produced and asset
cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject
to some variability. 
In the event
that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation
of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is
used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected
life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying
reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural
gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses
straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end
of its useful life.
To the extent that proved reserves for a property are
substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the
resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of
cost over the expected life, assets will be depreciated using a
unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC
price which results in a more meaningful quantity of proved reserves,
appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes. The effect of this
approach on the Corporation’s 2018 depreciation expense versus 2017 is
anticipated to be immaterial.
Impairment
The
Corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability on an ongoing
basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may
not be recoverable. Among the events or changes in circumstances which could
indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be
recoverable are the following:
·        
a significant decrease in the
market price of a long-lived asset;
·        
a significant adverse change in
the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical
condition including a significant decrease in current and projected reserve
volumes;
·        
a significant adverse change in
legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
·        
an accumulation of project costs
significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;
·        
a current-period operating loss
combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and
·        
a current expectation that, more
likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of
significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
Asset
valuation analyses performed as part of its asset management program and other
profitability reviews assist the Corporation in assessing whether events or
circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be
recoverable.
In
general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an
indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term
must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global
demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices
over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand
fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is
declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new
discoveries, field developments and technology and efficiency advancements.
OPEC investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world
oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic
activities and levels of prosperity. Because the lifespans of the vast majority
of the Corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the value of these
assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity prices and
production costs. During the lifespan of these major assets, the Corporation
expects that oil and gas prices will experience significant volatility, and
consequently these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and
periods of lower earnings, or even losses.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

In assessing whether the events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable,
the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of
its longer-term view of prices. While near-term prices are subject to wide
fluctuations, longer-term price views are more stable and meaningful for
purposes of assessing future cash flows.
When
the industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in commodity prices,
the market supply and demand conditions may result in changes to the
Corporation’s long-term price or margin assumptions it uses for its capital
investment decisions. To the extent those changes result in a significant
reduction to its long-term oil price, natural gas price or margin ranges, the
Corporation may consider that situation, in conjunction with other events and
changes in circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an indicator of
potential impairment for certain assets.
In the
Upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the
Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities
is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices. These
prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the
Corporation’s long-term price assumptions which are used for impairment
assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide
a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the
development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its
oil and gas reserves and therefore does not consider it relevant in determining
whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment
assessment.
If
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of
the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In
performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which
there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments
are based on the Corporation’s assumptions which are developed in the annual
planning and budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria management
uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the
Corporation’s assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural
gas commodity prices, refining and chemical margins, volumes, costs, and
foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on projected field and
facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Where unproved reserves
exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included
in the evaluation. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the
effects of derivative instruments.
An asset
group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the
asset’s carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is based on market prices if an
active market exists for the asset group, or discounted cash flows using a
discount rate commensurate with the risk. Significant unproved properties are
assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the
capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of
success and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the
properties. Properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by
groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period. 
The Corporation has a robust process
to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups
throughout the year. This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360
and relies in part on the Corporation’s planning and budgeting cycle. As part
of its 2017 annual planning and budgeting cycle, the Corporation identified
emerging trends such as increasing estimates of available natural gas supplies
and ongoing reductions in the industry’s costs of supply for natural gas that
resulted in a reduction to the Corporation’s long-term natural gas price
outlooks. Based in part on these trends, the Corporation concluded that events
and circumstances indicated that the carrying value of certain long-lived
assets, notably North America natural gas assets and certain other assets
across the remainder of its Upstream operations, may not be recoverable.
Accordingly, an impairment assessment was performed which indicated that the
vast majority of asset groups assessed have future undiscounted cash flow estimates
that exceed their carrying values. However, the carrying values for certain
asset groups in the United States exceeded the estimated cash flows. As a
result, the Corporation’s fourth quarter 2017 results include an after-tax
charge of $0.5 billion to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair
value. The asset groups subject to this impairment charge are primarily dry gas
operations with little additional development potential. In addition, the
Corporation made a decision to cease development planning activities and
further allocation of capital to certain non-producing assets outside the
United States. The Corporation’s fourth quarter 2017 results include an
after-tax charge of $0.8 billion to reduce the carrying value of those assets. Other
impairments during the year resulted in an after-tax charge of $0.2 billion.
The
assessment of fair values required the use of Level 3 inputs and assumptions
that are based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal
parameters used to establish fair values included estimates of both proved and
unproved reserves, future commodity prices which were consistent with the
average of third-party industry experts and government agencies, drilling and
development costs, discount rates ranging from 5.5 percent to 8 percent
depending on the characteristics of the asset group, and comparable market
transactions. Factors which could put further assets at risk of impairment in
the future include reductions in the Corporation’s long-term price outlooks, changes
in the allocation of capital, and operating cost increases which exceed the
pace of efficiencies or the pace of oil and natural gas price increases.
However, due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future 

57 



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

commodity prices, and the relationship between industry
prices and costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or
range of any potential future impairment charges related to the Corporation’s
long-lived assets.
 
Inventories
Crude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried
at the lower of current market value or cost (generally determined under the
last-in, first-out method – LIFO). 
 
Asset Retirement Obligations 
The Corporation incurs retirement
obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are
recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the
assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses
assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal
obligation for an asset retirement obligation; technical assessments of the
assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements; discount rates; and
inflation rates. Asset retirement obligations are disclosed in Note 9 to the
financial statements. 
 
Suspended Exploratory Well Costs 
The Corporation continues capitalization
of exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the Corporation is
making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and
operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these
criteria are charged to expense. The facts and circumstances that support
continued capitalization of suspended wells at year-end are disclosed in Note
10 to the financial statements. 
 
Consolidations 
The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the
Corporation controls. They also include the Corporation’s share of the
undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. Amounts representing the Corporation’s interest in entities that it
does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in companies that are
partially owned by the Corporation are integral to the Corporation’s
operations. In some cases they serve to balance worldwide risks, and in others
they provide the only available means of entry into a particular market or area
of interest. The other parties, who also have an equity interest in these
companies, are either independent third parties or host governments that share
in the business results according to their ownership. The Corporation does not
invest in these companies in order to remove liabilities from its balance
sheet. In fact, the Corporation has long been on record supporting an
alternative accounting method that would require each investor to consolidate
its share of all assets and liabilities in these partially-owned companies
rather than only its interest in net equity. This method of accounting for
investments in partially-owned companies is not permitted by U.S. GAAP except
where the investments are in the direct ownership of a share of upstream assets
and liabilities. However, for purposes of calculating return on average capital
employed, which is not covered by U.S. GAAP standards, the Corporation includes
its share of debt of these partially-owned companies in the determination of
average capital employed. 
 
Pension Benefits 
The
Corporation and its affiliates sponsor nearly 100 defined benefit (pension)
plans in over 40 countries. The Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits footnote
(Note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension
expense. 
Some
of these plans (primarily non-U.S.) provide pension benefits that are paid
directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of corporate cash flow rather than
a separate pension fund because applicable tax rules and regulatory practices
do not encourage advance funding. Book reserves are established for these
plans. The portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is
expensed as services are rendered. The portion attributable to the increase in
pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed over the term of the
obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. The primary difference in
pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for
funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on fund
assets.
For
funded plans, including those in the U.S., pension obligations are financed in
advance through segregated assets or insurance arrangements. These plans are
managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and
meet or exceed required funding levels as measured by relevant actuarial and
government standards at the mandated measurement dates. In determining
liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require
approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting purposes.


58 



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

The Corporation will continue to make
contributions to these funded plans as necessary. All defined-benefit pension
obligations, regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are fully
supported by the financial strength of the Corporation or the respective
sponsoring affiliate. 
Pension
accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term
expected earnings rate on fund assets, the discount rate for the benefit
obligations and the long-term rate for future salary increases. Pension
assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management.
These assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market
rates and outlook. The long-term expected earnings rate on U.S. pension plan
assets in 2017 was 6.50 percent. The 10‑year and 20‑year actual
returns on U.S. pension plan assets were 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively.
The Corporation establishes the long‑term expected rate of return by
developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund
asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for
the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is
then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation
percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. A
worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets
would increase annual pension expense by approximately $170 million before tax.

Differences between actual returns on fund
assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense
in the year that the difference occurs. Such differences are deferred, along
with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension expense
over the expected remaining service life of employees. 
 
Litigation Contingencies 
A
variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has
regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside
counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these
contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16. 
The
Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the
incurrence of a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These
amounts are not reduced by amounts that may be recovered under insurance or
claims against third parties, but undiscounted receivables from insurers or
other third parties may be accrued separately. The Corporation revises such
accruals in light of new information. For contingencies where an unfavorable
outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation
discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the
possible loss. For purposes of our litigation contingency disclosures,
“significant” includes material matters as well as other items which management
believes should be disclosed. 
Management judgment is required related to
contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult
to predict. However, the Corporation has been successful in defending
litigation in the past. Payments have not had a material adverse effect on
operations or financial condition. In the Corporation’s experience, large
claims often do not result in large awards. Large awards are often reversed or
substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement. 
 
Tax Contingencies 
The
Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the
world. Significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income
tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to
predict. 
The benefits of uncertain tax positions
that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are
recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more
likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities.
For a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the
financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50
percent likely of being realized. A reserve is established for the difference
between a position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and
the amount recognized in the financial statements. The Corporation’s
unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in
Note 19.
 
Foreign
Currency Translation 
The
method of translating the foreign currency financial statements of the
Corporation’s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars is prescribed by
GAAP. Under these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency
of these subsidiaries. The functional currency is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Management selects the
functional currency after evaluating this economic environment. 
Factors considered by management when
determining the functional currency for a subsidiary include the currency used
for cash flows related to individual assets and liabilities; the responsiveness
of sales prices to changes in exchange rates; the history of inflation in the
country; whether sales are into local markets or exported; the currency used to
acquire raw materials, labor, services and supplies; sources of financing; and
significance of intercompany transactions.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
 

 

 Management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive
Officer, Principal Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting Officer, is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the
Corporation’s financial reporting. Management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Exxon Mobil Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2017. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the
effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2017, as stated in their report included in the Financial

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Exxon Mobil Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Exxon Mobil Corporation and its subsidiaries (the
“Corporation”) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including
the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements”). We also have audited the Corporation's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, in 2017 the Corporation changed the manner in which it
accounts for certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with
revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of
governmental authorities.                
Basis for Opinions
The Corporation's management is
responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Corporation’s consolidated financial
statements and on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are
required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud,
and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects. 
Our audits of the consolidated financial
statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 

Definition
and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

 

 The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and the supporting and
supplemental material are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil
Corporation. 
The
Corporation’s principal business is energy, involving the worldwide
exploration, production, transportation and sale of crude oil and natural gas
(Upstream) and the manufacture, transportation and sale of petroleum products
(Downstream). The Corporation is also a major worldwide manufacturer and
marketer of petrochemicals (Chemical). 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. Prior years’ data has been reclassified in certain cases
to conform to the 2017 presentation basis. 
 
1.
Summary of Accounting Policies 
Principles of Consolidation
The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the
Corporation controls. They also include the Corporation’s share of the
undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. Amounts representing the Corporation’s interest in entities that it
does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are
included in “Investments, advances and long-term receivables”. The
Corporation’s share of the net income of these companies is included in the
Consolidated Statement of Income caption “Income from equity affiliates”. 
Majority
ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which
subsidiaries are consolidated. However, certain factors may indicate that a
majority-owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. These factors occur where the
minority shareholders are granted by law or by contract substantive
participating rights. These include the right to approve operating policies,
expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and management compensation
and succession plans. 
Evidence of
loss in value that might indicate impairment of investments in companies
accounted for on the equity method is assessed to determine if such evidence
represents a loss in value of the Corporation’s investment that is other than
temporary. Examples of key indicators include a history of operating losses,
negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil
and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee’s
business segment or geographic region. If evidence of an other than temporary
loss in fair value below carrying amount is determined, an impairment is
recognized. In the absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash
flows are used to assess fair value. 
The
Corporation’s share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment
for equity method investments is reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income. 
Revenue Recognition
The
Corporation generally sells crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical
products under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. In some cases
(e.g., natural gas), products may be sold under long-term agreements, with
periodic price adjustments. Revenues are recognized when the products are
delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the
risks and rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. 
Revenues
from the production of natural gas properties in which the Corporation has an
interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of the Corporation’s
net working interest. Differences between actual production and net working
interest volumes are not significant. 
Purchases
and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in
contemplation of one another are combined and recorded as exchanges measured at
the book value of the item sold. 
Taxes on Sales Transactions
Beginning in
2017, the Corporation revised its reporting of certain sales and value-added
taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with
customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities (sales-based
taxes). This changes reporting of sales-based taxes from gross reporting
(included in both “Sales and other operating revenue” and “Sales-based taxes”)
to net reporting (excluded from both “Sales and other operating revenue” and
“Sales-based taxes”) in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This change in
reporting was applied retrospectively and does not affect earnings. Similar
taxes, for which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the
government, continue to be reported on a gross basis.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Derivative Instruments
The
Corporation has the ability to use derivative instruments to offset exposures
associated with commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates that arise from existing assets, liabilities and forecasted transactions.
The gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives
are recorded in income. 
The
Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
For fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting
loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized in current earnings. For cash
flow hedges, the effective part of the hedge is initially reported as a
component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into
earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings, and
the ineffective part of the hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. 
Fair Value
Fair value
is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy
Levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. Hierarchy Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that
are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy
Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.
Inventories
Crude oil,
products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market
value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method –
LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including
depreciation) directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its
existing condition and location. Selling expenses and general and
administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from
inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or
less. 
Property, Plant and Equipment
Cost
Basis. The Corporation uses the
“successful efforts” method to account for its exploration and production
activities. Under this method, costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis.
Costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property (whether
unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are
carried as an asset when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves
to justify its completion as a producing well and where the Corporation is
making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and
operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these
criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including
geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred.
Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes,
are capitalized. 
Depreciation,
Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation,
depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the
unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on
estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration. 
Acquisition
costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method,
computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized
exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive
depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production
rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas that are
estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating
methods. Under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas volumes are
considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody
transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field
storage tank. In the event that the unit-of-production method does not result
in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset,
an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited
situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate
with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the
production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as
such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is
fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.
To the
extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that
property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge does
not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life, assets
will be depreciated using a unit-of-production method based on reserves
determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful quantity
of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes.

Investments
in refinery, chemical process, and lubes basestock manufacturing equipment are
generally depreciated on a straight‑line basis over a 25-year life.
Service station buildings and fixed improvements generally are depreciated over
a 20-year life. Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance,
are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and
the assets replaced are retired.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Impairment Assessment. The Corporation tests assets or groups of assets for
recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Among the events or changes
in circumstances which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or
asset group may not be recoverable are the following:
·        
a significant decrease in the
market price of a long-lived asset;
·        
a significant adverse change in
the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical
condition including a significant decrease in current and projected reserve
volumes;
·        
a significant adverse change in
legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
·        
an accumulation of project costs
significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;
·        
a current-period operating loss
combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and
·        
a current expectation that, more
likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of
significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
Asset
valuation analyses performed as part of its asset management program and other
profitability reviews assist the Corporation in assessing whether events or
circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be
recoverable.
In
general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an
indication of impairment. Management believes that prices over the long term
must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global
demand. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices
over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand
fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining.
This is being offset by investments to generate production from new
discoveries, field developments and technology and efficiency advancements.
OPEC investment activities and production policies also have an impact on world
oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of general economic
activities and levels of prosperity. Because the lifespans of the vast majority
of the Corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the value of these
assets is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity prices and
production costs. During the lifespan of these major assets, the Corporation
expects that oil and gas prices will experience significant volatility, and
consequently these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods
of lower earnings, or even losses. In assessing whether the events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in
the context of its longer-term view of prices. While near-term prices are
subject to wide fluctuations, longer-term price views are more stable and
meaningful for purposes of assessing future cash flows.
When the
industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in commodity prices, the
market supply and demand conditions may result in changes to the Corporation’s
long-term price or margin assumptions it uses for its capital investment
decisions. To the extent those changes result in a significant reduction to its
long-term oil price, natural gas price or margin ranges, the Corporation may
consider that situation, in conjunction with other events and changes in
circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an indicator of potential
impairment for certain assets.

Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production activities
is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices. These
prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the
Corporation’s long-term price assumptions which are used for impairment
assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide
a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the
development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its
oil and gas reserves and therefore does not consider it relevant in determining
whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment
assessment.
If
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of
the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing
this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other
groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on
the Corporation’s assumptions which are developed in the annual planning and
budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to
evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of the
Corporation’s assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural
gas commodity prices, refining and chemical margins, volumes, costs, and
foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on projected field and
facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Where unproved reserves exist,
an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the
evaluation. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of
derivative instruments.
An
asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than
the asset’s carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is based on market prices if an
active market exists for the asset group, or discounted cash flows using a
discount rate commensurate with the risk. Significant unproved properties are
assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the
capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of
success and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the
properties. Properties

that are not individually
significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk
and average holding period. 
Other. Gains on sales of proved and unproved properties are
only recognized when there is neither uncertainty about the recovery of costs
applicable to any interest retained nor any substantial obligation for future
performance by the Corporation. Losses on properties sold are recognized when
incurred or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the
properties is less than the carrying value.
Interest
costs incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase of
multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of acquiring
the constructed assets. The project construction phase commences with the
development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed
assets are ready for their intended use. Capitalized interest costs are
included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service
life of the related assets. 
 
Asset
Retirement Obligations and Environmental Liabilities
The Corporation
incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these
obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is
typically at the time the assets are installed. The costs associated with these
liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated. Over
time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value. 
Liabilities
for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have
been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities
are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties, and projected cash
expenditures are not discounted. 
 
Foreign
Currency Translation
The
Corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international
subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which
each subsidiary operates. 
Downstream
and Chemical operations primarily use the local currency. However, the U.S.
dollar is used in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in
Latin America) and Singapore, which predominantly sells into the U.S. dollar
export market. Upstream operations which are relatively self-contained and
integrated within a particular country, such as Canada, the United Kingdom,
Norway and continental Europe, use the local currency. Some Upstream
operations, primarily in Asia and Africa, use the U.S. dollar because they
predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into U.S.
dollar-denominated markets. 
For all
operations, gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency transactions into
the functional currency are included in income. 
 
Stock-Based
Payments
The
Corporation awards stock-based compensation to employees in the form of
restricted stock and restricted stock units. Compensation expense is measured
by the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over
the requisite service period.

2. Accounting Changes 
Effective December 31, 2017, the Corporation revised its
accounting policy election related to the reporting of certain sales and
value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions
with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities (sales-based
taxes). This changes reporting of sales-based taxes from gross reporting
(included in both “Sales and other operating revenue” and “Sales-based taxes”)
to the preferable method of net reporting (excluded from both “Sales and other
operating revenue” and “Sales-based taxes”) in the Consolidated Statement of
Income. The revised election makes reported revenue more consistent with
ExxonMobil’s role as an agent for the government and is more consistent with
the reporting practices of other international major oil and gas companies and
the largest U.S. companies. This change in accounting principle was applied
retrospectively and does not affect net income attributable to ExxonMobil.
Also effective December 31, 2017, the
Corporation reclassified U.S. Federal excise tax from “Sales-based taxes” to
“Other taxes and duties”. For these taxes ExxonMobil is not considered to be an
agent for the government and these taxes will continue to be reported gross. The
amount reclassified was $3,110 million in 2016 and $3,044 million in 2015. This
change in classification was applied retrospectively and does not affect net
income attributable to ExxonMobil.

Effective January 1, 2018, ExxonMobil adopted
the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s standard, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, as amended. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry and
transaction specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The
standard was adopted using the Modified Retrospective method, under which prior
year results are not restated, but supplemental information on the impact of
the new standard must be provided for 2018 results, if material. The standard
is not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial
statements. The cumulative effect of adoption of the new standard is de
minimis.
Effective
January 1, 2018, ExxonMobil adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
Update, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The standard
requires investments in equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries
and equity method investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the
fair value recognized through net income. Companies can elect a modified
approach for equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair
value. The standard is not expected to have a material impact on the
Corporation’s financial statements.
Effective
January 1, 2018, ExxonMobil adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
Update, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the
Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement
Benefit Cost. The update requires the service cost component of net benefit
costs to be reported in the same line of the income statement as other compensation
costs and the other components of net benefit costs (non-service costs) to be
presented separately from the service cost component. Additionally, only the
service cost component of net benefit costs is eligible for capitalization. The
Corporation expects to add a new line “Non-service pension and postretirement
benefit expense” to its Consolidated Statement of Income and expects to include
all of these costs in its Corporate and financing segment. This line would
reflect the non-service costs that were previously included in “Production and
manufacturing expenses” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses”. The
update is not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial
statements. 
Effective
January 1, 2019, ExxonMobil will adopt the Financial Accounting Standards
Board’s standard, Leases. The standard requires all leases with an
initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance sheet as an asset
and a lease liability. The Corporation is gathering and evaluating data and
recently acquired a system to facilitate implementation. We are progressing an
assessment of the magnitude of the effect on the Corporation’s financial
statements.

5. Cash Flow Information 
The
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides information about changes in cash
and cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less when acquired are classified as cash equivalents. 
For
2017, the “Net (gain) on asset sales” on the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows includes before-tax amounts from the sale of service stations in multiple
countries, Upstream asset transactions in the U.S., and the sale of ExxonMobil’s
operated Upstream business in Norway. For 2016, the number includes before-tax
amounts from the sale of service stations in Canada, the sale of Upstream
properties in the U.S., and the sale of aviation fueling operations across
multiple countries. For 2015, the number includes before-tax amounts from the
sale of service stations in Europe, the sale of Upstream properties in the
U.S., the sale of ExxonMobil’s interests in Chemical and Refining joint
ventures, and the sale of the Torrance refinery. These net gains are reported
in “Other income” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
In
2017, the “Additions/(reductions) in commercial paper, and debt with three
months or less maturity” on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes a
net $121 million repayment of commercial paper with maturity over three months.
The gross amount issued was $3.6 billion, while the gross amount repaid was $3.7
billion. In 2016, the number includes a net $608 million addition of commercial
paper with maturity over three months. The gross amount issued was $3.9
billion, while the gross amount repaid was $3.3 billion. In 2015, the number
includes a net $358 million addition of commercial paper with maturity over
three months. The gross amount issued was $8.1 billion, while the gross amount
repaid was $7.7 billion.
In
2017, the Corporation completed the acquisitions of InterOil Corporation and of
companies that own certain oil and gas properties in the Permian basin and
other assets. These transactions included a significant noncash component.
Additional information is provided in Note 20.
In
2015, ExxonMobil completed an asset exchange that resulted in value received of
approximately $500 million including $100 million in cash. The noncash
portion was not included in the “Sales of subsidiaries, investments, and
property, plant and equipment” or the “All other items-net” lines on the
Statement of Cash Flows. Capital leases of approximately $1 billion were not
included in the “Additions to long-term debt” or “Additions to property, plant
and equipment” lines on the Statement of Cash Flows.

7. Equity Company Information 
The
summarized financial information below includes amounts related to certain
less-than-majority-owned companies and majority-owned subsidiaries where
minority shareholders possess the right to participate in significant
management decisions (see Note 1). These companies are primarily engaged in oil
and gas exploration and production, and natural gas marketing in North America;
natural gas exploration, production and distribution in Europe; and exploration,
production, liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations, refining operations,
petrochemical manufacturing, and fuel sales in Asia and the Middle East. Also
included are several refining, petrochemical manufacturing and marketing
ventures. 
The
share of total equity company revenues from sales to ExxonMobil
consolidated companies was 15 percent, 14 percent and 15 percent in the
years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Corporation’s
ownership in these ventures is in the form of shares in corporate joint
ventures as well as interests in partnerships. Differences between the
company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in
the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to
specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the factors
giving rise to the difference. The amortization of this difference, as
appropriate, is included in “Income from equity affiliates” on the Consolidated
Statement of Income. 
In
2013 and 2014, the Corporation and Rosneft established various entities to
conduct exploration and research activities. In 2014, the European Union and
United States imposed sanctions relating to the Russian energy sector. In the
latter half of 2017, the United States codified and expanded sanctions against
Russia. With respect to the foregoing, the Corporation and its affiliates
continue to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. In late
2017, the Corporation decided to withdraw from these joint ventures. The
Corporation expects it will formally initiate the withdrawal in 2018. The
decision to withdraw resulted in an after-tax loss of $0.2 billion.
In 2017, the Corporation invested about $3
billion to acquire shares in four joint venture companies, resulting in a 25
percent indirect interest in the natural gas-rich Area 4 block offshore
Mozambique. The transaction was completed on December 13, 2017. The investments
are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

The Corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of
potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year. This process
is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and relies in part on the
Corporation’s planning and budgeting cycle. As part of its 2017 annual planning
and budgeting cycle, the Corporation identified emerging trends such as increasing
estimates of available natural gas supplies and ongoing reductions in the
industry’s costs of supply for natural gas that resulted in a reduction to the
Corporation’s long-term natural gas price outlooks. Based in part on these
trends, the Corporation concluded that events and circumstances indicated that
the carrying value of certain long-lived assets, notably North America natural
gas assets and certain other assets across the remainder of its Upstream
operations, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, an impairment assessment was
performed which indicated that the vast majority of asset groups assessed have
future undiscounted cash flow estimates that exceed their carrying values.
However, the carrying values for certain asset groups in the United States
exceeded the estimated cash flows. As a result, the Corporation’s fourth
quarter 2017 results include a before-tax charge of $0.8 billion to reduce the
carrying value of those assets to fair value. The asset groups subject to this
impairment charge are primarily dry gas operations with little additional
development potential. In addition, the Corporation made a decision to cease
development planning activities and further allocation of capital to certain
non-producing assets outside the United States resulting in a before-tax charge
of $0.9 billion to reduce the carrying value of those assets that are included
in Property, Plant and Equipment. Other impairments during the year resulted in
a before-tax charge of $0.3 billion. The impairment charges are recognized primarily
in the line “Depreciation and depletion” on the Consolidated Statement of
Income.
The assessment of fair values required the use of Level 3
inputs and assumptions that are based upon the views of a likely market
participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair values included
estimates of both proved and unproved reserves, future commodity prices which
were consistent with the average of third-party industry experts and government
agencies, drilling and development costs, discount rates ranging from 5.5
percent to 8 percent depending on the characteristics of the asset group, and
comparable market transactions. Factors which could put further assets at risk
of impairment in the future include reductions in the Corporation’s long-term
price outlooks, changes in the allocation of capital, and operating cost
increases which exceed the pace of efficiencies or the pace of oil and natural
gas price increases. However, due to the inherent difficulty in predicting
future commodity prices, and the relationship between industry prices and
costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of
any potential future impairment charges related to the Corporation’s long-lived
assets.
Accumulated
depreciation and depletion totaled $224,555 million at the end of 2017 and $209,691
million at the end of 2016. Interest capitalized in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $749
million, $708 million and $482 million, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Asset Retirement Obligations 
The
Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values
of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which
is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair
value, the Corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of
settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. Asset retirement obligations
incurred in the current period were Level 3 fair value measurements. The costs
associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets
and depreciated as the reserves are produced. Over time, the liabilities are
accreted for the change in their present value. 
Asset
retirement obligations for downstream and chemical facilities generally become
firm at the time the facilities are permanently shut down and dismantled. These
obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil
remediation. However, these sites have indeterminate lives based on plans for
continued operations and as such, the fair value of the conditional legal
obligations cannot be measured, since it is impossible to estimate the future
settlement dates of such obligations.

obligations:

10. Accounting for Suspended Exploratory
Well Costs 
The
Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the
well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing
the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. The term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.
The
following two tables provide details of the changes in the balance of suspended
exploratory well costs as well as an aging summary of those costs.

13. Financial Instruments and Derivatives 
Financial Instruments. The fair value of financial instruments
is determined by reference to observable market data and other valuation
techniques as appropriate. The only category of financial instruments where the
difference between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term
debt. The estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized
lease obligations, was $23.7 billion and $28.0 billion at December 31, 2017,
and 2016, respectively, as compared to recorded book values of $23.1 billion
and $27.7 billion at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
The fair value of long-term debt by
hierarchy level at December 31, 2017, is: Level 1 $23,529 million; Level 2 $170
million; and Level 3 $6 million.
 
Derivative Instruments. The Corporation’s size, strong capital
structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream,
Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide
risk from changes in interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices. In
addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including
derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and for trading purposes. Credit
risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by
several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the
quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The
Corporation believes that there are no material market or credit risks to the
Corporation’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity as a
result of the derivatives. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that
includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.
The
estimated fair value of derivative instruments outstanding and recorded on the
balance sheet was a net liability of $38 million at year-end 2017 and a net liability
of $22 million at year-end 2016. Assets and liabilities associated with
derivatives are usually recorded either in “Other current assets” or “Accounts payable
and accrued liabilities”. 
The
Corporation’s fair value measurement of its derivative instruments use either
Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. 
The
Corporation recognized a before-tax gain or (loss) related to derivative
instruments of $(99) million, $(81) million and $39 million during 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Income statement effects associated with
derivatives are usually recorded either in “Sales and other operating revenue”
or “Crude oil and product purchases”.

14. Long-Term Debt 
At
December 31, 2017, long-term debt consisted of $23,736 million due
in U.S. dollars and $670 million representing the U.S. dollar equivalent
at year-end exchange rates of amounts payable in foreign currencies. These
amounts exclude that portion of long-term debt, totaling $4,766 million, which
matures within one year and is included in current liabilities. The amounts of
long-term debt, including capitalized lease obligations, maturing in each of
the four years after December 31, 2018, in millions of dollars, are: 2019
– $4,045; 2020 – $1,617; 2021 – $2,549; and 2022 – $1,835.
At December 31, 2017, the Corporation’s unused long-term credit lines were $0.2
billion.

15. Incentive Program 
The 2003 Incentive Program provides for
grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and
other forms of award. Awards may be granted to eligible employees of the
Corporation and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned. Outstanding awards
are subject to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award
instrument. Options and SARs may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent
of market value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. The
maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 Incentive
Program is 220 million. Awards that are forfeited, expire or are settled in
cash, do not count against this maximum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does
not have a specified term. New awards may be made until the available shares
are depleted, unless the Board terminates the plan early. At the end of 2017,
remaining shares available for award under the 2003 Incentive Program were 89 million.  
Restricted
Stock and Restricted Stock Units. Awards totaling 8,916 thousand, 9,583 thousand, and 9,681 thousand
of restricted (nonvested) common stock units were granted in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Compensation expense for these awards is based on the price of
the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite
service period. Shares for these awards are issued to employees from treasury
stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their
changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. During the
applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold or
transferred and are subject to forfeiture. The majority of the awards have
graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares and units in each award
vesting after three years and the remaining 50 percent vesting after seven
years. Awards granted to a small number of senior executives have vesting
periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years or
retirement, whichever occurs later, for the remaining 50 percent of the award. 
The
Corporation has purchased shares in the open market and through negotiated
transactions to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with benefit plans and programs. Purchases may be discontinued at any time
without prior notice.
The
following tables summarize information about restricted stock and restricted
stock units for the year ended December 31, 2017.

As of December 31, 2017, there was $2,049
million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested restricted
awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 4.5 years. The compensation cost charged against income for the restricted
stock and restricted stock units was $856 million, $880 million and $855 million
for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The income tax benefit recognized in
income related to this compensation expense was $78 million, $80 million
and $78 million for the same periods, respectively. The fair value of shares
and units vested in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $826 million, $851 million and $808
million, respectively. Cash payments of $64 million, $67 million and $64
million for vested restricted stock units settled in cash were made in 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively.

16. Litigation and Other Contingencies 
Litigation. A
variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has
regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside
counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these
contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those
contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no
amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the
minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities
when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the
amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be
only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable
outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation
discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the
possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant”
includes material matters, as well as other matters, which management believes
should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to defend itself vigorously in
these matters. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and
circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any
currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse
effect upon the Corporation’s operations, financial condition, or financial
statements taken as a whole.
Other Contingencies. The Corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2017,
for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where
guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not
include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum
potential exposure.

Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous
long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities,
all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material
to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.
In accordance with a nationalization
decree issued by Venezuela’s president in February 2007, by May 1, 2007,
a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA) assumed the
operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This Project had been
operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent ownership
interest in the Project. The decree also required conversion of the Cerro Negro
Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one of its
affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with the stipulation that if ExxonMobil
refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed enterprise within a
specified period of time, the government would “directly assume the activities”
carried out by the joint venture. ExxonMobil refused to accede to the terms
proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the government
expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro Project.
On September 6, 2007, affiliates
of ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID Tribunal issued a decision
on June 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the
basis of the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. On October 9, 2014,
the ICSID Tribunal issued its final award finding in favor of the ExxonMobil
affiliates and awarding $1.6 billion as of the date of expropriation, June 27, 2007,
and interest from that date at 3.25 percent compounded annually until the date
of payment in full. The Tribunal also noted that one of the Cerro Negro Project
agreements provides a mechanism to prevent double recovery between the ICSID
award and all or part of an earlier award of $908 million to an ExxonMobil
affiliate, Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., against PdVSA and a PdVSA affiliate, PdVSA
CN, in an arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce.
On
February 2, 2015, Venezuela filed a Request for Annulment of the
ICSID award. On March 9, 2017, the ICSID Committee hearing the
Request for Annulment issued a decision partially annulling the award of the
Tribunal issued on October 9, 2014. The Committee affirmed the
compensation due for the La Ceiba project and for export curtailments at the
Cerro Negro project, but annulled the portion of the award relating to the
Cerro Negro Project’s expropriation ($1.4 billion) based on its determination
that the prior Tribunal failed to adequately explain why the cap on damages in
the indemnity owed by PdVSA did not affect or limit the amount owed for the
expropriation of the Cerro Negro project. As a result, ExxonMobil retains an
award for $260 million (including accrued interest). ExxonMobil reached an
agreement with Venezuela for full payment of the $260 million and Venezuela has
begun performing on it. The agreement does not impact ExxonMobil’s ability to
re-arbitrate the issue that was the basis for the annulment in a new ICSID
arbitration proceeding.

The United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York entered judgment on the ICSID award on October 10, 2014.
Motions filed by Venezuela to vacate that judgment on procedural grounds and to
modify the judgment by reducing the rate of interest to be paid on the ICSID
award from the entry of the court’s judgment, until the date of payment, were
denied on February 13, 2015, and March 4, 2015,
respectively. On March 9, 2015, Venezuela filed a notice of appeal of
the court’s actions on the two motions. On July 11, 2017, the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rendered its opinion overturning
the District Court’s decision and vacating the judgment on the grounds that a
different procedure should have been used to reduce the award to judgment. The
Corporation is evaluating next steps.
A
stay of the District Court’s judgment has continued pending the completion of
the Second Circuit appeal. The net impact of these matters on the Corporation’s
consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. Regardless, the
Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material effect upon the
Corporation’s operations or financial condition.
An affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under
a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) covering the Erha block located in the offshore waters of
Nigeria. ExxonMobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25
percent interest under the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC
regarding NNPC's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the
terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors
initiated arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and
Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral
Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material
respects and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly in an amount of
approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. The
Contractors petitioned a Nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award,
and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012,
the court set aside the award. The Contractors appealed that judgment to the
Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial Division. On July 22, 2016, the Court
of Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court setting aside the award. On
October 21, 2016, the Contractors appealed the decision to the
Supreme Court of Nigeria. In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against
NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order to preserve their ability to
seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary. Following dismissal by
this court, the Contractors appealed to the Nigerian Court of Appeal in June
2016. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary, the
arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction. NNPC
has moved to dismiss the lawsuit. The stay in the proceedings in the Southern
District of New York has been lifted. At this time, the net impact of this
matter on the Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably
estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the
Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the
Corporation's operations or financial condition.

For selection of the discount rate for
U.S. plans, several sources of information are considered, including interest
rate market indicators and the effective discount rate determined by use of a
yield curve based on high-quality, noncallable bonds applied to the estimated
cash outflows for benefit payments. For major non-U.S. plans, the discount rate
is determined by using a spot yield curve of high-quality,
local-currency-denominated bonds at an average maturity approximating that of
the liabilities. 
The measurement of the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 4.5
percent in 2019 and subsequent years. A one-percentage-point increase in the health
care cost trend rate would increase service and interest cost by $72 million
and the postretirement benefit obligation by $696 million. A
one-percentage-point decrease in the health care cost trend rate would decrease
service and interest cost by $53 million and the postretirement benefit
obligation by $536 million.

The funding levels of all qualified
pension plans are in compliance with standards set by applicable law or
regulation. As shown in the table below, certain smaller U.S. pension plans and
a number of non-U.S. pension plans are not funded because local applicable tax rules
and regulatory practices do not encourage funding of these plans. All
defined benefit pension obligations, regardless of the funding status
of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength
of the Corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate.

The long-term expected rate of return on funded assets shown below
is established for each benefit plan by developing a forward‑looking,
long-term return assumption for each asset class, taking into account
factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and
inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the
weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term
return assumption for each asset class.

The Corporation’s investment strategy for
benefit plan assets reflects a long-term view, a careful assessment of the
risks inherent in plan assets and liabilities and broad diversification to
reduce the risk of the portfolio. The benefit plan assets are primarily
invested in passive global equity and local currency fixed income index
funds to diversify risk while minimizing costs. The equity funds hold
ExxonMobil stock only to the extent necessary to replicate the relevant equity
index. The fixed income funds are largely invested in investment grade
corporate and government debt securities. 
Studies
are periodically conducted to establish the preferred target asset allocation
percentages. The target asset allocation for the U.S. benefit plans and the major
non-U.S. plans is 30 percent equity securities and 70 percent debt securities.
The equity targets for the U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans include a small
allocation to private equity partnerships that primarily focus on early-stage
venture capital of 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively. 
The
fair value measurement levels are accounting terms that refer to different
methods of valuing assets. The terms do not represent the relative risk or
credit quality of an investment.

18. Disclosures about Segments and Related
Information 
The
Upstream, Downstream and Chemical functions best define the operating segments
of the business that are reported separately. The factors used to identify
these reportable segments are based on the nature of the operations that are
undertaken by each segment. The Upstream segment is organized and operates to
explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas. The Downstream segment is
organized and operates to manufacture and sell petroleum products. The Chemical
segment is organized and operates to manufacture and sell petrochemicals. These
segments are broadly understood across the petroleum and petrochemical
industries. 
These
functions have been defined as the operating segments of the Corporation
because they are the segments (1) that engage in business activities from
which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (2) whose operating
results are regularly reviewed by the Corporation’s chief operating decision
maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to
assess its performance; and (3) for which discrete financial information
is available. 
Earnings
after income tax include transfers at estimated market prices.

Sales-based taxes were previously reported gross on the income
statement and included in total taxes in the above table. See Note 2:
Accounting Changes. 
 
The above provisions for deferred income
taxes include a net credit of $5,920 million in 2017, reflecting a $5,942
million credit related to U.S. tax reform and $22 million of other changes in
tax laws and rates outside of the United States. Deferred income tax expense
also includes net charges of $180 million in 2016 and $177 million in 2015 for
the effect of changes in tax laws and rates. 
Following the December 22, 2017, enactment
of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in accordance with Accounting Standard
Codification Topic 740 (Income Taxes) and following guidance outlined in
the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, the Corporation has included
reasonable estimates of the income tax effects of the changes in tax law and
tax rate. These include amounts for the remeasurement of the deferred income
tax balance from the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent
and the mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and
profits. The Corporation has paid taxes on earnings outside the United States
at tax rates on average above the historical U.S. rate of 35 percent. As a
result, the deemed repatriation tax does not create a significant tax impact
for ExxonMobil. The impact of tax law changes on the Corporation’s financial
statements could differ from its estimates due to further analysis of the new
law, regulatory guidance, technical corrections legislation, or guidance under
U.S. GAAP. If significant changes occur, the Corporation will provide updated
information in connection with future regulatory filings.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

 

 Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences
between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting
purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes. Balances at December 31,
2017, reflect the deferred income tax effects from the enactment of the U.S.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Corporation has elected to account for the tax on global
intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) as a tax expense in the period in which it
is incurred.
Deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are
comprised of the following at December 31:

The Corporation’s earnings from subsidiary
companies outside the United States were subject to the deemed repatriation
required by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Those amounts continue to
be indefinitely reinvested and are retained to fund prior and future capital
project expenditures. Deferred income taxes have not been recorded for certain additional
future tax obligations, such as foreign withholding tax and state tax, as these
earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for the foreseeable future.
As of December 31, 2017, it is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized
deferred income tax liability.

The gross unrecognized tax benefit
balances shown above are predominantly related to tax positions that would
reduce the Corporation’s effective tax rate if the positions are favorably
resolved. Unfavorable resolution of these tax positions generally would not
increase the effective tax rate. The 2017, 2016 and 2015 changes in
unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Corporation’s
net income. 
Resolution
of these tax positions through negotiations with the relevant tax authorities
or through litigation will take many years to complete. It is difficult to
predict the timing of resolution for tax positions since such timing is not
entirely within the control of the Corporation. In the United States, the
Corporation has various ongoing U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The IRS has
asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. The Corporation
has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the Corporation does not
expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. The Corporation has
filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a U.S. federal district court
with respect to the positions at issue for those years. Unfavorable resolution
of all positions at issue with the IRS would not have a materially adverse
effect on the Corporation’s net income or liquidity.
It
is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could
increase or decrease by 10 percent in the next 12 months with no material
impact on the Corporation's net income.

subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction:

The Corporation classifies interest on
income tax-related balances as interest expense or interest income and
classifies tax-related penalties as operating expense. 
The Corporation
incurred $36 million, $4 million and $39 million in interest expense on income
tax reserves in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The related interest payable
balances were $168 million and $191 million at December 31, 2017, and 2016,
respectively.

20. Acquisitions

InterOil Corporation
On February 22, 2017, the Corporation
completed the acquisition of InterOil Corporation (IOC) for $2.7 billion. The
IOC acquisition was mostly unproved properties in Papua New Guinea.
Consideration included 28 million shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation common
stock having a value on the acquisition date of $2.2 billion, a Contingent
Resource Payment (CRP) with a fair value of $0.3 billion and cash of $0.2
billion. The CRP provided IOC shareholders $7.07 per share in cash for each
incremental independently certified Trillion Cubic Feet Equivalent (TCFE) of
resources above 6.2 TCFE, up to 11.0 TCFE. IOC’s assets include a contingent
receivable related to the same resource base for volumes in excess of 3.5 TCFE
at amounts ranging from $0.24 - $0.40 per thousand cubic feet equivalent. The
fair value of the contingent receivable was $1.1 billion at the acquisition
date. Fair values of contingent amounts were based on assumptions about the
outcome of the resource certification, future business plans and appropriate
discount rates. 
On September 6, 2017, the resource
certification was finalized triggering both payment of the CRP to former IOC
shareholders and receipt of the current portion of the contingent receivable.
The earnings impact from settlement of the CRP and the related contingent
receivable was not material. 
 
Permian Basin Properties
On February 28, 2017, the Corporation
completed the acquisition for $6.2 billion of a number of companies from the
Bass family in Fort Worth, Texas, that indirectly own mostly unproved oil and
gas properties in the Permian Basin. Consideration included 68 million shares
of Exxon Mobil Corporation common stock having a value on the acquisition date
of $5.5 billion, together with additional contingent cash payments tied to
future drilling and completion activities (up to a maximum of $1.02 billion). Fair
value of the contingent payment was $0.7 billion as of the acquisition date and
is expected to be paid beginning in 2020 and ending no later than 2032
commensurate with development of the resource. Fair value of the contingent
payment was based on assumptions including drilling and completion activities,
appropriate discount rates and tax rates.
The fair value of the contingent payment
is adjusted each quarter. The earnings impact from these adjustments was not
material.
Below is a summary of the net assets
acquired for each acquisition.

Oil and Gas Exploration and Production
Costs 
The amounts shown for net capitalized
costs of consolidated subsidiaries are $15,292 million less at year-end 2017
and $15,239 million less at year-end 2016 than the amounts reported as
investments in property, plant and equipment for the Upstream in Note 9.
This is due to the exclusion from capitalized costs of certain
transportation and research assets and assets relating to LNG operations.
Assets related to oil sands and oil shale mining operations are included
in the capitalized costs in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board rules.

Oil and Gas Exploration and Production
Costs (continued) 
The
amounts reported as costs incurred include both capitalized costs and costs
charged to expense during the year. Costs incurred also include new asset
retirement obligations established in the current year, as well as increases or
decreases to the asset retirement obligation resulting from changes in cost
estimates or abandonment date. Total consolidated costs incurred in 2017 were $19,644 million,
up $8,269 million from 2016, due primarily to acquisitions of unproved
properties, partially offset by lower development costs including lower asset
retirement obligation cost estimates mainly in the North Sea. In 2016 costs
were $11,375 million, down $10,512 million from 2015, due primarily to lower
development costs. Total equity company costs incurred in 2017 were $6,008
million, up $4,602 million from 2016, due primarily to acquisition of unproved
properties.

Oil and Gas Reserves 
The following information describes
changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at
year-end 2015, 2016, and 2017. 
The
definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X. 
Proved
oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas,
which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward,
from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating
methods and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal
is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional
wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.

In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules, the
Corporation’s year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change
categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the
basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of
the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic
average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period.
These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit‑of-production
depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted
net cash flow. 
Revisions
can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of
proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of
(1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new
geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of
first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are used in the
estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in
either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity. Reserve
volumes that were subject to a downward revision can be revised upward at some
point in the future when price levels increase, costs decline, and / or
operating efficiencies occur. 
Proved
reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate’s participation
in proved reserves and ExxonMobil’s ownership percentage of the proved reserves
of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas
reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from
the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants.
These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas
liquids. 
In
the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves
are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company
reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies. 
Reserves
reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are
based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the
agreement. The production and reserves that we report for these types of
arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes.
As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the
company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to
achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When
prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total
liquids and natural gas proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity
companies) at year-end 2017 that were associated with production sharing
contract arrangements was 12 percent of liquids, 10 percent of natural gas and 11
percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas converted to oil-equivalent at
6 billion cubic feet = 1 million barrels). 
Net
proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in
which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the
cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are
expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing
wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
Crude
oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas production quantities shown are the
net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil’s oil and natural gas reserves. The
natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for
sale by the producing function as reported in the Operating Information due to
volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.
The
changes between 2017 year-end proved reserves and 2016 year-end proved reserves
primarily reflect extensions/discoveries in the United States, Guyana, and the
United Arab Emirates, as well as purchases in the Permian Basin and offshore
Area 4 in Mozambique, along with upward revisions to North America natural gas,
liquids in the United Arab Emirates, and bitumen at Kearl and Cold Lake.
Downward revisions are reflected in Europe for the Groningen gas field. 
The
downward revisions in 2016, as the result of very low prices during 2016,
include the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl. In addition, 0.8
billion barrels of oil equivalent across the remainder of North America no
longer qualified as proved reserves at year-end 2016 mainly due to the
acceleration of the projected end-of-field-life.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Cash Flows 
As required by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
is computed by applying first-day-of-the-month average prices,
year-end costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10 percent
to net proved reserves. The standardized measure includes costs for
future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation obligations.
The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide
a reliable estimate of the Corporation’s expected future cash flows to be
obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or
of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves. The standardized measure is
prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including
first-day-of-the-month average prices, which represent discrete points in time
and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year
as prices change.

(1)    
Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) rules require the
Corporation’s reserves to be calculated on the basis of average first-of-month
oil and natural gas prices during the reporting year. As a result of very low
prices during 2016, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain
quantities of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior
years did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. Future net cash
flows for these quantities are excluded from the 2016 Standardized Measure of Discounted
Future Cash Flows. Substantially all of this reduction in discounted future net
cash flows since December 31, 2015, is reflected in the line “Net change in
prices, lifting and development costs” in the table above.
