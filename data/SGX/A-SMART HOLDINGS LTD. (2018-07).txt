We use the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework to guide the Board’s monitoring and reporting 

of our impact on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters. The topics discussed in this 

report were primarily determined based on the study of ESG topics monitored and reported by local 

and global players along our value chain. Other factors that influenced our selection of material 

topics to monitor and report included our cost structure, industry trends on ESG concerns relevant to 

the print and media, property development and smart technologies industries.

Sustainability Report 2018


Dear Stakeholders,

The Board of directors (“Board”) is pleased to present A-Smart Holdings Ltd.’s 

(the “Group”) first sustainability report in line with the Singapore Exchange 

guidelines on Sustainability Reporting. 

The Board will continue to embrace sustainable growth strategies and 

incorporate sustainability as a key component of the Group’s strategy 

towards achieving long term success for its stakeholders. Our commitment 

in taking care of the well-being of employees, the environment and the 

communities in which we operate is reflected in our sustainable business 

strategy and material ESG factors which are shown in the report.  

Through our stakeholder engagement, the Board and Management identified 

many key trends and topics that our internal and external stakeholders are 

concerned with.

Proper management and disposal of raw materials and effluents

We have implemented procedures and internal controls to ensure proper 

management and disposal of raw materials such as waste paper, ink and 

their by-products as well as to minimise wastage of raw materials. Our 

employees are also trained to adopt techniques that reduce paper waste 

in various stages of the production process. 

To minimise the risks of chemical leaks and spills, the Group follows closely 

the guidelines recommended by the Singapore Civil Defence Force and 

engages only NEA licensed waste management companies to handle the 

disposal of chemical waste.

Anti-corruption

A whistle-blowing policy is in place to provide arrangements whereby 

concerns on financial improprieties or other matters raised by whistle-blowers 

may be investigated and appropriate follow up action taken. 

BOARD MESSAGE

Training and Development

We remain committed to training and upgrading the skills of our employees 

as it is crucial for organisation development and success. Our training and 

development policy encourages employees to upgrade their skills and 

enhance their knowledge. 

Workplace Health &amp; Safety

Our workers’ welfare ranks high in our organisational value system as employees 

are our key assets. To prevent workplace injuries and illnesses, we conducted 

training and set up safety procedures to improve occupational health and 

safety awareness of the employees.

Our Commitment 

The Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, 

determined the material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

factors to be: 

•	 Anti-Corruption

•	 Raw Materials 

•	 Management of Effluents 

•	 Workplace Health &amp; Safety 

•	 Training and Development

The Board has also overseen the management and monitoring of the 

above material ESG factors. Moving ahead, we will continue to improve our 

sustainability efforts and actively engage our key stakeholders.

Sustainability Report 2018


In January 2018, the Group expanded its core businesses to include Property Development and 

Real Estate Investment. The Group’s maiden property development project, Timor Marina Square 

(“TMS”), is currently in progress in Dili, the capital city of Timor-Leste and construction is expected to 

commence in the second half of 2019. TMS is situated at a prime coastal location opposite the Port of 

Dili, Timor-Leste, where the World Bank, foreign embassies and government offices are located. The 

building and design plan to develop a mixed development property (comprising retail, residential 

and office units) has undergone pre-consultation with the Timor Building Authorities and will soon be 

formally submitted to the authorities for approval.

Anti-Corruption

The Audit Committee (“AC”) has in place a whistle-blowing policy to provide arrangements whereby 

concerns on financial improprieties or other matters raised by whistle-blowers may be investigated 

and appropriate follow up action taken. Under such whistle-blowing procedures, employees are free 

to submit complaints confidentially or anonymously to the Chairman of the AC who is well known 

to many employees and easily accessible. All complaints are to be treated as confidential and are 

to be brought to the attention of the AC. Assessment, investigation and evaluation of complaints 

are conducted by or at the direction of the AC. If it deems appropriate, independent advisors are 

engaged at the Group’s expense. Following investigation and evaluation of a complaint, the AC will 

then decide on recommended disciplinary or remedial action, if any. The action so determined by 

the AC to be appropriate shall then be brought to the Board or to the appropriate senior executive 

staff for authorisation or implementation respectively.

The AC reports to the Board on such matters at the Board meetings. Should the AC receive reports 

relating to serious offences and/or criminal activities in the Group, the AC and the Board have access 

to the appropriate external advice where necessary. Where appropriate or required, a report shall 

be made to the relevant government authorities for further investigation or action. 

The AC is kept updated annually or from time to time on any changes to the accounting and financial 

reporting standards by the external auditors. No former partner or director of the Group’s existing 

auditing firm has acted as a member of the AC. 

There were no whistle-blowing reports received in FY2018.

Raw material

Paper makes up a substantial portion of the Group’s inputs and remains the main raw material used 

throughout the Group’s business operations. Trees are being cut down to be made into papers and 

thus proper management of paper use is essential to promote environmental sustainability. 

To reduce the amount of paper used as well as paper waste generated, our sales team works very 

closely with our customers to ensure customers’ requirements are interpreted correctly.  Besides that, 

our production team calibrates the design of print jobs to ensure the optimal use of paper. Our 

employees are also well-trained in the areas of efficient cutting, binding techniques and printing 

colour control which further reduce paper waste. Unusable waste papers are sold to scrap dealers 

for recycling purpose. 

Furthermore, we purchase paper only from responsible certified suppliers, such as those with Forest 

Stewardship Council (FSC™) certification as FSC™ certified suppliers obtain paper supplies only 

through sustainable forest management solutions. 

Management of Effluents

As an organisation with a printing business, we require large amounts of ink chemicals for our print 

products. The proper management of waste is important to the communities where we operate and 

thus, we are committed to dispose waste chemicals responsibly. 

We have a dedicated team of experienced handlers that store chemicals in the designated safe 

areas, so that the risk of any chemical leaks can be minimised. These safe areas are under surveillance 

and can only be accessed by authorised personnel. The Group has obtained the Petroleum &amp; 

Flammable Materials Storage Licence from Singapore Civil Defence Force for storing the chemicals 

in the designated areas.

The Group is aware of the negative effects that inappropriate handling/disposal of chemical waste 

can have on the environment. Therefore, the Group engages a NEA licensed waste management 

company to handle the disposal of chemical waste.

In addition, the Group also has, as part of the Emergency Response Plan, guidelines on how to 

respond to accidents or hazardous events resulting from chemical spills or fire.
