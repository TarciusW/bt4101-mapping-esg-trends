Sustainability Report 2019

Journeying Through 2019

The debate on climate change is forcing businesses

to respond to demands to stop carbon dioxide and

other greenhouse gas emissions. While some are

slow to embrace the call for action, the views from the

global

business

community

have

changed

significantly over the last decade, shifting from denial

and

criticising

green

movement

into

eventual

acceptance.

Capital investment, technology and political will, are

key factors pushing the business community to accept

the need to transform in order to comply national level

regulation

promoting

the

shift

from

fossil-fuel

dependence towards renewable energy reliance.

The UN Secretary-General António Guterres issued a

dire warning about the global crisis, underlining that

we are close to a “point of no return” on climate

change , witnessed by rapid melting of glaciers that

cause rising sea levels, devastating wildfires, as well

as stronger storms and hurricanes.

Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called

climate change “an existential threat” during his 2019

National Day Rally speech, highlighting Singapore’s

relative vulnerability to rising sea levels which needs

to be tackled with good engineering solutions that will

cost money2.

Earlier this year, Singapore government announced

further efforts to tackle climate change, whereby

Singapore will aim to halve its 2030 peak greenhouse

gas emissions by 2050, to achieve net zero emissions

"as soon as viable" in the second half of the century3.

Sustainability is an integral component of our

business

EnGro took its first steps to go green nearly two

decades ago with the intent to promote Ground

Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS), a low carbon

yet high performance material that could partially

displace Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), which had

a high carbon footprint of almost 20 times that of

GGBS.

By

raising

environmental

awareness

among

our

stakeholders,

the

steel

players

and

the

cement

players, our GGBS business expanded in China. Our

green products started to gain recognition shortly

after we submitted our products to be certified with

eco-labels promoted by the Singapore Environment

Council (SEC) and the Singapore Green Building

Council (SGBC) since 2007. Subsequently, in year

2008 we were the first among our peers to adopt

carbon footprint assessment for our products, and

provide

third

party

assessed

carbon

footprint

certificates to our customers for the products they

procure from us.

Concrete, the most widely used man-made material,

generates eight percent of global carbon dioxide

emissions.

Cement,

the

primary

component

of

concrete, is the major source of emissions related to

concrete.

Researchers continue to conjure innovative solutions

such as carbon capture or carbon sequestration

programs to address the reliance on high carbon

intensity materials such as the OPC. In recent years,

while cement production capacity continued to grow

unabatedly

driven

by

rapid

urbanisation

and

population growth across the world, the cement

industry has also increased the use of Supplementary

Cementitious Materials (SCMs) such as GGBS and

Pulverised Fly Ash (PFA) to reduce its reliance on

clinker-based OPC which still dominates the larger

volume

of

cementitious

materials

used

in

construction.

Over the past one and a half decade, green building

certifications, such as the US LEED, Singapore BCA

Green

Mark,

and

China

Three

Star,

gained

prominence across the world. These green building

certification standards recognise the value-add of

GGBS and Green Cement to reduce the embodied

carbon of concrete supplied to green developments.

This trend is aligned with global consensus to reduce

over-reliance on fossil fuel and products with large

carbon

footprint.

Steel,

cement

and

concrete,

contribute nearly 70 percent of the embodied carbon

The Group’s GGBS and Green Cement (a term used

to describe blended cement that are mixed with

sustainable cementitious materials) were the first in

the industry to be independently accorded with eco-

label and carbon footprint certifications to distinguish

them from the competition.

This is our third Sustainability Report as we continue

to update the progress of the Group’s efforts in

promoting

and

building

sustainability.

As

our

stakeholders derive better appreciation of the impact

of climate change, we believe in a collective effort

with the community in adopting green and going the

extra mile, and upholding corporate governance

practices to achieve a balance between People,

Planet, and Profit.

Sustainability Committee

in buildings across the world. And this is where

EnGro

could

contribute,

by

promoting

greater

adoption of low carbon GGBS. Our 11.4 million tons

of annually combined GGBS production capacity in

China and South Korea, significantly contributes

towards annual carbon reduction in the construction

sector in these regions.

As a leading promoter and producer of green building

materials - GGBS and Green Cement – efforts to

strive towards low carbon footprint for our materials

are

reflected in our corporate

tagline, “Building

Sustainability”.

Low carbon impact to the environment means that

our manufacturing presence would not detriment the

environment and the community where we operate

in.

The

Group’s

green

initiatives

continue

to

accentuate our drive in upholding Environmental,

Social and Governance criteria.

Our core values of Harmony, Trust, Excellence and

Win-Win strengthen our sustainability focus to make

our world sustainable and safe for future generations.








EnGro Corporation Limited

Sustainability Report 2019

EnGro was incorporated on 27 November 1973 under the name SsangYong Cement (S) Pte. Ltd. It was

originally formed as a joint venture between SsangYong Cement Industrial Co. Ltd. of South Korea, Afro-Asia

Shipping Co (Pte.) Ltd. and The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd. The Company was converted into a

public limited company on 31 May 1983 and assumed the name SsangYong Cement (S) Ltd.

In 1976, the Company started off with manufacturing OPC but from 2003 onwards, it ceased to produce OPC

but expanded its product offering to include high performance blended cement, Ready-Mix Concrete (RMC),

low carbon GGBS, microfine cement and other innovative construction materials.

In 2002, the Company marked the beginning of a new chapter as it witnessed the end of the Singapore-Korea

partnership over the Company’s 30-year history. Afro-Asia International Enterprises Pte Ltd acquired shares

divested by SsangYong Cement Industrial Co Ltd and subsequently made a mandatory cash offer for shares

not owned by Afro-Asia International Enterprises Pte Ltd or parties acting in concert.

In 2005, the Company changed its name to EnGro Corporation Limited with a new logo that reflects its vision

of growth in North Asia and growth through strategic partnerships. The striking blue and orange curves

symbolises EnGro and its partners. The curve design of the logo simulates the hemisphere of a globe

reflecting EnGro’s determination to expand globally.

Over the years, EnGro diversified its business by investing in specialty polymer, high-tech venture capital

funds, property developments as well as food and beverage. At present, the main businesses of the Group

are:

1. Integral Cement &amp; Ready-Mix Concrete

2. Specialty Cement

3. Specialty Polymer

4. Hi-Tech &amp; Venture Capital Investments

The “Building Sustainability” corporate tagline reflects EnGro’s commitment towards promoting green and

achieving the triple bottom-line equilibrium of PEOPLE, PLANET, and PROFIT.

EnGro Corporation Limited

Sustainability Report 2019



The global community’s commitment to limit global warming to 2ºC between now and 2100, requires global

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions to decrease by 40 percent to 70 percent by 2050 and achieve net zero

emissions by the end of the century. As such, many countries have committed towards reducing their GHG

footprints. As part of the contribution to achieving this goal, the Singapore government has pledged to reduce

its emissions intensity by 36 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. In addition, in early 2017, the Singapore

government announced its intention to implement the carbon taxation scheme beginning 2019. Meanwhile,

China has eight pilot carbon market schemes and is expected to start its national carbon market in year 2020

to further curb its emissions level on a national scale.

These recent developments clearly justify EnGro’s early focus and attention on sustainability. The building and

construction sector is the second largest contributor of GHG emissions as building materials generate

significant amount of embodied GHG emissions throughout their product life cycle due to the substantial

amount of embodied GHG emissions contributed by the use of steel and concrete as the core building

elements of buildings. The building and construction industry is a labour-intensive industry while the sector is

also one of the key GDP contributors to the country. Therefore, one of the ways to reduce emissions from the

sector while maintaining growth of the industry is through the greater use of green or sustainable materials.

As we continue to be among the leading suppliers of building materials in Singapore and realise our vision to

be the integral partner of innovative and sustainable material solutions, EnGro has the responsibility to

promote the use of environmentally-friendly materials. In the long run, we aim to increase the use of recycled

materials in our products and commit to doing more research and development of innovative sustainable

building materials, leveraging on our success in handling blastfurnance slag from iron producing steel mills.

EnGro also continues to provide a safe working environment for its employees and contractors. Safety is

paramount in EnGro’s operations and we have put in place policies and initiatives to ensure minimal injuries

occur in our operations. On these fronts, we are proud that we have achieved internal targets for 2019.

EnGro Corporation Limited

Sustainability Report 2019



Supply chain is an integral facet of EnGro’s operations. The Company leverages upon its international

network of raw material and logistics players to import critical raw materials into Singapore. In Singapore, raw

materials are received at our state-of-the-art multi-cell silo bulk terminal at Pulau Damar Laut to produce a

series of low carbon blended cement products. These green products, along with our GGBS, are then

transported to our RMC batching plants to produce ready-mixed concrete or sold to customers directly while a

small volume is sold in bagged form through distributors.

In Malaysia, TMM produces RMC with raw materials sourced locally and sold directly to customers.

Separately, our specialty polymer operational unit, RPT, procures raw material from oil refiners and other

suppliers from overseas to manufacture and supply to customers outside China.

EnGro Corporation Limited

Sustainability Report 2019

Healthy economic or financial performance is paramount for EnGro’s foundation as a key pillar to support the

Company’s efforts in other aspects of sustainability. The Company recorded a profit before tax of S$12.0

million in year ended 31 December 2019 (FY2019). EnGro recorded a revenue of S$131.3 million for FY2019,

a 9.0 per cent decrease compared to the S$144.3 million in FY2018, due to lower revenue from Specialty

Polymer, and Integral Cement and RMC businesses.

The Group reported a higher profit after tax of S$11.1 million in FY2019, attributed to higher fair value gains

from our Investment segment, and improved performance from our China Joint Ventures and Integral Cement

and RMC business.

hazard

analysis/risk assessment of the work activities and

submit to the appropriate EnGro management for

approval.

This

requirement

is

applicable

to

both

EnGro’s employees as well as its contractors.

and

investigations are carried out to ensure corrective

actions have been identified and implemented.



18

taken the following initiatives:

1.

Employ a Safety Officer to educate and identify

safety

gaps

and

work

towards

closing

all

occupational health and safety gaps.

2.

Develop Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

manual and display the SOP explicitly at all

sites with safety rules embedded in all the work

processes to ensure that safety rules are strictly

and consistently observed.

3.

Organise regular in-house safety training and

have

safety

instruction

diagrams

visibly near or on starting equipment in both

English and Chinese.

4.

EnGro Corporation Limited

Sustainability Report 2019

EnGro upholds a relentless commitment towards corporate governance which is in accordance with our

continuing obligation as a company listed on the SGX. We are committed to go beyond the basics in

regulatory compliance and have established a robust internal system, governed by the board and senior

management, that diligently cross-checks our compliance to regulations in various countries that we operate

in.

EnGro’s goal is to ensure that Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal

controls to safeguard shareholders’ interests and the Company’s assets. We have set up a risk assessment

structure in the form of an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Committee comprising the key Heads of

Departments. The ERM Committee convenes every three months to discuss the key risk areas that affects

the Group’s business. The ERM committee submits its findings to the Audit Committee (AC) Chairman and

the Board of Directors for review and comments on a quarterly basis.

By adhering to laws, regulations, guidelines and specifications relevant to EnGro’s businesses, it ensures that

the Group’s long-standing reputation is intact and continues to be preserved. In our view, a strong and ethical

reputation forms an integral element of our core values of “Harmony, Trust, Excellence, and Win-Win”, which

enhance our ability to attract strong partners to expand our various businesses and attract relevant personnel

to join our ever-growing capable workforce.

EnGro Corporation Limited

Sustainability Report 2019



Staying true to our vision, EnGro has run its business with responsibility to the environment. We implemented

green initiatives more than a decade ago and today we are seeing the results of our efforts. In 2010, EnGro

contributed to the establishment of Friends of Building Sustainability, an independent cross-industry platform

for peers to exchange information on green practices. EnGro and its subsidiary companies have invariably

sought to obtain international certifications, such as the ISO, to demonstrate our environmental commitment.

Our Singapore operations were certified ISO14001 since 2012 and we have obtained ISO certification for our

Malaysia concrete operations.

To closely communicate the results of our green initiatives, EnGro chose to implement carbon footprint

assessments at product and company level to communicate the GHG contribution of our operations and

products to our stakeholders. In 2011, EnGro engaged the services of a professional GHG assessor to

analyse the product Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of its products in accordance to international standards

ISO14040/44 and PAS2050. In 2012, we were early adopters of the ISO14064 to assess the GHG emissions

relating to organisational emissions. EnGro is also proud to have achieved carbon neutrality for China joint

venture laboratory building project in 2013 as per PAS2060 certification by offsetting our carbon emissions.

These assessments have enabled EnGro to better understand the true emission sources of our products and

our operations, which have helped us to manage our resources more efficiently. Management believes in the

benefits of monitoring EnGro’s GHG footprint and continues to assess its emissions.

USE OF SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS

EnGro’s products utilise recycled materials as raw materials. Moreover, EnGro cement and Top-Mix Concrete

use EnGro’s low-carbon VCEM product to their mixtures. This results in products of lower carbon-content

than typical OPC, while maintaining the strength and functionality of the products. Since 2007, EnGro’s low

carbon products have received accreditation from the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme for its sustainability

qualities. In addition, since 2011, our products have also been acknowledged to have met the highest industry

standards for a green product. Our products also eventually received the “4 ticks” or “Leader” rating from the

Singapore Green Building Product (SGBP) accreditation body. This rating is given to eco-friendly products

with low-carbon content. High-rated SGBP products can accrue more points in the Singapore BCA Green

Mark rating system, with the 4 ticks Leader products scoring 1 additional point per qualifying product.
