MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The business and sustainability of our Group are 

always based on the same methodology, a visionary 

approach that will accelerate the business to consistently 

achieve superior efficiency and quality for greatest 

customer satisfaction while protecting our stakeholders’ 

interest.

Dear Stakeholders,

We maintain that being sustainable requires looking beyond 

productivity and profitability and taking the responsibility 

to leave the best legacy for future generations. A 

sustainable approach inclusive of an overall risk strategy 

on sustainability management encompasses environmental, 

social and governance matters and is the cornerstone 

of our Group’s continuity. We proactively nurture our 

reputation in the regions where we operate to align with 

our vision. Sound practices follow our commitment to 

principles of sustainability, matching our customers’ own 

focus on the importance of sustainability in their supply 

chains. This coincides with maintaining compliance with all 

applicable environmental laws and regulations, and results 

in our good reputation in stakeholder communities. Our 

responsible stewardship of the environment rests on this 

established sustainability framework and provides for our 

employees’ welfare.

The promise to prioritise sustainability begins with initial 

production processes and represents our commitment 

to establish sustainability throughout the entire supply 

chain by working closely with all relevant stakeholders 

to mitigate ecological impacts and advance employee 

welfare in the Group.

We believe that environmental sustainability rests on 

effective planning and the responsible and efficient use of 

raw materials, directly reducing waste. The welfare of our 

employees and their safety and security are tantamount 

and hone our focus on ensuring the Group’s success. 

Engaging in corporate giving and the empowerment 

of local communities positively influences our networks. 

This is of particular importance due to our low-cost 

based production plants located in ASEAN’s fast-growing 

economies, such as Vietnam. 

Overall, this sustainability report illustrates our approach 

to sustainability, from the implementation of our strategies 

in our business practices to the ways we encourage 

performance in the achievement of our targets. Further, 

our drive towards sound sustainability practices bolsters 

our capacity to engineer sustainable growth and returns 

in the present and future that are stable, strategic and 

sustainable.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019








New Toyo International Holdings Ltd (“New Toyo”) is a leading regional supplier and one of the largest players in the 

provision of high quality specialty packaging materials to the tobacco, food and beverage, wine, liquor and cosmetics 

industries in Asia Pacific. New Toyo was founded in 1975 and has been listed on the Mainboard of the Singapore 

Exchange since 4 April 1997. Headquartered in Singapore and with employees totalling 1,563, the business and its 

activities are located regionally to strategically serve local as well as global customers. The multiple facilities that form 

our solid manufacturing base are vital to our critical locations in four countries, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Dubai, 

thus providing local and immediate support to our customers in these markets. This enhances our Group’s focus on 

fulfilling customer needs and perfecting the quality of our products.

New Toyo has two core business divisions:

The Specialty Papers (“SP”) division focuses on providing laminated and/or coated paper and paperboards in reel 

form or in sheets for customers in the food and beverage, alcohol, tobacco and cosmetics industries. These products 

are primarily used in the packaging of cigarettes, food, beverages, wine and liquor, tissues and cosmetics, as well as 

for labelling and gift-wrapping.

The Printed Cartons and Labels (“PCL”) division offers mainly gravure and lithography printing. Gravure printing is a 

specialised high-speed printing process used for the printing of high quality paper prints, mainly for cigarette packaging. 

Lithography or offset printing is mostly provided for the supply of folded cartons and labels for rapid selling consumer 

goods.

In addition, the Group has a trading business that centres on the sale of raw materials, paper products and equipment.

ABOUT NEW TOYO

OUR VISION

With more than 40 years of experience, New Toyo 

has developed a reputation as a respectable value-

added supplier of quality products and services. We 

continuously improve our productivity and match recent 

trends in the packaging business in order to become 

the supplier of choice for our customers.

high-quality packaging materials

OUR SUSTAINABILITY ETHOS

To do our part to 



Safeguard our Environment 



and better the lives of Our 



People and the Communities 



where we Work and Live



At New Toyo, we consistently enhance a proactive concept 

of the direction of our business. We evaluate how to 

conduct our business in the most productive manner and 

ways to engage individuals and bolster the effects of our 

activities such that the influence on future generations and 

their relationships to us is enhanced. We recognise that 

prioritising sustainability issues is crucial to our reputation 

in the market and to our bonds with key stakeholders.

Our approach to sustainability encompasses the supply 

chain in its entirety, from raw materials and conversion 

to the eventual provision of products for our customers. 

Effective planning forms the basis of improvements as 

we continuously review our processes. In this way, we 

reduce utilisation of the natural resources necessary to 

produce paper, paper board and aluminium foil. 

We provide New Toyo’s Supplier Code of Conduct 

policy (“Supplier CoC”) to our suppliers for their written 

acknowledgement as a way of stressing our sustainability 

principles and extending them throughout our supply chain, 

thus maintaining healthy and productive business contacts. 

The Supplier CoC prompts our suppliers to consider 

sustainability as being more than simply a set of rules 

for compliance and encourages them instead to hold 

sustainability as an integral underlying principle guiding the 

conduct of business. The Supplier CoC offers guidelines 

on a range of issues, including ethics in business 

dealings, adherence to applicable laws and regulations 

and environmental stewardship. 

In accordance with these principles, we validate that, 

according to our expectations, no product of ours has 

been restricted in any of the markets where we operate.

In summary, the correct conduct of business encompasses 

adopting the right attitude and mind-set to maintain ethical 

and responsible behaviour. For additional information on 

our management of raw materials and engagement with 

suppliers, please refer to Responsible Sourcing on page 25.

HOW WE CREATE VALUE SUSTAINABLY













































































































































































































































































































































































1. OUR INPUTS

2. HOW WE MANAGE OUR 

MANUFACTURING PROCESS

In our pursuit to deliver quality products and services, we believe in ensuring that sustainability 

underpins our entire supply chain, from the raw materials we use to the distribution of final 

products to our customers. By integrating sustainability throughout our manufacturing process, 

we aim to create value for our stakeholders through a safe and environmentally sound approach.

Base materials

Through proactive planning, we are able to 

obtain base materials that are closest to the 

dimensions of our final products’ specifications. 

This enables us to reduce wastage and, as a 

result, we consume fewer natural  resources.

Other raw materials

We always encourage our customers to use 

water-based inks as they are more environmentally 

friendly.

Personnel Planning

Operational efficiency and productivity are enhanced through careful and effective 

planning and procedures.

Job Scheduling

Appropriate work scheduling allows us to provide adequate rest for staff between 

and before their shifts. Healthy work practices are distilled in the workplaces to 

increase efficiency while also enhancing employee well-being and reducing the threat 

of accidents and injuries.

Electricity

Machine maintenance is done at regularly scheduled intervals, aiming to minimise 

machine downtime and, in turn, lessen our carbon footprint. As our machineries utilise 

additional electricity when switching from a disconnected to a running mode, relative 

to running at a constant rate, reduced machine downtime enables us to minimise 

environmental impacts.

Water

As compared to the average manufacturing plant, our manufacturing facilities require less 

water; still, with our priority on environmental concerns at New Toyo, we are tracking 

our water consumption patterns with a goal of minimising water usage where possible.

Counting more than 40 years of experience, New Toyo has 

built an established reputation as a value-added provider 

of quality products and services. We are committed to 

upgrading our technology and developing our employees 

through thorough training programmes to improve productivity.

We build and nurture trusting, long-term relationships with 

our customers through a steadfast commitment to quality and 

customer service excellence.

We prioritise employee safety and well-being 

by adopting measures aimed to reduce potential 

hazards and risks.

3. HOW WE DISTRIBUTE

A need for last minute urgent deliveries is reduced by ensuring 

the timely and in full delivery of orders, thus reducing our 

environmental impact

Our production plants follow ISO 9001, thus guaranteeing 

quality products. Emphasising quality reduces consumption 

as fewer internal and external rejects result in savings 

on materials, energy, transport and labour needed for 

remedy and replacement.

All products are securely packed and enclosed, which ensures that 

products retain their quality through the delivery process despite 

any exposure to the elements. Customers encounter fewer rejects, 

which reduces consumption of raw materials, energy, transport 

and labour costs for exchanging faulty products. 

Licenced and locally registered 

contractors conduct waste disposal 

to ensure proper adherence to local 

laws and conditions.

To decrease our carbon footprint, freight delivery is 

optimised by fully utilising container capacity and integrating 

tightly with our customers.

Immediate support is provided to our customers through our 

strong manufacturing base and facilities strategically located 

in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. Our factories are 

positioned within arm’s reach of our customers, thus cutting down 

on distances and travel times for product delivery, resulting in 

reduced costs and minimised environmental impact.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019






ABOUT THIS REPORT

We honour the trust given to us by our stakeholders 

by exceeding regulatory compliance in our business 

sustainability. Our approach to sustainability accords with 

our customers’ practices over four decades, stressing: 

honesty, integrity and a dedication to excellence.

Since our first report published in December 2018 for the 

financial year 2017, our sustainability report has been an 

annual practice coinciding with the Annual Report.  The 

reporting scope for financial year 2019 encompasses our 

four countries of operation – Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam 

and Dubai respectively.

Our sustainability report is organised around the three 

focus areas of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

topics that are most valued by our stakeholders. Detailed 

information on our material ESG topics and the ways our 

operations interact with society and the environment are 

provided in the following sections.

The present sustainability report deals with how the 

SP division is representative of our material ESG topics 

while our PCL division is detailed in a separate report by 

our subsidiary, Tien Wah Press Holdings (“TWPH”), as 

TWPH is listed on Bursa Malaysia and subject to Bursa’s 

sustainability reporting requirements1 . The Trading division 

is also not included in this report as the business of the 

Trading division, being an intermediary in the buying and 

selling of materials, has little sustainability impact. Diligence 

is considered in periodic reviews of the materiality of the 

Trading division for inclusion in our sustainability reporting. 

Feedback on our material ESG topics is procured 

from various stakeholders through our stakeholder 

engagement exercise emphasising stakeholder inclusiveness, 

completeness and balanced reporting. For more details, 

Please refer to our Materiality section on page 13.

To adhere to best practices, our sustainability reporting 

follows the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards 

framework as the framework offers clear specifications that 

guarantee reporting accuracy and facilitate benchmarking 

our performance against peers. Our sustainability reporting 

accords with the GRI Standards: Core Option. As with 

reports of previous years, we have not sought external 

assurance though this option is considered going forward 

where necessary and prudent. Sustainability continues to 

be continuously integrated throughout our organisation, 

and we work to embed key sustainability-related metrics 

into our management systems. Future efforts will further 

deepen our sustainability reporting by keeping abreast 

of the changing business environment and safeguard 

our organisation’s long-term sustainability by adopting 

relevant KPI. 

To see all complete and transparent aspects of our Group’s 

performance across environmental, social and economic 

domains, this report should be considered alongside with 

our New Toyo’s 2019 Annual Report, which will be issued 

no later than 14 June 2020, for details of our financial 

performance and our approach to corporate governance 

and risk management. 

Standard units of measurement are employed for this 

report. Any necessary and applicable conversion factors, 

in addition to the computational basis for certain metrics, 

are provided in respective sections.

For any queries regarding this report, please direct it to 

us at enquiry@newtoyo.com.

NEW TOYO INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LTD






OUR APPROACH

As sustainability has become vital for leading corporations, 

we launched our Sustainability Reporting Committee 

(“SRC”) in early 2017 to guide and oversee the 

development of New Toyo’s sustainability policies and 

practices. In line with this measure, the Board answers 

for the management of New Toyo’s overall sustainability 

practice and is informed of sustainability issues through 

the mechanism of the SRC’s updates to the Group 

Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. 

Accordingly, the Board assures that sustainability is 

upheld in a diligent manner throughout all levels of the 

organisation. The Board considers all identified material 

ESG topics when making adjustments to New Toyo’s 

strategic planning and development.

Further bolstering our approach to sustainability are our 

well-established governance structures and proactive 

method of risk management. Please refer to our Corporate 

Governance Statement in our New Toyo’s 2019 Annual 

Report, which will be issued no later than 14 June 2020, 

for more information on our corporate structures, practices 

and policies.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) structure 

enables us to make full use of emerging opportunities 

and to mitigate detrimental effects of strategic, financial, 

operational and compliance risks. Sustainability topics are 

identified accordingly when and where these risks emerge. 

We recognised that every business unit operates in a 

unique business environment. As such, it is emphasised to 

follow ERM in spirit and substance, rather than in form, 

while attending to the unique circumstances and needs 

of any occasion faced by each unit. Please refer to our 

Risk Management and Internal Controls section in our 

New Toyo’s 2019 Annual Report, which will be issued 

no later than 14 June 2020, for more information on our 

practices and policies.

BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT

At New Toyo, we hold sustainability to be an integral 

endeavour to progressively manage challenges within 

the community, environment and business to minimise 

the impacts of adverse events on our people and the 

local community and to ensure minimal disruption in our 

supply to our customers.

Business continuity management considers options to:

• 

Ensure our employees’ safety and well-being are 

paramount

• 

Enable containment actions to control damage to 

the factory, personnel and surrounding areas 

• 

Reduce harm to production equipment due to 

emergencies, such as a fire

• 

Halt and prevent interruptions to operations and 

damage to factory resources 

• 

Redirect shipments to alternative production facilities 

should our customers experience disruptions at their 

site

• 

Facilitate immediate information sharing on matters 

of emergency response and safety

This plan is checked regularly during the year to guarantee 

its robustness and continued viability and reliability.

ETHICAL STANDARDS

Ethical standards underlie the way we construct 

dependability with clients, suppliers and investors through 

ethical business practices. This boosts the stability of our 

supply chain and leads to long-term sustainability. Ethical 

standards are firmly adhered to, particularly those involved 

with anti-competitive behaviour, anti-trust and monopoly 

issues and customer privacy. All employees acknowledge 

that they have read, comprehend and follow our Code of 

Conduct (“Code”) in order that they continuously display 

ethical standards. The Code is mandatory at each new 

employee’s orientation session. Included are all applicable 

aspects of compliance with relevant laws, rules and 

regulations, including directives on insider trading, fraud 

and anti-counterfeiting. These policies form the basis of 

our anti-corruption ethos as stressed in the Code.

As an accompaniment to the Code, our whistle-blowing 

policy offers a way for employees to voice worries 

regarding possible financial reporting infractions or other 

relevant matters. Each employee is familiarised with this 

policy on his or her first day at the company.

All our employees are offered avenues to bring any 

concerns they may have in good faith to New Toyo’s 

designated receiving officer, the chairman of the Audit 

Committee. This open channel of communication offers 

respect for anonymity and is testament to our promise 

of a work environment where employees are enabled to 

share concerns without fear.

All New Toyo employees can look to our Employee 

Handbook for guidance on ethical matters, including policies 

and procedures for data protection and confidentiality. The 

handbook is definitively recognised by each new hire as 

he or she enters the company.

We undertake to work closely with our stakeholders on matters of mutual importance into the future through multiple 

avenues, such as regular customer surveys, shareholder meetings and analyst calls. Importantly, stakeholder engagement 

is prioritised as we endeavour to place stakeholder considerations foremost in those topics most material to us.

In accordance with our last sustainability exercise, we stress five stakeholder groups based on their influence and 

involvement with New Toyo:

• 

Customers

• 

Suppliers

• 

Investors

• 

Board of Directors

• 

Employees (represented by management personnel from our SP division units)

In line with our expectations, no incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and economic 

areas occurred for year 2019. In addition, there were no recorded concerns regarding breaches of customer privacy or 

losses of customer data, and New Toyo was involved in zero legal actions brought for anti-competitive behaviour or 

anti-trust and monopoly practices. Each year we strive to uphold this superlative record by guaranteeing that compliance 

minimises risk exposure in terms of reputational damage.

Investing in dependable, long-term value for our stakeholders continues to be our highest priority. With sustainability 

governance present throughout our operating environments, we are better able to coordinate economic, environmental 

and social performance, as guided by our core values and culture and following our top management’s lead.

OUR APPROACH

MATERIALITY

We supplement the traditional means of financial reporting to additionally strive in sharing material information with 

our stakeholders on vital matters. Material topics may influence their estimations of New Toyo or affect our long-term 

financial performance; therefore, the concerns of stakeholders are valued in identifying the material ESG topics.

For our materiality assessment exercise of year 2017, we engaged an independent sustainability consultant, and the 

resulting survey indicated that our stakeholders were satisfied with our management of the material topics. In the 

formal process of the survey:

• 

Topics were first identified and validated by the Sustainability Reporting Committee

• 

Stakeholders were invited to rank the topics by their significance 

• 

Material ESG topics were identified through means of a materiality assessment workshop with the presence of 

the Board and top management

New Toyo has formulated the 2019 sustainability report in line with these ESG topics and guided by the GRI Principles. 

Targets for material topics ranked as High Priority and necessary control mechanisms were designed to benchmark our 

performance against these targets. To our satisfaction, all targets were achieved or maintained. We aim to continuously 

evaluate and improve our performance on material ESG topics going forward. 

Reviewing the materiality of ESG topics will ensure their continued relevance to any fluctuation in the business environment.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019






Our customers recognise us in word of mouth marketing 

that provides evidence of our achievements. As a global 

brand, we are committed to excellence in customer service. 

With highly satisfied and engaged customers, we highlight 

our position relative to our competitors and are in the 

forefront to capture new opportunities. Customer visits 

to our facilities and audits are welcome as they provide 

customers with a better understanding of our people and 

our production activities.

An excellent customer experience begins with initial contact 

with the customer, followed by identifying the customers’ 

needs and then providing on time delivery of top quality 

products and acclaimed after sales support. 

Our goal is a smooth and timely delivery of product supply 

to our customers, but, on occasion, there are situations 

in which extenuating circumstances affect our operations, 

as well as the businesses of our customers, and hamper 

our ability to deliver to the intended destination. Locally 

adverse conditions, such as floods, earthquakes and political 

instability, may result in scenarios of impairment to the 

supply chain. As part of our pledge to our customers, we 

regularly review safety measures that reduce and alleviate 

external risks. Our business continuity management system 

includes back up contingency sites within the Group 

and our customers’ supply chain, and its effectiveness is 

periodically reviewed to promote the efficient activation of 

our procedures. Options may include sourcing alternative 

sites for raw materials and rerouting goods to continue 

supply. 

Based on our customers’ feedback, the quality control 

department will coordinate with the proper departments 

to jointly investigate and determine the fundamental 

source of the problem, followed by recommendations for 

appropriate actions to avoid future occurrences. 

Our goal is to be continually engaged and coordinated 

with our customers while responding closely to their 

needs. Such engagement is a material ESG topic ranked 

highly by our stakeholders. One way we achieve this 

is through our annual customer satisfaction survey. In 

2019, we received an average rating of 4 out of 5 for 

our SP division on both product quality and the quality 

of packaging for products supplied, and we will continue 

to maintain this good rating.











Our business units are certified according to the 



ISO9001 Standard to ensure that our products 



meet the needs of our customers while according 



to statutory and regulatory requirements:



• 

New Toyo Aluminium Paper Product Co., 



Pte Ltd: ISO9001 (2015)



• 

Paper Base Converting Sdn Bhd: ISO9001 



(2015)



• 

New Toyo (Vietnam) Aluminium Paper 



Packaging Co., Ltd: ISO9001 (2015)



OUR CUSTOMERS



TARGET 

We aim to maintain at minimum 

a ‘good’ performance rating.

RESULT

We continue to maintain a ‘good’ 

performance rating in year 2019.

Our customers are consistently offered excellent 

services and quality products as we consider their 

satisfaction to be our success as we enhance our 

reputation in the industry. To uphold this status, we 

continuously engage with our customers through active 

contact and seek feedback for the on-going resilience 

of our relationships.

14



NEW TOYO INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LTD








At New Toyo, we believe that our employees’ 

performance is paramount to the success of our organisation. 

To enhance our employee satisfaction and effectiveness, 

we embed a culture of inclusiveness in the organisation 

and offer on-going training and development, to further 

our positive relationship with them.

OUR EMPLOYEES

Our workforce totalled 502 members within our SP division by the end of 2019. This amounted to a profile of male and 

female employees at 396 and 106 respectively in our workforce. The majority of employees are based in the production 

factory engaged in physical work. This results in the company attracting more male employees who are more prevalent in 

the manufacturing industry. (see Figure 1.1)

All staff are full-time members with the exception of two part-time female employees. 37.3% are engaged for fixed-

term or temporary contracts that cover between one and three years. 30.4% of our workforce in Malaysia and 100% of 

our workforce in Vietnam fall under collective bargaining agreements. Aiding our pledge to safeguard worker rights, we 

follow the SA8000 standard at our Vietnam operations. This standard enhances our ability to develop, maintain and apply 

socially acceptable practices in the workplace.

Total Employees by Employment Contract by Gender and Region (Figure 1.1)

EMPLOYEE ATTRITION AND NEW HIRE RATES

Remuneration and career progression opportunities are competitively designed to attract and retain our valued staff. In 

2019, employee turnovers and new hires were at 30.0% and 18.8% respectively. The high employee turnover rate was 

mainly due to group restructuring to focus on our core business as well as to increase the productivity and efficiency of 

our overall operation.

The total employee turnover rate increased by 8.8% in year 2019 (in 2018: 21.2%). This increase resulted from our Group 

operation restructuring, in which 22.1% of the employee turnover rate (see Figure 1.3) was attributable to Vietnam, up 

from 14.7% the previous year. In detail, 111 of employees left from our Vietnam operations due to cessation of our core 

paper business operation in the 4th quarter of 2019, of which 53.3%, or 56 employees, were aged below 30.

OUR PEOPLE

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

At New Toyo, we provide a workplace environment that 

is inclusive and respectful of each employee, regardless 

of age, gender, ethnicity, nationality or sexual orientation. 

We assess the performance of new and current 

employees by considering their merit, qualifications 

and job-related achievements. The feedback, ideas and 

suggestions of our employees are of topmost value, and 

we consider this with no regard to rank as we create a 

workplace conducive to retaining and engaging a diverse 

pool of talent.

We achieve increased business resilience by properly 

understanding and attending to the evolving nature of our 

supply chain. Innovation and future success rest on having 

a diverse team where employees are able to contribute 

their views safely and with comfort and flexibility. 

Encouraging diversity and inclusion allows us to better 

connect with our customers as we identify their needs 

with respect to differing social, ethnic and geographical 

backgrounds.  



TARGET

While we value workforce gender parity, we 

understand that the nature of our business 

tends to attract more male than female 

workers. Our goal of achieving a practical 

target with regard to this material ESG of 

employee diversity is demonstrated by the 

increase in female employees and recruitment 

in the older age bracket in 2018. We will 

continue to strive towards a gender and age 

diverse workforce.

RESULT

In 2019, we continue to maintain the balance 

between gender and age as per of our 

objective.

ANTI-DISCRIMINATION AND 

HARASSMENT-FREE ENVIRONMENT

New Toyo maintains a workplace culture without animosity 

where each worker is given due respect. Alleged 

discrimination or any other form of abuse or harassment 

is given high priority and severe measures are in place 

to prevent and settle any incident should it arise. This 

includes discrimination based on age, ancestry, marital 

status, national origin, race, religion, gender or veteran 

status, among others. Harassment is considered abusive, 

insulting or offensive behaviour, such as sexual advances, 

speech with sexual comments and attempted procurement 

of sexual favours.

GRIEVANCE MECHANISM

Should an employee experience or be a witness to any 

form of discrimination or harassment, he or she has 

immediate access to our Group legal department, and 

the identity of the reporting party will receive rigorous 

confidentiality. Our managers are tasked with prompt 

submission of any case and will immediately notify the 

company’s senior management or our Human Resources 

department if they learn of an incident of harassment or 

discrimination. The policies are outlined in the Employee 

Handbook Recruitment Policy and Guidelines on Selection 

and Hiring. Human Resources keep tabs on our hiring 

processes to make sure discrimination is avoided and 

keeps statistical data reported to the Group HR Admin 

Manager quarterly. No reported incidents of discrimination 

were noted for 2019.

OPEN COMMUNICATION 

Our performance evaluation system offers a means of 

back and forth feedback among our employees and their 

reporting officers. Through this performance evaluation 

system, we are able to view employee inputs and offer 

recognition and rewards based on their contributions 

while encouraging them in performance improvement and 

career development.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

At New Toyo, our workplace philosophy rests on progress 

in the professional careers of employees and their 

engagement in lifelong learning. This gives avenues for 

employees to grow professionally, continually meeting 

the chance for skills upgrading and training. External 

and in-house career training programmes allow our 

employees to achieve excellence in their work and reach 

their fullest potential. Financial assistance is offered as 

well as subsidies for external courses if workers take the 

opportunity to further extend their skillsets as desired 

or needed.

We promote employees from within where applicable in 

the event that they demonstrate the potential and drive 

as well as skills when vacant positions arise rather than 

recruiting externally. Our appraisal and profiling process 

allows us to search for best candidates to assume the 

leadership roles within the organisation. Human capital 

development remains a priority as we advance our 

planning and promote our growth strategies.



TARGET

Our 2019 Target is zero discrimination 

incidents.

RESULT

We maintained zero discrimination 

incidents for year 2019.

OUR PEOPLE



TARGET

We will continue to explore ways to encourage learning and assist our employees 

in harnessing their talents for their own professional development, which will 

ultimately benefit our organisation. For 2019, the focus is on increasing training 

hours for the non-clerical group.

RESULT

The average training hours per employee for the non-clerical group was increased 

120% to 8.6 hours (FY2018: 3.9 hours).

Year 2019 marks our third year of sustainability reporting, and, as previously, we report following the 2016 version 

of the GRI 403 standard on Occupational Health and Safety. Our aim is to report in alignment with the updated 

2018 GRI 403 standard on Occupational Health and Safety when we submit our sustainability report for financial 

year 2020. This updated 2018 GRI 403 provides measures and instruments to track “high-consequence work related 

injuries”.

Our vigorous risk management system at New Toyo is able to evaluate the system’s effectiveness and safeguard its 

relevance and ability to handle matters of health and safety. Please refer to the Risk Management section on page 

11 of the report for further information.

Our workforce is exposed to certain risks while forking in the factory setting, and workplace health and safety 

remains one of our top priorities. At New Toyo, we have developed detailed procedures and policies to limit and 

foresee potential risks in terms of when operations are on-going as well as prior to the start of operations. We 

guarantee adherence to all relevant industry regulations and have established a systematic approach to violations of 

safety protocols and the advancement of a culture of safety awareness. Health and safety receive the same attention 

as traditionally identified critical business activities with regular reporting, evaluations and assessments.

Employees are instructed to maintain a safe working environment and to avoid actions resulting in injury to themselves 

or others; in such events, they immediately report any potentially hazardous situation to management. They are 

required to observe and follow all safety and environmental regulations outlined in operation instructions, including 

those detailing the use of necessary safety equipment where relevant.

As our responsibility and duty, we pledge to provide a safe and accident-free work environment for our employees. 

While we recognise that no workplace risk, such as cuts, bruises and sprains, may be fully anticipated, we adopt 

every precautionary measure to minimise and reduce workplace accidents. Safety protocol refresher courses are 

regularly attended to further ingrain the importance of safety in our employees’ work habits, and they are mandated 

to adhere to safety procedures at all times for their safety and well-being.

Our low absentee rates provide evidence of our resolve to encourage the highest standard of health and safety.

ENVIRONMENT

Having concern for and responsibility towards the 

environment is vital to ensuring our long-term business 

sustainability. In this, we endeavour to follow all 

applicable laws and regulations related to environmental 

issues with strict adherence and compliance at all times. 

We believe that every organisation is tasked with responsibility towards environmental stewardship. We understand 

the importance of environmental matters and rigorously follow each environmental law. As a measure towards our 

long-term sustainability, we source input from our stakeholders to reduce the environmental impact of our activities. 

No incidents of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations, such as those connected to air toxins, 

effluents and waste, occurred this year. We aim to honour this admirable performance going forward in the 

advancement of our businesses. 

Our machines operate by utilising more electricity when switching from a disconnected to a running mode. Keeping 

this in mind, we organise our manufacturing cycles efficiently as we attempt to keep unnecessary starts and stops 

down. Regular maintenance of the machines helps us keep them running optimally while reducing breakdown, all 

contributing to reduce our carbon footprint. We also advise our customers to use water-based inks as they are 

more environmentally friendly. 

Our environmental policies and programmes are regularly updated to see to their responsiveness and continued 

implementation. 

In year 2018, we set the KPIs for all relevant business units that cover materials utilisation, work scheduling, machine 

upkeep and staffing to keep track of and continually maintain high efficiency.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019










WATER

Water scarcity remains a global issue of concern. This covers also tropical regions, such as Malaysia and Singapore, 

where we base our operating units. However, water is not identified as a material topic for New Toyo’s operations 

as our water use is not as intensive as that of other heavy industries. In any event, we continue to evaluate such 

environmental considerations, particularly as New Toyo has facilities in water scarce countries (Dubai), and we responsibly 

check our water use aiming for opportunities to reduce water usage. For comparability purposes, this being only 

the third report published by New Toyo, we continue to report in alignment with the 2016 version of the GRI 303 

standard on Water. We look forward to reporting in accordance with the updated 2018 GRI 303 standard on Water 

and Effluents with the publication of our sustainability report for financial year 2020. 

Water is supplied by municipal water sources for all our operations. The total volume of water used in 2019 decreased 

to 29,427 cubic metres, down from 33,194 cubic metres in 2018. This was mainly due to higher water consumption 

in 2018 attributable to a printing site set-up encompassing construction and upgrades works in Malaysia.  

ENVIRONMENT

MATERIALS

While we make our products from pre-processed raw materials and so do not ourselves process pulp, we acknowledge 

that the production of paper materials does leave an environmental footprint that may impact local communities. We 

therefore implement an appropriate resource conservation plan to recognise this.

Considering ourselves to be a responsible and devoted company, we do our utmost to follow the principles encapsulated 

in Our Approach and Our Sustainability Ethos and variously limit results to the environment through effective planning 

and excellent product delivery. Our products are of the highest quality as we also commit to a responsible use of 

materials in our operations. By reducing the number of rejects (both internally and externally), we have a direct impact 

on material, energy, labour and transportation costs involved in replacing products. Our methods allow us to minimise 

wastage and obtain a maximised operational efficiency that enhances our customers, shareholders and the environment. 

One of our strategies for impact reduction and the goal to be environmentally friendly is to use recycled paper cores 

to package our materials wherever possible. For the present year, 10.2% (2018: 12.1%) of input materials were paper 

cores made from recycled materials. In our processes, materials generated that are capable of recycling resulted in 

2,761 metric tonnes (2018: 3,909 metric tonnes) of scrap materials sent for processing during 2019.

ENVIRONMENT

ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

Lowering our energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions enables us to increase operational efficiency 

while also being environment friendly as we prioritise energy efficiency and the use of renewable fuel sources. This 

aids global efforts to counter the effects of climate change. Our sustainability reports welcome opportunities to share 

our headline figures and trend data as we continue to work on our carbon footprint.

New Toyo’s internal Energy Conservation Policy and Procedure, published since 2011, is obligatory reading for all 

headquartered employees and offers guidelines on measures our employees can take to conserve energy. The guidelines 

include setting air conditioning systems to 24°C and reducing energy consumption where possible. Items for consideration 

are keeping doors closed, turning off lights and enabling the power management features of personal computers. 

Following this guide, our employees can show their support for our initiative to improve our energy and emissions profile.

We continuously oversee our supply, manufacturing and distribution processes so they are at the optimal level as a 

way of mitigating our carbon footprint. We ensure, for example, that containers are fully loaded to their ideal safe 

capacity wherever possible. Our energy intensity for 2019 was 425 kilojoules per dollar revenue. One focus for the 

future is to further bolster this aspect of our operational efficiency.

Our energy intensity calculations include fuel3 and electricity used for our processes, with electricity consumption 

based on electricity bills. We source fuel in diesel form as well as biomass (from compressed wood tablets), which is 

considered an environmentally friendly form of energy. 

We encourage the acquisition of energy efficient products where possible.

NEW TOYO INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LTD








RESPONSIBLE SOURCING

ETHICS IN BUSINESS DEALINGS

We hold that ethical business dealings are the right and only ways to prosper as a business. We look to our suppliers 

to entrench mechanisms for the prevention of conflicts of interest, excessive gifts and entertainment, bribery and 

corruption. The company’s established code of conduct covers topics regarding ethical conduct, including conflicts of 

interest within or beyond the Group, and itemises a policy on the acceptance of gifts, hospitality or other favours that 

all our employees are tasked to acknowledge and strictly adhere to.  

Finally, creating a healthy business environment by upholding the principle of anti-competitive, trust and monopoly 

practices enables us to garner positive perceptions and construct a reputable status in the market. 

Our major customers have taken steps to be leaders in the sustainability arena. With sustainability becoming a 

priority for these customers, we aim to match their high standards with conscientious procurement from a social and 

environmental perspective. New Toyo’s Supplier CoC covers areas such as ethics in business dealings, adherence to 

applicable laws and regulations and environmental stewardship, and we encourage our suppliers to promote these 

values in their business practices.

ENVIRONMENT

At New Toyo, we stress environmental concerns in the same way we prioritise all other business practices. All suppliers 

are required to be good stewards of the environment and to comply with all applicable environmental laws and 

regulations. We encourage our suppliers to proactively encounter new ways to minimise the consumption of natural 

resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve waste management.

As a responsible business partner, we endeavour to 

ensure that our suppliers adhere closely to our Supplier’s 

Code of Conduct established as our core principle to 

guarantee we conduct business only with proper contacts.
