CEO’s Statement on Sustainability 

On behalf of the Board of Directors (“Board”), I am pleased to present SunMoon Food Company 

Limited’s (“SunMoon” or the “Company”) Sustainability Report for the twelve (12) months ended 31 

March 2019. 

About the Sustainability Report 

This report has been prepared with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative Standards (“GRI”) and 

covers environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) performance of all business divisions and 

subsidiaries which are under the Group’s financial and operational control.  

Information presented in the report has been extracted from our internal records and documents to 

ensure accuracy using internationally accepted measurement data units. Unless otherwise stated, the 

information represents that of the Group. 

As SunMoon has always embedded sustainable practices in its activities, it welcomes the release of 

the sustainability reporting guidelines issued by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

(“SGX-ST”) in July 2016. This initiative has provided us the platform to formalise our sustainability 

policies and procedures; consolidate our existing efforts; communicate to our stakeholders; and plan 

further for the future. 

CEO Statement  

Here at SunMoon, we are deeply committed in ensuring sustainable development of our business by 

engaging our stakeholders and giving back to the community. Besides being responsible for setting 

the overall strategy and management of the Group, our Board is also active in considering 

sustainability issues such as the environmental and social factors affecting us as part of our strategic 

formulation. The approval of the Board is required and essential for any matter which is likely to have 

a material impact on the Group, including issues relating to sustainability as well as corporate social 

responsibility. The Company takes committed view towards sustainable practices and issues and as 

such, our Board will ultimately oversee all sustainability related issues. The Sustainability Officer will 

be responsible for the major and overall direction of the sustainability report and processes and 

oversees the management of sustainability within the Group. While we have not sought independent 

assurance, we rely on our internal processes to verify the accuracy of ESG performance data and the 

information presented in the report. 

Looking back to the past development of the Group, and based on future trends of the industry, I 

support and will continue to build on the strategic framework already put in place by the former CEO, 

i.e. network x geography x product (N x G x P). Therefore, in the new fiscal year, my management 

team and I will make and execute relevant action plans under this framework.  

 

There are two key words in my work plan for the SunMoon Group this year: Simplicity, and Focus. 

SunMoon is not a company that has unlimited resources. We have to constantly strategise how best 

to leverage our limited resources to increase our market share, and drive the transformation of 

SunMoon from a traditional supply chain company to a value-adding supply chain company. 

Therefore, the word “Focus” is extremely important at this moment. We will focus on China market this 

year, refine the SunMoon brand, and simultaneously continue to develop and expand the distribution 

network in the Southeast Asian market for Fuji apples. 

 

From the operating efficiency and cost perspective, I will simplify and streamline the operations, cut all 

unnecessary costs, utilise our comparative advantages, and encourage our teams to achieve the 

highest level of efficiency at the lowest cost.

CEO Statement (Cont’d) 

 

In the first quarter of the new financial year, I have spent considerable time to observe and analyse 

SunMoon’s team and businesses from all aspects. At the same time, I have reflected about 

SunMoon’s past, present and future. I believe there are many great opportunities in enhancing the 

business team and strategies for SunMoon. Therefore, I will do my utmost to rebuild the team and 

upgrade the strategies, helping SunMoon to rejuvenise its brand, and enhance its market influence, 

and further improve the overall situation of the company. 

 

Our new business model will feature two core strategies: 

 

(1) Focusing on the China market, and enhancing the SunMoon brand value in China. 

 

We will further build the SunMoon brand by setting up an independent and professional team 

to operate the business in China. We will further leverage on the foundation of the strong 

SunMoon product branding to build SunMoon into a brand for its distribution channel. 

 

(2) Expanding the markets outside China, and building the distributor network into the 

SunMoon’s brand ecosystem.  

 

We will concentrate our efforts on the Southeast Asian market and establish a better 

distribution system in the initial stage. We will distribute the products in Southeast Asian 

market leveraging on Yiguo’s commanding fresh food sourcing capability in China and strong 

bargaining power on prices with suppliers worldwide.  

 

At the same time, we aim to strengthen SunMoon both as the product and channel brand through 

continuous strengthening and expansion of the distribution network. 

 

I believe SunMoon can achieve even more than the above. I hope SunMoon will gradually return to its 

business roots, with its businesses becoming simpler, more focused, and better executed. 

 

I believe that with the determined efforts of our new team, SunMoon will execute its new business 

strategies effectively and achieve its goals. I have full confidence in the performance of the Group in 

the coming year. We look forward to that! 

 

 

Mr Zhang Ye  

Chief Executive Officer

GRI 201: ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE  

 

Due to the nature of SunMoon’s business, climate change and weather will invariably have a direct 

impact on our products. Bad weather conditions caused by climate change will have a negative 

impact on product quality and quantity. In 2018, bad weather conditions directly affected the quality 

and quantity of apple harvests, in particular, in the People’s Republic of China. We recognize the 

impact of climate change on our revenues and so endeavour to involve all our partners to participate 

and engage in sustainability practices.  

SunMoon has received CDG and MRA grants from the government. CDG stands for Capability 

Development Grant in financial year ended 31 March 2019. CDG is a financial assistance program by

the Singapore government to help businesses build capabilities in key areas such as improving the 

efficiency of technology a company uses and enhancement of financial management. The Market 

Readiness Assistance (MRA) grant assists the Company with overseas marketing costs and aims to 

facilitate the growth of Singapore companies overseas. These grants gave the Company support to 

improve our capabilities.  

GRI 204: PROCUREMENT PRACTICES 

SunMoon has implemented improved global procurement strategies, and manages a carefully 

controlled process based on the “SunMoon Quality Assurance” standard. Fruits from certified 

plantations are selected according to the “SunMoon Quality Assurance” standard, a critical checklist 

of freshness, quality, and safety as demanded by our discerning customers; a reputation also backed 

up by internationally recognised accreditations. 

As fresh fruits are perishable goods, we do not keep large inventories and our operational model is 

mainly to work with our suppliers so as to undertake direct shipping of the fresh fruits. Accordingly, 

our procurement budget is substantially spent on suppliers.                  

GRI 308: SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 

All suppliers must be approved according to SunMoon’s set of selection criteria to ensure product 

quality and branding. Complementing quality assurances and our brand, we at SunMoon believes 

strongly in protecting and caring for our environment. As such, we at SunMoon will make a 

conscientious effort in developing and, in due course, implement environmental assessment 

processes.  

 

GRI 401: EMPLOYMENT 

There are 6 new employee hires during the reporting period with 2 below 30 years of age, 3 are 

between 30 to 50 years of age. The makeup of the new hires comprises of 5 female and 1 male.  

SunMoon also provides various benefits to full time employees such as free medical services at one 

of our panel clinics, dental and specialist medical benefits. Additionally, we are supportive of family life 

and work-life balance and offer various types of leave for our employees such as parental, marriage, 

maternity, paternity, childcare, exam, and compassionate leave. However, none of our employees 

utilised their parental leave during the reporting period.  

GRI 404: TRAINING AND EDUCATION 

As part of SunMoon’s policy of constant training and professional development for our employees, we 

frequently send our employees to various training programs in order to upgrade their skills and

competencies; this improves employee satisfaction and helps our staff perform even better at their 

jobs. For example, our marketing team was sent to event such as the “AI in Finance; Marketing staff 

was sent for Certificate in Digital Marketing (SME)” talk and our IT staff were sent to develop their 

skills in new technologies like blockchain at the event “Hands on Practical Applications on 

Blockchain”. On an ongoing basis, the Company also seeks to ensure that senior management are 

considered for leadership training to ensure that their skills and knowledge remain relevant.  

The average hour of training per year per employee amounted to 9 hours. All of our employees have 

annual performance reviews being carried out as part of our Company’s policy. They receive regular 

performance and career development reviews as feedback so that they can continue to improve.
