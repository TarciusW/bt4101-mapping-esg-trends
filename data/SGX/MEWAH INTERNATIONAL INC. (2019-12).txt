SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019




1. 

Mewah International Inc has worked unswervingly to 

integrate corporate responsibility and sustainability 

across every aspect of our business. We published 

our first sustainability report in year 2017. Through 

the sustainability report, we endeavour to provide 

our stakeholders with an understanding of our 

sustainability approach, the measurements we have 

put in place at all our operating sites and our approach 

in building a sustainable business. 

2. 

In this Sustainability Report 2019, we remain focus 

on the core areas which are spelled out in Mewah 

Sustainability Framework. We seek to strengthen this 

framework by continue promoting sustainability and 

putting sustainability at the heart of our business and 

leadership. 

3. 

We have sought to seek guidance from the Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standard index for boundary 

settings, focusing on performance data and reporting 

on aspects which are most significant, as reflected 

in our Sustainability Framework and our Sustainable 

Palm Oil Policy. 

4. 

The content of this report focuses primarily on our 

refineries and manufacturing plants in Malaysia and 

Singapore. It also features sustainability performance 

of our palm oil mill operations in Indonesia. There has 

been no restatement of information in the scope of 

our reporting from the previous report. We commit 

to progressively extend the scope of our reporting to 

cover other business segments more comprehensively 

in forthcoming reports as we increase our reporting 

capacity and understanding of our new businesses. 

5. 

In order to define the contents of this report, we have 

worked with our stakeholders to identify our key risk 

areas. Such data is collected and analysed to further 

discern and design improvement plans qualitatively 

and annually. 

6. 

In relation to our Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and Crude 

Palm Kernel Oil (CPKO) supply chain, the reporting 

will be based on policies, traceability milestones and 

progress in Traceability to Mill (TTM) &amp; Traceability to 

Plantation (TTP). The performance data will also focus 

on identifying material ESG (Environmental, Social, and 

Governance) factors in all our manufacturing sites.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ 

STATEMENT FOR 2019

Welcome to Mewah’s Sustainability Report 2019. 

This report presents an overview of our Sustainability 

performance, which we measure against objectives 

and targets we set based on the identified key material 

Environmental, Social &amp; Governance (ESG) factors where 

we have direct influence and impact on environments, 

societies and economies. 

The framework of Mewah’s sustainability reporting is 

consistent with Singapore Exchange’s (SGX) Guidelines 

and Rule on Sustainability Reporting. These guidelines 

are in line with increasing investor demand for sustainable 

returns. This report is also prepared in accordance 

with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability 

Reporting Standards. It is part of our strategic planning 

process to assess the various sustainability issues and 

we have also set out our priorities for the next reporting 

period and beyond. 

Since our first published Sustainability Report in 2017, 

we have worked consistently to ensure our disclosures 

meet the expectations of our stakeholder groups. In this 

third Sustainability Report, we have raised the bar further 

by expanding our reporting scope. The sustainability 

performance of our recent acquisition of palm oil mill in 

Indonesia is included in this report for a more complete 

monitoring. 

To maintain our continuing success and to deliver 

sustainable returns to our shareholders, we are committed 

to supporting and contributing towards the 17 United 

Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). All 17 

SDGs are closely integrated to our identified material ESG 

factors defined under Mewah Sustainability Framework. 

By setting the SDGs targets as the blueprint of our 

sustainability framework, we are confident that we can 

further improve our commitment towards ESG factors  

set out by SGX to better measure risks and opportunities 

within sight as well as manage for future returns. 

The theme of this Sustainability Report is “Making a 

Difference”. We are at a key moment in the evolution of 

sustainability in our business. Our world is transforming 

at a rapid pace along with consumer expectations and 

competitive landscape. It is undeniable to the fact where 

shared and concerted effort from all stakeholder groups 

is required to “make a difference” in order to achieve 

positive progress in SDGs as well as towards our overall 

sustainability objectives. 

Minimizing our environmental impact has been the 

top priority under Mewah’s Sustainability Framework. 

Articulating our ambitions for sustainable energy, we 

made a bold move to invest in cogeneration plant in our 

refineries. The investment in cogeneration technology at 

our refineries has significantly reduce the Greenhouse Gas 

(GHG) emission footprint of our operations. Furthermore, 

it has presented the Group with a valuable opportunity to 

strengthen our commitment to energy conservation and 

effective climate change mitigation. 

Our efforts to strengthen Mewah’s position as a leading 

producer of sustainable palm oil continued throughout 

2019, with focus on the implementation of our Sustainable 

Palm Oil Policy and in promotion of Malaysia’s national 

sustainability standard, the Malaysian Sustainable Palm 

Oil Certification (MSPO). MSPO is known as an important 

catalyst to enhance the sustainability standards across 

all oil palm value-chains in Malaysia palm oil industry. In 

September 2019, the Group becomes the first palm oil 

refinery in Malaysia to produce and export first shipment  

of MSPO-certified RBDPO to international market. 

Looking forward, the Board is fully committed to 

continue working closely with Management, to identify 

opportunities relevant to the long-term success of Mewah  

and to determine the material ESG risks to be managed.  

The Management are supported in this regard by Group 

Sustainability Team comprising senior executives from 

functions across the organization. As we continue to 

develop our core edible oils &amp; fats business and invest 

in growth opportunities, strong governance remains 

the cornerstone of our business. We aspire to continue 

enriching lives by being a positive influence for our people, 

the environment and the society that underpin Mewah’s 

sustainability strategy.

Focus Area 1: Minimizing Our Environmental Footprint







MAKING A DIFFERENCE 

– IN ACTION

Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

Utilising less water with the increasing food production to satisfy the world’s 

demand of a higher population has become one of the greatest challenges to 

the world. Our water management strategies focus in safeguarding water quality, 

reduction in water consumption and optimisation of water use. 

Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

We have put in place renewable energy resources (cogeneration plant) as a 

clean energy initiative to improve the use of renewable energy sources and 

reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

Achieving responsible consumption and production is essential to ensure that 

the natural resources we depend on are not depleted and used efficiently. We 

maintain 100% reuse and recycle of solid waste generated from our factory. We 

will explore further reduction or recycling of waste in our operations. 

12

Mewah International Inc.




A 

t Mewah, we continue to evaluate and make 

changes in our operations and throughout 

our value chain so as to minimise our 

manufacturing carbon emissions and improve 

our environmental footprint per metric-ton of product 

produced. We focus our efforts on key areas where 

our portfolio and business scale allow us to have the 

biggest impact that offer the biggest opportunities for our 

business.

We drive collaboration throughout our supply chain in an 

effort to reduce our climate impact associated with our 

raw materials processing till delivering our products to the 

hands of our buyers. 

This focus area covers our impact on various 

environmental footprints in terms of: 

1) 

Carbon Management 

2) 

Water management

3) 

Waste management 

 

The processing of edible oils is both complex and energy-

intensive. Mewah’s processing plants differ in capacity, 

capability and range of products. This brings about 

different environmental footprint in different facilities. 

Therefore each plant has different greenhouse gas 

(GHG), water and waste emissions. 

13

Sustainability  Report 2019


Focus Area 1: Minimizing Our Environmental Footprint

CORE AREA 1: 

CARBON MANAGEMENT 

At Mewah, we are mindful that increasing carbon 

footprint has profound effects on the environment. We 

are committed to progressively reduce greenhouse gas 

(GHG) emissions by identifying significant pollutants 

and emissions and implementing plans to mitigate or 

minimise them. 

The primary contributing factors of GHG emissions in 

our production sites are: 

i. 

Electricity consumption, 

ii. 

Chemicals consumption, 

iii. 

Fuel consumption. 

Our GHG emissions from our production activity are 

calculated using the ISCC methodology and includes 

data from all processing facilities under Mewah Group. 

These numbers are compiled on a monthly basis, 

evaluated and projects are in place to further improve 

these consumption figures.

1.1.1 GHG Emissions in our Production Sites

Our greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) index depicts 

the results of quantity of GHGs emitted per metric-ton 

of product processed or packed in our manufacturing 

premises. The measurement is in kilograms of carbon 

dioxide-equivalent per metric ton of product (kg CO2e/

MT). In 2019, the GHG emission achieved in our operation 

is 39.51 kgCO2/MT production the average GHG 

measured in our palm oil mill operation is 936.75 kgCO2/

MT CPO. On the other hand, the electricity consumption 

in our operation has improved by around 18% to 11.37 kwh/

MT product from 14.01 kwh/MT in 2018. We note that the 

GHG emission in our operation is on a rising trend and we 

are implementing efforts to reduce carbon emission in 

our operation. Such effort including commencement of 

an assessment project to help further improve our carbon 

footprint. 

As we keep expanding our business and investments, 

we are mindful that of our responsibility to minimize our 

manufacturing emission and improve our environmental 

footprint. As such, in managing our day-to-day business, 

we remain committed to low carbon operations and evident 

from our target for GHG emissions. We seek to reduce our 

GHG emissions by being more efficient in our production 

abilities as well as seeking more environmentally friendly 

sources of energy. 

Carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) that is 

produced directly and indirectly with our manufacturing activities. The standard unit of 

measurement for carbon footprint is carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). GHG Emissions 

is an all-encompassing measurement for the carbon footprint and energy efficiency in 

our production.

1.1.2 Energy efficiency in our Production Sites

Articulating our ambitions for a sustainable future, energy 

efficiency has been one of the top priorities of Mewah 

Group in the way we develop and manage our business. 

For the past two decades, we have continuously innovated, 

invested in green technology and improved our operating 

efficiencies. Since 2018, driven by our commitment to play 

integral part in mitigating the effects of climate change, 

one of our refinery introduced high efficiency air-cooled 

compressor and high efficiency natural circulation high 

pressure boiler to our palm oil refinery plant. These 

projects are part of our low carbon strategies with the aim 

to achieve higher energy and resource efficiency.

Cogeneration, also known as combined heat and power (CHP) is a clean, 

efficient and cost effective choice for power production. It transforms a 

single source of energy (natural gas) into two useful energies. In our case, 

electricity and thermal steam energy are both generated from a single 

natural gas turbine generator and heat recovery steam generator. In the 

past, we relied completely on national grid power plant for electricity and 

packaged boilers for steam. These conventional facilities are far less 

efficient than the cogeneration plant. With higher efficiency, less fuel is 

consumed for the same of amount of energy output and thus it not only 

conserves energy but also at the same time produces less greenhouse 

gases and other air pollutants. 

It is estimated that we can reduce the greenhouse gas emission by about 

26 %, equivalent to reduction of 16,200 ton CO2 per year 

compared to the conventional operating scheme by 

producing electricity and steam using cogeneration 

plant. The necessary investment in cogeneration 

plant presents Mewaholeo with a valuable 

opportunity to strengthen our commitment 

to energy conservation and effective climate 

change mitigation.

CHONG KEOH YING,

Assistant Project Manager, Mewaholeo Industries Sdn. Bhd.

In 2019, we made a bold move to invest in cogeneration 

plant replacing packaged boiler in our refineries. 

Cogeneration technology is an energy-efficient solution 

for facilities that require both thermal energy and electricity. 

The operational efficiencies realized by cogeneration 

plants provide great benefits to both industries and 

consumers. It uses less fuel and emits lower amounts of 

pollution when producing electrical and thermal energy 

than stand-alone electrical and thermal energy facilities. 

The new cogeneration plant investment is an example of 

our action in using energy more efficiently.

Protecting our water source

Water is a vital resource for our operations and the 

communities in our supply chain. We strive to continue 

to improve our water efficiency by recycling and reusing 

where appropriate in the palm oil production process. 

The quality of water discharged from our refineries 

and palm oil mill are constantly monitored to make sure 

the discharge quality in within compliance of national 

environmental limit.

Palm Oil Mill Operations 

Our mill accounts for the majority of water consumption 

in our palm oil operations. It draws water supplies from 

local waterways and wells in order to process FFB. In 

addition to that, we also draw water for household use. 

In 2019, the water consumption intensity at palm oil mill is 

reported at 1.75m³ per MT FFB in year 2019. We note that 

the amount of water used by our mill to process 1MT of 

FFB is slightly higher than normal industry levels. 

Wastewater from FFB processing at our mill, palm oil 

mill effluent (POME) is released into local waterways 

after treated. We comply with local environmental 

limits in order to minimise the risk of disturbance to the 

aquatic environment and the pollution of ground water. 

The annual average BOD and COD level in our palm oil 

mill operation are reported at 94.5ppm and 284.0ppm 

respectively, that is in compliance with all relevant local 

thresholds in 2019.

WASTE MANAGEMENT/ 

WASTE FOOTPRINT 

At Mewah Group, we are adopting a comprehensive 

waste management blueprint that outline action plan 

to understand our waste streams, to measure/baseline 

current waste generation and to complete a facility-

wide waste operations assessment. The objective of our 

water management plan is to assure a sustainable waste 

material management in our production sites by putting in 

place effective measures. 

1) 

Our waste are divided into 4 main categories: 

Category

Type of Waste

A

General Waste

B

Scrap Waste

C

Production Waste

D

Schedule Waste

2) 

The amount of waste generated by each category 

is monitored and attention is brought to the amount 

generated. 

3) 

Identify the 5 Rs’ components in managing waste: 

Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recover and Recycle. 

i. 

Refuse: Refuse to receive unnecessary 

materials will help to eliminate waste from the 

very beginning. It’s simply about saying no and 

looking into reusable alternatives.

ii. 

Reduce: Focus to improve efficiency. To 

establish practices that are capable to reduce 

the amount of waste we generate to help the 

environment.

iii. 

Reuse: Practice to reuse materials without 

change whether for the original or a different 

application instead of throwing them away, or 

pass those unused materials on to others who 

could use them.

iv. 

Recover: To set up ways to recover the energy 

values contained within the waste material.

v. 

Recycle: Many of the things we use every 

day can be recycled. Recycled items are put 

through a process that makes it possible to 

create new products out of the materials from 

the old ones.

Sustainable waste management planning is a massive task that involves scientific 

knowledge, logistical planning, and understanding in order to balance the impact on our 

environment and the cost effectiveness of the process.

1.3.1 Refusing Plastic Waste

In Malaysia, a “Roadmap towards Zero-Single Use 

Plastics 2018 -2030” was launched by Ministry of Energy, 

Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change. 

The roadmap spells out Malaysian government’s plans to 

phase off single-use plastics in the nation by 2030.

In 2019, Mewah introduced “plastic-free campaign” in 

all our operating sites with the purpose to bar the use of 

plastic bags and polystyrene food ware. A practical guide 

was set up and awareness campaign was built to educate 

our employees on the presence of plastic and its harmful 

effects on the environment.

1.3.2 Reducing General Waste

The concept of waste minimization is fundamental in our 

waste management. We encourage our employees to use 

recyclable and bio-degradable bags and containers 

1.3.3 Reusing Scrap Waste

We have a program in place to first reuse all possible 

scrap waste produced, including mild steel, tin, zinc, and 

etc., before being sold for recycling. This cost-effective 

practice ensures that these natural resources are fully 

utilized before being disposed.

1.3.4 Recycling Production Waste

At refineries, Spent Bleaching Earth (SBE) is the major 

source of waste generated from production. It contains 

20-25% of residual oil. Due to the high oil content in the 

Spent Bleaching Earth, its disposal can be considered an 

environmental hazard, as it is highly flammable. 100% of 

SBE generated from our refineries are recycled either as 

raw material for another manufacturer or used as biomass. 

(Note: Bleaching earth is an adsorptive cleansing agent used in 

bleaching process to remove impurities and colour pigments in 

the CPO.) 

At our palm oil mill operations, the common waste 

generated from FFB milling process are solid biomass 

waste and liquid waste. Solid waste comprises empty 

fruit bunches (EFB) of oil palm, fibre and shells. Palm Oil 

Mill Effluent (POME) is the liquid waste generated from 

mill. Both solid and liquid waste is either being recycled 

or reused as organic fertilizer or fuel. We aim to achieve 

zero waste by 2023 – that is to have 100 percent of solid 

and liquid waste from FFB milling process reused and 

recycled. 

1.3.5 Recovering Schedule Waste 

Spent nickel, hydraulic oil, lubricant oil, and waste solvent 

are some of the examples of waste which are generated 

from our production activities. Such by-products are highly 

regulated and they have to be disposed of at recovery sites 

as designated by the Department of Environment (DOE). 

We have complied with these schedule wastes, which 

are recovered and treated by licensed contractors. The 

recovery of such schedule wastes involves the removals 

of harmful or/and contaminated substances, in certain 

instances, the recovery of valuable resources. 

Our 2019 Waste Footprint

Our analysis shows that the production waste accounts for 80% of our total waste footprint. The spent bleaching earth 

generated from our refinery business makes the largest contribution to our waste footprint. This accounts for more than 

50% of our total waste footprint. 

General waste, scrap waste and schedule waste are 10%, 8% and 2% respectively of total waste footprint. 

Production Waste

• Spent bleaching earth (SBE);

• Spent filter aid;

• Empty can/ carton/ lid/ tin 

plate skeleton;

• Palm oil mill effluent;

• Empty fruit bunch;

• Palm kernel shell.

General Waste

– AT A GREATER SCALE



Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

We believe that education is the key to success in life. We supported schools ranging from kindergarten 

to secondary school benefits over 4,500 students. We also work in partnership with a key supplier and an 

important Buyer to carry out “Love Our Children” program that aims to educate children of smallholders on 

child-protection measure against abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence by the adults. 



Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

To conserve and safeguard the marine ecosystem, we implement and enforce the main conventions and 

regulations adopted by International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in our shipping operation, which cover all 

aspects including ship design, equipment, construction, manning, ship operation and waste disposal. 



Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

By boosting socio-economic development, palm oil industry helps in improving the quality of life among rural 

populations. We have been actively engage with underprivileged smallholders particularly in poorer states 

in Malaysia to provide free training in good agricultural practices and hopefully to improve productivity and 

boost their incomes.

Through our supplier group level engagement program, we build up mutual understanding and develop 

parallel Sustainability goals with our suppliers. This enables us to safeguard sustainable production of our 

raw materials. 



Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

At Mewah, we have set up a public grievance platform as well as a grievance mechanism for all stakeholders 

in our supply chain to raise their concern or report any breaches of our policies. It serves as a transparent 

communication channel for us to promote peaceful and inclusive sustainability development. 

Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

We recognize the interdependency of climate and forests. We commit to “No Deforestation” and “No 

Burning” in Mewah’s Sustainable Palm Oil Policy and we will work to ensure our suppliers comply with the 

same commitment.



Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

We believe that partnership with industry stakeholders enable us to create more collaborative innovation. To 

achieve consistent progress in sustainability awareness in our supply chain, we form tripartite collaboration

CORE AREA 2: 

TOWARDS FULL 

TRACEABILITY 

The palm oil supply chain is complex 

and fragmented. Every tier in the supply 

chain plays its essential role in forging 

a path to full traceability. Transparency 

in the supply chain is a critical aspect 

of sustainability since it increases the 

visibility of suppliers and it allows us to 

trace and identify the origin of our raw 

material. 

For every ton of palm oil and palm kernel oil received into 

our factory, we trace to the exact location of the palm oil 

mills and the particulars of FFB suppliers to the palm oil 

mills that supplying to us. Traceability data is necessary 

as it allows us to evaluate our suppliers’ performance 

against our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy. At the same time, 

we are establishing engagement with our suppliers with 

the objectives to improve the sustainability standards 

in our supply chain. This is done through traceability 

data collection, suppliers’ assessment and educational 

workshops.

TRACEABILITY (cont’d)

2.2.2 Mewah’s Traceability Approach

Since we rolled out the Mewah Sustainable Palm Oil 

Policy in 2014, we have been focusing greatly on supplier 

engagement initiatives to raise sustainability awareness 

across our suppliers in order to make certain that 

everyone is improved. As an independent palm oil refiner, 

we are fully aware that a large part of our footprint actually 

lies beyond our own operations. Therefore, our suppliers 

are playing an important role in forging a path towards 

sustainable palm oil production. 

How we do it?

We actively trace raw materials supply flows from refineries 

back to palm oil sources to map our supply base, evaluate 

suppliers’ performance against our Sustainable Palm Oil 

Policy and to initiate engagement with our suppliers to 

make improvements whenever is needed. 

Today, we are proud to announce that 100% of our CPO 

and CPKO are Traceable to Mill (TTM). The definition of 

“traceable to mill” refer to the fulfilment on 5 key traceability 

criteria i.e. Parent Company Name of Mill Party, Mill Name, 

Mill Address, GPS coordinates of Mill Party and Volume 

of CPO received into our refinery. We are determined 

to make sure that all our suppliers must fulfil the same 

condition as the fundamental entry requirement into our 

supply chain. 

Evaluation of suppliers’ sustainability performance 

With the purpose to evaluate and validate sustainability 

progress of our suppliers, we kick-started supplier 

verification program as early as November 2014. Over 

the years, we completed assessment to more than 

130 CPO suppliers across different states in Malaysia 

and the reports are published on Mewah Sustainability 

Dashboard. In Mewah’s Traceability to Plantation (TTP) 

approach, a comprehensive field assessment will be 

carried out at every supplier’s mills to assess its Fresh Fruit 

Bunch (FFB) supply base and to evaluate its compliance 

to Mewah’s Sustainable Palm Oil Policy using our pre-

defined Supplier Assessment Guidelines. In general, a 

palm oil mill’s fresh fruit bunch (FFB) may be supplied by 

hundreds of estates, growers, smallholders and dealers. 

TTP assessment is an educational tool as well as a 

“bridge” for Mewah to support the transformation of our 

suppliers. The primary objective of our TTP initiative is to 

lift up the sustainability standards of all our suppliers to a 

higher level. So far, there is no common definition of TTP in 

the palm oil industry. Our current approach on traceability 

to plantations establish on ensuring the availability and 

validity of Malaysia Palm Oil Board (MPOB) operating 

license from FFB suppliers. The rationale behind our 

requirement is to make sure that all FFB supplied to the 

palm oil mills are sourced legally.

In year 2019, we published the Mill Sustainability Assessment Reports of more 

than 130 suppliers on Mewah Sustainability Dashboards. This public summary 

report assemble all the key findings from our supplier verification program 

covering traceability score, environmental impact assessment outcome as well 

as social impact assessment result, which collected by means of multiple sampling 

methodologies including observation, documentation review, dialogue &amp; interview and 

spatial analysis during on-site assessment at our suppliers’ mill. The objective of sharing this 

report is to demonstrate our efforts in striving for a greater transparency in our supply chain.

2.2.3 Commitment Towards 100% Traceability 

A 100% traceable supply chain is the ultimate objective 

that galvanises us to focus our efforts towards improving 

the sustainability program in our supply chain. Our 

traceability approach helps us in identifying the potential 

risks in our full supply chain while increasing our abilities in 

establishing constructive engagement with our suppliers. 

We set out the CPO/CPKO traceability milestone 

alongside our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy in 2014. The 

milestones set mark specific points along our journey 

to fully sustainable supply chain. These points signal 

anchors in every period of our traceability targets that we 

strive to commit to our palm oil Buyers. 

2.2.4 Year 2019 Traceability Score 

The launch of our Traceability to Mill (TTM) exercise in 

2014 and Traceability to Plantation (TTP) exercise in 2016 

enabled us to reach out to a greater number of suppliers 

including millers, estates’ owners, dealers and smallholders. 

The traceability data collected from TTM and TTP exercise 

allowed us to map all the palm oil mills that supply CPO and 

CPKO to our four refineries and the estates, dealers and 

smallholders that supply FFB to the mills. 

In 2019, we maintain 100% TTM in our CPO and CPKO 

supply chain. Moving forward, we aim to continue working 

closely with all of our esteemed suppliers for improvement 

in TTP score.

Environmental Risk Analysis  

We initiated environmental risk assessment to our 

suppliers since 2017. Today, we completed assessment on 

more than 250 CPO suppliers present in our supply chain. 

We adopt online forest monitoring and alert system – 

Global Forest Watch (GFW) and Global Forest Watch Pro 

(GFW Pro) in the environmental risk assessment. 

 

The GFW platform enables us to identify potential 

deforestation risks in our supply chain; the desktop 

assessment is done through overlapping the TTP data of 

each supplier (collected during our TTP assessment) and 

other source of information such as peatland map, intact 

forest landscapes, tree cover loss and etc.

Social Impact Assessment 

In relation to respecting human rights and labour 

rights, Malaysia has ratified a total of 18 International 

Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Conventions. On top of the 

ratification, these conventions have been domesticated 

into national laws and regulations, including Employment 

Act 1955, Child and Young Persons Act 1966, Housing and

In order to making sure our suppliers’ mills are legally 

responsible and accountable to advocate human and 

labour rights in Malaysia, we developed our own set of 

assessment checklist to address social challenges and 

identify gaps in our supply chain.

2.3.2 Supplier 

Group 

Level 

Sustainability 

Engagement Program

As part of our NDPE Implementation Program, we 

introduced Supplier Group Level Engagement Program in 

2019. We selected 10 critical supplier groups in our supply 

chain that responsible for the supply of 50 palm oil mills 

that account for 20% of palm oil production volume in our 

supply base. The program serves as a platform for us to 

communicate mill assessment findings with our supplier. 

The targeted audience for this program are, i.e. Owners 

or senior management, group sustainability department 

and other relevant leaders in the organization. It allows 

us to raise prompt awareness to the mill to undertake 

responsibility of its own supply chain’s transformation, as 

well as to stand in as the leader in leading transformation 

within its supply base.

2.3.3 Mewah’s Sustainability Dashboard

We actively maintain an online sustainability dashboard 

on our company website since 2016. The main purpose 

is to ensure we are responsive to our stakeholder 

sustainability concerns. The dashboard provides updates 

on traceability declaration data, grievance log and policy’s 

commitments, as well as the certification status of our 

factories. 

2.3.4 Mewah’s Supplier Engagement Program

Supplier engagement is beyond the traceability exercise. 

The main objectives of supplier engagement are to 

create awareness to our upstream suppliers, to increase 

interaction between our suppliers &amp; buyers, to spread 

responsible palm oil practices and to build up supplier 

capacity to adapt sustainability practices. 

Our focus is to continuously raise the standard of the palm 

oil industry by sharing our experience, technical expertise, 

and knowledge by providing training and technical 

assistance to ensure that our suppliers have the right skills 

and motivation to deliver our goals. 

We see three crucial benefits from Supplier Engagement 

Program: 

i. 

Multi-stakeholders approach - The opportunity to 

socialize our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy with our 

direct suppliers. 

ii. 

A platform to discuss the implications and 

requirement of adopting similar policies. 

iii. 

A platform to create awareness of the market 

demands for the need to delink our palm oil supply 

chain from deforestation, oil palm development of 

peatland and human rights abuses.

2.3.6 Multi-Stakeholders Engagement Approach 

First export shipment of MSPO-

certified RBDPO to Japan

Mewah Group has been a loyal supporter 

for the promotion of Malaysia’s national 

sustainability standard in Malaysia palm 

oil industry. Mewaholeo Industries Sdn. Bhd. is proud 

to announce that it is the first refinery to produce and 

export Malaysia’s very first shipment of Malaysian 

Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certified Refined, 

Bleached, Deodorized Palm Oil (RBDPO) to Japan. 

Mewah Group is honored to be given the opportunity 

to host the Ministry of Primary Industries in its official 

launch ceremony and is proud to contribute towards 

the Malaysia Government’s directive on MSPO 

certification.

In September 2019, Mewaholeo Industries Sdn. Bhd. 

exported 300 MT of MSPO-certified RBDPO to Japan 

via Johor Port. This was a challenge that Mewah boldly 

undertook back in April 2019 in spite of the scarce 

supply of MSPO-certified Crude Palm Oil (CPO) at the 

time. With the collective support from the Ministry of 

Primary Industries and MPOCC, Mewah successfully 

convinced its suppliers to complete MSPO SCCS 

certification in time to supply MSPO-certified CPO, the 

raw material for the MSPO-certified RBDPO. 

We truly believe that MSPO uplifts the sustainability 

standards in the Malaysian palm oil industry, resulting in 

benefits to all stakeholders in the supply chain 

including independent palm oil millers and 

independent smallholders. In general, 

Mewah believes that the inclusion 

of all stakeholders, especially 

independent 

smallholders 

in 

the scheme, would further 

enhance the positive image of 

MSPO-certified 

sustainable 

palm oil in the eyes of global 

palm oil consumers.

smallholders surrounding Jambi province. In line with 

our sustainability commitment, we seek to engage 

our smallholder suppliers to provide knowledge and 

assistance in implementing sustainable practices in their 

operation. 

We hosted a smallholder sustainability empowerment 

workshop at our palm oil mill. The workshop contains 

more than 50 participants. The purpose of this initiative 

is to increase sustainability awareness among suppliers. 

This program has successfully bring together our 

suppliers on a coaching session to adopt a sustainable

2.3.7 Sustainable Partnership Initiatives

On 4th March 2019, a Sustainable Partnership Initiative 

– “Love Our Children” took place in one of our supplier’s 

mill, located at Kuala Kubu Baru, Selangor under the 

collaboration program between Dupont, FGV and Mewah 

Group. 

The scope of this partnership initiative is to gather the 

upstream, midstream &amp; downstream palm oil supply 

chain players to establish collaboration to enhance the 

sustainability commitment. The focus of this partnership 

initiative is “Love Our Children” – with the primary 

objectives of raising awareness of child protection through 

education about children’s rights, women’s privileges, and 

to contribute positively to the children of workers of our 

supplier’s mill and its surrounding oil palm plantations. 

In this program, we had successfully gathered around 100 

participants – including 30 women who work with palm 

oil mills and around 70 of the children, aged ranging from 

5 – 12 years old. The program incorporated interactive 

activities to educate the participants on human rights, 

safety and health, as well as personal protection. In 

addition, the volunteered fire-fighting team demonstrated 

the knowing-how to use a fire extinguisher and other 

invaluable live saving skills that everyone should have.

OUR SUSTAINABLE 

SHIPPING INITIATIVES

In year 2019, we announced compliance to a 

Sustainable Shipping Policy. In this policy, we reinstate  

our commitment to relevant laws and regulation, 

security, occupational safety and health, human and 

labour rights, ethical business conduct as well as 

confronting climate change. A Labour Compliance 

Checklist has been put in place in our ships to ensure 

compliance with Maritime Labour Convection 2006.

Our initiatives in driving sustainable development in 

shipping operation includes:

1. 

Reducing GHG emissions and other air pollutants, 

notably (SOx and SO2), nitrogen (NOx) and 

particulate matter (PM) emissions;

2. 

Providing safe, healthy working environments on 

ships 

3. 

Promoting human and labour rights 

We support the measure taken by International 

Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce permissible 

SOx from 3.5% m/m (mass per mass) to 0.5% m/m 

beginning in January 2020. Starting from August 2019, 

all our ships have converted to only consume low-

sulphur fuel oil. 

Sustainability is firmly embedded in our daily business operation, including maritime 

transport. Green shipping is the concept of sustainable development applied to the 

shipping sector, incorporating environmental and social responsibility. At Mewah, 

we are committed to improving the sustainability of our shipping operations and to 

moving the maritime industry towards a sustainable future.

Production of Low 3-MCPD and low GE Palm Oil

3-monochloropropanediol (3-MCPD) is becoming a 

major concern in the palm oil industry as it is classified as 

food processing contaminant and probably carcinogenic 

to human. In year 2018, the European Food Standards 

Authority (EFSA) revised the safe intake of contaminant 

3-MCPD and Glycidyl Esters (GE) levels. Mewah is 

aware of consumer concerns about the food safety and 

health aspects of our palm oil products. We have been 

actively addressing the 3-MCPD/GE issue through our 

efforts in minimizing the occurrence of MCPD precursors 

and optimising our refining techniques. We aim to 

tackle the issue holistically so to provide assurance to 

our consumers in our products and to safeguard our 

consumer health. 

Mineral Oil Hydrocarbon (MOH) in Palm Oil

The levels of mineral oil hydrocarbon (MOH) namely, 

mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH) and mineral 

oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) are a concern in 

agricultural raw materials. Such contaminants are found 

across several food products, including vegetable oils, 

such as soy and sunflower, and it can enter food through 

packaging materials, additives or during storage. 

Since 2018, European Governments have been 

considering regulating the levels of MOSH and MOAH 

in palm oil. At the same time, some food companies 

have established limit in the palm oil starting from 2020. 

Although there are no European regulations on MOSH 

and MOAH at present, our objective is to ensure levels 

of MOSH and MOAH are as low as feasibly possible in 

the raw materials we source as well as in the product we 

produce. 

MOSH and MOAH cannot be removed by physical 

refining process. Therefore, the only way we can limit its 

presence is to enforce control at source. One key solution 

is to work with our suppliers to conduct an overview of all 

lubricant use on site and to explore feasibility to convert 

all lubricant/special fluid i.e. great oil, hydraulic oil and 

engine oil from non-food grade to good grade.

3.3.2 Recognizing and Rewarding Performance 

We recognize every employee is vital to the growth and 

progress of the company. Our recognition and reward 

framework aim to retain and motivate the talent needed to 

grow and sustain our business. 

We constantly seek to establish clear communication 

between managers and employees about what they 

are expected to accomplish. The performance-based 

system is a continuous process where managers and 

employees set goals through annual tasks &amp; objectives 

(T&amp;O) exercise. The T&amp;O set is then translated into 

departmental T&amp;O and individual employee T&amp;O so 

that every employee is aligned to our overall objective of 

building a sustainable business. 

3.3.1 Recruitment and Retention

Hiring and retaining talented employees are crucial to 

the success and growth of any business. Today, with 

the competition for talents growing more intensive, our 

recruitment focusses not only on job skills but also on 

positive personal attributes such as leadership. 

Retention is also the key to a successful healthy work 

culture of any vibrant and dynamic organisation. Retention 

means less disruption and more stability. This translates to 

a sustainable workforce who creates a sustainable work 

culture and a successful organisation orientated towards 

its workforce. 

These practices include listening to and respecting our 

employees’ feedback on their concerns and ideas, setting 

up performance-based rewards and a direct engagement 

platform by assisting them with their career development. 

We recognize too that our employees must feel engaged, 

valued and appreciated.

properly addressed, we have a specific Group Safety 

Policy in place in all our operating sites with the following 

guidelines: 

1. 

Comply with the current legal and other related and 

applicable health &amp; safety requirements, regulations, 

approved codes of practice, standards and 

guidelines in countries we operate;

2. 

Establish an Occupational Safety and Health

Formulate, establish, communicate, implement and 

maintain safety management systems at work;

Workplace safety is everybody’s concern. Any work-related injury or loss of life is 

unacceptable. At Mewah, health &amp; safety of our employees is always our top priority. 

We want Mewah to be an attractive workplace for our employee by ensuring each and 

every employee is healthy and safe both physically and mentally. With over 3,000 people 

employed in our palm oil operations, we understand that we should take this opportunity 

to provide good livelihoods and develop opportunities to all our workers and their families.

Every accident case is followed by a root-case analysis to review 

its cause and actions to prevent reoccurrence. The reviews 

are reinforced with continued efforts in training and PPE use to 

minimize, if not eliminate risks. Safety Committee is formed at every 

factory to oversee the factory’s production safety management 

and employee safety and health. The Safety Committee is 

responsible for ensuring that practices are in line with Mewah’s 

Group Safety Policy. 

To support this safety framework, we have a comprehensive 

workplace safety program to improve workplace safety. To 

measure the effectiveness of these programs, we have adopted a 

measurement of both leading and lagging indicators. We choose 

to focus not only on lagging indicators (e.g. Lost time injury rate) 

that report on the outcomes of safety initiatives, but also give equal 

consideration to leading indicators (e.g. training, safety audits, 

safety suggestions) that measure our employee safety behaviour 

and mind-set. By engraining safety as a part of a culture and habit, 

we hope to minimise unsafe employee behaviour. 

Leading Indicators:

1. 

Safety Training 

2. 

Behavioural Audit

3.

Improving health and safety at our workplace 

has been our key performance plan in 2019. 

We have unveiled a number of new initiatives 

to further strengthen our safety culture. This 

includes implementation of a robust safety 

framework to identify, correct and control 

hazards on an ongoing basis, a more inclusive 

health, safety and environment (HSE) program 

and evaluation of the effectiveness of overall 

factory safety management practices. We are 

also looking to address ergonomics risk factors 

at our employees by carrying out principle of 

occupational ergonomics training. The goal is 

to eliminate discomfort and risk of injury due 

to work as well as to design or modify the work 

that fit to our employee, not the other way round.

(HSE) 

Campaign in all Production Sites 

To keep abreast of the health &amp; safety awareness in our 

employees, we periodically conduct both in-house and 

external safety trainings in all production sites. In addition, 

every site will hold a week-long HSE Campaign Program 

annually. The primary objective of this campaign is to 

create organized efforts and procedures for identifying 

workplace hazards that aims to reduce accidents and 

exposure to adverse situations. 

It also provides training of personnel in accident prevention, 

accident response, emergency preparedness, and use of 

protective clothing and equipment. 

We maintain our focus on safety and are following through 

with our efforts to strengthen our safety culture. Key 

performance indicators that link employees’ remuneration 

to their health and safety performance are now being set to 

instill a behavior-based safety culture, support increased 

safety awareness and improve safety practices. 

In 2019, it is with regret that we 

report a higher lost time injury 

rate 

(LTI). 

Higher 

number 

of 

major accidents were reported 

at Mewah’s Malaysia refineries. 

All accidents were thoroughly 

investigated, and a series of steps 

have been taken to improve training 

and raise awareness. On top of 

this, several measures have been 

put in place to ensure appropriate 

risk assessments are conducted, 

fixing faulty equipment, ensuring

A. Active Volunteerism of our Employee 

– To create positive impact in our 

communities 

We believe that everyone can contribute and 

make a difference to the community and lives 

of others. We encourage our staff to volunteer 

and give back to the community. We believe 

that active employee volunteerism not only 

helps the community but contributes to the 

holistic development of our employee in terms 

of compassion, perspective and character 

building. It also helps to improve morale within 

our company. Therefore, we hold companywide 

community volunteer events so that the majority 

of our staff can find it easier to volunteer to give 

back to community. 

B. Supporting Our Next Generation

We believe that every child deserves a chance at 

a life filled with love, laughter, friends and family. 

Our works focus in improving access to inclusive 

and quality education for all, we strongly believe 

that education is a cornerstone for empowering 

individuals and communities to break out of 

poverty and build meaningful lives in long term. 

Every year, a number of fund-raising activities 

will be held internally and externally to distribute 

funds, groceries and stationeries to the children 

charitable organization. Our efforts are not only 

directed at alleviating the disablement of the 

less fortune children but also at giving the child 

a hope for the future. 

C. Disaster Relief 

Disaster relief refers to fast aid provided for 

alleviating the suffering of our neighbourhood 

disaster victims. Natural disasters often damage 

victims’ goals and ambitions; which is why 

disaster relief is highly important. Beyond the 

immediate physical damage and loss of life, 

disasters can also cause long-term damage to 

disaster survivors and communities. As such, we 

are often stay alert to the needs of supporting the 

communities that we operate in and to help our 

neighbours in their time of need.

Supporting our neighbourhood through disaster 

relief – Sponsorship towards victims of Sungai. 

Kim Kim water pollution 

As part of society, we are responsible to play our role to 

make contribution in humanitarian programs and relief 

efforts. 

In March 2019, the outbreak of Sungai Kim Kim chemical 

waste pollution threatened the health of the residents 

in Pasir Gudang. The water pollution was followed by 

air pollution, poisoning more than 1,000 victims in Pasir 

Gudang. The air was polluted with acrylonitrile, xylene, 

methane and toluene which, if inhaled, can cause 

headache, nausea, fainting and breathing difficulty. 

Hundreds of the victims was badly affected and 

hospitalised due to the incidents. We sponsored food and 

resources to the victims as part of our CSR initiatives. 

The second wave of pollution in Pasir Gudang district 

took place in June 2019. Schools and kindergarten 

were closed as the pollution threaten the health of more 

than 20,000 students. Due to tremendous increase in 

numbers of victims, our safety officers from Mewaholeo 

Industries has joined force with Pasir Gudang Municipal 

Councils (MPPG) and Department of Environment 

(DOE) by contributing additional equipment as well as 

manpower. We sponsored gas detectors to 5 schools 

located in Pasir Gudang to protect more than 3,500 

primary and secondary students by monitoring the 

surrounding air quality.

Moving forward, we are committed to expand scope 

of responsibilities to continue support the needs of our 

local communities in disaster relief.

its profit with a purpose. We believe that it is the key to 

make greater positive impact for the long term.

One of the programmes was to provide opportunities 

to underprivileged families around PT Angso Duo Sawit 

in Jambi to earn a living on their own and improve their

we built a cafeteria and awarded three underprivileged 

families as the cafeteria operators. With the objectives 

of creating wealth and combating poverty, our cafeteria 

serves not just our employees but also the locals. The 

income generated from the cafeteria has successfully 

sustained the family members and supported their

GLOSSARY 

Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)

The amount of oxygen used when organic matter undergoes 

decomposition by micro-organisms in a given water sample 

at certain temperature over a specific time period. 

Carbon Dioxide Equivalents 

Carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) provide a universal 

standard of measurement against which the impacts of 

releasing different greenhouse gases can be evaluated. 

Effluents 

Water discharged from one source into a separate body of 

water, such as the refinery plant process water. 

Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) 

Fruit bunch that harvested from the oil palm tree. The weight 

of the fruit bunch ranges between 10kg to 40kg depends on 

the size and age. 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

A multi-stakeholder standard for sustainability reporting, 

providing guidance on determining report content and 

indicators. 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 

GHG refers to gases that have the ability to trap heat in 

the atmosphere and keep the planet warm. The primary 

greenhouse gases in our atmosphere are Carbon Dioxide, 

Methane, Water Vapor, etc. 

Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

GHG Emissions is an all-encompassing measurement for 

the carbon footprint and energy efficiency in our production. 

High Conservation Values (HCV)

The concept of High Conservation Value Forests (HCVF) 

was first developed by the Forest Stewardship Council 

(FSC) in 1999 as their ninth principle. The FSC defined 

HCVF as forests of outstanding and critical importance 

due to their environmental, socio-economic and cultural 

biodiversity and landscape value. 

High Carbon Stock (HCS) 

The high carbon stock (HCS) approach is a methodology 

to 

avoid 

deforestation 

in 

land 

development. 

The 

methodology was initially developed in a partnership 

between Greenpeace, TFT and Golden Agri Resources. 

The approach stratifies the vegetation on area of land into 

different classes using analyses of satellite images and 

field plot measurements. Each vegetation class is validated 

through calibrating it with carbon stock estimates in the 

above-ground tree biomass.

International Sustainability and Carbon Certification 

(ISCC) 

ISCC is a sustainability certification system covering the 

entire supply chain and all kinds of bio-based feedstocks 

and renewables. It is officially recognized by the European 

Commission under the European Energy Directive (“RED”). 

Mass Balance (MB) 

The mass balance system allows for mixing of RSPO certified 

and non-certified palm oil at any stage in the supply chain 

provided that overall company quantities are controlled. The 

mass balance model is designed in such way that volumes 

of RSPO certified product shipped will never exceed volume 

received by the end-user. 

Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) 

The term of NGO used in this report refer to grassroots and 

campaigning organizations focused on environmental or 

social issues. 

Peat 

Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation 

matter. Peat forms in wetlands or peat lands, variously called 

bogs, moors, muskegs, pocosin and peat swamp forests. 

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) 

RSPO is a multi-stakeholder organization that unites 

stakeholders from 7 sectors of the palm oil industry including 

the oil palm producers, processors or traders, consumer 

goods manufacturers, retailers, bank, environmental NGO 

and social NGO to develop and implement global standards 

for sustainable palm oil. 

Segregation (SG) 

The Segregation supply chain model assures that 

sustainable palm oil from different certified sources is kept 

separate from ordinary/ conventional palm oil throughout 

supply chain. 

Stakeholders 

Stakeholders in this report refer to any group or individual 

who are affected by or can affect the company’s operations. 

Sustainability 

A term expressing a long-term balance between social,

Sustainability  Report 2019


ABOUT THIS REPORT 

Scope of the Report 

We adopted the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards  

at core level as our reporting framework in year 2019. It 

focuses on Mewah Group’s sustainability strategies and 

practices, highlighting the economic, environmental, 

and social aspects of the Company’s activities and 

developments. 

The report covers all sustainability issues that deemed 

material by Mewah. We have chosen to focus our reporting 

in our downstream operations as this is our core business in 

Malaysia. It provides an overview of our approach, priorities 

and targets, as well as a baseline performance review in 

several key areas. This Report supplement our 2019 annual 

report that can be found on http://www.mewahgroup.com/

upload/AnnualReports/ 

The report brings together our sustainability initiatives, 

including current and future direction. It is intended 

to be useful for our stakeholders – our customers, 

employees, shareholders, communities as well as being 

a communication tool to various interested parties about our 

approach to the social and environmental development.

Completeness 

This report provides a complete overview of our core 

businesses within the established scope. The data in this 

report covers 1 Jan – 31 Dec 2019. Where possible, we 

have sought to include historical data as a benchmark. We 

believe that the data presented are a fair representation of 

performance, and have included detailed notes in relevant 

sections to ensure transparency. 

Assurance 

This is the third Mewah Group’s Sustainability report. We 

have carried out extensive review with both internal and 

external stakeholders to identify gaps since the production 

of our first Sustainability report. Materiality assessment 

has been incorporated into our report. The outcome 

from materiality assessment enables us to recognize the 

economic, social and environmental issues that shape our 

business success. Moving forward, we will continue to use 

this report to engage our stakeholders and to understand  

what form of assurance they would like to see in our 

subsequent reports.
