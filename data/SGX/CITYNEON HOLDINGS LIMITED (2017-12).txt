Cityneon Holdings Limited





It gives me great pleasure to introduce our ﬁrst Sustainability Report for the ﬁnancial 

year ended 31 December 2017 (“FY2017”). It highlights our achievements over the previous  

12 months in working alongside with our valued stakeholders to build a sustainable 

business based on resilience, adaptability and innovation. 

MESSAGE FROM THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND 

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

In this, our ﬁrst Sustainability Report, we ﬁrmly believe in 

building a sustainable business that is fully accountable 

for our impact on the environment, our customers, our 

people and our community. 

The delivery of sustainable results is a critical aspect of our 

ability to remain a strong and ﬁnancially stable company. 

It puts into focus our commitment to principles laid out 

in our Corporate Sustainability Policy. Our responsibility 

to society is to ensure that sustainable practices are 

incorporated into every link of our value chain. We must 

meet the needs not only of our customers, employees and 

the community we operate in, but also those of future 

generations. 

This report provides details about how we have met our 

sustainability responsibilities towards our key stakeholders 

during FY2017 and beyond.

This is our ﬁrst Sustainability Report. It articulates our commitment to sustainability and 

transparency. It is designed to provide a transparent and balanced view of Cityneon’s 

sustainability efforts, reﬂecting and addressing the interests and issues of our key 

stakeholders. This report aims to include comprehensive and accessible information on our 

strategy towards sustainability, key issues as well as data according to recognised standards. 

ABOUT THE REPORT

Report Scope

The report covers Cityneon Holdings Limited and its 

subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the FY2017. The report’s 

content is deﬁned in accordance with Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) reporting principles including stakeholder 

inclusiveness, sustainability context, materiality and 

completeness. 

This report aims to provide an overview of our approach, 

priorities and targets of key sustainability areas. It covers 

sustainability strategies, initiatives and practices carried 

out by our business operations. Material issues and topics 

are determined based on materiality principle taking into 

consideration the Group’s activities and the activities of 

our local supply chain that have signiﬁcant economic, 

environment and social impact. The report also provides a 

performance review for our key sustainability areas. 

Report Methodology

We have prepared our report in accordance with GRI 

Standards reporting guidelines at the “In Accordance-

Core” level. The GRI Standards were chosen because 

of their modular structure and ﬂexibility in disclosure 

of sustainability topics and comparability which are 

useful for benchmarking. The report is also developed 

in accordance with Singapore Exchange Limited’s (SGX’s) 

“comply or explain”  requirements of primary components 

of a sustainability report. Our data is reported in good 

faith and to the best of our knowledge. We will continue to 

improve our data collection processes. 

We did not seek external assurance for this report.

Report Structure

This Sustainability Report is structured to highlight the 

impact of material issues on our value creation and 

business performance as well as the interests of our key 

stakeholders. We will describe the process in identifying and 

prioritising material issues within the context of economic, 

environment and social aspects. We have identiﬁed ﬁve 

key stakeholder groups, namely,  the environment and 

future generations, employees, customers, suppliers 

and communities. We will highlight how we engage each 

stakeholder group, how our material issues are identiﬁed 

as well as how the issues are prioritised and managed. 

Further, we will present our initiatives on how we address 

issues relevant to our topics and boundaries. Finally, we 

will provide information on our key performance indicators, 

performance targets and outcomes.

The information regarding the basis for report boundaries 

and our materiality assessment is provided in Page 6.

This report provides the basis for our responses and 

disclosures to the GRI Standards In Accordance-To-Core 

requirements. Relevant sections in the report are referenced 

in the GRI Content Index provided in page 21.

by the CSC, our Corporate Sustainability Champion  

(the “Champion”) is our Subject Matter Expert (“SME”) in 

the area of corporate sustainability, and pro-actively raises 

awareness through education and training across the 

organisation. Through the Corporate Sustainability Work 

Group (“CSWG”), our Champion engages businesses and

as well as action guidelines which are to be adhered by 

the ofﬁcers and employees across the organisation. Every 

new employee is instructed on our Code of Conduct and 

policies on ethics and compliances which include zero 

tolerance for corruption. Communication channels, such 

as whistle-blowing and a Board escalation process, are in 

place to enable all employees and individuals to report 

incidences of unethical behaviour. We have a dedicated 

ofﬁcer for maintaining a register of incidences regarding 

ethics and compliance issues which will be escalated to 

the management where appropriate.

We believe CSR is a key driver towards long-term sustainability. CSR is one of the core 

values in our corporate culture. Integrating CSR into our management processes and 

business practices across the value chain enables us to establish credibility among our 

stakeholders and ensuring that our strategy and operations are in line with our vision for 

sustainable growth. Through our sustainability activities , we are contributing to protecting 

the environment for future generations. 

INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS

Sustainability Management Framework

In July 2017, we took the initiative to establish our 

sustainability reporting framework. We performed an 

analysis of our business and operation models as the 

basis for our stakeholder mapping and materiality 

assessment. Through our analysis, we identiﬁed ﬁve key 

stakeholder groups within our sustainability context and 

their respective material issues are shown in this report.

Key Stakeholders and Material Issues

We have regular reviews, assessments and feedback on 

ESG topics. Key to this is our Risk Assessment and Control 

Self-Assessment exercise which entails the identiﬁcation, 

assessment and documentation of material risks and 

corresponding internal controls. Such material risks include 

fraud and corruption, environmental, health and safety, 

and human capital risks. We are continuously improving 

the adequacy and effectiveness of our Risk Assessment 

and Control Self-Assessment processes in response to the 

changing business and operation environment.

Through regular stakeholder engagement, we identify 

and review material issues that are most relevant and 

signiﬁcant to us and our stakeholders. For external 

stakeholders, priority is given to issues important to 

the society and applicable to us. Then, we prioritise 

the sustainability issues that are most material to the 

business and stakeholders. Considering that speciﬁc 

stakeholders and material issues are speciﬁc in 

countries and locations, we are reporting the stakeholder 

engagement and material issues principally for our 

Group’s operations in this report.

Alignment with International Initiatives

Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”)

Established in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations (“UN”), the General Assembly occupies a central position 

as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the UN. Comprising all 193 Members of the UN,  

it provides a unique forum for multilateral discussion of the full spectrum of international issues covered by the Charter. 

It also plays a signiﬁcant role in the process of standard-setting and the codiﬁcation of international law.

On 25 September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the 17 SDGs to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure 

prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has speciﬁc targets to be achieved over 

the next 15 years. Although the SDGs are primarily aimed at governments, they represent an important opportunity 

for businesses to also act for a more sustainable world. We will use SDGs as one of the guiding principles for our 

sustainability initiatives.

We acknowledge that our participation in reaching the SDGs has room for improvement. As we advance on our sustainability 

journey, we will continue to assess our alignment with the SDGs and, whenever possible, redirect our internal priorities 

and sustainability strategy to more effectively and comprehensively to address the goals.

Relevant Targets to Our Businesses

(Source: http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org)

Our Participation



13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising and 

human and institutional capacity on climate change 

mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early 

warning.

We have our own internal processes and 

environmental policies to reduce electricity and fuel 

consumption. Our approach to mitigating climate 

change includes staff training and implementing 

energy-efﬁcient measures. We monitor and report 

our Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions and set 

reduction targets.



15.1:  By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration 

and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland 

freshwater ecosystems and their services, in 

particular 

forests, 

wetlands, 

mountains 

and 

drylands are in line with obligations under 

international agreements.

All the paper used in our ofﬁces is either Forest 

Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certiﬁed or made 

from KHAN-NA. We actively promote the use of 

such papers across our organisation. Through 

that, the Company supports efforts in mitigating 

global warming and the creation of positive rural 

community engagement, job opportunity, and 

better livelihood for the farmers and members of 

the community.









The following SDGs are relevant to our business, 

operations and value chain. They are addressed in 

our various policies at group level. Such goals are 

also embedded in various initiatives carried out 

across the organisation.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS

All waste paper from our own ofﬁces is collected for 

recycling. Further, we encourage all our employees to 

adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with 

an aim to further reduce paper consumption.

Considering the changes and dynamics of our business 

and operations, we established our paper consumption 

index for consistent tracking of paper consumption 

over time. To this end, we have set a target for a paper 

consumption improvement of 23% by year 2030. Our target 

for paper consumption improvement is 1.8% per year. 

Although various business lines and operations account 

for different percentage of paper consumption across the 

organisation, they all support this target and have aligned 

our environmental objectives accordingly. 

In FY2017, we consumed total of 2,648 kg of paper, 100% of 

which are either FSC certiﬁed or made from KHAN-NA. Our 

paper consumption index stands at 22.7.

Promoting Green Practices 

We have embraced various green practices in our business 

and operation such as ISO 14001 and Green and Gracious 

Builders Award from BCA.

The ISO 14000 family of standards provide practical tools for 

organisations looking to manage their environmental impact. 

ISO 14001:2015 sets out the criteria for an environmental 

management system. Adopting ISO 14001:2015 provides 

assurance to our management and employees as well as 

external stakeholders that environmental impact is being 

measured and improved.

BCA launched the Green and Gracious Builder Scheme in 

February 2009. The scheme was introduced to raise the 

environmental consciousness and professionalism of 

builders. Apart from setting standards for green practices, 

it also sets standards for gracious practices. These gracious 

practices will improve the image of our builders particularly 

among neighbours and residents, some of whom may have 

been affected by construction activities near them.

Protecting Our Environment for the Future 

Generations

Our Approach

We are committed to maintaining and building on our 

stringent environmental policies and standards across 

the Group. We continually seek new and innovative ways 

to reduce the environmental impact of our products and 

services while maintaining the highest levels of quality. We 

recognise our responsibility to protect the environment for 

the health and well-being of future generations. 

FY2017 is our ﬁrst year of sustainability reporting. FY2017 will 

be used as the reference against which the performance 

will be measured in subsequent years. 

Reduction of Carbon Footprint

We recognise that effective management and monitoring 

of carbon footprint can reduce operating costs, raise brand 

proﬁle, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholder 

value. Our carbon footprint is measured in terms of GHG 

emission. However, GHG emission is an absolute measure of 

how much carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2e”) is emitted. Our 

GHG emission is predominantly indirect (Scope 2) emission. 

We have insigniﬁcant direct (Scope 1) emission, and we do 

not include the GHG emissions generated by our suppliers 

(Scope 3).

Considering the changes and dynamics of our business and 

operations, we established our GHG emission efﬁciency 

index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over 

time. To this end, we have set a target for GHG emission 

efﬁciency improvement of 23% by year 2030. Our target 

for GHG emission improvement is 1.8% per year. Although 

various business lines and operations account for different 

percentage of GHG emissions across the organisation, they 

all support this target and have aligned our environmental 

objectives accordingly. 

Reduction of Paper Consumption

All our employees are urged to minimise paper wastage at 

work by adhering to our Internal Paper Usage Reduction 

Guidelines. For example, double-sided printing is set as a 

default, lower grammage paper is used for daily printing, 

and blank sides of unneeded single-sided copies are used 

for printing drafts. Paper re-use and recycling habits are 

also cultivated through initiatives such as our in-house 

reminders posted near the photocopy machines.

Cityneon Holdings Limited



Caring for Our Employees

Our Approach

Our people are our most valuable resource. They are the 

driving force for all our business initiatives. Investing in 

their professional and personal well-being is vital to our 

business sustainability. One of our goals is to establish, 

among our employees, work ethics which are in line with 

our core values and Code of Conduct. 

We recognise that a motivated workforce will convey a 

positive and powerful message to all our key stakeholders, 

such as our customers, suppliers and the community. 

By attracting, nurturing, empowering and rewarding 

our employees, we create an environment conducive 

for innovation and inspiration to ﬂourish and boost our 

competitiveness. Such commitment to our employees 

promotes a corporate culture of passion, quality, excellence 

and trust within the organisation, enhancing our ability to 

create value for our stakeholders.

Our Human Resource (“HR”) management principles 

and policies have been developed and established 

based on the fair employment practices. Our HR policies 

cover remuneration, beneﬁts, health and safety, career 

development and training. Our policies are communicated 

to all our employees through our comprehensive 

Employee Handbook which is regularly reviewed by our 

management and we constantly seek feedback from our 

staff to ensure that our policies are aligned as much as 

possible with their needs.

Our business operates in an environment which comprises 

diverse races, cultures and geographic locations. Our 

pragmatic HR polices take into consideration prevailing 

laws and regulations as well as local culture, norms and 

racial sensitivity.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS

Employment Practices

Our employment practices focus on maximising the 

expertise and contributions of our employees through our 

comprehensive training and development programmes. We 

regularly review the performance and development of our 

employees to effectively match their strength with their 

job speciﬁcations. Our performance-based reward scheme 

provides guidance and motivation to our employees to 

perform to their potential in alignment with the objectives 

of the company. 

1. 

The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment 

Practices 

We proactively adopt the Singapore Tripartite Alliance 

for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. 

The Singapore Tripartite Alliance comprises the 

Ministry of Manpower, Singapore National Employers 

Federation and National Trades Union Congress. 

The Tripartite Alliance has formulated guidelines on 

fair employment practice for adoption by Singapore 

employers, embracing the recruitment, training, 

treatment and reward of employees. 

2. 

Communication

As our Company grows, effective communication 

across the organisation is crucial to ensure continuous 

alignment of employees and organisational objectives. 

We achieve this through our various communication 

sessions customised to  the needs of employees. 

Communication sessions for our managers are held 

on a regular basis. Agendas covered at these sessions 

are tailored to functional scope of the managers. 

For example, the monthly managers’ meetings may 

include operational issues such as leadership and 

operation while the quarterly sessions focus on higher 

level topics including strategic business directions, 

new service launches, ongoing developments and key 

project reviews.

3. 

Employee Feedback 

We value our employees’ expertise in their areas 

of responsibilities. Therefore, their feedback is 

important in the improvement of our overall 

management and operations of the organisation. We 

gather valuable feedback through various employee 

engagement channels, such as employee objectives 

setting, performance review as well as exit interview 

in the case of resignations. 

In addition, there are other feedback channels to 

address speciﬁc business and functional issues, 

such as health and safety and compliance. Such 

feedback is managed by the managers of speciﬁc 

business and functional domains. We have also 

established reporting and escalation channels 

should the feedback require the attention of higher 

management.

4. 

Career Development and Training

We recognise that consistent and ongoing education 

is critical to maintain a competitive, skilled, 

productive and motivated workforce. Employee 

career development and performance management 

are established based on merits and contributing 

skill sets towards the organisation objectives 

through objective settings and regular performance 

reviews. We continue to review and improve our 

career development and performance review process 

in light of the changing business and operation 

environment.

Our training programme caters to employees with 

different job scopes and skill set requirements. 

Our core training curriculum and contents are 

developed and guided by well-established industry 

and international standards such as ISO 9100, 

ISO 14000, OHSAS 18001 and bizSAFE. In addition, 

speciﬁc training curriculums are developed based 

on the requirements of the speciﬁc businesses 

and functions. Training topics range from soft 

skills development such as communications and 

leadership to technical programmes covering project 

management and ofﬁce productivity tools. 

In FY2017, each employee received an average of 

5.3 hours of training. We recognise that the training 

requirements vary depending on the levels of 

management responsibilities. Each senior manager 

registered an average of 3.2 hours of training while 

the managerial and non-managerial staff received 

an average of 12.8 hours and 7.8 hours of training 

respectively. In light of the changing business 

requirements and training methodologies, we 

continue to revise our training curriculum and 

programme to align with the organisation’s objectives 

and to strive for the effectiveness and efﬁciency in 

our training approach.

Workforce Diversity

Our business thrives on diversity. Our strengths and skills 

come from a diverse workforce comprising different ethnic 

groups, religion, age and gender. 

In FY2017, 54 of our employees were female, comprising 

43% of our workforce, while 71 (57%) employees were male. 

In terms of management function, 4 females (29%) held 

managerial positions compared to 10 males (71%), while 

48 females (47%) and 55 males (53%) held non-managerial 

positions. The male to female ratio of managerial and non-

managerial positions were 10:4 and 55:48 respectively. From 

the age proﬁle perspective, there were 39 employees below 

30 years old. The number of employees between 30 and 50 

years old was 68 as compared to 18 employees above 50 

years old. All members of our senior management team, 

including general managers, directors and unit heads, are 

Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents.

In FY2017, we hired a total of 31 new employees while 67 

resigned during the same period. As a result, we have a net 

decrease of 36 employees in our workforce. Out of the new 

hires, 71% were below the age of 30; 19% were between 30 

and 50 years old while 10% were above 50 years old. The 

gender ratio of new hires was 9 males to 22 females. For 

the resignees, 42% of the resignees were below the age of 

30; 49% were between 30 and 50 years old while 9% were 

above 50 years old. The gender ratio of resignees was 33 

males to 34 females. 

We outsource the provision of certain services such as 

cleaning and security to external contractors. These 

workers are employed by the contracted companies and 

work under our supervision. They are not included in our 

head count. We do not employ other types of uncontracted 

workers.

We expect our outsourcing providers share our core HR 

principles and practices. In our vendor selection process, we 

take into consideration of their HR management practices 

as one of the key selection and performance criteria. We 

regularly review the performance of our vendors based on 

these criteria as a basis to determine whether to continue 

to engage them for their services.

Employee Beneﬁts

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered by 

the Employment Act, which covers basic employment terms 

and working conditions including contract requirements, 

remuneration, hours of work, overtime, rest days and 

annual leave entitlement. 

In addition to the statutory beneﬁts outlined in the 

Employment Act, we provide beyond-compliance-level 

beneﬁts to our full-time employees. Examples of these 

beneﬁts include paternity leave and compassionate leave. 

1. 

Work–Life Balance 

We recognise that the well-being and fulﬁlment 

of our employees are pivotal to the success and 

sustainability of our business and performance. 

Our employees are our most valuable asset. We 

ensure that their needs are taken care of in order for 

them to realise their full potential and sustain their 

performance. 

To help our employees achieve work-life balance, we 

create an environment that allows our employees to 

achieve harmony in their personal and professional 

life. We achieve this through the adoption of ﬂexible 

work arrangements and offering programmes to 

support health and wellness. 

We understand the physical impact of stress on 

our employees’ sense of well-being. To help our 

employees pursue excellence, we have various 

programmes and initiatives to balance work with fun, 

and develop an environment and culture of mutual 

support. 

2. 

Retirement and Healthcare 

Our company has presence in various geographic 

locations with diverse laws and regulations on 

pension and healthcare. We comply with all relevant 

laws and regulations. In Singapore, we participate 

in the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) personal 

savings scheme, which helps employees fund 

their retirement, home ownership, healthcare and 

education. Under this scheme, monthly deductions 

from employees’ gross salaries are paid into their CPF 

savings accounts. We, the company, make employer 

contributions to these accounts, according to the 

rates stipulated in the CPF Act. In addition to CPF 

contributions, we provide comprehensive medical 

coverage for all employees. For more information on 

the CPF scheme and contribution rates, please go to 

www.cpf.gov.sg. 

Safety and Health in the Workplace

We are committed to Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) 

and we take every precaution to prevent occupational 

injuries among our employees. We believe that optimum 

work conditions not only make our employees safer, but 

also boost morale. For FY2017, we are in compliance with 

the Ministry of Manpower’s Workplace Safety &amp; Health Act. 

In addition, we have attained certiﬁcation for OHSAS 18001 

and bisSAFE. These well recognised standards provide us 

with the framework to manage risks associated with safety 

and health in our workplace.

Individual Rights 

Respecting and protecting basic human rights are 

fundamental to our philosophy and are deeply ingrained 

in our Code of Conduct. Labour rights, the prohibition 

of discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, 

prohibition of forced and child labour, and workplace 

safety and health are all strictly observed within the work 

environment. We also respect our employees’ rights to 

freedom of association as well as their membership of 

trade unions and other professional bodies. 

In FY2017, none of our workforce was covered by a collective 

bargaining agreement. No incident of forced labour, 

child labour or young workers were identiﬁed across the 

organisation, and no human rights related grievance has 

been reported.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS

Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs

Our Approach

Customer satisfaction is our highest priority. We are 

committed to providing quality products with the highest 

level of product safety. Customer retention begins with trust. 

We place the utmost importance on training our employees 

in customer service excellence and improvement of quality 

and safety of our products and services.

Open and frequent communication and responsive feedback 

is ingrained into our daily interaction with customers. In 

addition to service excellence, we place high importance 

on data privacy. We have processes and controls in place 

to protect conﬁdential and sensitive data related to our 

customers such as contracts.

Since 2011, we have been certiﬁed under the ISO 9001 

standard for quality management systems. The certiﬁcation 

has helped us to improve the control of our internal 

processes and the quality of our services. 

Customer Feedback and Satisfaction

We listen to our customers and we take their opinions 

very seriously. Customer feedback collated from our 

communication channels including our website, customer 

evaluation form and our customer service personnel 

are consolidated for analysis and action. Customer 

compliments are also tracked so that we can monitor 

where we are getting things right and cascade the positive 

feedback to our employees and the management. 

Service Quality and Safety

Reliability and quality of our products and services are 

of paramount importance to us. Safety and health of our 

customers are always our priority. We have in place a set 

of key quality assurance processes and standards, such 

as ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001, bisSAFE, BCA Green &amp; Gracious, 

to ensure compliance with regulations and international 

standards. Ultimately, we foster a ‘Safety First’ culture 

through training and quality control in order to totally 

eliminate product safety incidents. 

Data Safety and Privacy 

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of 

great priority to us. We have processes and controls in 

place for handling and communicating sensitive and 

conﬁdential information such as contracts, customer 

orders and service delivery orders. Our information 

security policies ensure our customers’ data are protected 

in accordance with the appropriate level of conﬁdentiality. 

We observe strictly all local laws and regulations applicable 

to personal information protection.

For the collection and disposal of wastepaper, we work with 

our ofﬁce cleaning personnel for handling and reselling of 

wastepaper to recovery companies for pragmatic reasons. 

Every employee is responsible for shredding all papers, 

including conﬁdential documents, before disposing them 

into paper recycling boxes situated near the photocopiers 

and printers. We are committed to ensuring all sensitive 

information is protected in the whole life cycle of our 

documents. 

Partnering Our Suppliers

Our Approach

As part of our aspiration to realise sustainability throughout 

our value chain, we will integrate sustainable business 

practices into our local partners, suppliers and supply 

chain. We recognise that we are only at the beginning of 

our journey. However, we are committed to continuous 

improvement. We aim to enhance collaboration with our 

suppliers, to gradually increase transparency and build 

shared capacity to minimise our indirect environmental 

and social impacts.

Supplier Selection

Our 

supplier 

selection 

criteria 

includes 

ﬁnancial 

health, quality of products and services, as well as 

price competitiveness. In addition, we also take into 

consideration the overall sustainability policies adopted 

by our suppliers. Our ﬁnal decision on supplier selection 

is based on overall assessment which takes a balanced 

view of all selection criteria.

Supplier Review 

We regularly review the performance of our key suppliers. 

During the key supplier review process, we engage our 

key suppliers and communicate our expectations and 

feedback. Such review process ensures alignment of our 

key suppliers’ services and products to our business 

requirements and sustainability objectives through 

continuous improvement in our collaboration.

our company ethos and is well integrated in our culture. 

We strongly believe in paying it forward by engaging and 

beneﬁting the lives of our people and the communities 

where we work and live.

Our CSR Programme is geared to helping communities 

in meaningful ways. Leveraging our deep resources and 

mobilising our spirit of volunteerism, we aim to create a 

positive difference.

The key motivation driving all our community engagement

We also recognise that meeting the needs of today’s 

youth goes beyond their own education, security and 

well-being, extending to that of their families, homes and 

neighbourhoods as well. To this end, our engagement 

programmes also encompass ﬁnancial and practical 

support in carefully selected communities, through 

donation, voluntary activities and fundraising. 

Our community initiatives are selected according to 

how closely they are aligned with our own community 

engagement goals of “enabling and empowering young 

people”, the anticipated staff participation rate, and the 

tangible impact on the beneﬁciary. Separately, we also 

participate in other community initiatives on an ad hoc 

basis. All our business units and some of our channel 

partners are involved in our community engagement 

programmes.
