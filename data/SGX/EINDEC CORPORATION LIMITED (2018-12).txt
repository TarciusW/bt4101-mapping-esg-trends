Board Statement

The board of directors (“Board” or “Directors”)

of Eindec is pleased to present the annual

sustainability report for the financial year

ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”).

This sustainability report is prepared with

reference to the guidelines of Global Reporting

Initiative (“GRI”) and in compliance with Rules

711A and 711B of the SGX-ST Listing Manual

Section B: Rules of Catalist as well as the SGX-

ST’s Sustainability Reporting Guide. We have

chosen the GRI framework as it is a well-

known and globally-recognised sustainability

reporting standard.

The Board oversees the management and

monitoring of these factors and takes them

into consideration in the determination of the

Group’s strategic direction and policies.

This sustainability report highlights the key

economic,

environmental,

social

and

governance (“EESG”) related initiatives carried

throughout a 12-month period, from 1 January

to

31

December

2018,

focusing

on

our

manufacturing

facility

in

Malaysia

and

operations

in

Singapore,

being

the

two

significant operations of the Group.

In defining our reporting content, we applied

GRI’s principles defining report content by

considering the Group’s activities, impacts and

substantive expectations and interests of its

stakeholders. We observed a total of four

principles, including materiality, stakeholder

inclusiveness,

sustainability

index

and

completeness.

For

reporting

quality,

we

observed principles of balance, comparability,

accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability.

The EESG data and information provided have

not been verified by an independent third

party. This sustainability report is done in

good faith and to the best of our knowledge.

This sustainability report will not be printed as

part

of

our

environmental

conservation

efforts. The electronic copy is available at

www.eindec.com.sg and www.sgx.com

We welcome feedback from our stakeholders

with regards to our sustainability efforts as

this enables us to consistently improve our

Materiality Assessment

Our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant aspect. Relevant aspects are

then prioritised to identify potential material factors which are subject to validation. The end

result of this process is a list of material factors in this sustainability report.

We conducted the materiality assessment under the guidance of an external consultant, together

with key personnel from the respective departments within the Group. In addition, the Group

adopts a matrix-based approach based on the likelihood and impact of occurrences to address

the Company’s sustainability risk profile and priority issues. We shall use this method to monitor

our risk profile on regular basis. Going forward, materiality review will be conducted every year,

incorporating inputs from stakeholder engagements.

In order to determine if an aspect is material, we assessed its potential impact on the economy,

environment and society and its influence on the stakeholders. Material aspects were identified

and prioritised through internal workshops together with senior management of the Group and

guidance from our consultant. Peer reviews and social impact assessments were performed at

site level.

Following polling exercise involving key personnel from various departments and validation

from our Board, the following eight (8) material EESG factors have been selected:

Economic Performance

•

Achieve sustainable growth through strengthening our presence in Asia Pacific and

China, focus in streamlining operational efficiencies and continue to innovate our

products and systems across our three product segments.

Eindec has implemented initiatives to reinvent its traditional equipment manufacturing business

into an environmental air protection solutions provider for the real estate sector comprising

residential, commercial and industrial properties.

The Group recorded a 26.0% year-on-year decline in revenue from S$14.1 million for the

financial year ended 31 December 2017 (“FY2017”) to S$10.4 million for FY2018. This was due

to lower contributions from all product segments, particularly the Air Purification (“AP”)

segment.

In FY2018, the continuous tightening of the real estate sector, specifically residential properties,

by the Chinese government, saw revenue for the Group’s AP segment fell 60.2%, from S$3.1

million in FY2017 to S$1.2 million in FY2018. Revenue from the Group’s Cleanroom Equipment

(“CRE”) segment slid 26.8%, from S$5.7 million in FY2017 to S$4.2 million in FY2018, on the

back of the slowdown in the private sector construction activities. Slowdown in the Singapore

real estate sector in prior years affected the Group’s HVAC segment, which registered a 7.4%

decline, from S$4.8 million in FY2017 to S$4.5 million in FY2018.

For detailed financial results, please refer to the following sections in our Annual Report for

FY2018, which can be downloaded from SGXNET:

•

Financial Review, pages 7 to 9

•

Financial Statements, pages 52 to 119

At Eindec, we aim to create value and better solutions for clean air control management in

buildings with a full suite of airflow and air quality management solutions for our customers. We

believe prudent cost management and constant innovation of our established environmental air

products and solutions through technological advancement will continue to place our established

brand names, “Eindec” and “Kyodo” at the forefront of the air environmental protection industry.

We are also capable of providing consultancy, design customisation and equipment manufacture,

installation and after-sales maintenance services.

Performance in FY2018

•

Achieved the target set for FY2018.

•

Reduced operating expenses by 13.7%

from S$6.7 million in FY2017 to S$5.8

million in FY2018 with better cost

management.

•

Established

strategic

collaboration

with Aire-Max to broaden market

reach.

Target for FY2019*

•

Continue to enhance the efforts in

improving operational efficiency to

achieve cost reduction.

•

Continue the efforts in exploring other

growth opportunities to drive growth

for the Group.

•

Conduct our business with integrity and transparency with no compromise on

Conduct and Discipline Policy, the Conflict of Interest Policy, and the Fraud and Whistle-Blowing

Policy, to prevent, govern and facilitate the reporting of any illegal or unethical practices in the

organisation.

Fraud and Whistle-Blowing Policy

The Group has implemented a Fraud and Whistle-Blowing policy whereby a designated mailing

address and email address are provided for all employees to raise concerns about possible

improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters which they become aware and to

ensure that:

I.

independent investigations are carried out in an appropriate and timely manner;

II.

appropriate action is taken to correct the weakness in internal controls and policies which

allowed the perpetration of fraud and/ or misconduct and to prevent a recurrence; and

III. administrative, disciplinary, civil and/or criminal actions that are initiated following the

completion of investigations are appropriate, balance and fair, while providing reassurance

that employees will be protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle-blowing in good

faith and without malice.

Governance

Corporate Governance

The Board and the management of Eindec are committed to the best practices in corporate

governance to ensure sustainability of the Group’s operations. We believe that our constant drive

for corporate excellence will allow us to establish a more transparent, accountable and equitable

system, thereby increasing the value of the Company and its value to our shareholders.

Please refer to the Company’s Annual Report 2018 from pages 13 to 44 for details of the Group’s

corporate governance principles and practices.

Enterprise Risk Management

The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk

management framework.

The Group had engaged third party professional to establish the Group’s Risk Control Assurance

Framework. Risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the key

risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, develop a risk control matrix

and to implement procedures to monitor and report risks and adherence to limits.

Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market

conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards

and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment whereby all

employees understand their roles and obligations.

The Audit Committee of the Company oversees how the management monitors compliance with

the Group’s risk management policies and procedures, and from time to time, reviews the

adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The

Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal auditor. The internal auditor

undertakes both regular and ad-hoc reviews of the Group’s risk management controls and

procedures, and reports its findings to the Audit Committee.

The Group aims to perform its risk assessment at least once per year, either internally or with the

assistance of a third party professional as determined by the Audit Committee.
