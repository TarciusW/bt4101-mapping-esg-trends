1. BOARD STATEMENT 

 

 

 

We are pleased to present our second Sustainability Report of Shanghai Turbo Enterprises Limited (“STE” or 

“Group”) which covers the Group’s performance from 1st January to 31st December 2018 (Reporting period). 

This report covers all relevant materiality of sustainable issues, performance and ESG factors of our group 

and it is prepared accordance to the Core Option of GRI Standards. 

 

The BOD appoints a 3-member Steering Committee consisting of the AC Chair, the CEO and the lead 

supervisor to work with the Working Committee since 1st quarter of the year 2018. In the process the team 

brought out many issues and subjects for discussion and had provided pragmatic solutions. 

 

In this report, the committee sets specific policies to deal with the energy saving by 10% in 2019, to upgrade 

the workers’ skills by at least one level up, to increase social connectivity by reaching out to some local 

needy communities and to raise the awareness of risk management and organized work forces to address 

them at all levels. Other more challenging measures and targets are also listed in the last chapter of this 

report. 

 

The Group had benefited from the process of sustainability reporting. Staff who had participated in the 

discussion and policies formulation felt greater confidence of the Company’s future and more willing to 

volunteer in participating of the local CSR projects. 

 

During the reporting period, the original board saw a resignations of the 3 non-executive independent 

directors, Mr. Jack Chia Seng Hee (Non-executive and Independent Chairman, RC and NC Chairman), Mr.

2.3 Our Capabilities 

We are China’s leading High-Technology Industrial Vane Manufacturer. To meet the high degree of 

dimensional accuracy required in our manufacturing process, we continually invest in cutting-edge 

technology. Our digital controlled precision machinery include Japanese-made Mori Seiki Machines, 

Swiss-made Starragheckert 5 -axis manufacturing equipment, Korean-made Daewo vertical manufacturing 

machines and latest 10 units of German-made C.B. Ferrari precision cutting equipment. 

 

We emphasize quality assurance at every phase of our production process - from the procurement and 

receipt of raw materials to cutting, precision machining, burnishing, polishing and coating - to ensure that 

our products meet the expectations and requirements of our customers. Being ISO 9001:2000 certified, we 

follow clearly defined procedures to produce consistently high-quality products.  

 

Our employees are equipped with the necessary training to empower them with the right skill-sets to 

perform their daily tasks effectively and efficiently. We place substantial emphasis on improving and 

upgrading their technical knowledge. 

 

 

Figure 4. Main Digital Machinery 

2.4 New Business Growth Initiatives 

Diversification, Downstream and Upstream business expansions 

Our machines and skilled workers allow us to venture into other areas of product lines beside turbo engine 

vanes. Profit margin could be lower but it helps to cover some overhead cost. Also we are now working on 

several potential downstream businesses for acquisition and to expand our business upstream to be in a 

better bargaining position. 

 

In the next 3 years, we will maintain our core business of vane production while transforming and 

diversifying to becoming a qualified supplier of aviation blades and military products OEM. Our target is to 

reduce reliance on traditional source of income  from a 100% single vane processing structure to 50% or 

less.

3. SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT AND APPROACH   

 

We are aware of the responsibility of an organization towards its community and country in relation to 

sustainable ESG factors before the Singapore Exchange’s (“SGX”) mandated for all listed entities to report 

their sustainability performance as most of our senior staff had attended ESG related talks and implemented 

policies according to the local compliance which could be found in this report. 

 

In recent years, the change in the procurement method of turbine manufacturers has put the OEM, like us, 

in a disadvantage, as our profit margins are being squeezed due to fierce competition. By the upward 

expansion of our business, we could reduce both material wastage and processing time drastically. This, in 

turn, will increase our profit margin significantly in the long run. 

 

During 2018, STE has adopted a sustainability framework based on the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) 

Standards guidelines (Core Option) in the preparation of this report. This report is part of our annual report 

which is also available at STE’s website at www.Shanghaiturbo.com 

 

3.1 Participation of Key Management in formation of our sustainability strategy 

A Steering Committee (3 members include AC Chairman, the CEO and the lead supervisor) and a Working 

Committee (5 members include the deputy GM, the group FC, subsidiary FC, HR manager and the lead 

supervisor) were formed to lead the Company’s sustainability efforts and are responsible for periodical 

meetings with the Board in determining sustainability issues in its business decisions. Sustainability and risk 

management are emphasized in the evaluation of any new orders or investment opportunities. The process 

has identified several material ESG factors for STE and are reflected in our materiality matrix under material 

considerations.

3.2 Materiality Identification Process 

 

During our materiality assessment process, we have prioritized through the following steps: 

 

1. Identify and Define important issues which might impact our business strategy 

2. Sorting out critical factors that might affect our stakeholders 

3. Prioritize selected factors and validate their severity within each business unit 

4. Embed solutions in the system and monitor regularly 

5. Adopt them to become our SOP or corporate culture when tested reliable  

 

The Committees identified the specific ESG factors which are material to the Group based on their collective 

and respective knowledge, the industrial perspective and their implications to our operations. Besides the 

regular in-house meetings on operational and financial progress, the committee members also engaged in 

regular dialogue sessions with the stakeholders for feedback and suggestions. For easy understanding of our 

stakeholders’ concern, (Stakeholders include our customers, employees, investors, suppliers,community and 

regulators), we chart the following materiality matrix to reflect their degree of importance towards the 

topics during the year 2018.

3.6 Engaging the Stakeholders 

 

The Company’s sustainability objectives must always be the interests and concerns of our stakeholders. 

 We had listed out here the 6 key groups in this report. 

 

We firmly believe that truthful and regular communication is the key to healthy stakeholder relationship.  

Over the years, we have engaged them via AGM, annual dinner, incentive tours, in house training 

programs, yearly industry convention, business talks and seminars, product exhibition and international  

trade fairs. Each of our business unit has always kept our stakeholders in mind in search of achieving  

our business excellence.

5.2 Current Human Capital Market in Changzhou 

During the period, 112 employees left the company and of which 10.7% （12）was terminated due to 

unfitness for their jobs and 42.9% （48）was due to retrenchment program and/or discontinuation of their 

employment contract by settlement. 46.4%(52) left for personal reasons. The average annual income for non 

private sector is already reaching RMB 83,909 in comparison with our worker’s income of RMB 50,000. The 

company faces more difficulty in attracting younger workers to join our traditional factory and work regime, 

particularly the polishing department where the air particle density is much higher. The ratio of annual total 

compensation of highest- paid individual to the median of total compensation for all employees is around 10 

times this reporting year. 

5.3 HR Policy     

During the year, the HR department had implemented several policies to enhance the benefits for the

7. MEASURES AND TARGETS for 2019 

In the coming years we will be focusing in resolving the following concerns. 

 

Sustainability Concerns 

Policies &amp; Measures 

Targets &amp; Impacted  

SDG Goals  

Diversification 

for 

Growth 

and 

Sustainability  

Our machines and skilled workers allow us 

to venture into other areas of product lines 

beside turbo engine vanes. Profit margin 

could be lower but it helps to cover some 

overhead cost. Also we are now working on 

several potential downstream businesses 

for acquisition and to expand our business 

upstream to be in a better bargaining 

position. 

 

 

 

In the next 3 years, we will 

maintain our core business 

of vane production while 

transforming &amp; diversifying 

to becoming a qualified 

supplier of aviation blades 

and military products OEM. 

Our target is to transform 

from a 100% single vane 

processing 

structure 

to 

50% or less.  

 

 

Environmental  

Compliance  

(There are five targets 

set for the coming 

year)  

1. Work Place Air and Environment  

We have set up a maintaining unit to 

constantly monitor the air condition and 

discharge level on a weekly basis. Workers 

are also sent for medical check-up regularly 

for 

certain 

production 

lines. 

HR 

department will report to the management 

meetings weekly. 

 

2. Waste Management 

We are reviewing the qualification and 

performance of our contractors regularly 

and assign supervisor to monitor their 

disposal procedures randomly.  

 

3. Production Safety Standardization 

We are to conduct in-house training and 

awareness seminars with all level of 

workers quarterly to ensure all safety 

standardization requirement SOPs are fully 

complied. 

 

 

 

 

To renovate the Polishing 

department 

and 

to 

improve 

the 

exhaust 

system by second quarter 

of 2019.  

 

 

 

 

Put in place a review 

committee in the next 

review and selection of 

contractors during 2019 

 

Zero accident due to high 

awareness of safely rules in 

2019

4. Supply Chain/Responsible Procurement 

To ensure raw material supply (about 80% 

purchased locally in 2018) is reliable and 

elastic within our purchasing and supply 

level, we are constantly sourcing for new 

suppliers and reviewing their supply code 

of conduct.  

Also we are Implementing  responsible 

procurement policies in the selection of 

construction vendors, material suppliers 

and project partners and monitor their 

ongoing performance.  

 

5. Energy Saving Plans  

In 2016 our power consumption was nearly 

RMB 5 million, this has reduced our profit 

and wasted energy due to poor power 

management and old compressor. 

We had replaced an old generator in 2017 

and put in place a energy saving plan of 

controlling the switches in a reasonable 

level. During this reporting year the power 

consumption had dropped to RMB 3.1 

million, but nevertheless partially due to 

reduction in production.  

A committee consists of 

staff of supply, account &amp; 

production 

departments 

will review the suppliers 

during the 3rd quarter of 

2019 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We will continue to ensure 

energy saving policy is 

consistent. The production 

unit concerned has set to 

reduce the energy saving 

up to 10% in year 2019 by 

implementing &amp; enforcing 

SOPs which were in already 

in place.  

 

Recruitment and  

Upgrading of  

skilled workers 

We are working closely with the local 

technical and vocational schools for fresh 

graduates to join the company to ensure a 

continual supply of younger workers with 

better 

technical 

know-how. 

Better 

incentives are provided for workers who 

are 

willing 

to 

learn 

and 

upgrade 

themselves. Also by constantly review their 

piece rates vs the complication of the work 

itself to ensure workers’ pay are fair and 

sustainable. 

To reduce the attrition 

rates by 5% in the next 

reporting 

year 

through 

revived incentives scheme 

and loyalty bonus. We also 

set targets for every worker 

at all levels to improve 

his/her skill by at least one 

grade 

in 

2019. 

 

Corporate  

Social  

Responsibility (CSR)    

We have plans to promote healthy life style 

among the industrial zone with annual walk 

&amp; jog campaign where charity contribution 

is a built-in element. Also we are proposing 

to set up a Scholarship scheme for both 

our staff children and for some selected 

schools in the long run. 

We aim to kick start the 

above plan by second half 

of the year 2019.
