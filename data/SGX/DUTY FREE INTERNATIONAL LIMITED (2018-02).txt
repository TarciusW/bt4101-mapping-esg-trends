Code of Ethics 

 

At DFI, we believe that strong business ethics is paramount to maintain and enhance 

stakeholders’ confidence in us. This shapes a culture of honesty and integrity which are integral 

in sustaining our business. 

Our employees are required to act responsibly and in compliance with the Group’s Code of 

Conduct (the “Code”). Likewise, we emphasise the need for our business partners to comply with 

the Code. Each of us have an obligation to ensure that the conduct of those who work with us 

complies with these standards. The Code provides clear guidelines for workplace ethics and 

professionalism in compliance with applicable laws.  

All employees are given a personal copy of the Code and are required to sign off their 

acknowledgement of responsibility to comply with the policies and procedures of the Group via 

the Employee Acknowledgement Form.  

 

Anti-Corruption and Whistle-Blowing Policy 

 

Anti-corruption policies and procedures are befittingly laid out in the Employee Handbook and in 

the Code which are accessible via the Group’s intranet or through physical briefing by their 

respective Heads of Department or Outlet Managers. 

As part of the anti-corruption procedures, we have established a Whistle-blowing Policy within the 

Group which provides an avenue for employees to raise genuine concerns. The policy was 

approved by the Board and subsequently disseminated to all employees via the intranet since 

September 2012.  

Under the policy, employees may address their concerns in writing to the Audit Committee 

Chairman of the Group. In such circumstances, employees are given assurance that they shall 

be protected from reprisals and victimisation. All information provided will be fairly investigated 

with due consideration given to the severity, reliability and credibility of the information.  

As at the financial year ended 28 February 2018, there were no complaints received by the Audit 

Committee Chairman of the Group on this matter.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

 

Stakeholders are integral to the sustainability of our business. It is fundamental for us to 

proactively engage and responsibly address the concerns of our stakeholders. This increases 

accountability and strengthens stakeholders’ confidence towards us. The feedback and concerns 

from our stakeholders help us understand their expectations, allowing us to prioritise our 

sustainability efforts effectively.  

As part of our materiality assessment process, we have identified our key stakeholders who have 

direct influence on our business and operations. Our key stakeholders include, but are not limited 

to customers, employees, Board of Directors, government, investors, suppliers and financiers.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

Materiality Assessment Process 

 

Material topics that are relevant to us are dependent on its degree of influence on our 

stakeholders’ decisions and the significance of economic, environmental and social impacts to 

our business.  

Internal stakeholders comprising the Group’s heads of key business functions and key 

management personnel (including Directors), were involved in providing their views and 

perspectives from the aforementioned two dimensions: significance of the impact to DFI and the 

importance to our stakeholders. The outcome of the materiality assessment, as shown in Diagram 

3 was presented and approved by the Board of Directors.  

We recognise that the materiality assessment process is essential in identifying stakeholders’ 

concerns and systematically formulating plans for our long-term sustainable business growth. 

The materiality assessment process is summarised in Diagram 2 as follows:  

 

Diagram 2: Materiality assessment process 

 

 



A list of potential material 

topics (economic, social 

and environmental) were 

identified based on the GRI 

Standards, media reviews 

and other internal and 

external sources.  

A customised questionnaire 

with a list of stakeholders 

and material sustainability 

topics was circulated to 

internal stakeholders to 

shortlist topics that are 

relevant to DFI. 







1. Identify 



2. Prioritise 



3. Validation 









During the materiality 

assessment workshop, key 

internal stakeholders were 

asked to rank each of the 

shortlisted material topics 

according to the 

aforementioned two 

dimensions. 



A summarised ranking 

of the material topics 

were presented to the 

Board of Directors for 

discussion and 

validation.  

Five (5) material topics 

were selected for this 

reporting period.

 OUR SUSTAINABILITY PILLARS 

 

Sustainability is crucial in unlocking shared value for the organisation and our stakeholders 

through our initiatives. The Group’s sustainability agenda has three areas of focus: Our Economic, 

Our People and Our Environment, and will serve as a guide for the Group’s future sustainability 

direction. 

For this reporting period, we have identified five material topics to fulfil our sustainability agenda 

as mapped in Diagram 4. We will work towards enhancing the disclosures and scope of our 

sustainability initiatives as we believe in the long-term benefits it has on our business and the 

communities around us.

OUR ECONOMIC 

 

Economic Performance 

 

The core value of our business is to provide customers with an exclusive duty free shopping 

experience beyond expectations by having the highest standards of customer service, retail 

execution and exquisite product offerings. Throughout the years, we have established an 

extensive market presence with branches at all major entry and exit points in Peninsular Malaysia. 

These branches are centrally managed in Penang, Malaysia. 

As we continue to financially excel and grow, we generate economic value and benefits to our 

diverse groups of stakeholder. Diagram 5 below showcases our direct economic value generated 

and the distribution of economic value to these stakeholder groups. Further details of our 

economic performance for the financial year ended 28 February 2018 can be found on Page 39-

OUR PEOPLE 

Employment 

 

Our employees are the most valuable assets of the Group. They contribute to the growth of our 

business by fulfilling our customers’ diverse needs and meeting operational targets. As such, we 

are mindful of our people’s well-being and strive to create a conducive and accessible working 

environment that encourages our people to excel. Our employees are guided by the Code of 

Ethics and the Employee Handbook. 

Our Workforce 

As at 28 February 2018, we had a total of 761 employees as compared to 856 employees in 

FY2017. We have embarked on an exercise to realign job scopes following the increased number 

of resignations to improve efficiency alongside the advancement of technology.  

 

In the travel retail industry, we believe that a diverse workforce enables us to better engage and 

understand the unique needs of our stakeholders. As such, we are in support of gender diversity 

in an effort to create an inclusive environment. We pledge to continue providing equal 

opportunities in hiring, career progression and remuneration packages strictly based on merits 

irrespective of gender, ethnicity or background. In FY2017 and FY2018, we are proud to 

showcase that we have a total of 52% and 53% women workforce, respectively. 

 

Over the years, we have established a strong business presence in our travel retail business. The 

understanding of local stakeholders’ needs is the key to achieving our service delivery goals, 

beyond ‘just selling’. As such, we are committed to the recruitment of local citizens with similar 

cultural background and the common ‘lingua franca’ to serve the local and international market. 

We have achieved 99.7% and 99.8% local hiring (Malaysian citizens) in both FY2018 and FY2017 

respectively.

Employment (cont’d) 

 

We strive to compensate our employees fairly and competitively and in line with the relevant labour 

laws in efforts to attract and retain our employees. Our full-time employees are entitled to benefits 

such as: 

• 

Group personal accident insurance 

• 

Group hospitalisation and surgical scheme 

• 

Healthcare 

• 

Hospitalisation and sick leave 

• 

Annual leaves 

• 

Statutory contributions to Employees Provident Fund (“EPF”), Social Security Organisation 

(“SOCSO”) and Employment Insurance System (“EIS”) 

• 

Parental leave 

Parental leave is an equitable gender benefit comprising both maternity and paternity leave. We 

ensure employees are aware of the aforementioned benefits through the employment contracts 

and the Employee Handbook on the intranet. We eminently encourage entitled male employees 

to utilise their paternity leaves whenever possible to help reduce the burden of their spouse as 

well as to have more bonding time with their family. This also positively impacts women to take 

such leave without prejudicing their career path.

Performance appraisal 

 

All employees at a minimum will receive one performance and career development review 

annually. This process aids personal development of employees and enhances employee 

satisfaction.  

Our performance and career development review process is established based on the Balanced 

Scorecard, which focuses on strategic alignment of targets and goals. Our performance and 

career development review process is summarised in Diagram 17.  

Diagram 17: Performance and career development review process 

 







Target setting



Each department 

will set their annual 

targets and key 

performance 

indicators for the 

employees, which 

ultimately aligns to 

the Group's vision.



Consultations



Employees may 

enquire and obtain 

advice on their 

performance 

expectations from 

their immediate 

superior. Their 

competencies will 

then be assessed 

and the necessary 

trainings will be 

recommended.



Appraisal



At year end, a one-

to-one appraisal 

session will be 

conducted between 

immediate superior 

and the employee 

to evaluate their 

work performance 

against the targets 

and expectations 

set.



Compensation



Any high achievers 

will be rewarded with 

lucrative monetary 

benefits, whereas for 

any under achievers, 

further trainings will 

be provided to help 

bridge their capability 

to the expected level 

of skill.

OUR ENVIRONMENT 

Energy 

Climate change is driving a shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly power generation, which 

includes renewable energy technology. The energy consumption associated with our travel retail 

branches and office buildings generates a significant footprint towards the environment. 

Consequently, we are progressively minimising our reliance on non-renewable sources of energy 

which in turn increases cost-efficiency.  

Our energy consumption during the financial year mainly relates to electricity consumption. 

Energy intensity for the Group is recorded at 7.14 MWh/employee as compared to 6.9 

MWh/employee in FY2017.

Energy (Cont’d) 

 

Our energy consumption is monitored on a monthly basis by each outlets and calculated using 

the conversion from RM to MWh. We have therefore been able to gather comparative information 

on energy consumption from each outlet as illustrated in Diagram 19 below. 

 

Henceforth, for FY2018, we set in motion the installation of solar panels at our Bukit Kayu Hitam 

outlet. Table 5 below shows the projection of our renewable energy generation capacity.  

     Table 6: Projection of renewable energy capacity 

Going forward, we will extend this initiative to other outlets as a part of our progress towards 

reducing the reliance on non-renewable sources of energy.

Management Approach  

Principles and Commitments 

 

DFI strives to reduce reliance on non-renewable sources of energy in light of climate change. 

 

Monitoring and Control Systems 

 

Energy consumption monitoring 

 

We monitor all outlets’ monthly energy consumption as shown on Page 18. 

 

Solar panel performance tracking system 

 

The installed solar panels’ performance is tracked using vendor’s photovoltaic (PV) system, 

Sunny Portal. This system allows DFI to access and analyse key system data remotely and in 

real time. The monitoring mechanism measures both the overall consumption of internal power 

and external energy as well as the generation of power for self-consumption. These data are 

available on a daily, monthly and yearly basis and includes historical data. The system is able to 

detect minor deviations and resolve it quickly. There is also a built-in community portal for DFI 

to benchmark our PV system data with other peer users.
