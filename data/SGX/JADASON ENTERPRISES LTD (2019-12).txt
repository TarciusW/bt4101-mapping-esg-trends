DEAR STAKEHOLDERS, 

Jadason Enterprises Ltd (the “Company”, together with its subsidiaries, the “Group” or  “Jadason” or “we” or “us” 

or “our”) is the leading supplier of equipment and supplies to the printed circuit board (“PCB”) industry. We are 

pleased to release our third Sustainability Report, subscribing to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, 

in accordance with the Core option, and in line with Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) guidelines on Sustainability 

Report.  

The Group continue to focus on the two plants in Dongguan, China as the reporting boundary for FY2019 as they 

generate the highest weightage on the Group’s revenue, as well as having the widest material impact on 

sustainability issues that were identified. The two plants in Dongguan, China classified under “Manufacturing and 

Support Services” in the Group’s business segment, provides PCB drilling service and PCB mass lamination to 

the PCB manufacturers in China, relied heavily on energy, water and material usage in their day-to-day operation.

SUSTAINABILITY  

REPORT 2019

2019 had been a challenging year for the Group. For the most part of the year, the US-China trade war remains 

unresolved, and uncertainties had continue to weigh on manufacturers and their business decisions. The 

“Manufacturing and Support Services” business segment in China had saw a lower volume of PCB drilling and 

PCB mass lamination jobs flowing into the plants. 

We remain positive in the growth prospect of the PCB industry in the coming year. The increasing demand for 

greater digitalisation / automation, connected devices, high speed data transmission, usage of electric vehicles 

due to growing environmental concern, biodegradable PCB, etc., provides opportunities for growth in this 

industry.  We will invest to enhance our manufacturing capabilities and ensure that we are able to meet the 

requirements of our customers and to prepare for the upswing in business. 

With the continue investment to enhance our manufacturing capabilities and to prepare for the upswing in 

business, it will inevitably increase the usage on energy, water and materials in the plants. We are well aware that 

this will create an impact on the environment and we had integrated our sustainability practices into our business 

process, like electric reduction plan, etc. in both plants. 

We are committed to run a responsible business which requires a delicate balancing of long-term interest of our 

planet, employees and business profitability as identified on the materiality topic namely Corporate Governance, 

Environmental, Economic and Social for our Sustainability Report, which can be found on page 16 in this report. 

We are actively monitoring and improving on our sustainability practices and working towards a sustainable and 

responsible business.   

We are committed to providing high quality and maintaining stringent controls striving for continuous operational 

excellence without compromising on the environment. We will continue to integrate sustainability into our 

business operation, building a sustainable business for the next generation.

Our People form the backbone of Jadason with our identified core business segment - Equipment and Supplies, 

and Manufacturing and Support Services. Our People contributed endlessly in providing a high and reliable 

quality as well as good services to our customer across our distribution network across Asia. They are crucial to 

the growth and progress of Jadason. Without the selfless contribution, commitment and effort of each and every 

employees that work with us throughout the years, Jadason will not come to be where we are today.  

In FY2018, we had consolidate and report the Group’s total employee hire and turnover rate as well as 

diversification profile to be in line with GRI standard. In FY2019, Jadason will not be implementing any changes 

to the reporting of our employees other than including the growth and development of our employees into our 

report as a Group instead of reporting within the two plants in Dongguan, China.

4.1 

Employment Profile 

With the lower volume of PCB drillings and PCB mass 

lamination jobs in China, and the difficulty in retaining 

employees in China as well as gearing towards 

automation, the total employment headcount for China 

had decreased by 25% compared to the previous 

reporting year. The total employment headcount in other 

countries reported minimum changes from previous year. 

This results in the decrease of the total employment 

headcount in Jadason across Asia by 22% from 2018, 

bringing it to 544 in 2019.    

In 2019, Jadason saw an increase in the percentage of 

permanent contract workers in the Group compared to the 

previous reporting year, where the total number of 

temporary contract worker and supervised worker 

decreased in this reporting year.  

Similar to the years before, China had accounted the 

largest workforce in Jadason in 2019 followed by Thailand 

and Singapore.

Diversification 

In Jadason, we value all our employees despite of their 

age, gender, religion, etc and provide equal opportunity to 

them. We hire our employees on the basis of value and 

competency instead of age, gender, religion, etc.  

We believe that having a diversified group of employees 

working and learning together can aid with the growth of 

the organisation. The younger group tends to be more 

energetic, tech savvy and innovative while the older group 

tends to be more mature, reliable and possessed wealth 

of experience. This two group can learn from each other 

to bring the company to the next level.  

From the distribution table shown on the right, there is a 

significant difference between the male and female 

employees in China as compared to the other countries. 

Our business in China, mainly where our PCB drilling and 

PCB mass lamination service is situated, is traditionally 

more towards male dominated due to the nature of the 

work being more physical demanding. As such, it does not 

stop us from hiring female employees whom are deemed 

as competent for the job.  

China carrying a huge weightage of the total employee 

headcount of 82.9% in the Group of which 75.4% of the 

total employee headcount in China are male, putting a 

heavy weightage on the total male employee in the Group 

despite several countries reported a higher percentage of 

female headcount.  

With the decrease in total headcount in China this year, 

the percentage between male and female employee in the 

Group had slide towards female employees. Breaking the 

record on the reported total male employee above 70% for 

2 consecutive years. 

In 2018, we started to report diversification of the total 

employment headcount as a Group, our historical data for 

this aspect will be limited to 2018 and after.

Growth and Development 

Subtracting the business outlook around the world that will 

affect the organisation, the growth and development of the 

employees may affect the organisation as well. With the 

continuous training, learning and developing in view with the 

movement and changes in the business market around the 

world, be it in the skill of Information Technology (IT), 

Engineering, Technical, etc., the Group will be able to sustain 

and growth together.  

Continuous training provides the employee with better 

understanding and expectation on task being assigned to 

them. This could help the employee to build up their 

confidence when performing on daily work as well as 

business operation and further excelling them.   

With COVID-19 situation that arise in the December 2019 

affecting several countries in 2020, we aim to maintain the 

training hours per employee for 2020. 

Starting from this reporting year, we will not limit on the 

reporting of our growth and development record to the two 

plants in Dongguan, China. Jadason will report the growth 

and development record as a Group.  

As such, the historical data for this aspect will be limited to

Jadason provides a “one-stop” service through the two plants in Dongguan, China to meet the outsourcing needs 

of PCB manufacturers operating in China. The two plant in Dongguan, China categorised as “Manufacturing and 

Support Services” business segment specialise in PCB, FPC drilling, laser drilling, PCB contour routing machine, 

drill pointing and PCB inner layer mass lamination.  

The daily operations in 

t h e t w o p l a n t s i n 

Dongguan, China, 

works around with 

energy, water and 

material and accounted 

as the major usage in 

the Group and are 

aware that such usage 

will put the environment 

to strain in the long-run. 

This will in turn affects 

the sustainability of our 

future generations and the 

Group’s business.  

With the challenge in retaining employees and the lower volume of PCB drilling and PCB mass lamination job 

flowing to China from the drawn-out US-China trade war in FY2019, the total employment headcount recorded for 

the two plants in Dongguan, China had decreased by 30% comparing to the previous reporting year. 

 

The Group continuously review its process to reduce manpower requirement and expanding on the production 

capacity. Jadason had progressively invested in automation equipments and processes to reduce its manpower 

needs and enhanced on operation effectiveness while to prepare and support in the upswing of the business.

Environmental  

In Jadason, we integrate our sustainability practices into our business process of the two plants in Dongguan, China to 

manage the impact of our business operations and activities to the environment.  

The progressive investment in automated equipments and processes to reduce 

reliance of manpower and enhanced operation effectiveness, to prepare and support 

in the upswing of the business, will no doubt adding stress to the environment due to 

the increase in energy and water requirement. With more environmental concern and 

the improve in technology, equipments and/or machines moving towards energy 

saving criteria which on the other hand maintaining on the energy usage despite have 

more equipments. The Group constantly review on its energy reduction plan in the 

plants to lighten the stress on energy usage.   

Of the two plants in Dongguan, China, one of the plants is governed by ISO 14001 

guidelines on the environmental management systems. We are committed to 

minimise the environmental impact of the business operation for both plants in 

Dongguan, China with our best effort.  

In FY2019, the two plants in Dongguan, China had reported one new supplier that underwent screening  

based on the environment criteria.

Material  

The business operation of our two plants in Dongguan, China requires high volume of 

materials of which majority are procured across China.  

The category of materials being used in the two plants in Dongguan, China are 

namely “raw material”, “associated process material” and “materials for packaging”. 

Direct measurements methodology is practiced in the two plants to collect the usage 

volume of the materials identified.  

We recognised that the volume of materials used in our business operation in 

Dongguan, China will inevitably create an impact to the environment. We practice on 

utilising the materials to every bits that we can before disposing them to minimise the 

wastage of the material and to play our part moving towards sustainability.  

Due to the undervalue figures collected in FY2017 for the category “Associated Process 

Materials” and “Materials for Packaging”, shows a lower usage figure despite having the highest production yield in the three 

years in Dongguan, China. 

We aim to maintain or to have a low increase in the material used in the coming years, when the production yield increase.

Waste  

The waste materials that was generated by the two plants 

in Dongguan, China are disposed according to the China 

waste disposal regulatory requirement. We engaged 

licensed and certified third party waste treatment 

contractor for the collection and disposal of waste 

materials for the two plants in Dongguan, China. 

The waste materials generated in the plants were stored 

and categorised in an easily understand manner in the 

plants to avoid mixing up with other usable material. The 

third party waste treatment contractor will then drop by the 

two plants as scheduled to collect the waste material.  

Waste materials that ware identified as renewable will be 

stored in a separate area from non-renewable waste. 

These renewable waste will then being sold to a third 

party collector in Dongguan, China for recycling process.  

The lower volume of PCB drillings and PCB laminating 

jobs flow to the plants, and the gradual change in the 

equipments the amount of materials used in the two plants 

had decreased compared to the previous reporting year. 

The percentage of renewable and non-renewable 

materials had falls back to almost the same weightage in 

FY2017. 

We recognised that the high weightage of non-renewable 

materials used in the two plants put a strain to the 

environment. We aim to maintain the weightage of 

renewable material used even though the production yield 

increase in the next reporting year.

Energy Consumption  

Our business operation in Dongguan, China generally works around machineries and equipments on a daily basis, consuming 

high amount of electric energy. We are well aware that the amount of energy consumption in the plants will create an impact 

to our environment and affect on the sustainability of our business in the long-run.  

Our electric energy is directly purchased from municipal electric supplier situated in Dongguan, China. Periodical checking 

and recording of the electric usage from electric meters for the two plants were arranged by the electric supplier follow by 

billing the usage amount to the two plants.  

In the previous reporting year, we had changed the recording measurement from 

“KWH” in FY2017 to “TCE” in FY2018 and will follow this measurement unit from 

FY2018 onwards. The two plants in Dongguan, China subscribes to GB/T13234-2009 

on the methodologies and assumptions used for calculation of energy consumption 

with the calculation method as follow: 

(12 months x 30 days x KWh) / 10,000 x 1.229 = tce

ELECTRIC ENERGY CONSUMPTION

The electric energy consumption of the two plants in 

Dongguan, China had dropped 11% in terms of “TCE” 

calculation compared to the previous reporting year. With 

the energy saving plan in place, the electric energy 

consumption was further reduced in FY2019 from the 

lower production yield and employment headcount of the 

plants.  

We will strictly adhere to the standards on electric energy 

consumption and reduction plan to achieve our energy 

reduction goal in FY2020. We continuously review our 

energy saving plan through monitoring, analysing and 

optimising the energy consumption in the plants.  

We aim to achieve a 5% reduction of electric energy 

consumption from FY2018 “TCE” reporting figure for our 

first short-term plan that was set in FY2018.

Water Withdrawal 

Our two plants in Dongguan, China, recorded substantially high 

amount of water withdrawal for our business operation and 

periodically machinery upkeep and maintenance. The main water 

supply source for our plants is from municipal water supplier situated 

in Dongguan, while other water supply source is from our own water 

recycle plant that is situated in one of our plants.  

In our water recycle plant, we subscribe to the PCB industrial water 

standard, methodology and assumption. This standard is relevant to 

our business operation of the plant where the water recycle plant is 

situated.  

The total water usage of the two plants is tabulated to an estimate of 

354,700 tonnes of water withdrawn from our municipal water supplier 

and our water recycle plant. Despite the decrease in employment 

headcount and the decrease in production yield, the total water 

usage of the two plants had increased by 18.3% from the previous 

reporting year. There is a slight increase in the amount of recycled 

water used in the plant compared to municipal water used in the 

plant from the previous reporting year and the total volume of water 

recycled in the plant had increased by 48.5% from FY2018.

Employee Wellness  

With the rapid growth in China over the years, and more business setting up in the country creating more working 

opportunities for the people, it posses a challenge to the businesses in China to retain manpower in the company, which does 

not exclude Jadason.  

Growing importance on employee well-being, welfare, and incentives had surfaced over the years. It's believed that employee 

wellness leads to higher employee retention rate, which could affects the productivity of the workforce in the plants.  

The two plants in Dongguan, China provide full-time employees with benefits consisting insurance (maternity, industrial injury, 

medical and pension/retirement, etc), housing provident fund, and leaves (annual, marriage, maternity, etc). Additional 

retirement plan is being drawn up for male and female employees above 60 years old and 50 years old respectively. Unlike 

full-time employee, our part-time and temporary employees do not enjoy most of the benefits mentioned.  

Our employees are able to utilise places like the Reading Room, Entertainment Room, TV Room, etc during their spare time.  

We recognise on the importance for our employees to feel a sense of belonging with the company throughout their 

employment with Jadason. Activities such as basketball match, tug-of-war, table tennis or even other sports were organised 

for the employees, which could unite the employees, promote on team bonding and cultivating team work among the 

employees.

Healthy and Safety  

The health and safety of our employees is an important factor to 

us. We believe that having an accidental prone, dangerous and/

or hazardous working environment will affect both our employees 

and business operation. We subscribe and comply to the safety 

requirements of China reporting standard (GB6441-86), ISO 

9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 standards.  

Employees are required to strictly comply to the safety measures 

drawn up in the plants. We will arrange trainings for our 

employees to educate on the proper method in handling 

machineries, equipments, materials and waste materials, logistic 

flow in the plants, etc to minimise the risk of accident in the 

plants.  

We achieved zero fatality across our plants in Dongguan, China 

in FY2019 and aim to achieve zero fatality for the upcoming 

reporting years.  

There is a re-adjustment on the total injuries counts for the 

previous reporting years due to the figures provided by one of the 

plants had been provided wrongly. With the adjustment, a 

downward trend on the total injuries count can be observed 

compared to the previous years. We aim to continue reduce our
