Board Statement 

 

The Board of Directors (“Board”) of Colex Holdings Limited (“Colex” or “Company”) is pleased to present 

our third sustainability report.  

 

At Colex, we aspire to lead the waste management and contract cleaning sector with credibility and a 

strong focus on corporate social responsibility. We seek to continually create long term value for our 

shareholders. Since Colex was formed, we have been investing in our people and contributing to local 

communities while building our business in waste management and contract cleaning. We believe in 

the importance of building sustainability into our Company’s ethos for the benefit of the environment 

and the long-term success of our business.  

The Board considers sustainability to be an important part of Colex’s business strategy formulation and 

decision-making processes. A designated team made up of representatives from various divisions 

across Colex, known as the Sustainability Steering Committee, develops sustainability policies and 

manages and monitors the Company’s sustainability risks, opportunities and performance.  

 

This year, we revalidated the material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors that were 

identified in the past two years as of high importance to our business and stakeholders. The Board is 

responsible for overseeing the management and monitoring of these material ESG factors. 

 

The Board continues to be involved in the identification of associated key performance indicators 

(“KPIs”) and targets relating to each material topic for the following year. We believe that with specific 

KPIs and targets, Colex will have a clearer direction and more effective strategy formulation to address 

any gaps and enhance our sustainability performance.

Sustainability at Colex 

 

 

In the National Day Rally 2019 speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted Singapore’s waste 

generation and management issue and the need for a sustainable solution in our efforts to mitigate 

climate change1. As the amount of waste disposed of in Singapore has increased seven-fold over the 

last 40 years, Singapore’s only landfill, Semakau Landfill, is expected to run out of space by 2035 at this 

rate2. In 2019, Singapore’s inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan was launched to map out Singapore’s key 

strategies in building a sustainable, resource-efficient and climate-resilient nation. The plan includes 

adopting a circular economy approach to waste management and best practices in the 3Rs (reduce, 

reuse and recycle).  

 

As part of the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, Singapore targets to achieve a 70% overall national 

recycling rate, a 30% domestic recycling rate and an 81% non-domestic recycling rate by 20303. 

 

As a public waste collector, we play a key role in offering and upholding the integrity of reliable and 

sustainable waste collection and management systems in view of our duties over public health, safety 

and environmental conservation that we are entrusted with. Therefore, we strive to align our goals and 

actions with that of Singapore’s trajectory as well as global goals for sustainable development. We 

ensure that adequate controls and measures are in place to monitor the collection, transport and 

appropriate management of general waste and recyclables separately. Utilising our role and influence 

as a public environmental service provider, we support and encourage recycling in conjunction with 

individual, business and government efforts, such as conducting educational recycling tours in our 

Material Recovery Facilities (“MRF”) and implementing the Cash-for-Trash program in residential areas. 

 

We are pleased to present this report and we aim to stay agile and relevant, easily adapting to the 

everchanging needs of the environment and society.

Materiality  

Identifying material ESG factors that can potentially have significant impacts on our core business 

operations and stakeholders is crucial for Colex to make more effective decisions. In 2017, a formal 

materiality assessment was conducted to identify ESG risks and opportunities that are most relevant to 

our business and stakeholders. The materiality assessment was guided by the GRI Principles of 

Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement. Through an internal stakeholder survey and a workshop 

involving Colex’s representatives, the material topics were prioritised using a materiality matrix and 

based on consideration of the following factors:  

 

• 

global and local emerging sustainability trends; and 

• 

material topics identified by industry peers;  

 

This year, we have reviewed and revalidated the list of material factors identified in the past two years, 

having considered the interests and concerns of our key stakeholders, megatrends and the current 

state of our business model.  

 

The following table summarises Colex’s material factors identified:

Environmental 

The scope of environmental factors covers only our waste management operations under CEPL which 

account for most of the material issues in respect of waste and recycling, water and effluents and 

energy and emissions arising from our operations. 

Waste and Recycling 

FY2019’s Performance 

 

Amount of waste collected for recycling and/or composting: 1,663 tonnes (0.59% of total waste 

collected) 

Performance Against FY2019’s Target 

 

Continued to bundle waste disposal and recycling services to further encourage recycling of 

waste, in line with our target for FY2019 

FY2020’s Target 

 

 Continue to bundle waste recycling services to further encourage recycling of waste 

 

As a waste management provider, Colex contributes towards protecting the environment by managing 

the waste generated in the areas we serve in an efficient and sustainable manner.  

In 2019, we continue to serve the private condominiums and HDB residents in Jurong by collecting both 

waste and recyclable items from this area. We view this contract as an opportunity for us to fulfil a 

community service obligation and strive to ensure that our services are delivered to a high standard. At 

the beginning of each day, a driver job card with an assigned collection route is provided to each driver 

collecting waste. Waste pick-ups are tracked and monitored through a Global Positioning System 

(“GPS”) tracker installed on each collection truck. Each driver’s job card is signed off by a supervisor 

upon returning to the site of the facility. Furthermore, the bodies of our general waste and recycling 

trucks are painted yellow and blue respectively to ensure that the trucks are easily distinguishable. 

These control measures ensure that waste is collected and sent to the disposal sites or MRF 

appropriately. 

Colex encourages recycling by offering our clients the option of bundling recycling services with general 

waste contracts. We have strategically placed signages around the areas we serve to direct more 

residents towards our recycling bins. We also encourage recycling through our Cash-for-Trash initiative 

which incentivises residents to recycle their unwanted items with Colex. All commercial, industrial and 

residential recyclable materials collected are taken to the MRF where the sorting of carton boxes, 

paper, plastics, metal and aluminum takes place. The sorted recyclables will subsequently be sold to 

various vendors to be used locally or exported.  

 

The amount of waste collected for recycling and composting (garden waste) increased from 1,430 

tonnes in FY2018 to 1,663 tonnes in FY2019. Further, the percentage of waste collected for recycling 

and composting over the total waste collected increased slightly from 0.52% in FY2018 to 0.59% in 

FY2019. The table below shows a breakdown of the amount of waste collected.

At our MRF, the percentage of materials recovered is about 25% of the total materials collected for 

recycling, which remained relatively constant from FY2017 to FY2019. 

As for Colex’s daily waste management operations, one of the main wastes that we generate is engine 

oil from our workshops. As engine oil is a toxic waste which cannot be recovered, we have engaged 

waste disposal specialists for the safe handling and incineration of the waste. There was a 13% increase 

in the amount of engine oil waste that we generated from 3,000 litres in FY2018 to 3,400 litres in 

FY2019, which was due to increase in servicing required as a result of aging fleet.  

Water and Effluents 

FY2019’s Performance 

 

Water intensity: 0.015 m3/tonne of waste collected 

Performance Against FY2019’s Target 

 

Achieved our FY2019’s target of maintaining or reducing our water intensity from 0.018 

m3/tonne of waste collected in FY2018  

FY2020’s Target 

 

Maintain water intensity at current levels 

 

According to PUB, Singapore’s total water demand is expected to double by 2060 with the non-

domestic sector accounting for 70%5. Thus, we are committed to consume water responsibly to avoid 

unnecessary wastage and reduce water stress in the region.  

 

Washing trucks and cleaning the MRF accounts for significant water withdrawal and wastewater 

generated for Colex. We strive to improve water efficiency in our operations. To reduce our water 

withdrawal, training and information on water-saving measures are provided to truck drivers to raise 

awareness on water conservation. We also use rainwater stored in a tank in our daily operations. 

 

The chart below shows our annual water withdrawal and water intensity calculated using annual water 

withdrawal over the total amount of waste collected in tonnes during the year.

All water used on our premises and in our business operations was from the Public Utilities Board 

("PUB”). In FY2019, our water withdrawal was 4,293 m3, a reduction of 14% from 4,971 m3 in FY2018. 

Our water intensity decreased by 16% from 0.018 m3/tonne in FY2018 to 0.015 m3/tonne in FY2019.   

 

Meanwhile, we ensure that adequate measures are taken to manage the discharge of wastewater from 

the washing of trucks and the cleaning of the MRF as improper management of such wastewater may 

lead to potential environmental and health risks. We engage a licenced contractor to collect 

wastewater generated on a daily basis. The wastewater is then sent to a third-party treatment plant.  

Moreover, a wastewater treatment plant has been installed at Colex since December 2018. The treated 

water is reused together with rain water collected for truck washing purposes. As a result, our water 

withdrawal and intensity have been reduced.

Energy and Emissions 

FY2019’s Performance 

 

Total energy intensity: 0.204 GJ/tonne of waste collected 

 

Total GHG emissions intensity from energy consumption: 0.015 tCO2e/tonne 

Performance Against FY2019’s Target 

 

Achieved our FY2019’s target of maintaining or reducing energy intensity from 0.207 GJ/tonne 

in FY2018  

FY2020’s Target 

 

Maintain energy intensity and GHG emissions intensity at current levels 

In the waste management industry, energy consumption accounts for a substantial portion of operating 

costs and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions.  The equipment in our MRF run on electricity, while some 

machines, tools, as well as trucks and vans used in our operations consume diesel. We strive to reduce 

our energy consumption to lower our operating costs and cut down our carbon footprint. We have 

implemented robust monitoring and management systems to ensure energy efficiency. 

 

To reduce our energy consumption and GHG emissions, we use fuel-efficient vehicles in our operations 

and regularly upgrade existing vehicles. Training is provided to each truck driver on using the shortest 

routes possible and tracking each vehicle’s diesel consumption using a computerised system. Trucks 

and vans that have high diesel consumption are inspected and serviced if required and the diesel 

consumption of each vehicle is presented to the management on a monthly basis. In addition, we use 

automated trucks and electric lifters when collecting and sorting waste as a way of cutting down on 

GHG emissions and noise pollution in the areas we serve. All vehicles are inspected yearly to comply 

with the Land Transport Authority’s Carbon Emissions-Based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS). We also adhere 

to United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)’s R101 Fuel Consumption standards. To 

promote environmental awareness, a truck inspection manual is provided to each truck driver and 

posters on environmental issues are displayed within our premises. Beyond energy efficiency, we also 

make sure that our vehicles comply with the pollution emission standards. Currently, we own 26 Euro 

5 vehicles, 29 Euro 4 vehicles and 10 Euro 3 vehicles. As such, all 65 of our vehicles use high-quality, 

low-sulphur diesel that is purchased directly from the refinery.   

 

At Colex’s office, we use energy-efficient appliances such as LED lights, motion sensors and an efficient 

air-conditioner. We disconnect the electricity supply to the MRF when it is not in use. We also 

encourage our employees to turn off lights when they are not in use. We track and carefully monitor 

the MRF’s electricity consumption and regularly report its usage to the management every month. This 

measure allows us to promptly identify any issues leading to abnormally high consumption.  

The chart below illustrates our total energy consumption which consists of diesel6 and electricity used 

within our waste management operations, and our total energy intensity which is calculated based on 

total energy consumption over total waste collected in tonnes during the year. 

 

 

6 Diesel consumption is converted from litres to joules using the conversion factors derived from IPCC 2006, IEA 

2005.

Our total energy consumption for FY2019 is 58,019 GJ, a 1% increase from 57,181 GJ of total energy 

used in FY2018. Nevertheless, our total energy intensity decreased by 1% from 0.2077 GJ/tonne in 

FY2018 to 0.204 GJ/tonne in FY2019.  

The following table depicts the total GHG emissions arising from our waste management operations, 

which consists of direct (scope 1) GHG emissions8 and energy indirect (scope 2) GHG emissions9, and 

the total GHG emissions intensity which is calculated based on total GHG emissions over total waste 

collected in tonnes during the year.

At Colex, we prioritise the occupational health and safety of our employees. We recognise that some 

of our employees may be exposed to health and safety risks in their regular scope of work and duties. 

We strive for an incident and injury-free workplace by implementing safety practices and continually 

looking for ways to reduce health and safety risks wherever possible. It is our responsibility to ensure 

that the working conditions of our employees adhere to international standards. In 2017, Colex was 

certified under ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 standards.  

 

Our operations are assessed for health and safety risks on a regular basis. Colex has been certified by 

an external auditor recognised by the Singapore Accreditation Council to attain the bizSAFE Level 3 

status. BizSAFE is a five-step programme to help companies build up capabilities in addressing 

workplace safety, health and security. Members of Colex’s top management team took part in a bizSAFE 

Workshop for Top Management conducted by a bizSAFE service provider. A Risk Management (“RM”) 

Champion was then appointed to participate in a bizSAFE course to develop a RM Implementation Plan. 

Upon successful implementation of the RM Plan to mitigate all the highlighted risks in the plan, Colex 

is audited every three years by an external third party approved by the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) 

to attain the bizSAFE Level 3 certificate, with the latest audit being conducted in FY2018. 

Colex provides safety training to employees of CEPL and IPM . Colex has also made it mandatory for all 

new employees to attend a safety induction course and has given each employee a safety handbook 

which contains information on health and safety procedures for their daily activities at Colex. We also 

ensure that our welders receive regular health screenings and medical tests to ensure they remain in 

fit for work. We have an emergency response team on standby, who are trained in firefighting and first 

aid, in compliance with the Singapore Civil Defence Force’s requirements for facilities with on-site diesel 

tanks.  

ISO 9001:2015 specifies the requirements for a quality management system to meet customer

Performance Against FY2019’s Targets 

 

Continued to raise awareness about recycling by inviting students from local schools to visit our 

plants and facilities, in line with our target for FY2019 

FY2020’s Targets 

 

Continue to raise public awareness of recycling through educational trips to our MRF 

 

Colex takes responsibility in promoting better waste management and encouraging the use of recycling 

amongst the local communities. Colex believes that such actions are essential to foster a clean and 

healthy community. We provide community services and implemented several initiatives aimed at 

raising awareness about the importance of proper waste disposal and recycling. For example, we 

invited schools to visit the MRF to give them an understanding on how waste is sorted and recycled. In 

2019, we had 3 visits to the MRF and reached approximately 90 students in total.  We also worked with 

these schools on their newspaper collection initiatives under the Community Involvement Programme 

(CIP). Furthermore, we run recycling programmes for the community, such as the Cash-for-Trash 

initiative held every Sunday in Jurong. The initiative encourages residents to recycle and to keep 

recyclable materials out of landfills. 

 

While our business operations can have some negative impacts on local communities, such as noise 

pollution, traffic congestion and road safety hazards, we are working towards minimising such issues 

through the careful planning and monitoring of our waste collection schedule. Our waste collection 

schedule is based on the needs of our residents, ensuring quality services to the communities we serve. 

For example, the driver’s card is signed off by a supervisor daily to ensure that each driver adheres to 

the waste collection schedule. Moreover, we have stopped our waste collection activities at business 

centres during peak and lunch hours and have adjusted our waste collection schedules and routes 

according to routines of residents. Our cleaning services are adjusted based on clients’ schedules and 

needs and their demands and services are monitored on a regular basis.   

We have a strict no-missed collection policy and require our drivers to adhere to a 7am-7pm collection 

schedule. All our trucks are fitted with speed limiters and our truck drivers are required to adhere to a 

speed limit of 60 km/h so as not to endanger the safety of our communities.

Achieved our FY2019’s target of achieving zero incidents of significant14 non-compliance with all 

relevant socioeconomic and environmental laws and regulations 

FY2020’s Target 

 

Achieve zero incidents of significant14 non-compliance with all relevant socioeconomic and 

environmental laws and regulations. 

 

 

Colex strives to comply with various laws and regulations. We are committed to meeting the 

requirements of NEA’s environmental and public health regulations and MOM’s labour and safety 

regulations in order to minimise harm to human health and the environment. For instance, in FY2019, 

we ensured that all Hooklift-mounted trucks were fitted with reversing cameras in compliance with 

NEA’s Environmental Public Health Regulations. In FY2019, there were zero incidents of significant14 

non-compliance with all relevant socioeconomic and environmental laws and regulations.  

We comply with training requirements and send all our drivers and attendants to attend Singapore 

Workforce Skills Qualifications (“WSQ”)’s and NEA’s Clean Mark training programmes. We also ensure 

that our cleaners take WSQ’s courses and are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to 

perform their jobs safely and effectively. We conduct regular checks on employees’ identification cards 

(“IDs”) and work permits to ensure that we are compliant with the MOM’s regulation regarding the 

employment of illegal and “phantom”15 workers.  

At Colex, we ensure compliance with various environmental laws and regulations enforced by NEA, 

other regulatory bodies and international standards (such as ISO 14000). All our operations meet the 

requirements of the ISO 14000 (environmental management) and ISO 9000 (quality management) 

standards. Our employees are also required to familiarise themselves with NEA’s Code of Practice for 

Licensed General Waste Collectors. We have implemented measures to minimise the environmental 

impact of all aspects of our business, which includes ensuring no leakages from trucks and proper 

containment of waste during waste collection. 

We also offer training to directors and relevant employees regularly whenever there are changes made 

to existing laws and policies. Information about these laws and policies is included in the company 

handbook and is provided to all employees.   

 

 

14 Significant non-compliance is an incident resulting in a fine over SGD 10,000. 

15 Phantom workers do not genuinely work for a company but their identifications are used for fraudulent 

purposes.
