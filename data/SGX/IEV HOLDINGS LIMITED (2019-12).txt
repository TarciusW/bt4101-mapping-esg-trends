This is IEV Holdings Limited’s (“IEV”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) third sustainability report 

(“Report”). This Report covers economic, environmental, social, and governance (“EESG”) related factors 

identified for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”).

Sustainability at IEV means providing infrastructure, engineering, and customer-driven services in a responsible 

manner that respects people, their safety, and the environment. This Report identifies the key sustainability 

challenges that IEV faces in its day-to-day operations and the ways in which the Group has responded to such 

challenges. 

The Group strives to proactively improve on its sustainability efforts by conducting annual materiality 

assessments that identify EESG issues of particular interest to our stakeholders. These assessments help us 

ensure our operations reflect and adapt to any changes in business priorities and prevailing events, while 

supporting our commitment to maintaining environmentally and socially sustainable business practices.

This Report details FY2019 material issues and the actions taken by IEV to manage the EESG performance of 

our asset integrity management division. The issues discussed in this Report are:

ABOUT THIS REPORT

Throughout each year, we use a structured process to select our list of topics and assess their validity. We 

engage with various groups and individuals to understand specific concerns about our operations and its 

impact, particularly in relation to the environment and society. We consider, among others, the views of our 

stakeholders such as employees, investors, and customers. We gather opinions and advice in various ways 

including formal and informal meetings, surveys, and site visits.

Our sustainability assessment is conducted annually and this Report is set out on a “comply or explain” basis in 

accordance with Listing Rule 711B and Practise Note 7F of the Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist of 

the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”). IEV has adopted the Global Reporting Initiative 

(“GRI”) Standards: Core Option for the preparation of this Report, which provides a globally recognised 

framework for companies to measure and communicate EESG performance.

IEV has not sought external assurance for this Report. This Report should be read in conjunction with IEV’s 

annual report for FY2019 (“Annual Report 2019”).

MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD

Dear Valued Stakeholders, 

As we move into a time of extraordinary turbulence 

brought about by the global Covid-19 pandemic, we 

strive to continue to make positive contributions to 

our stakeholders and society at large. 

In 

FY2019, 

our 

attention was 

focused 

on 

discontinuing, divesting, and impairing parts of our 

business that were adversely affected by low oil 

prices. Despite such pressures, we have remained 

committed to upholding core principles that support 

our business. These are: a safety-oriented culture; 

zero tolerance of bribery and corruption; and an 

open and transparent system for checking on the 

health and safety of our employees, protection of 

the environment, and efficiency of our operations.

To those ends, we have expanded our framework for 

sustainability reporting. In this Report, we include 

disclosures on labour and management relations to 

show how we uphold care, fairness, and equitability 

as we transform into a leaner entity.

We have also expanded our reporting by including 

the following indicators to assess our sustainability 

performance:

• Waste generation and significant waste-related 

   impacts

• Management of significant waste-related impacts

• Worker training on occupational health and safety

To reduce our exposure to volatile oil prices and 

diversify our assets, we embarked into the healthcare 

space with postpartum care business in Malaysia 

and Singapore as the initial step. We see the 

healthcare sector as comparatively more stable and 

largely unaffected by cyclical business and market 

fluctuations. 

Covid-19 has presented challenges to our new 

business venture, namely in delaying the completion 

of our Singapore postpartum care centre, but we 

also see opportunities as the pandemic heightens 

awareness 

about 

the 

need 

for 

professional 

healthcare. Our Malaysia postpartum centre has 

already experienced an increase in enquiries and 

we have turned to using multiple digital means to 

communicate and reach out to clients even as key 

markets impose quarantine or lockdown measures 

to contain Covid-19’s spread.

Safety remains a pillar of our operations. As a 

provider of products and services for the oil and gas 

industry, operating safely without hurting people or 

the environment remains a paramount objective. To 

that end, we succeeded in achieving zero fatalities 

in FY2019, with zero Loss Time Incidents (“LTI”) 

and zero Medical Treatment Injuries (“MTI”) at our 

worksites.

We also continue to invest in progressive research and 

development in order to reduce our environmental 

impact and ensure resilient operations. The latest 

generation of our marine growth products are self-

cleaning and last longer. We also encourage clients 

to use our decommissioning service, so we can help 

them facilitate a cradle-to-cradle philosophy where 

our products, once decommissioned, are recycled.

Turbulent times call for forward-looking decisions 

that are informed and balanced by reliable data. By 

being as open as we can about what we do and why 

we do it, we aim to provide an accurate picture of 

how we fare and what we have done to be better. 

On behalf of the Board

Christopher Nghia Do

President and Chief Executive Officer

IEV Group Sustainability Report 2019

Established in 1986, IEV has evolved from a single 

product line company to become a multi-national 

group of companies that combines disruptive 

technologies and proven engineering capabilities 

in serving the oil and gas industry. In 2011, IEV 

was listed on the Catalist Board of SGX-ST and is 

currently headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Currently, IEV runs an asset integrity management 

business across Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, 

Indonesia, Vietnam, and India. This business covers 

the following divisions: Structural Integrity Solutions; 

Advanced Inspection Solutions; Corrosive Control 

Solutions; and Subsea Engineering Solutions.

The divisions offer both individual and integrated 

technologies and solutions to assess, inspect, 

repair, and maintain fixed assets of both onshore 

and offshore structures such as offshore oil and 

gas platforms, pipelines, jetties, refineries, and 

petrochemical plants. The types of technology 

offered are either proprietary, co-developed, or 

originated from providers who partner with IEV 

to launch their unique technology through IEV’s 

extensive global distribution network under long-

term strategic alliance arrangements.

IEV offers such technologies and solutions across 

upstream, midstream, and downstream markets. They 

complement IEV’s core engineering services such 

as pipeline stabilisation, cold cutting, structural pile 

grouting, jacket strengthening, and decommissioning 

studies. 

IEV is also involved in the brownfield market segment 

and has expanded its offerings to customers of 

existing offshore and onshore facilities that include 

oil and gas platforms, ports and terminals, pipelines, 

and plants. 

In Malaysia, IEV’s subsidiaries have been active in 

niche turnkey services, and together with its selected 

service providers, implement transportation and 

installation contracts of major deep water or float-

over facilities. 

In FY2019, low oil prices prompted IEV to 

discontinue, divest, and impair underperforming 

parts. The Group disposed of two non-core 

subsidiaries, IEV Engineering (India) Pvt Ltd in India 

and IEV Technologies Vietnam LLC in Vietnam, and 

voluntarily liquidated two dormant subsidiaries, PT 

IEV Pabuaran KSO in Indonesia and IEV Vietnam LLC 

in Vietnam. 

To reduce our exposure to the oil and gas industry, 

which has seen volatile prices and markets that are 

moving to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, IEV 

has diversified into the healthcare sector. In 2019, 

the Group acquired Lady Paradise (M) Sdn Bhd, a 

postpartum care centre in Malaysia, that has since 

been rebranded as Nadora.

Under Nadora, the Group will open two more 

postpartum care centres – a second centre in 

Malaysia and its first Singapore-based centre. The 

Group is also actively seeking out businesses in 

the arena of aesthetics, wellness, and physiology 

services.

OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Our Board of Directors is the highest governing body 

of IEV and is responsible for strategic direction and 

the long-term success of the Group. The Board is 

made up of Directors with a wide range of skills and 

qualifications in areas such as business management, 

finance, accounting, as well as specific experience in 

related/relevant industries.

In FY2019, the Board consisted of seven members, 

comprising of one Non-Independent, Non-Executive 

Chairman; one President and Chief Executive Officer; 

one Executive Director; and four Independent 

Directors.  

For FY2019, the Board has complied with the 

principles and guidelines of the Singapore Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018. As steward of IEV’s 

strategic direction, the Board has taken steps to 

integrate sustainability issues as part of its strategic 

formulation. Consistent with this role, the Board has 

determined the economic, environmental, social, 

and governance factors identified as material to 

the business and ensures they are monitored and 

managed. The Board is supported by a strategic 

team of senior managers, which enables the Board 

to assess and ensure that sustainability governance 

is structured and functioning through the various 

levels of management.

For more information on our corporate governance, 

please refer to our Annual Report 2019 (Report on 

Corporate Governance).

SUPPLY CHAIN



Our suppliers and partners are integral to our 

ability to run our business. They are involved in 

numerous aspects of our operations, from logistics 

to engineering and IT. As such, we aim to work with 

those that conduct themselves in an economically, 

environmentally, and socially-responsible manner.

In FY2019, IEV spent RM2.76 million on goods 

and services from 50 suppliers. Our approach is to 

source products/materials and services through a 

multi-layered procurement process that is vetted at 

various levels of IEV management. We review, among 

others, potential suppliers’ industry reputation, track 

record, work ethics and assess them for a fit with our 

own philosophy and strategy.

Throughout our engagement with suppliers, we 

assess and monitor their procedures, and if needed, 

ensure training is provided to meet our standards.

We source our suppliers mainly from the countries 

we operate in such as Malaysia and Singapore. We 

also source from countries where we previously had 

a presence and where we have maintained business 

relationships with local suppliers such as in India.

For non-proprietary products and services, such 

as diamond-wire cutting and microcrystalline wax-

based anti-corrosion tape, we source the equipment 

and materials from our Principals in the USA.  The 

nature of these Principal-owned technology does 

not allow us to source any comparable equipment or 

material locally. 

Equipment and tools for cutting services and anti-

corrosion waxtape application are stored in supply 

base locations in the Asia-Pacific region, in proximity 

to where clients may require such services.  Materials 

for these services are procured from the USA and 

shipped to these supply bases as and when projects 

are undertaken. 

When mobilised by the client, such equipment and 

materials are then moved to a port for embarkation 

on a vessel and transported to an offshore location 

where the service is rendered or materials applied. 

For 

our 

proprietary 

marine 

growth 

control 

technology, 

individual 

components 

are 

manufactured using custom moulds through a 

selected panel of injection-die manufacturers. These 

components are stored at IEV’s own manufacturing 

facility, where we prepare the marine growth 

control products according to client specifications. 

The semi-assembled pieces are then freighted to 

and assembled at the client’s destination location, 

be it at a fabrication yard, jetty, or on an offshore 

platform.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

The Group relies on a robust and rigorous process of stakeholder engagement to understand the expectations 

and needs of its stakeholders. We believe this process allows us to continuously learn about what we are doing 

right (and wrong), how we are impacting those we work with, and how and where we can improve. This, we 

believe, strengthens our accountability to, and builds trust with, our stakeholders.

Our stakeholder engagement process involves talking to and opening communication channels with various 

groups and individuals to understand specific concerns about our business and its impact, particularly in 

relation to the health and safety of our employees and our impact on the environment. These include, but 

are not limited to: internal stakeholders such as employees, managers, senior management, and Board of 

Directors; and external stakeholders such as suppliers, regulators, creditors, shareholders, and customers.

We gather opinions and advice in various ways including formal and informal meetings, surveys, site visits, and 

feedback channels. These opinions and advice are then incorporated into our corporate strategies to achieve 

mutually beneficial outcomes.

these factors as and when there is a change to our business 

model. If there is no change to our model, we will review these 

factors annually.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

• Direct economic value generated and distributed

IEV believes financial sustainability is critical to our 

survival and business progression. We aim to ensure 

long-term profitability by taking into account the 

interests of all stakeholders, such as employees, 

shareholders, suppliers, and society as a whole; 

minimise risk by identifying early opportunities and 

obstacles and putting in place clear measures that 

maximise opportunities and mitigate obstacles; and 

adhere to laws and regulations that protect and 

enhance employee welfare.

The Group’s operations continue to be impacted by 

fluctuating prices of oil and gas, and their derivative 

products. In a low oil and gas price environment, 

our clients would generate less revenue from their 

businesses, which could result in the businesses 

incurring losses or becoming less profitable. 

Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices, coupled 

with rising costs, over the last few years, have 

resulted and could continue to result in projects 

being delayed, cancelled, or divested.

Continuing weakness in oil and gas prices has led us 

to diversify into the healthcare sector. The Group 

acquired Lady Paradise (M) Sdn Bhd and subsequently 

rebranded it as Nadora to kickstart our foray into 

operating postpartum care centres. The Group has 

also disposed of two non-core subsidiaries, IEV 

Engineering (India) Pvt Ltd and IEV Technologies 

Vietnam LLC, and voluntarily liquidated two dormant 

subsidiaries, PT IEV Pabuaran KSO in Indonesia and 

IEV Vietnam LLC, to alleviate cash flow pressures.

For FY2019, the Group’s revenue from its asset 

integrity management sector increased by RM6.8 

million, or 230%, due mainly to increased sales of 

our proprietary marine growth control products, a 

completed Advanced Inspection Solution in Nigeria, 

and an on-going retrofitted corrosion control project.  

Revenue from our healthcare division has been 

marginal as the postpartum centres are currently 

undergoing planned refurbishment and renovation, 

and are expected to commence operations during 

the financial year that ends on 31 December 2020.

For FY2019, the Group’s gross profit increased 

by 169% to RM4.5 million from RM1.7 million in 

FY2018 due to increased sales of our marine growth 

control products and higher sales activity in our asset 

integrity management sector. We recorded a lower 

gross profit margin of 45.7% for FY2019 compared 

to 56.0% in FY2018 due mainly to our contract with 

the Advanced Inspection Solution project, which has 

a lower gross profit margin compared to the sales of 

our proprietary marine growth control products.

We view the outlook for the oil and gas industry 

in 2020 and beyond as uncertain. The Covid-19 

pandemic has weighed heavily on prices as countries 

impose travel bans and shut down workplaces. 

Given this uncertainty, the Group will continue to 

exercise stringent cost control of our core asset 

integrity management division, cease new capital 

investment to preserve cash, and monitor cash flow 

with extreme vigilance.

For a more detailed look at our financial results, 

please refer to the following sections in our Annual 

Report 2019:

ECONOMIC

• Financial implications and other risks and 

opportunities due to climate change

Rising climate change concerns have led and could 

lead to additional legal and/or regulatory measures 

for our clients in the oil and gas industry. This can 

result in project delays or cancellations, a decrease 

in demand for fossil fuels, potential litigation, and 

additional compliance obligations.

 

We have continuously been working on reducing 

our exposure to the oil and gas industry. In 2018, we 

exited oil exploration and production in Indonesia; 

mobile natural gas distribution in Indonesia, Malaysia, 

and Vietnam; and the renewable energy (rice husk-

based) sector in Vietnam. In 2019, we continued to 

divest parts of our business that had been negatively 

impacted by low oil and gas prices. We parted ways 

with four companies whose operations had been 

rendered dormant or unprofitable (see About IEV for 

the list of companies). 

In FY2019, the Group worked on diversifying 

our assets by entering the healthcare sector and 

planning for the opening of several postpartum care 

centres. We believe the healthcare sector to be a 

comparatively more stable market, and in light of 

the current Covid-19 pandemic, may present more 

opportunities as markets call for an increase in 

professional healthcare services. 

Physical effects of climate change such as, but 

not limited to, adverse weather patterns could 

negatively impact our operations. Currently, our 

work in asset integrity management can be subject 

to weather disruptions, which may delay the start 

and completion of work. We have put into place 

contingencies in our work schedule and budgeting 

that compensate for potential weather disruptions.

ECONOMIC

ANTI-CORRUPTION

• Operations assessed for risks related to corruption

The Group operates across different countries and 

engage numerous contractors, suppliers, agents, 

and other partners. This exposes us to numerous 

vulnerable points for corruption. Preventing and 

managing risks associated with corrupt practices is 

therefore a material factor.

As corruption is considered a major risk factor 

in the company’s overall risk assessment, the 

Group’s accounting and procurement practices are 

consistently scrutinised and audited by external and 

internal auditors to monitor and maintain corruption-

free practices. Each year, the auditors assess any 

gaps or lapses to evaluate if improper payments/

procedures have been made.

The Group also mitigates any potential risk of 

corruption that may arise from procurement 

processes by centralising its procurement at the 

Group’s headquarters. The Group’s centralised 

procurement process is validated by ISO 9001:2015 

standard. This requires the Group to set a limitation on 

what can be procured and any procurement in excess 

of set limits requires multiple levels of authorisation 

before the procurement can be approved.

We prevent and manage corruption risks with a 

zero-tolerance policy towards accepting any gifts or 

favours from individuals, organisation, vendors, or 

contractors doing or seeking to do business with the 

Group. Senior management has been tasked with 

ensuring the appropriate controls and monitoring 

systems have been put in place to prevent improper 

payments/bribery/corrupt practices. 

We also have in place a whistle-blowing policy 

that supports our anti-corruption commitment by 

enabling employees to, in confidence, raise concerns 

internally and disclose any impropriety through well-

defined and accessible channels. Should there be any 

reported impropriety, we have an audit committee 

that conducts independent investigations and enact 

appropriate follow-up actions where necessary.

• Communication and training about anti-corruption 

policies and procedures

Our policies are communicated to all employees, 

including our Board of Directors and senior 

management, in all countries we operate in and can 

be accessed easily via our company intranet. 

As part of our induction programme when any new 

personnel joins the organisation, we instil in them 

the Group’s anti-corruption policies and procedures 

including no-gifts and whistle-blowing.

We also notify our employees on changes to 

such policies via internal notices and emails. Our 

employees are also encouraged to consult or seek 

clarification from HR and Senior Management 

personnel who have been designated to manage 

whistle blowing channels.

The Group’s anti-corruption policies are described in 

our annual Sustainability Report, which the general 

public can access online. Our business partners and 

suppliers are encouraged to access the Report in 

order to understand our policies better and ensure 

they abide by them. We also expect our people 

to adhere to such policies when interacting with 

business partners and to clarify to the latter our 

policies should anything be unclear.

• Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions 

taken

We had zero incidents of corruption in FY2019. We 

aim to maintain zero incidents of corruption in the 

next financial year. No whistle blowing reports were 

made during FY2019.

ENVIRONMENTAL

WASTE

• Waste generation and significant waste-related 

impacts

The Group regularly assesses how materials move 

into, through, and out of our companies. We do this 

to understand where these materials eventually 

become waste. Such assessments provide an 

overview of waste generation and its causes, which 

in turn can support us in identifying how we can 

prevent waste and adopt circularity measures. We 

believe this will allow us to go beyond mitigating 

and remediating negative impacts once waste 

has been generated and move towards managing 

waste as a resource.

Previous generations of our marine growth 

control products tend to reach the end of their 

service life when their anti-fouling coating loses 

its efficacy, which is usually after five years. Our 

recommendation to clients is for these products to 

be removed and replaced by a new set of marine 

growth control products. As our products are 

made of high-density poly-ethylene, they can be 

recycled like any plastic material. 

We have since improved our latest generation 

of products by making them self-cleaning, which 

negates the requirement for an anti-fouling coating 

and therefore extends its service life beyond five 

years.  

In typhoon prone or icy ocean conditions, there is 

a risk that IEV’s marine growth control products 

installed on offshore structures may, after a 

prolonged period, break apart or detach from the 

structures and drift into the open sea.  Before the 

latest generation of products, we have avoided 

installing our products in locations prone to 

extreme weather conditions.

To reintroduce our products to locations with 

extreme weather conditions, our latest generation 

of marine growth control products have been 

developed to be stronger such that it can withstand 

extreme storm conditions.  

To support such efficacy claims, various tests have 

been conducted by an external agency, designed 

to see if our products can withstand typhoons and 

other severe ocean conditions.

The initial tests revealed that our Single Ring 

product can withstand winds and ocean conditions 

up to Beaufort force 10 without any damage, while 

our Multiple Ring can withstand up to Beaufort 

force 12 without any damage. The Beaufort 

scale measures wind speeds and relates them to 

observed conditions at sea or on land, with the 

maximum, force 12, denoting typhoon force winds 

and conditions.  

Further tests are being conducted to determine 

the products’ endurance in repeated height drops 

to simulate extreme wave conditions.

ENVIRONMENTAL



• Management of significant waste-related impacts

We aim to assist our clients in recovering infrastructure 

that has been decommissioned. This will allow us to 

better plan for the end-of-life of our products with 

our clients and moving forward, facilitate a cradle-

to-cradle philosophy where our products, once 

decommissioned, are recycled. However, in FY2019, 

none of our clients requested for their infrastructure 

to be decommissioned as their structures are still in 

prime working condition.

As 

for 

plastic 

waste 

produced 

during 

the 

manufacturing of our products, we abide by Malaysia’s 

Environment Quality Act of 1974, which requires 

us to recycle the waste at periodic schedules. We 

produced 300 kilograms of plastic waste in FY2019, 

which is half of what we produced in FY2018. 

We will store the plastic waste, which does not pose 

any environmental hazard in its current state, on our 

premises until enough is accumulated to make it cost 

effective for us to recycle. We will then contract a 

professional waste recovery and recycling company 

to treat and recycle our plastic waste using the latest 

technology. 

We 

maintain 

a 

centralised 

database, 

which 

incorporates online data entry, of the amount of 

waste we generate. While we do not include the 

waste generated by our clients as part of our waste 

database, we recommend clients engage us when 

removing or dismantling our products so we can 

assist in transporting, recovering, and disposing of 

such items. At the same time, this helps us remain 

accountable for the products we sell and aids the 

execution of our commitment to circularity.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

• Non-compliance with environmental laws and 

regulations

IEV believes in reducing our footprint and impact to 

as low as reasonably practicable. As such, we support 

the precautionary principle and aim to avoid negative 

impacts on the environment where feasible. To this 

end, we aim to ensure all risks generated from our 

operations are identified, assessed, and mitigated to 

a reasonably practicable level.

We have adhered to all relevant Codes and 

Regulations on the environment. In FY2019, there 

were no incidences of non-compliance with laws 

and regulations that resulted in significant fines or 

sanctions, and we aim to maintain this in the next 

financial year.

LABOUR AND MANAGEMENT RELATIONS

• Minimum notice periods regarding operational 

changes

The Group believes that promoting an environment 

of collaboration, understanding, and mutual trust 

among employees is important in preventing conflicts 

and deteriorating relations.

When a company has to undergo significant 

operational 

changes, 

timely 

and 

meaningful 

consultation allows affected parties to understand the 

impacts of the changes and trust that the company is 

not unilaterally making decisions against them. It also 

allows the company sufficient opportunity to work 

with affected parties to avoid or mitigate negative 

impacts as much as possible.

The Group believes that good consultation, whereby 

management takes the views of employees into 

account when making specific decisions, must take 

place before the implementation of significant 

operational changes. The Group also believes 

genuine consultation involves face-to-face dialogue 

and endeavours to provide employees with sufficient 

information in a timely manner.

 

FY2019 proved significant in how we managed 

our people’s expectations and needs as low oil 

prices forced us to discontinue or dispose of four 

underperforming subsidiaries. While the Group does 

not have a prescribed minimum notice period for 

informing staff of significant operational changes, 

management conducted town hall meetings with 

affected staff to discuss operational changes at least 

two weeks before they were to be implemented. 

Also, in FY2019, the Group sought to minimise the 

number of retrenched employees as a result of any 

discontinued operations. When the Group sold two 

non-core subsidiaries, IEV Engineering (India) Pvt Ltd 

in India and IEV Technologies Vietnam LLC in Vietnam, 

to Disruptech Holdings Sdn Bhd (“Disruptech”) in 

October 2019, all employees of the subsidiaries were 

retained by Disruptech.

With IEV Vietnam LLC, a subsidiary of the Group 

that was deregistered in October 2019, all staff of 

the subsidiary had already been transferred to IEV 

Technologies Vietnam LLC before the subsidiary was 

liquidated. The staff were then retained by Disruptech 

when it bought IEV Technologies Vietnam LLC.

The Group liquidated PT IEV Pabuaran KSO 

(“Pabuaran KSO”) in September 2019 and retrenched 

employees only after exhausting all other options. 

Prior to liquidation, Pabuaran KSO sought to get its 

exploration and production concession renewed but 

it was not successful. As a result, many roles within 

the company were made redundant. The company 

wanted to retain all staff with reduced pay but 

most chose to resign and look for work elsewhere. 

Following that, the Group opted for liquidation of 

Pabuaran KSO. Remaining Pabuaran KSO employees 

were retrenched and provided with all statutory 

retrenchment benefits.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

• Occupational health and safety management 

system

Providing engineering services to offshore and 

onshore oil facilities carries a certain degree of risk 

that requires the installation of carefully calibrated 

processes to minimise injury and danger. As such, 

occupational health and safety (“OHS”) is of great 

importance to IEV and we have put in place robust 

systems for engendering a safety culture that goes 

beyond compliance to one where our people feel 

listened to, cared for, and comfortable raising 

concerns.

As a basic requirement, we adhere to applicable 

health and safety laws in the countries where we 

operate. These laws include Malaysia’s Occupational 

Safety and Health Act 1994, Factory &amp; Machinery 

Act 1976, and Environmental Quality Act 1974. 

Malaysia is where the Group’s manufacturing facility 

is based. Other country offices manage sales and 

marketing operations and do not produce industrial 

waste but nevertheless abide by laws imposed by 

their respective governments.

We have also put in place an integrated health 

and safety culture that runs throughout all levels 

of our organisation. We believe putting in place 

proper training and effective communication and 

consultation can ensure all accidents and incidents 

are preventable. 

IEV’s OHS is managed by the Quality, Health, 

Safety, and Environment (“QHSE”) department. 

This department is led by a QHSE Manager, who is 

responsible for ensuring the management system is 

established, updated, and maintained according to 

local and international standards and requirements. 

This position is part of senior management, which 

reports directly to the President and CEO of the 

Group.

Also, IEV’s OHS management system is implemented 

in reference to ISO 45001:2018 standard. We strive 

to continually improve on the suitability, adequacy, 

and effectiveness of the OHS management system 

by ensuring that we have put in place numerous 

checks and communication channels for identifying 

and rectifying hazards and risks. These checks and 

communication channels will be elaborated upon 

further in the next sections.




IEV Group Sustainability Report 2019

SOCIAL

• Hazard identification, risk assessment, and 

incident investigation

Our dedicated QHSE department ensures health 

and safety practices are carried out across all our 

operations from corporate to manufacturing and 

engineering services. Before embarking on any 

engineering service work, our project management 

team will conduct a job safety induction. In addition, 

we conduct a job hazard analysis, which dissects 

the job procedure by procedure to identify existing 

as well as potential hazards, prioritise corrective 

actions, and reduce/eliminate the hazards.

Our whistle-blowing policy supports our health and 

safety commitment by enabling employees to, in 

confidence, raise concerns internally and disclose 

any impropriety through well-defined and accessible 

channels. Our people need not fear reprisal for 

reporting any shortfalls in our health and safety 

practices. 

Should employees view an activity to be a potential 

hazard, we have a “Stop Work” policy, which can be 

exercised by any employee, regardless of position, 

seniority, or discipline. We do not apportion blame 

or fault on any employee who calls for a “Stop Work” 

order even if, upon investigation, the “Stop Work” 

order was deemed unnecessary. Work that has 

ceased due to a “Stop Work” order resumes only 

after all safety checks have been conducted.

When investigating incidents, we have a reporting 

process that must be completed within 12 hours 

for incidents involving a fatality, within 24 hours 

for loss time incidents (“LTI”), and a maximum of 48 

hours for incidents involving medical treatment or 

the application of first aid. This involves filling up a 

“Work Incident Report” form and submitting the form 

to the immediate supervisor. Within the same time 

periods (12 hours for fatal incidents and 24 hours for 

LTI), supervisors must form a team to investigate the 

incident. For medical treatment incidents, supervisors 

must form an investigative team within 72 hours.

The team is responsible for analysing the incident, 

evaluating the risks, and preparing concluding 

remarks that will be presented to all staff to raise 

awareness and put in place prevention measures. 

This process should be completed within seven days 

for fatal incidents, within 10 days for LTI, and within 

14 days for medical treatment incidents.

We periodically conduct an internal review and 

reference against relevant clauses of the ISO 

45001:2018 requirements. The outcome of the 

review is analysed and presented at our management 

review meeting. Further action is then taken where 

warranted. This can involve, among others, changing 

policies and processes that do not work/have 

resulted in accidents and identifying new risks and 

opportunities.

In FY2019, an internal review found no negative 

outcomes and the Group continues to strive to meet 

ISO 45001:2018 standards. 

• 

Worker 

participation, 

consultation, 

and 

communication on occupational health and safety

The Group have in place a formal joint management-

worker 

health 

and 

safety 

committee. 

This 

committee comprises of representatives from senior 

management and the workers. This committee 

meets every quarter and reports to the committee’s 

chairman, who represents IEV’s senior management.

The committee is responsible for assisting in the 

development of health and safety rules and safe 

work systems; reviewing the effectiveness of health 

and safety programmes; carrying out studies on 

accident trends, near-misses, dangerous occurrences, 

occupational poisoning/disease; reporting on unsafe/

unhealthy practices and providing recommendations 

for corrective action; reviewing workplace health 

and safety policies; and making recommendations for 

revising any existing policy.

• Worker training on occupational health and safety

We view training as an essential part of our operations 

to ensure competency and avoid the risk of injury. In 

that regard, a job safety training is conducted before 

every engineering service work. We also arrange 

for staff to periodically get certified for a range of 

safety and technical skills via training courses, with 

recertification occurring every two to three years. 

We identify the training courses that staff need to 

complete by assessing the training needs of the 

various work activities that they undertake. A training 

matrix is then drawn up to identify the necessary 

skills needed to perform each job and any training 

gaps on the part of the employee. Staff then attend 

courses that have been matched to their needs/

abilities, and what they would be required to learn to 


IEV Group Sustainability Report 2019

SOCIAL

perform effectively at their job. Staff also attend 

courses to refresh or update their knowledge of 

occupational health and safety related to their job 

needs. 

Such training courses have included the following: 

Basic Offshore Safety Induction and Emergency 

Training; Travel Safely by Boat; Hydrogen Sulfide 

Training; Working at Height; and Permit to Work 

Procedures.

The training courses are conducted by certified 

third parties or accredited training centres, which 

have been approved by our clients. Also, the courses 

require participants to pass tests so that they can be 

properly certified to carry out their work. 

Every year, we conduct a Health &amp; Safety Awareness 

Day, where staff are educated on various health 

and safety topics. In FY2019, we conducted a Fire 

Safety Talk for our factory staff that was led by a 

representative from the local Fire Brigade. The Talk 

included a demonstration on how to properly use fire 

extinguishers.

It is mandatory for staff to attend training courses 

that have been assigned to them. The Group bears 

the cost of the courses and ensures that staff 

attends the courses during working hours. If the 

courses are conducted outside of the company’s 

workplace, the Group will pay for the staff’s travel 

and accommodation.

• Work-related injuries

Between January and December 2019, we recorded 

109,087 man-hours across our operations with zero 

Loss Time Incidents and zero Medical Treatment 

Injuries. In 2018, the Group recorded 110,536 man-

hours with zero Loss-Time Incidents and zero Medical 

Treatment Injuries. Moving forward, we aim to 

maintain zero Loss Time Incidents and zero Medical 

Treatment Injuries at our work sites.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

• Diversity of governance bodies and employees

IEV considers our employees our most valuable asset, 

and as such, endeavour to offer our people a fair 

and safe work environment. We do not discriminate 

against 

race, 

age, 

gender, 

religion, 

ethnicity, 

nationality, or physical abilities. This is codified in our 

employee handbook, which is disseminated to all our 

people when they start working with us. 

In addition, we have put in place a strict policy 

against sexual harassment in order to ensure a safe 

and conducive work environment. We define sexual 

harassment as conduct of a sexual nature which 

can take verbal (e.g. innuendoes, comments), non-

verbal (e.g. leering, obscene gesticulations), visual 

(e.g. posters, signs), physical (e.g. touching, coerced 

sexual act), and textual/electronic (e.g. e-mails, texts) 

forms. A thorough investigation is launched when 

a complaint is received and those found guilty will 

be meted punishments, ranging from a warning to 

dismissal.

In 

2019, 

we 

received 

zero 

complaints 

for 

discrimination and we aim to replicate this in future.

We aim to sustain a diverse workforce and an inclusive 

environment that respects and shows care for all our 

people, which in turn, we believe will improve our 

business performance. 

In FY2019, IEV employed a total of 51 permanent 

employees (including senior management and CEO). 

The employee gender breakdown was 37% female 

and 63% male. The breakdown for employees in 

terms of age was 14% were below 30 years old; 76% 

were 30-50 years old; and 10% were over 50 years 

old. 

Out of the 51 permanent employees, IEV’s senior 

management team comprised of 18 employees 

holding positions ranging from Assistant Manager to 

Chief Executive Officer. The gender breakdown of the 

senior management positions was 44% female and 

56% male. Out of a total of 18 senior management 

members, 5% of senior management were below 30 

years old; 67% were 30-50 years in age while 28% 

were over 50 years old. 

IEV’s Board of Directors for FY2019 comprised 29% 

female and 71% male. Two were 30-50 years old 

while 5 were over 50 years old.  

We have endeavoured to have an equal gender mix, 

where possible. However, in the engineering sector 

and the kinds of industries (such as oil and gas) that 

we target, we do receive more applications from 

males than females. This can account for the slightly 

lower overall percentage of female employees.
