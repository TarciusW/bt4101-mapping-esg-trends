SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016




At Wilmar International Limited, we care about sustainability and remain committed 

to nurturing a liveable future. As a key player in the global palm oil industry, we 

strive to achieve a strong triple bottom line within a social, environmental and 

financial accounting framework. Our business practices are aligned with universally 

acceptable standards, which guides us towards achieving profitability while 

safeguarding the environment and labour rights.

We care enough to lead by example. Wilmar was the first in the industry to launch 

our No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation (NDPE) Policy (“Policy”) in 

December 2013. This Policy extends beyond operations to encompass our entire 

supply chain, including third-party suppliers. Wilmar also invests substantial resources 

to address deforestation, improve labour practices and strengthen social issues 

across our supply chain.

Our continuous effort to uphold the highest standards and protocols include 

collaborations with subject matter experts to help us drive positive change across 

the industry. To this end, Wilmar has partnered with Verité Southeast Asia, an 

independent global advocate for workers which ensures that people worldwide 

work under safe, fair and legal working conditions. In all that we do, we do with 

heart. We believe in building a conducive and cohesive work environment for our 

people, thereby empowering them to deliver the best in all that they do.

The design for this Sustainability Report reinforces our commitment to our people. 

Be it staff in our corporate offices, workers in the oil palm fields or the children 

we support through community outreach programmes; we care about making a 

positive impact by making things right.

We are proud of the employees, their families and the local community members 

who are featured in all the images of people in this report.

Report

Scope and boundary

W

ilmar International Limited (‘Wilmar’ or ‘the Group’) has 

sought to apply the guidance of Global Reporting Index 

(GRI) Sustainability Standards on the boundary settings, focusing on 

performance data and reporting on aspects that are most significant, 

as reflected in our No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation 

(NDPE) Policy. We will report on the implementation progress against 

our policies with regards to crude palm oil (CPO) and lauric suppliers, 

as well as fresh fruit bunches (FFB) suppliers. While we now have 

better insights into the performance of our key suppliers, we have 

not included these in our metrics as such information is subject to 

confidentiality agreements.

The performance metrics detailed in this report are focused on 

Wilmar’s global palm oil operations in our upstream business. As such, 

we are primarily focused on the performance of our own plantations 

in Indonesia, Malaysia and Africa, as these are the most scrutinised 

among our activities and the key concern of our stakeholders. 

The performance data disclosed does not cover:

• 

Operations in which Wilmar has 50% ownership or less, or those 

in which the Group does not have management control.

• 

The Group’s other upstream and downstream activities outside of 

oil palm plantations and mills (in particular suppliers and refineries), 

including in Indonesia, Malaysia and Africa.

• 

Unplanted areas inside Group plantations for environmental figures, 

except for conservation areas and fire incidents.

Reporting period

This report covers performance data for the calendar year 2016, as well 

as 5-year historical figures where available. Due to the fast-moving nature 

of the issues described, we have also included some information on 

progress in 2017 and have focused on activities planned for 2017–18.

About 

This Report

Process for determining report content

S

ince our last Sustainability Report 2015, we have retained 

our focus on the key aspects covered in our NDPE Policy. 

Through our in-depth engagement in multi-stakeholder 

initiatives in the palm oil industry and the broader agricultural 

sector, we believe these aspects reflect the general landscape. 

While demands for sustainability performance are increasing, 

the focus is on ensuring robust implementation of specific 

Policy commitments (e.g. traceability and no deforestation), 

rather than the emergence of new focus areas. We have 

therefore chosen to retain our focus and seek to strengthen 

accountability in this report.

Identification and Prioritisation

We reviewed the major topics discussed in this report in various 

forums and engagements, and through email correspondence 

with stakeholders. We have also conducted interviews with 

stakeholders from the finance sector, the non-governmental 

organisations (NGO)/technical support sector, as well as from 

our third-party suppliers. 

In addition, we reviewed the aspects covered by other palm-

related initiatives, such as the High Carbon Stock (HCS) 

Approach Steering Group, the Zoological Society of London’s 

(ZSL) Sustainable Palm Oil Transparency Initiative (SPOTT), 

CDP (formerly known as Carbon Disclosure Project), Ceres 

Reporting Guidance for Responsible Palm and the Fair and 

Free Labour Principles for Palm Oil Production.

We undertook a thorough review of our materiality matrix based 

on these latest developments. While no major new themes 

have emerged, the relative impacts on Wilmar’s business and 

the interest of stakeholders have shifted somewhat over the 

past 18 months. Our 2016 materiality matrix has therefore 

been updated to reflect the volume of enquiries we receive 

on specific issues, as well as the commercial impacts related 

to these. For example, labour standards have become an 

increasingly significant topic, while fires and haze, for example, 

have been less prominent on stakeholders' agendas in 2016.

We have also made a minor change to the way we present 

our materiality matrix. We have eliminated ‘low’ priorities (e.g. 

philanthropy) and include only those topics that have some 

level of significance to both stakeholders and our business.

Validation and Review

We validate our material aspects and balance in reporting 

through three main processes: 

• 

Through the reporting process, continuously monitoring 

stakeholder concerns to ensure that these are covered 

by the report. 

• 

Through advice from our report consultant, Helikonia, 

based on their in-depth knowledge of the palm oil industry 

and stakeholders. 

• 

Through reviews and commentary from Neil Judd, the 

co-founder of Proforest, which is a leading technical 

support organisation in the sustainable palm oil space.

Assurance

We have engaged Ernst &amp; Young (EY) to perform assurance 

work on selected information disclosed in the report. The 

assurance provided by EY is for the use of the Management 

of Wilmar only. Any use or reliance by a third party on the said 

assurance is at the third party’s own risk. Please refer to the 

section “EY Assurance Statement” for details.

As sustainability reporting is an ongoing process, we chose to 

disclose and to discuss some of the most pertinent material 

issues for Wilmar and its stakeholders within the boundaries 

of the report. Due to the inherent limitations of the internal 

control structure, it is possible that errors or irregularities in 

the information presented in this report may occur and not 

be detected. We endeavour to increase our efforts on the 

reporting process and present information in as complete 

and accurate manner as possible.

We have decided to perform reviews on a limited scope of 

information disclosed in this Sustainability Report. Our aim 

is to extend the scope of the assurance work and opinion in 

future Sustainability Reports.

Chairman

and CEO’s 

Statement

I

t gives me great pleasure to introduce Wilmar's Sustainability 

Report 2016. In the following pages, we present an overview 

of our activities, performance and challenges. We also set 

out our sustainability priorities and objectives for the future.

This, our fifth sustainability report, marks a shift in the 

frequency and focus of our sustainability disclosures. From 

now on we will publish an annual sustainability report in line 

with the requirements of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) to 

ensure our stakeholders are up-to-date on our sustainability 

strategies. We find these requirements timely as they coincide 

with a louder call for transparency from stakeholders, as well 

as an unprecedented change of pace in the drive towards 

sustainability, both in our company and our industry as a whole. 

The palm oil industry has changed more in the past 36 months 

than it has in the last 15 years. Within a very short time, the 

majority of large palm oil and consumer sector companies have 

adopted No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation (NDPE) 

policies, and many have begun implementing these policies 

in their supply chains. Technology such as remote sensing 

is also increasing the speed and reach of implementation, 

enabling companies to monitor and take action in their supply 

chains in real time.

 

Yet, despite these positive changes, we are still witness to 

grave levels of deforestation and peatland destruction. And 

while support for sustainable palm oil is growing in many 

key markets, the uptake of unsustainable palm oil persists in 

many parts of the world. 

From the outset of our sustainability journey we have aimed to 

set the highest example and contribute solutions to some of 

the world's most complex environmental and social challenges. 

While our focus on our own performance has remained 

undiminished, we have always recognised the need for broad 

changes across our sector as a whole. Collective action within 

our industry and along our supply chains is critical for achieving 

this transformation, as are the support and partnerships we 

foster with governments, inter-governmental organisations 

and civil society.

The need for unity in the fight against deforestation has never 

been more urgent. I am consequently discouraged to observe 

that companies that are taking the lead, that are setting the 

bar high, and that are operating transparently and accountably, 

continue to bear the brunt of attacks from non-governmental 

organisations (NGOs). I believe this situation is unfair and 

unproductive. I also believe it discourages underperformers 

from stepping up their efforts for fear of making themselves 

a target.

Despite this situation, we continue to be an energetic player in 

multi-stakeholder partnerships that are catalysing transformation 

in the agri-business industry. We are a longstanding member of 

the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and were a first mover 

in subscribing to the United Nations (UN) Global Compact. In 

recent years, we have also joined the global Tropical Forest 

Alliance (TFA 2020), a public-private alliance with a mission 

to mobilise collective action by financial, government and 

industry players to secure deforestation-free supply chains by 

2020. Such collaborative multi-sector approaches enable us 

to leverage a wide range of expertise and local knowledge, 

expedite implementation processes, and offer assurance to 

civil society stakeholders.

In the past year, the greatest success delivered by such an 

approach has been the convergence of the High Carbon Stock 

(HCS) Approach methodology. The collaboration between 

palm oil companies, including Wilmar, and NGOs in agreeing 

a unified approach to implementing No Deforestation policies 

is a significant step towards enabling the palm oil industry 

to meet its commitments. It also demonstrates what can be 

achieved through constructive discussion and trust. It was a 

long road, but one illuminated by the expertise, insights and 

goodwill of a wide range of private sector and civil society 

partners globally.

At a more local level, I am encouraged by the formation of 

the Fire-Free Alliance, of which Wilmar is a founding member. 

The fire-free community programme, which seeks to educate, 

enable and empower villages against the use of fire, reached 

61 villages around Wilmar’s concessions in South Sumatra and

Central Kalimantan in 2016.  This has contributed to a 90% 

reduction in fires in our concessions. 

For many years, sustainable agriculture initiatives were seen 

as solely a matter for the private sector and civil society. 

However, as our experiences with both deforestation and 

land rights issues have demonstrated, we need the public 

sector to join us at the table. I am encouraged to observe that 

several sub-national governments have actively embraced No 

Deforestation commitments as an opportunity for increased 

investment and green growth. Starting with Sabah, Central 

Kalimantan and South Sumatra, more state governments 

are realising the potential for improved land-use planning 

and tenure clarification, as well as smallholder inclusion and 

production practices. The need for supportive provincial 

regulations to enforce sustainable production practices is 

also becoming more widely recognised.

One of our greatest challenges in 2016 was the increased 

focus on labour rights by NGOs and media outlets. While 

working conditions are an important aspect of our NDPE 

Policy, a series of reports pointed to gaps in our industry. 

While we acknowledge that shortcomings exist, including 

in our operations, we also recognise that labour rights in 

plantations are complex to monitor due to the size and 

remoteness of many workplaces, and in many jurisdictions 

there is limited oversight and enforcement of labour policies 

and regulations. As such, this is a challenge that also requires 

collective action from experts in the field, regulators, as well 

as our peers, to ensure that the bar is raised for all workers, 

and that industry-wide solutions are developed and shared.

Our imperative for the future is therefore to support and engage 

in collective action across the full spectrum of sustainability. 

Not one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals will be 

achieved by a single actor, be that a government, company 

or civil society. 

We are willing to step up and do our part, but overall success 

will depend on agreed visions of sustainability supported by 

public policies, progress on land tenure, and enforcement of 

progressive regulations at national and regional levels. The 

transformation towards sustainable palm oil supply chains 

will require collective action from businesses, civil society and 

governments. This is the only way to ensure that the industry 

can meet the growing demand for palm oil while contributing 

its share to national fiscal earnings and socioeconomic 

development in production landscapes.

Report Review

by Proforest

T

his 2016 Sustainability Report continues Wilmar’s strong 

track record of transparency, and of evident commitment 

to a range of sustainability objectives across its palm oil 

operations. Some of the specific achievements that are 

reported on include RSPO certification of over 80% of the 

company’s plantation area in Indonesia, Malaysia and Ghana; 

set-aside of 12% of plantation land as conservation areas; 

involvement in a range of biodiversity conservation projects; 

and the continued development of the Fire-Free Alliance 

(FFA) community programme.

Rather than follow the approach of last year’s external review, 

which attempted a wide-ranging evaluation of progress 

across the full range of topics, this review focuses on a smaller 

number of themes, where opportunities for improvement were 

identified last year. These key themes are: (1) the scope of the 

report, and the balance between Wilmar’s own operations 

and third parties; (2) the specific topics of labour and working 

conditions, and smallholders; and (3) overall strategy and 

measurement of progress. 

The Sustainability Report applies to the full scope of Wilmar’s 

palm oil operations and supply base. This includes the company’s 

own plantations, the company’s palm oil mills and their wider 

supply base, and third-party mills and their supply base. 

However, the emphasis is on Wilmar’s mills and plantations, 

and to a much lesser extent on third-party volumes. While it 

is understandable that there is a focus on the company’s own 

operations because of the high degree of control, given the 

proportion of Wilmar’s overall volumes that come from third- 

party suppliers it is very important to have a systematic review 

of both challenges and progress with these volumes and the 

implications for overall sustainability. This could be achieved 

by supplementing the materiality matrix to detail the relative 

levels of risk in the third-party supply base, together with the 

proportions of volumes being sourced through third parties, 

and then to set out the company’s strategy in relation to the 

levels of influence that it is feasible and reasonable for Wilmar 

to exert on these sources and timeframes for doing so. The 

report does refer to the Aggregator Refinery Transformation 

(ART) programme that applies to third-party mills, and to 

proactive independent monitoring of supplying companies 

and training activities for suppliers, which is useful, though 

in future more information on timelines, effectiveness and 

progress would add more depth.

Our review of Wilmar's 2015 performance noted a need for 

a more robust approach to labour-related commitments. 

Although Wilmar has not yet defined specific indicators of 

labour performance that it will be systematically reporting 

against, this report does provide considerable detail on 

labour issues, including Wilmar’s overall approach to date and 

detailed position on some issues. This is partly in response 

to specific grievances raised by stakeholders over the past 

year in relation to its operations in North Sumatra, but Wilmar 

also takes the opportunity to provide a wider context on 

performance in relation to topics such as wages, temporary 

workers, child labour, forced labour and safety. Although the 

reporting again relates only to Wilmar’s own operations, the 

level of detail across some of the key challenges and the clear 

commitment to address identified issues is extremely positive. 

There is a recognition that working conditions and potential 

abuses are a systemic issue across the sector, and that Wilmar 

needs to play a role in pre-competitive efforts to address this. 

The company is also to be commended for taking the initiative 

to instigate a multi-stakeholder process on labour rights and 

working conditions, collaborating initially with Business for 

Social Responsibility (BSR) and Golden Agri-Resources (GAR). 

The same review also highlighted the challenge represented by 

implementing policy commitments in the smallholder supply 

base. Indeed, Wilmar’s materiality matrix recognises smallholder 

inclusiveness as a significant issue in terms of importance to 

both Wilmar’s business and to external stakeholders. This is 

mentioned and recognised in the report, which cites various 

specific examples of direct technical support to independent 

smallholders. As these programmes develop, more information 

on the planned level and timelines of Wilmar’s proposed 

interventions to address independent smallholder livelihood 

and sustainability challenges, as well as progress being made, 

would be helpful.

The wider importance of multistakeholder collaboration, in 

order to address underlying social and environmental impacts 

and achieve genuine sector transformation, is recognised in 

the report. This is correct and welcome, although the level 

of Wilmar’s current and potential future contribution to the 

required efforts is not explored in detail. This applies to labour 

and smallholder initiatives as already noted, and also to other 

options for potential involvement such as landscape-level 

approaches to address deforestation and HCV protection.

Finally, there remains a need to provide a stronger strategic 

framework for the undoubted progress that Wilmar is making, 

and reporting on, annually. This would include a more 

comprehensive set of practical key performance indicators 

(KPIs), as the basis for ongoing monitoring and reporting. 

Stakeholders are looking for clear evidence that the various 

activities are effectively building compliance with policy 

commitments, and that this is reflected by delivery of the 

expected positive impacts on the ground. This was identified 

as desirable in last year’s review, and remains a key priority 

for action. This overarching observation does not reduce the 

significance of the many impressive achievements to date, 

but the recommended set of KPIs and roadmap would assist 

Wilmar in both prioritising actions and in demonstrating the 

progress of implementation.

High priority suppliers are mostly 

identified through a risk analysis 

process, known as the Mill Prioritisation 

Process (MPP), which combines spatial 

and non-spatial information relating to 

environmental and social components 

to identify potential risks within a 50 

km radius of a mill. Most of the mills 

assessed in 2016 are the remaining high 

priority suppliers identified in the MPP 

exercise, and this is reflected in the 

reduced number of mill assessments 

for the year. From 2017 onwards, the 

scope of assessments will be broadened 

to include medium to lower priority 

suppliers.

To assess annually at least 32 mills and

Our Approach

to Sustainability

O

ur No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) Policy (“Policy”) sets 

the overall direction in our journey towards sustainability. It guides our efforts 

to mitigate deforestation, peat development and exploitation, both in our own 

operations and in our supply chain.

We seek to address our impact and compliance with our NDPE Policy at multiple 

levels. For Wilmar’s operations and our scheme smallholders, we pursue continuous 

improvements by strengthening standard operating procedures and participating in 

relevant certification schemes. In our wider supply chain, we use our refineries as a 

central point for engaging, assessing and improving supplier performance through 

our Aggregator Refinery Transformation (ART) programme, as well as through direct 

technical support for independent smallholders. 

The aim of our NDPE Policy has always been to achieve genuine transformation in 

the palm oil industry towards the mitigation of deforestation, peat development and 

exploitation. These challenges are bigger than the palm oil industry and need to be 

addressed holistically through the collaborative effort of governments, civil society 

organisations, smallholders, suppliers and industry players. We therefore invest 

significant resources to support multi-stakeholder partnerships and jurisdictional 

and landscape approaches as part of our sustainability strategies.

Wilmar supports the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) 

certification. The Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture has 

implemented ISPO certification to improve the competitiveness 

of Indonesian palm oil in world markets, as well as to help 

meet Indonesia’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas 

(GHG) emissions and increase focus on environmental issues. 

As at 31 December 2016, six mills and their supply bases 

have been certified against ISPO standards.

We also started the Malaysian Palm Oil (MSPO) certification 

programme in our operations in East Malaysia in 2016, 

and have achieved certification for two mills and their 

supply base, one in Sabah and the other in Sarawak, at 

end of the year.

e recognise that a large part of our footprint lies beyond 

our own operations. Our suppliers therefore have a 

critical role to play in forging the path towards sustainable 

palm oil production. 

Since 2014, we have been putting in place a series of measures 

to ensure that all palm oil physically handled by Wilmar is 

traceable to the mill where it is processed.  In 2016, traceability 

analyses and summary data continued to be collected across 

Wilmar’s global operations (see below bar chart).

As at 31 December 2016, we achieved about 95% traceability 

to mills for our operations in Indonesia and Malaysia.

Where any part of this information is incomplete, volumes 

from that particular supplier will be treated as “untraceable”. 

“Untraceable” does not mean that we do not know who we 

procure from but that it does not fully meet the above criteria.

The traceability performance of our refineries is calculated 

in percentages of the total volume received by the refinery. 

Refineries can receive supplies from individual mills, refinery 

transfers, traders, or bulking terminals.

Defining and Calculating Traceability: 

Wilmar’s Approach

For a mill to be considered traceable, Wilmar requires the following information:

Tracking traceability through a volumetric approach means 

that we can more accurately track the physical flows of our 

oil, and supports a traceable physical supply chain. While we 

strive to increase traceability from one period to the next, it 

should be noted that the traceability values may also decrease. 

Such trends occur predominantly because supplies available 

from different sources may vary from one period to another.

W

e have focused our attention on traceability to 

mill, because the mill is a good indicator of the 

approximate location of its suppliers. 

The palm oil supply chain is multi-tiered. A typical palm oil 

mill could be supplied by hundreds of growers, and also 

by dealers that may source from many more growers. In 

turn, a refinery may likely be supplied by thousands of FFB 

suppliers, as it sources from multiple mills. For mills that do 

not have their own integrated plantations, which is typical in 

Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, a mill’s FFB supplier base 

changes constantly, as farmers move from mill to mill on the 

basis of best price.  This revolving supply situation is further 

intensified where there is an increase of milling capacity in 

a given area (e.g. with the addition of new palm oil mills, or 

the upgrading of existing mills), resulting in a sudden boost 

in demand for FFB.

Obtaining traceability information to farm or plantation 

level can therefore be highly resource intensive in terms of 

man-hours and cost. Traceability information, by itself, does 

not address environmental and social issues. Moreover, the 

definition of 'traceable to plantation', or 'fresh fruit bunch 

(FFB) traceability', is also a subject of considerable debate. 

We believe resources are more effectively utilised in supporting 

the transformation of mills and their supply bases towards 

responsible practices, such as through the Aggregator Refinery 

Transformation (ART) programme. This is mainly because 

the issues linked to sustainability (or NDPE compliance) will 

be similar within a mill’s supply base (i.e. within a radius of 

approximately 50 km). It therefore serves no real purpose to 

identify the specific source of FFB at this level, as issues within 

the radius will be mapped as part of the mill assessments, 

such as extensive peat areas, proximity to national parks and 

populations of endangered species. As Wilmar's intent is to 

transform as much of the supply base as possible, it makes 

more sense to invest resources in efforts to raise the floor 

for sustainability and good practice for all suppliers and 

estates within a mill's supply base. Traceability to plantation 

primarily serves the purpose of delivering 100% segregated 

sustainable supply – which can mean the exclusion of the 

most vulnerable producers, such as smallholders. 

However, we have prepared maps of all our own mills in 

Malaysia and Indonesia, showing all estate boundaries and 

the location of each smallholder and dealer. We are pursuing 

options to help third-party suppliers do likewise.

For more detail on Wilmar’s traceability efforts and progress, 

please visit www.wilmar-international.com/sustainability/

progress/traceability/

Wilmar's Position on Traceability to Plantation

Starting in 2011 and continuing through 2015, we have focused our efforts to trace supplies 

of FFB to our own mills in Malaysia and Indonesia.

This mapping exercise was led by an in-house team of full-time, dedicated and experienced 

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) practitioners, supported by regional FFB procurement 

teams and the involvement of individual mill operations. The entire process was relatively 

extensive in terms of cost, time, requiring a skilled workforce specialised in cartography and 

the use of high precision equipment and software.    

In addition to Wilmar's own mills, over 800 mills also directly supply to Wilmar's refineries 

in Indonesia and Malaysia. Having completed the mapping process for our own mills, we 

recognise that replicating and enforcing this mapping process for all our third-party suppliers 

is a big challenge. We also recognise that mapping our supply chain on this scale will require 

the development of a robust information-gathering system which must be easily replicated 

and implemented, and which must also be both efficient and cost-effective.

Wilmar International Limited

We Care

33


We will continue to work with our third-party suppliers as well as independent smallholders to 

develop and build an operative model. We strongly advocate the importance of encouraging 

transformation throughout the industry, and while traceability is a component of this, it is not 

an end in itself.  

Traceability to plantation will only add value in a true sense when larger issues faced by the 

industry are addressed – people and environment. We therefore continue to focus our efforts 

on driving real change on the ground through a dynamic capacity-building programme known 

as the Aggregator Refinery Transformation (ART) model, which has been co-developed with 

The Forest Trust, and which we are currently implementing across six landscapes. 

The ART model offers a holistic approach for bringing our suppliers along with us on the 

sustainability journey. It is a platform for providing active support and training and enables 

the sharing of best management practices. This empowers suppliers (mills and their supply 

bases) to identify specific and systemic issues that exists within their operating environments, 

provides solutions and tools to aid the adoption of good practices, and allows for monitoring. 

Wilmar believes the ART programme will yield longer-term benefits by bringing suppliers and 

customers together to accelerate real transformation, and by shaping a traceable, resilient 

and sustainable supply chain. 

More information on ART can be found on page 38-39.

Creating Partnerships Globally

W

e recognise that many of the sustainability challenges 

confronting the world today are too big for any one 

company, or any one industry, to tackle alone. Over the last 

decade, Wilmar has intensified its involvement in the global 

food production sector to engage with players throughout 

the supply chain, especially in the creation of partnerships 

that include not only the private sector and civil society, but 

also governments and inter-governmental organisations.

Engagement

and Empowerment

We continue to play an active role in certification and assessment 

organisations, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 

(RSPO) and the High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach Steering 

Group, where we are involved in numerous working groups 

and governance bodies. 

We also actively participate in a variety of multi-stakeholder 

platforms that seek to support the production of sustainable 

commodities and eliminate deforestation from commodity 

supply chains.

W

hile such engagements are helpful in driving change, 

we are also conscious that capacity building and 

engagement on the ground is critical to achieving our 

sustainability mission and ensuring that programmes are 

effective and realistic. We are therefore involved in more 

practical programmes to engage communities in issues that 

are locally specific. 

Most of this work is done through our day-to-day operations, 

including our community and smallholder projects. These 

are covered in relevant sections of this report. However, we 

are supporting communities throughout our supply chains 

as well. In Latin America, for example, we have launched the 

Wilmar Smallholders Support in Honduras (WISHH) initiative 

(see page 61 for more information), while in Africa we have 

initiated a community outreach programme in Cross River 

State, Nigeria (see page 60 for more information).

Transparency 

We have maintained an online sustainability dashboard 

on our company website since 2015. To ensure we are 

responsive to stakeholder concerns, the dashboard carries 

updates on grievances, traceability and certification, as well 

as policies and statements on issues raised by stakeholders 

or in the media. The dashboard can be accessed at  

www.wilmar-international.com/sustainability/.

We produce a quarterly sustainability update highlighting 

our most important initiatives, and submit an Annual 

Communication of Progress (ACOP) to the RSPO. We also 

provide disclosures in support of various benchmarking and 

ranking initiatives, including the Forest, Climate Change, 

Water and Supply Chain programmes by CDP (formerly the 

Carbon Disclosure Project).

Our efforts to increase transparency and accountability have 

been recognised, in particular by the Zoological Society of 

London's (ZSL) Sustainable Palm Oil Transparency Initiative 

(SPOTT), where our Group's score has improved from 57% 

in 2014 to 77.5% in the 2017 update. SPOTT ranks palm 

oil companies based on a number of indicators relating to 

Policy scope, certification progress, improvement targets 

and transparency.

For broader audiences, such as our financial stakeholders, we 

produce annual reports, quarterly updates, and, until FY2015, 

a biennial sustainability report. Based on feedback from our 

stakeholders, as well as new stock exchange regulations, we 

have adjusted our reporting timeline, and will from now on 

produce a sustainability report annually.

Progress on Aggregator Refinery 

Transformation (ART) 

ART was co-conceived with TFT in 2014 as a landscape 

approach to ensuring Policy compliance from our more 

than 1,000 CPO and lauric suppliers, as well as their FFB 

sources. Through ART, our refineries provide a central point 

for growers and millers to progress on HCV, HCS and peat 

protection, environmental impact management, labour 

standards, FPIC, and traceability.

ART is implemented in strategic areas in Malaysia, Indonesia, 

Latin America and West Africa. At year-end 2016, we have 

conducted 64 assessments in these areas.

These assessments are compiled into anonymised overarching 

reports by landscape, and each report summarises representative 

issues that may be prevalent in that landscape. Through 

Broad-Level Engagement (BLE) workshops, we socialise 

the common issues to all suppliers operating in that region 

and share learnings and recommendations on improvement. 

Topics include findings from mill assessments, guidance on 

land-use planning, and respecting the rights of workers and 

indigenous and local communities.

Following up from the assessments, we engage with suppliers 

on details of mill assessment findings and the development of 

action plans. We have also conducted return visit programmes 

with some of our suppliers who participated in the 2015 

ART field assessment. The objective of the return visits is to 

assess suppliers' progress and provide further guidance on 

closing identified gaps.

In addition to mill and grower assessments, we have also 

started a series of one-day, region-specific training sessions 

open to all our suppliers, as well as to their FFB suppliers. 

Training sessions are issue-specific and include conservation, 

labour rights, environmental impact management and health 

and safety. Sessions also provide space for the discussion of 

issues and examples of best practice, and serve as a forum 

for dialogues with government representatives, such as 

those from the labour and environment departments. Two 

training sessions were conducted in Malaysia in 2016 that 

were attended by 50 participants from 30 supplier mills. We 

will conduct similar sessions in Indonesia in 2017.

Sustainability Governance 

and Ethics

W

e have in place a Code of Conduct that prohibits 

the giving and receiving of any type of bribe. These 

include gifts, entertainment or other benefits that may affect 

our employees’ ability to carry out their duties legally and/

or in line with company interests. Any benefits or gifts must 

be declared to a reporting superior. The Code of Conduct 

is codified in our employee handbook.

Our Whistleblowing policy sets out guarantees for confidentiality 

and freedom from reprisals. It also identifies several contact 

points for reporting fraud, corruption and non-compliance 

with legal requirements and company policies. 

The policy ensures that a process is in place for independent 

investigations of alleged improprieties and for appropriate 

follow-up actions, including providing assurance that the 

complainant will be protected from reprisals for whistleblowing 

in good faith and without malice. The policy highlights that 

any employee who raises a genuine concern and makes a 

disclosure in good faith will not be at risk of losing his or her 

job, nor suffer adverse treatment or harassment for doing so. 

We strictly adhere to the spirit of this policy, and do not 

penalise employees for raising concerns to ensure that Wilmar’s 

business conduct meets its policies on compliance, including 

when they choose to raise the issues through third parties.

The implementation of the policy has been communicated 

to employees of the Group and the policy is posted on the 

Group’s website. The policy is also socialised to employees 

at staff training sessions, as part of the Group’s efforts to 

promote awareness of fraud control.

Protecting Our 

Environment

No Deforestation

A 

major focus for our business over the last three years has been to ensure that 

neither our own operations, nor those in our supply chain, are contributing to 

deforestation. Our NDPE Policy commits us to the use of the High Carbon Stock 

(HCS) Approach and the High Conservation Value (HCV) framework as primary tools 

to identify areas suitable or unsuitable for planting. We have previously appointed 

RSPO-approved assessors to identify HCV areas. Since 2015, with the launch of the 

HCV Assessor Licencing Scheme, we have only appointed licensed HCV assessors 

to undertake our assessments. 

Through the HCS and HCV assessments, Wilmar has identified around 30,000 hectares 

in Indonesia, Malaysia and Africa to be set aside and managed for value conservation.

T

he HCS Approach was launched in 2013 to categorise 

forests and define a better landscape-level methodology 

for preventing deforestation. In 2014, a broad group of 

stakeholders established the HCS Approach Steering Group 

(HCSA SG) to strengthen and evolve the methodology, as well 

as to provide a governance body for its use. In parallel, the 

Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto (SPOM), a group consisting of 

major palm oil growers and scientists undertook to develop an 

alternative approach focused on addressing socio-economic 

concerns related to forest set-asides, and on determining a 

carbon neutral approach towards development. Wilmar took 

an active role in both groups to ensure that the significant 

progress made by each could be harnessed. It was therefore 

a major achievement when, in November 2016, the two 

initiatives announced that they had reached a convergence 

agreement through which all actors can now look to a single 

definition and methodology to reduce deforestation. 

We are committed to applying this methodology to all new 

developments, including extensions of existing plantations. 

We have to date undertaken one such HCS process in our 

Nigerian operations. The assessment was completed in 2015, 

and in 2016 we were among the first oil palm companies to 

submit an assessment to the HCS Approach Peer Review 

Process. The full peer review is available here. 

Conservation and wildlife

Our NDPE Policy places special emphasis on the protection 

of endangered species and wildlife conservation. We do not 

operate in internationally or nationally designated protected 

areas, and we have established management plans for 

reducing illegal activities, including poaching, encroachment 

and logging, in our conservation areas. 



A group of regional conservation specialists monitor and 

manage our conservation areas overseen by a global Forest 

Sustainability Manager. Specialists in Sabah, Sarawak, Indonesia 

and Africa work in partnership with estate and plantation 

management to ensure that Conservation Management 

Plans are implemented throughout our operations and 

that conservation areas are monitored and protected. We 

partner with local research bodies to continually improve our 

management plans, and employ a combination of manual 

monitoring (such as our ranger programme – see page 44 

for more information), as well as smart satellite and Global 

Positioning System (GPS)-based monitoring tools. We also 

train estate workers to identify and report encroachment 

and other threats to protected areas.

Partners

Initiative

Provincial Government of Central Kalimantan and 

Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation (BOSF)

An ongoing collaboration to safeguard almost 4,000 ha of High Conservation Value (HCV) 

areas in our PT Mentaya Sawit Mas (MSM) estate in Central Kalimantan. 

The partnership was initiated in 2011 to ensure that orangutan populations identified in Wilmar’s 

concession could continue to thrive.

In May 2016, the partnership commissioned an external evaluation to review the progress and 

outcomes of the conservation programme against its initial objectives set five years previously. 

Three independent conservation experts conducted the evaluation, all of whom have more than 

25 years of experience in conservation and orangutan-related work in the palm oil industry. 

Key findings from the external evaluation include: (i) that the tripartite partnership has succeeded 

in increasing community awareness and understanding on the importance of orangutans and 

conservation; (ii) that there is a need for greater coordination among all partners in order to resolve 

outstanding issues with local communities; and (iii) that there is potential for the programme 

to contribute significantly to the conservation of orangutan populations in Central Kalimantan, 

as the HCV area in PT MSM remains connected to a larger forest landscape extending beyond 

the concession's borders.

South East Asia Rainforest Research Partnership 

(SEARRP)

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) to advance the knowledge and application of 

sustainable plantation practices in Malaysia, Indonesia and the wider tropics through a 

five-year research and training programme.

Both parties commit to support and facilitate research by academics from leading universities, 

including the UK universities of York, Oxford, Cambridge, Leeds, Nottingham and Aberdeen, and 

Universiti Malaysia Sabah, with a strong focus on biodiversity conservation and the management 

of conservation areas within oil palm plantation landscapes.

Wilmar and SEARRP will also work together to develop simplified methods for environmental 

assessment and monitoring. By deepening the partnership between a leading palm oil processor 

and one of the foremost research programmes in the tropics, Wilmar and SEARRP aim to make 

a major contribution to science which is critical to underpinning conservation, sustainability and 

environmental best practices for the palm oil industry.

Kalaweit Foundation 

An NGO collaboration on gibbon rehabilitation 

We have extended our gibbon programme with the Kalaweit Foundation through a rehabilitation 

programme for rescued siamangs to be returned to the wild. The programme is now set to continue 

for an additional five years, ensuring that we can monitor and sustain the achievements so far. 

University Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS), University 

Andalas, South East Asia Rainforest Research 

Partnership (SEARRP), Zoological Society of 

London (ZSL) and Borneo Orangutan Survival 

Foundation (BOSF)

Bringing together technical experts working in our plantation areas to exchange knowledge 

and findings, and to improve the management of our HCV areas. 

We organised a workshop with our research partners in Sampit, Central Kalimantan. The 

workshop was attended by most of our research partners from University Malaysia Sarawak, 

University Andalas, SEARRP, Zoological Society of London and Borneo Orangutan Survival 

Foundation. The discussions covered findings from the research undertaken by the agencies in 

Wilmar’s conservation areas in Sumatra, Central Kalimantan, Sabah and Sarawak, as well as the 

potential for new collaborations. 

The participants from this workshop identified three areas of future work: (i) continued floral and 

faunal surveys, (ii) knowledge on ecosystem restoration, and (iii) economic and social research 

into alternative incomes for communities.

The workshop also boosted the capacity of our internal HCV and managerial teams by exploring 

the latest research findings on HCV management.

Wilmar supports a wide range of initiatives set up to protect iconic wildlife species, 

both in our set-aside areas as well as in areas adjoining our plantations.

Unsung Heroes of the Forest 

We often read in the media about brave 

police officers arresting dangerous criminals, 

saving victims from harm and ensuring law 

and order in society; or about iconic wildlife 

facing threats of extinction due to rampant 

illegal hunting activities. And yet, little is 

mentioned or reported about the valiant forest 

rangers and game wardens working beyond 

the boundaries of concrete jungles on the 

frontline of the war with poachers. These are 

the unsung heroes from the forest, and John 

Anak Alit is one of them. 

John Anak Alit is our High Conservation Value 

(HCV) Assistant Manager. Originally from 

Sarawak, East Malaysia, he has been working 

with PPB Oil Palms Bhd (PPBOP), a subsidiary 

of Wilmar International Limited, since 2011. 

Based in Saremas Plantation in Sarawak, 

he became an Honorary Wild Life Ranger, 

a voluntary vocation, in 2015. In November 

2016 he was presented with the "Outstanding 

Honorary Wild Life Ranger" award by the Chief 

Minister of Sarawak. 

In states like Sabah and Sarawak, where poaching 

and illegal logging activities do happen and 

government resources are limited, ranger 

volunteers like John Alit and other Wilmar 

employees can help to keep illegal activities at 

bay. Despite knowing that the work of a wildlife 

ranger can be dangerous at times, John sees 

it as an honour to serve his beloved Sarawak 

State by helping to protect its forest reseources. 



To qualify as Honorary Wild Life Rangers, John 

and his colleagues underwent a three-day training 

course led by the Sarawak Forest Corporation. 

They were trained on the relevant skills and 

knowledge, including the relevant State laws, 

law enforcement tactics, surveillance methods 

and procedures for reporting to the authorities. 

A background check was also conducted by the 

Malaysian Police Department in Kuala Lumpur 

to ensure that they would not have any criminal 

records prior to being appointed as Honorary 

Wild Life Rangers. 

According to John Alit, all this effort and work 

is worthwhile. “Since the establishment of 

PPBOP’s Honorary Wild Life Ranger Programme 

in Sarawak in March 2015, we have observed 

a reduction in encounters with poachers and 

people with guns moving into our plantation 

area,” he reports. Asked whether he is concerned 

about safety when confronted with armed 

suspects John said, “At times we encounter 

suspicious characters or poachers during our 

patrolling or road-block duty, who can be quite 

aggressive, but we are adequately trained to 

handle such situations.”  

Wilmar is the first plantation company in 

Sarawak to have an Honorary Wild Life Ranger 

Programme, and we currently have 40 Honorary 

Wild Life Ranger appointed. As part of this 

programme, PPBOP has also conducted a series 

of awareness sessions on wildlife with local 

indigenous communities in or near conservation 

areas. Six headmen have also been enlisted as 

Honorary Wild Life Ranger in the programme.

We have a similar programme in Sabah, which 

has 15 Honorary Wildlife Wardens to help 

protect iconic species such as orangutans and 

Sumatran rhinoceroses. Given our success 

and track record in the neighbouring state, 

we are confident these initiatives will help us 

to maintain the integrity of the conservation 

area and contribute meaningfully to Sabah’s 

and Sarawak’s conservation initiatives.

Promoting 

Zero-Burn Practices

W

etter weather conditions in 2016 led to fewer fires, and 

consequently less haze in the Southeast Asian region 

(particularly in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia) than in 

previous years. We have continually enforced our zero burn 

policy over the past decade, and we continue to monitor and 

control any outbreak of fires within the immediate vicinity 

of our operations.

In 2016, Wilmar expanded its fire prevention efforts through 

the Fire-Free Alliance (FFA), which was launched in February 

2016. Central to the FFA is the Fire-Free Village Programme 

(FFVP), a community-based incentives scheme to help reduce 

the incidents of fires. The founding members are APRIL, Asian 

Agri, IDH, Musim Mas, PM.Haze and Wilmar. Sime Darby 

and IOI Group officially joined as members in March 2017. 

The FFA provides a tool to identify the risk of fires in plantation 

boundaries. Our adoption of the FFA approach also included 

the extension of fire monitoring to areas 5 km outside our 

plantation boundaries. Since February 2016, Wilmar has 

socialised the FFVP to 61 villages in South Sumatra and Central 

Kalimantan. Some 1.39 ha of planted area and 82.88 ha of 

unplanted area were burnt in 2016, representing an overall 

improvement of approximately 90% on previous years. Our 

2017 goal is to halve the 2011–2015 mean average incidents 

of fires in our Indonesian plantations and reduce the number 

of fires occurring in the extended buffer zones.

According to the FFA Members Review 2016 report released 

in March 2017, the FFA has rapidly expanded fire prevention 

outreach to 218 villages in various parts of Indonesia. Of 

these, 77 villages signed up with FFA members for training 

programmes in 2016. This is a 756% increase in the number of 

participating villages since the FFVP was launched in mid-2015.

Reducing Our Greenhouse 

Gas Emissions

R

educing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remains a 

top priority within our NDPE Policy, and we are committed 

to avoiding emissions to the best extent possible. 

In 2016, using both the latest RSPO PalmGHG calculator and 

the GHG Protocol accounting standard, we continued our 

emissions mapping exercise with expansion of the reporting 

scope. The data collected helps us monitor our emissions 

footprint and design measures to reduce emissions. 

RSPO PalmGHG Calculator

We follow the RSPO PalmGHG calculator to measure the 

GHG emissions of our RSPO-certified palm oil mills annually, 

as required by the RSPO standards.  We tested the RSPO 

PalmGHG version 1 calculator in 2013, and used the PalmGHG 

version 2.1.1 to calculate emissions for 2014 and 2015. 

For 2016, we have used the latest version, PalmGHG 3.0.1. 

There were substantial variations from version 1 to version 

2, and further changes have been made for version 3 (major 

changes have been summarised in the RSPO PalmGHG 

website). Historical data can therefore not be used as a 

definitive indicator of reductions and/or increases in carbon 

dioxide emissions year-on-year.

Methane recovery to mitigate GHG Emissions

M

ethane from palm oil mill effluent (POME) is our biggest 

source of avoidable GHG emissions, and has been a 

major strategic focus for our emissions reduction efforts. 

Over the past year, we have made tremendous headway in 

our efforts to reduce POME emissions. As at end 2016, we 

have 17 operational methane capture plants, which capture 

biogas for either flaring or electricity generation, and eight 

more are in various phases of construction. These facilities 

provide alternative sources of electricity for our operations 

and help to reduce our overall fossil fuel consumption. 

Through this initiative, we estimate that we can achieve 

an annual emission reduction (from methane gas capture 

only, excluding the emissions avoided by not using fossil 

fuels for electricity generation) of about 500,000 tonnes of 

carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) when all 25 sites are in 

full operation.

Planted and Conserved Peat

Note 1: No peat areas are found in Ghana and Nigeria.

Note 2: The classification of soils has evolved steadily over the past years, as research bodies and government agencies have improved the available methodologies. 

This has resulted in changes to the soil maps we use to calculate our total peat area – as we seek to follow best available science – and consequently 

incremental increases in planted areas classified as peat. We have not developed new areas containing peat since we adpoted the No Peat policy in 2012.

To avoid misunderstandings, we have decided not to report peat figures from previous years, as they are not comparable. Previously reported figures can 

be found in our 2015 Sustainability Report.

Avoiding Peat

Peat oxidation results in significant carbon emissions due to 

the peat soil being mostly organic. Although peatland makes 

up a small portion of our planted area, it still accounts for 

26% of our total gross emissions.

In 2012, Wilmar was among the first companies in the palm 

oil sector to ban new plantings on peat, regardless of depth. 

Our 2013 NDPE Policy expanded this commitment to cover 

all our suppliers. 

Around 8% of our planted area is currently on peat, with the 

vast majority in our older estates in Sumatra. In these areas, 

we apply best management practices, such as maintaining 

appropriate water tables and other practices recommended 

by technical experts and working groups in the RSPO. We 

are also sharing best practices with third-party suppliers to 

ensure that they have access to the latest knowledge and 

insights on responsible peat management. As crops planted 

on peat meet the end of their current rotation, we will explore 

options for the long-term restoration of peatland and peat 

forest where feasible.

Safeguarding

Water Quality

W

e recognise that clean, accessible water is critical for 

the wellbeing of communities, wildlife and aquatic 

ecosystems. We continuously monitor our impact on local 

waterways to ensure that we do not affect water availability 

or quality, and we are seeking to minimise the use of potable 

water in all our operations.

Wastewater from FFB processing at mills – POME – is disposed 

of either through land application as a fertiliser, or by release 

into local rivers. In the former way, the wastewater provides 

moisture, nutrients and organic matter which helps to reduce 

the need for commercial fertiliser. In the latter way, wastewater 

is treated before discharge. 

In both cases, we comply with local environmental limits* 

to minimise the risk of both disturbance to the aquatic 

environment and pollution of ground water. All our operations 

were in compliance with all relevant local thresholds in 2016.

Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) Levels

BOD is the amount of oxygen used when organic matter undergoes decomposition by mircoorganisms.Testing for BOD is done 

to assess the amount of organic matter in water.

BOD Levels by Region and Discharge Destination

Note: 1) In Nigeria, there was sufficient pond capacity to contain all effluent without land discharge.

 

2) The BOD data in 2016, as reported in Wilmar's Annual Report 2016, has been restated following EY's limited assurance procedure.

Water Usage

Our mills account for the majority of our water use, drawing supplies from local waterways and wells in order to process FFB. In 

addition to mill water, we also draw some water for nursery irrigation and household use. In our mills, we typically use around  

1.5 m3 of water per tonne of FFB processed. We believe this is in line with normal industry levels.

Reducing 

Chemicals Use

T

he use of chemicals to enhance production and prevent 

pests and diseases is a critical aspect of good agricultural 

practice. However, we recognise that such chemicals should 

be handled and applied in a way that does not risk the safety 

of workers and the environment in which we operate. 

To minimise our pesticide use, we have adopted an integrated 

pest management system that applies a combination of 

natural and mechanical pest reduction strategies, including 

the introduction of natural predators. We also work to 

minimise pesticide usage through precision application. Our 

R&amp;D laboratory in Indonesia has also identified beneficial 

microbes that are being used to develop environmentally 

friendly approaches to controlling or preventing oil palm 

diseases. These may also reduce our reliance on synthetic 

fertilisers and improve plant growth.

Protecting workers

Workers that handle chemicals are required to undergo 

extensive and ongoing training. It is mandatory that they 

wear personal protective equipment (PPE) on site – including 

protective eyewear, facial masks, gloves and boots – and 

showering is compulsory after each shift. These workers 

are subject to regular check-ups to detect any presence 

of residual chemicals. All chemicals are stored in locked 

facilities to which only authorised personnel have access. 

Containers used for storing chemicals are collected, stored 

and disposed of in accordance with the legal requirements 

for hazardous waste. 

In 2016, as part of our in-depth review of our operations in 

North Sumatra, we identified non-conformances in some 

sections, including insufficient PPE stock, which resulted 

in workers not being issued replacement PPE in a timely 

manner. These issues have now been addressed, and we 

are following up to ensure that such breaches in standard 

operating procedures do not take place elsewhere in our 

operations.

Chemicals policy

We monitor toxicity and restrict the use of a number of 

chemicals of concern in order to minimise the potential hazards 

of pesticides for workers, communities and ecosystems. We 

have banned paraquat in our operations since 2011, and 

pesticides that are categorised as World Health Organization 

Class 1A or 1B, or listed by the Stockholm or Rotterdam 

Conventions, are not used, except in specific urgent situations.

We monitor our pesticide usage and focus on tracking the use 

of herbicides as these are applied as part of good agricultural 

practice. Fungicides, rodenticides and insecticides are used 

only to contain outbreaks and attacks, and year-on-year 

comparisons would not be meaningful.



It is compulsory for workers who handle chemicals to wear PPE on site and shower after each work shift.

Wilmar International Limited

We Care

51


Toxicity Per Hectare by Region

T

he use of herbicides is largely determined by planting 

cycle, as new plantings and young palms require greater 

amounts of herbicide. Herbicide usage is also determined 

by local climatic conditions, such as heavy rainfall, as well as 

agricultural and soil conditions and pest profiles. Tracking 

toxicity enables us to more accurately assess our performance 

against peers over time, as well as ensure that changes to the 

type or volume of herbicides used do not adversely affect

Rights of Workers

W

ith over 51,000 people employed in our oil palm 

operations, we have a major challenge as well as a great 

opportunity to provide good livelihoods and development 

opportunities to all our workers and their families.

Review of Current Practices

In late 2016, some civil society groups drew attention to concerns 

about labour practices at our North Sumatra operations, PT 

Perkebunan Milano (PM) and PT Daya Labuhan Indah (DLI).

By the end of 2016, a total of two internal and two external 

assessments were successively undertaken to investigate 

the matter.

One of the external reviews was conducted by Business for 

Social Responsibility (BSR) in December 2016. The assessment 

methodology involved visual observations, interviews, focus 

group discussions and documentation reviews. More than 100 

Wilmar employees, almost all non-management workers, were 

interviewed by BSR, and the findings have been made public.

External due diligence audits also took place in these 

operations via the RSPO and ISCC certification processes 

in January and February 2017 respectively. 

A compilation of all external findings and our action plan has 

been published on our grievance list on our sustainability 

dashboard.

We are continuing our efforts In Indonesia with BSR and 

Verité Southeast Asia in 2017 to define practical approaches 

to improving labour practices across the sector, focusing on 

four highly complex areas:

• 

Presence of children in the workplace

• 

Wages

• 

Fair and equal treatment of workers 

• 

Occupational health and safety 

Engagements with affected workers are ongoing, and we 

are seeking to resolve disputes.

Fair Wages and Benefits

W

e are committed to paying fair wages to all employees, 

and to ensuring that our lowest wage paid always 

meets at least the applicable minimum wage. This also 

applies to workers subject to quotas, such as harvesters, 

who will never earn below the minimum wage, even if the 

set quotas are not met. 

In Indonesia, the legal minimum wage in different provinces 

and/or districts may vary. This is because minimum wages are 

determined by the governor of each region using a formula 

based on the previous year’s minimum wage, inflation and 

economic growth.

*** For Sabah and Sarawak.

**** Ghana’s minimum wage is based on a daily wage of 8 Cedi. To calculate the monthly national minimum wage, we multiply this daily wage by 27 working days.



In addition to wages, our permanent workers and their 

immediate family also enjoy free housing and other benefits, 

including access to facilities such as playgrounds and day-care 

facilities for babies, toddlers, and children of pre-school age.#

We reiterate that all workers are paid at least the legal 

minimum wage or higher. However, due to a lack of details 

on payslips, including cash advances made to workers and 

rice allowances in some regions, we recognise that workers 

may not have fully understood that they have been paid the 

full minimum wage. 

For this reason, we are reviewing the details provided on 

our payslips and will issue them in Bahasa Indonesia instead 

of English. We will also provide guidance to workers to 

ensure greater understanding of the various components 

that make up their take-home salary and how these are 

detailed on payslips.

There were also concerns that workers are given high “targets 

and quotas” to meet.  The “targets and quotas” referred 

to are in fact similar to key performance indicators (KPIs). 

While workers are encouraged to meet the KPIs for the task 

at hand, the minimum wage will still be paid even if the work 

is not completed within the given timeframe (in this case, a 

seven-hour working day).

In the specific case of KPIs for harvesters, these are set 

annually and take into consideration a number of factors, 

including terrain, palm maturity, operational practices (e.g. 

different tools or equipment specifications) and workers 

of different productivity levels (i.e. high, medium and low

Non-Discrimination

Wilmar has in place non-discrimination and equality policies 

that are published on our sustainability dashboard, along 

with other sustainability-related policies.

We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities, 

regardless of gender. However, typically work in agriculture 

attracts a higher proportion of male workers. The latest 

available statistics for Indonesian 'labour in agriculture' from 

the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that 

the number of male workers exceeded female workers by 

about 40%*.

productivity). Following an extensive review and consultation 

with workers’ union representatives, the process is currently 

being improved and updated to also factor in the different 

age groups when defining productivity levels. The process 

will now be conducted in the presence of union leaders who 

will sign off on the outcome. 

Following a review with the management in 2017, it has also 

been found that it is unnecessary to continue communicating 

KPIs for spraying and manuring. While spraying and manuring 

work is integral to plantation management, it is carried out 

at most twice a year per palm in any given block, and will 

therefore no longer require the communication of a KPI for 

productivity. Instead, workers will be assigned to a seven-

hour working day (including one hour for travel, five hours 

for work, and one hour for showering and drinking milk).

Temporary Workers

Temporary workers are hired to perform seasonal work and 

to allow for work flexibility for our workers.

In Central Kalimantan, where there is a lack of workers from 

the resident population (Central Kalimantan is one of the 

least populous provinces in Indonesia), the number of workers 

with temporary status is actually lower than in other regions 

precisely because there are not enough workers to do the 

plantation work required. Although most of the workers in 

Central Kalimantan originate from other parts of Indonesia, 

they tend to reside in company housing in our plantations 

and stay longer than the required three-month period. Hence 

they are categorised as permanent employees.

In other regions, many of our employees are locals who live 

in communities near our plantations. Most of these workers 

have alternative sources of income, such as their own oil palm, 

rubber or paddy fields, and prefer to work on a casual basis 

to supplement their regular source of income. 

Wilmar is now working towards reducing the ratio of temporary 

workers in our plantations, by moving them from temporary 

contracts to permanent contracts.

On the other hand, the proportion of women on temporary 

work contracts is greater than that of men on temporary 

contracts. This is because many temporary workers are wives 

of permanent workers who have specifically requested to 

be employed on a casual basis, with flexible working hours 

that allow them to tend to their households. Permanent 

work contracts do not allow for flexible working hours. We 

continue to have dialogues with our workers to improve 

their contract terms, work conditions and work-life balance.

Child Labour

We launched our first No Child Labour Policy in 2010, and 

our NDPE Policy includes a strict No Child Labour provision. 

We do not employ anyone under the age of 18, and workers 

are not allowed to bring their children to work with them.# 

However, in a plantation landscape where there are communities 

working and living in the same spatial environment, we do 

have some difficulties in preventing a child being present 

in the field. We have therefore now made estate managers 

directly responsible if breaches to the rule are found, and 

this has a direct impact on their KPIs.

A number of internal and external assessments found no 

evidence that Wilmar was employing any children. Checks 

through independent interviews with teachers in the nearby 

schools, which compared Wilmar’s census data against 

school attendance records, found that almost all children 

were attending school daily, and that the few who were not 

accounted for were not likely to be missing school to work 

with their parents. Through our own internal investigation, 

we did find instances where children were not being sent to 

school.  In particular, 36 out of a total of 1,391 children residing 

in PT PM and PT DLI in North Sumatra were of school-going 

age (up to 18 years old) but did not attend school. The most 

common reason cited was that the children did not want to 

attend school. Our management team is currently working 

out potential solutions with parents to resolve this problem.

Interviews with union representatives conducted by independent 

assessors also indicated that children were not present on the 

plantation to help their parents. The interviews also found 

that the rule that children cannot accompany parents in the 

field is well understood by workers. 

We are committed to keeping children out of plantation 

operations, and we are taking the following actions to that end:

• 

Conducting a survey at two estates in North Sumatra to 

identify why children drop out of school, and developing 

a solution based on the findings to encourage their 

attendance.# Survey will be extended to more estates 

in Indonesia in 2017.

• 

Developing a pocket book that lists potential hazards for 

children in the plantation to raise parents' awareness of 

the risk.#

• 

Consistently socialising the No Child Labour Policy to all 

workers by providing written notifications, management 

instructions and regular reminders during the muster.

Workers' passport lockers in Wilmar's plantation in East Malaysia.

Bonded Labour

I

n accordance with the RSPO and our NDPE Policy, we do 

not accept any forced, trafficked or bonded labour, either 

in our own operations or in our supply chain.

Should we encounter instances of such practices, we will 

undertake remedial actions to ensure that victims are referred 

to existing services for support and assistance. In the oil palm 

sector, the most prominent risk of force or coercion occurs 

during the recruitment of workers through employment 

agencies. This is a particular risk in the case of foreign workers. 

In Malaysia and Indonesia, we recruit all workers for our 

upstream operations (i.e. plantations and mills) directly and 

do not pay fees to recruitment agencies. Workers are either 

hired directly or referred through friends and relatives. In 

some cases we ask team leaders to assist in the recruitment 

of local workers and they are paid an incentive to. We do, 

however, use agents to help with the processing of recruitment 

documents, such as work permits and passports, as well to 

arrange the transportation of workers to our plantations. 

These agents are fully paid by the company and no cost is 

charged to the workers.

In countries like Ghana and Nigeria, we do use agents in the 

recruitment process, but we do not allow any requirement 

that jobseekers lodge monetary deposits or other collateral 

as a condition of employment. 

Fees or costs must not be charged to job-seekers and workers 

for services directly related to their recruitment, in either a 

temporary or permanent job placement, including when they 

use the services of private employment agencies. 

We also seek to ensure that employees are never subject to the 

unlawful withholding of wages, identification cards, passports 

or other travel documents, or other personal belongings, 

without their consent. To ensure that all employees have 

access to a secure place to store their personal belongings, 

we are now embarking on the installation of lockers for 

workers in Sabah and Sarawak. We installed 750 lockers in 

2016 and are on target to install a total of 9,640 lockers by 

the end of 2017.

Employee Engagement and Complaints Mechanisms

Our NDPE Policy and the RSPO Principles &amp; Criteria (P&amp;C) set 

out clear requirements to ensure that workers have access to a 

complaints mechanism and a process for settling grievances.# 

In Indonesia, for example, all employees (including temporary 

workers) can make complaints verbally or in writing to their 

direct supervisor.# If the complaint concerns the direct 

supervisor, the employee may also go to a union representative 

or make use of on-site feedback boxes to make an anonymous 

complaint.# If a complaint cannot be settled satisfactorily, 

the matter may be escalated to the Human Resources (HR) 

Department and subsequently to the senior management 

(general manager level).# Should a complaint not be resolved 

in a manner that is satisfactory to the employee, he or she 

may seek the assistance of a mediator from the Department 

of Manpower, or may ultimately resort to legal action.# 

Confidentiality and anonymity of the complainant may be 

requested and will be guaranteed, depending on the degree 

of sensitivity of the problem, the scale of the impact if the issue 

is made public, and the risk of retaliation to the complainant.

In addition to our general grievance mechanism, complaints 

mechanism and workers’ unions, we have in place gender 

committees in our plantations to ensure that women can 

access support and raise concerns.# 

The assessment conducted with BSR in Indonesia found 

that workers had a low level of awareness about grievance 

mechanisms, and that it was unclear whether temporary 

workers were covered by existing mechanisms. We are now 

reviewing ways to ensure that all employees are aware and 

clear about the complaints options available to them. 

Freedom of Association

We support the rights of employees to form and join trade 

unions of their choice and to bargain collectively.# Where the 

rights to freedom of association and to collective bargaining 

are restricted under law, parallel means of independent and 

free association and bargaining are made available for all 

personnel.

Unions are a very important partner in ensuring that we 

understand and appropriately address the concerns and 

grievances of our employees. In many of our operations in 

Indonesia, Collective Labour Agreements (CLAs) have been 

developed jointly with workers’ union representatives to provide 

clarity and assurance on the rights and responsibilities of both 

plantations/mills and workers, as well as on workers' benefit 

entitlements. CLAs are negotiated between the plantation/

mill management and workers, who are represented by the 

respective labour union, and are valid for workers who are 

members of the union.  CLAs are reviewed every two years.

Workers can also use the union as a grievance channel or for 

collective bargaining purposes, such as to negotiate with the 

company on issues related to wages and premium incentives.

s an integral part of our labour assessments, we are 

strengthening our focus on health and safety at our 

plantations and mills. This includes better enforcement of 

existing standard operating procedures, such as appropriate 

use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and improved 

training for all workers. We are also looking to address 

certain non-work related behaviours that put workers at risk. 

For example, to stop workers using herbicide containers for 

storing drinking water, we are providing drinking containers 

and potable water in the field. We have also implemented a 

triple-rinsing process for empty herbicide containers.

We maintain our focus on safety and are following through 

with our efforts to strengthen our safety culture. Key indicators 

that tie employees’ remuneration to their health and safety 

performance are now being set to instil a behaviour-based 

safety culture, support increased safety awareness and 

improve safety practices.  

Note: In the course of compiling the 2015 Sustainability Report, it was discovered that the methodology for collating incidents differed across our sites. Therefore, 

historical incident rates for 2015 are not reported. We have resumed LTIR reporting in our 2016 Sustainability Report after setting a more consistent reporting 

standard across the Group.

Fatalities

We regret that our oil palm operations recorded one work-related fatality in our plantation in Sabah in 2016 as a result of 

a tractor accident. The incident was reviewed in collaboration with the Department of Occupational Health and Safety.  

A range of controls has been put in place, and additional driver training has been carried out to prevent similar accidents.

acilitating the inclusion of smallholders into the supply 

chain is a priority for Wilmar. Smallholder inclusion is of 

critical importance for securing our social license to operate, 

our future fruit supply and our ongoing good relations with 

local communities.

While certification is an important component in incentivising 

sustainable practices, we do not believe it is the only solution 

for smallholders. We believe that smallholders must understand 

the direct value of sustainable practices, and that “sustainability” 

is part of a quality component for FFB. While our formal 

programmes with smallholders and external partners have 

so far focused on certification as an end goal, we also want 

farmers to focus on improving yields – primarily through 

consistent use of fertiliser and the correct interventions for 

key pests and weeds, and through improving FFB harvested 

In addition to scheme smallholders, we are also working to 

grow our independent smallholder base and increase our 

direct FFB purchases from them.  In 2016, we bought a total 

of 516,038.53 MT of FFB from independent smallholders, of 

which about 80% was from Indonesia, about 13% from Malaysia 

and the remainder from Ghana.

We are also focusing on supporting independent FFB suppliers 

in Nigeria. We have partnered with the Central Bank of Nigeria 

(CBN) to run an outgrower programme known as the CBN 

Anchor-Borrower Programme. Our Biase Plantation has been 

selected to anchor the programme in Cross River State, Nigeria. 

As at end 2016, more than 400 farmers in over 40 cooperatives 

(representing over 1,000 ha of land) have been identified for 

participation in the programme. The programme is still being 

fine-tuned before its launch date in 2017. 

To complement the CBN Anchor-Borrower Programme, 

Biase Plantations and Eyop Industries are working on a pilot 

outgrower programme to test the functionality of a “Nucleus-

Estate” model within Wilmar’s operations in Cross River State. 

Three farmer cooperatives who fulfil all legal requirements 

with regards to their land, and who share common boundaries 

with our estates have been identified as suitable. Wilmar will 

be entering into an agreement with them to develop their 

land as part of the pilot. This model will then be refined for 

replication through the CBN Anchor-Borrower Programme. So 

far, 140 ha of land neighbouring our Calaro and Ibiae estates 

has been identified. We have been working with farmers to 

fulfil legal, customary and environmental due process before 

the land clearing begins.

quality (e.g. harvesting only ripe FFBs, correct cutting of stalks, 

picking of loose fruits, etc.) – so that they can benefit from 

better extraction rates and pricing. 

To address a vast diversity of cultures, traditions, land tenure 

models and local development needs, the format and focus 

of our smallholder work is shaped locally and in partnership 

and dialogue with communities and local government bodies.

Wilmar sources from both scheme and independent smallholders. 

We are committed to helping our own scheme smallholders 

achieve certification under the RSPO Smallholder P&amp;C. Of the 

total scheme smallholder planted area in Indonesia and Ghana, 

about 90% is RSPO-certified. We aim to have the remaining 

smallholder planted area certified by 2018.

Supporting Smallholders Beyond Our Direct Smallholder Supply Base

In addition to our direct smallholder supply 

base, Wilmar also supports the smallholders 

of our suppliers. The Wilmar Smallholders 

Support in Honduras (WISSH) was initiated at 

the beginning of 2016 to empower smallholders’ 

knowledge and build technical capacities on 

best agricultural management practices so 

they can increase productivity and improve 

their livelihoods, while maintaining responsible 

sustainable practices. 

WISSH is a partnership between Wilmar 

(Europe) and The Industrial Association of 

Palm Oil Producers in Honduras (AIPAH). A 

total of 1,980 smallholders were trained on 

two key topics –Wilmar’s NDPE Policy and 

good environmental practices and ecosystem 

conservation – in over 119 sessions. 

Besides providing training, our implementation 

partner, NES Naturaleza, also developed 

a “Monitor &amp; Control” mobile application 

(app) to facilitate crop management. This app 

enables record keeping for field activities, such 

as pesticide application, fossil fuel use and 

harvesting schedules. 

Over the course of 2016, three editions of 

pocket guidebooks featuring information about 

the training topics and functionalities of the 

mobile app were published and distributed to 

participating smallholders. As part of this initiative, 

we started collecting the GPS-coordinates of 

associated smallholders to map out the supply 

base of our supplier mills. At end 2016, we have 

produced concession maps that capture the 

supply shed of 1,500 smallholders.

Community Relations and 

Conflict Resolution

W

ilmar works to obtain the Free, Prior and Informed Consent 

(FPIC) of local communities in all development projects. 

FPIC is based on good faith negotiation, through which local 

communities can give or withhold their consent to relinquishing 

their land rights to the company.

In most of the countries where we operate, land use and 

land ownership are highly complex, with overlapping or un-

delineated land rights in land concessions. Shaped by national 

development policies and projects, these can sometimes have 

an unintentional impact on local communities and result in 

conflicts and disagreements.

We endeavour to be respectful of local communities 

whenever such conflicts arise. We are committed to long-

term relationship building as part of our goal  to maintain 

harmonious relations with all our stakeholders. We engaged 

with affected communities in an open and consultative manner 

to bring about a free, prior, informed and consensual solution 

that benefits all parties. Our NDPE Policy mandates that 

we only develop in areas where we are welcomed by local 

communities. We will respect the wishes of local occupants 

who want to keep their land, and these areas will be delineated 

as social enclaves for community use.

Making reference to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s 

Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of 

Tenure, Wilmar’s policy guidelines are: 

• Wilmar will respect the resource (e.g. land, forests 

and fisheries) and tenure rights of local communities. 

This is done in cognisance of the national obligations, 

constitutions, local laws and regulations of the country 

we are operating in. We diligently strive to ensure that 

we use land to which we have a legal right, and in which 

the country’s government recognises us as the rightful 

entity to manage the land in question.

• If there are land disputes, Wilmar seeks to resolve them 

in an open and consensual manner. In the event of loss 

or damage affecting legal or customary rights, property, 

resources or livelihoods, we endeavour to undertake all 

measures to help avoid such loss or damage.

Wilmar pledges to respect and recognise the long-term 

customary and individual rights of indigenous and local 

communities. We also commit to ensuring legal compliance 

and that international best practices on FPIC are implemented, 

in accordance with the full scope of our NDPE Policy, prior 

to commencing any new operations. 

Our standard practice involves negotiating with individual 

landowners and local community leaders, or the government, 

depending on the country. With respect to compensation, we 

strive for a fair compensation to the local community leaders 

for existing crops, with statutory levels of compensation 

as a minimum. We also implement progressive community 

development programmes through employment opportunities 

and smallholder schemes, making every effort to ensure that 

communities are satisfied with the socio-economic benefits 

that development will bring.

We continually strive to improve and strengthen our land 

claims resolution system through an inclusive, multi-stakeholder 

approach, and by working closely with local civil society 

groups and social experts.

Supporting Community Development

Many of our operations are located in remote parts of 

developing countries, and often close to local communities. 

Our business activities therefore have a direct impact on 

the quality of life and livelihoods of our employees and our 

neighbours.

Our approach is to ensure that we bring meaningful and lasting 

benefits to communities, and build open, honest and mutually 

beneficial relationships that promote harmony with them.

We seek to address local needs and encourage community 

self-reliance, particularly through our provision of and support 

for education, healthcare and infrastructure.

Access to Schools

We provide a range of services in our plantations, including 

childcare, kindergartens and schools, to ensure that all our 

workers’ children have access to day-care and education 

while their parents are at work.

Wilmar has 10 schools in its Indonesian plantations. Together, 

these cover kindergarten, primary and secondary-level 

curricula. We also support the education of more than 5,000# 

children in our local communities, including our employees' 

children. We also support and contribute to another three 

government schools outside our estates, including through 

the provision of new school buildings and routine upgrades 

and refurbishments, which altogether serve 1,200 children. 

We also provide educational materials, such as computers, 

books and uniforms, and fund the employment of teachers.

We have a total of 17 primary schools in our estates in Malaysia 

– 15 in Sabah and two in Sarawak. These benefit a total of 

747# children. As many children are of Indonesian origin or 

Indonesian nationals, we collaborate with the Indonesian 

government to run Community Learning Centres (CLCs). CLCs 

provide secondary education to 144# children in Sabah, and 

primary education to 170# children in Sarawak.

Access to Healthcare

All our employees and their families have access to medical 

services, including hospitals, local clinics and mobile aid 

posts. In addition, clinics are open to local communities to 

provide them with basic healthcare services.

Our employees are also highly supportive of our healthcare 

programmes. For example, our Malaysian operations organise 

annual blood donation drives to support local hospitals.

EY Assurance Statement

Independent Limited Assurance Statement to the Management of Wilmar International Limited (‘Wilmar’)

We have performed limited assurance procedures in relation to Wilmar’s Sustainability Report 2016 (‘the Report’) as detailed 

in the ‘Subject Matter’ below.

The Management’s Responsibility 

Wilmar’s Sustainability Report 2016 has been prepared by 

the Management of Wilmar, which is responsible for the 

collection and presentation of the information it contains 

and for maintaining adequate records and internal 

controls that are designed to support the sustainability 

reporting process.  For the purpose of the Sustainability 

Report 2016, there are no legally prescribed requirements 

relating to the preparation, publication and verification of 

sustainability reports.

The Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility in performing our limited assurance 

activities is to the Management of Wilmar only and in 

accordance with the terms of reference agreed with them. 

We do not accept or assume any responsibility for any 

other purpose or to any other person or organisation. Any 

reliance any such third party may place on the Report is 

entirely at their own risk.

Our review was limited to the information on the select 

indicators set out within the Report from 1 January 2016 to 

31 December 2016 and our responsibility does not include:

• 

Any work in respect of sustainability information 

published elsewhere on Wilmar’s annual report, 

company website, sustainability dashboard, policy 

progress updates and other publications,

• 

Sustainability information prior to 01 January 2016 and 

subsequent to 31 December 2016, and

• 

Management’s forward looking statements such as 

targets, plans and intentions.

Our multi-disciplinary team has the required competencies 

and experience to conduct this assurance engagement. Our 

professionals have experience in both assurance skills and 

in the applicable subject matter including environmental, 

social and financial aspects.

Reporting Criteria

As a basis for the assurance engagement, we have used 

the criterion of accuracy in the sustainability reporting 

guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 

Standards). We consider this reporting criterion to be 

relevant and appropriate.

Assurance Standard Used and  

Level of Assurance

Our limited assurance engagement has been planned and 

performed in accordance with the ISAE 30001 Assurance 

Engagement Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical 

Financial Information. We have also considered the Global 

Reporting Initiative Standards (‘GRI Standards’) reporting 

guidelines in conducting our limited assurance procedures. 

A limited assurance engagement consists of making 

enquiries and applying analytical and other limited 

assurance procedures.  Our procedures were designed 

to provide a limited level of assurance and as such do not 

provide all the evidence that would be required to provide 

a reasonable level of assurance. 

The procedures performed depend on the assurance 

practitioner’s judgement including the risk of material 

misstatement of the specific activity data, whether due 

to fraud or error. While we considered the effectiveness 

of Management’s internal controls when determining the 

nature and extent of our procedures, our review was not 

designed to provide assurance on internal controls. We 

believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 

appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.

What we did to form our conclusions

The procedures performed aim to verify the plausibility of 

information. We designed our procedures in order to state 

whether anything has come to our attention to suggest 

that the Subject Matter detailed above has not been 

reported in accordance with the reporting criterion cited 

earlier. In order to form our conclusions we undertook the 

steps below:

1. Inquiries with Wilmar’s Sustainability team to:

 

a. Understand principal business operations, 

 

b. Appreciate 

key 

sustainability 

issues 

and 

developments,

 

c. Map out information flow for sustainability reporting 

and the relevant controls,

 

d. Identify data providers with their responsibilities, 

and 

 

e. Recognise 

the 

likelihood 

of 

fraud 

on 

the 

sustainability information.

2. Undertake multiple visits to:

 

a. Wilmar’s headquarters in Singapore, and

 

b. Wilmar’s selected plantations and mills in West 

Sumatra.

3. Interviews with employees and Management in 

Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia (e.g. Sustainability 

team, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) team, 

Human Resources, estate managers, fire coordinators) 

to understand key sustainability issues related to the 

selected indicators, collection processes and accuracy 

of reporting. 

4. Conduct process walk-through of systems and 

processes for data aggregation and reporting, with 

relevant personnel to understand the quality of checks 

and control mechanisms, assessing and testing the 

controls in relation to the concerned subject matters.

5. Obtain documentation through sampling methods 

to verify assumptions, estimations and computations 

made by Management in relation to the concerned 

subject matters. 

6. Conduct general media research (including reports from 

reputable NGOs) on the concerned subject matters.

7. Checking that data and statements had been correctly 

transcribed from corporate systems and / or supporting 

evidence, in relation to concerned subject matters.

Our independence

EY has provided independent assurance services in relation 

to Wilmar’s Sustainability Report 2016. 

In conducting our assurance engagement, we have met the 

independence requirements of the Institute of Singapore 

Chartered Accountants and Code of Professional Conduct 

and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities. 

Our EY independence policies prohibit any financial 

interests in our clients that would or might be seen to impair 

independence. Each year, partners and staff are required to 

confirm their compliance with the firm’s policies. 

Observations and areas for improvement

Our observations and areas for improvement will be raised 

in an internal report to Wilmar’s Management. These 

observations do not affect our conclusions on the Report 

set out below. 

Conclusion

Based on the procedures performed and evidence 

obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 

to believe that the Subject Matter was not presented fairly, 

and calculated in all material respects in accordance with 

the criterion detailed above.

Other Matter

The Subject Matter No. 7 for the years ended 31 December 

2012 to 2015 were not audited and our opinion does not 

relate to this Subject Matter for that year.

The Subject Matter No. 6 for the years ended 31 December 

2012 and 2013, were audited by another auditor who 

expressed an unmodified opinion on this Subject Matter on 

26 August 2014.

to assess the amount of organic matter in water.

CO2 Equivalents

Carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) provide a universal standard of measurement against which the impacts of releasing (or 

avoiding the release of) different greenhouse gases can be evaluated.

Effluents

Water discharged from one source into a separate body of water, such as mill process water.

Extraction rate

The amount of oil extracted from oil palm fruit at a mill. Crude palm oil (CPO) is extracted from the flesh; palm kernel oil 

(PKO) from the nut.

Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)

FPIC the principle that a community has the right to give or withhold its consent to proposed projects that may affect the 

lands they customarily own, occupy or otherwise use.

Fresh fruit bunch (FFB)

Bunch harvested from the oil palm tree. The weight of the fruit bunch ranges between 10 kg to 40 kg depends on the size 

and age.

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

A multi-stakeholder standard for sustainability reporting, providing guidance on determining report content and indicators.

High Conservation Values (HCVs)

HCVs are biological, ecological, social or cultural values which are considered outstandingly significant or critically important, 

at the national, regional or global level.

High Carbon Stock approach

The HCS Approach is a methodology to avoid deforestation in land development, initially developed in a partnership between 

Greenpeace, TFT and Golden Agri-Resources. The approach stratifies the vegetation on an area of land into different classes 

using analyses of satellite images and field plot measurements. Each vegetation class is validated through calibrating it with 

carbon stock estimates in the above-ground tree biomass.

Independent Director

According to the Listing Manual of SGX, an independent director is one who has no relationship with the company, its related 

corporations (i.e. a corporation that is the company’s holding company, subsidiary or fellow subsidiary), its 10% shareholders 

or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent 

business judgement with a view to the best interests of the company.

Independent smallholder

Small growers with less than 50 hectares, which are self-financed, managed, and equipped and are not bound to any one mill. 

They may deal directly with local mill operators of their choice or process their own palm oil using personal or community 

manual palm oil presses (more common in Africa)

Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

IPM is the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that 

discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically 

justified and reduce or minimise risks to human health and the environment. IPM emphasises the growth of a healthy crop 

with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms.

International Labour Organization (ILO)

Is a tripartite world body representative of labour, management and government, and is an agency of the United Nations. It 

disseminates labour information and sets minimum international labour standards called “conventions”, offered to member 

nations for adoption.

Mass Balance

The Mass Balance system allows for mixing of RSPO certified and non- certified palm oil at any stage in the supply chain 

provided that overall company quantities are controlled. The mass balance model is constructed in such a way that volumes 

of RSPO certified product shipped will never exceed volumes received by the end-user

Non-executive director

A board director who does not currently hold other employment with the company. Unlike an independent director, a non-

executive can have significant financial interests or close personal ties to the company.

Non-governmental organisation (NGO)

Is used in this report to refer to grassroots and campaigning organisations focused on environmental or social issues.

Palm oil mill effluent (POME)

By-product of processed fresh fruit bunch (FFB).

Peat and Peatland

Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation matter. Peat forms in wetlands or peat lands, variously called 

bogs, moors, muskegs, pocosins, mires, and peat swamp forests. Land with soil having more than 65% organic matter is 

considered peatland. 

Plasma schemes

A programme initiated by the Indonesian government to encourage the development of smallholders’ plantations with 

the assistance and cooperation of plantation companies (the nucleus) which assist and support the surrounding community 

plantations (the plasma).

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)

A multi-stakeholder organisation based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The organisation has developed a certification scheme 

for sustainable palm oil.

Segregation

The Segregation supply chain model assures that RSPO-certified palm oil and its derivatives delivered to the end-user come 

only from RSPO certified sources. It permits the mixing of RSPO-certified palm oil from a variety of sources.

Stakeholders

Any group or individual who are affected by or can affect a company’s operations.

Sustainability

A term expressing a long-term balance between social, economic and environmental objectives. Often linked to sustainable 

development, which is defined as “development that meets the need of current generations without compromising the 

needs of future generations”.
