BOARD STATEMENT

Perennial Real Estate Holdings Limited 

(“Perennial”) is pleased to present our third 

Sustainability Report (“SR2019”). This report 

has been prepared in accordance with the 

sustainability reporting requirements set 

out in the Listing Manual of the Singapore 

Exchange 

Securities 

Trading 

Limited  

(“SGX-ST”) 

(Rules 

711A 

and 

711B).  

The report is also prepared with reference to 

Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards 

– ‘Core’ option, an internationally-recognised 

standard used by corporations globally.

Sustainability 

has 

been 

ingrained 

into 

Perennial’s strategic directions and business 

operations ever since it started trading on the 

Mainboard of the SGX-ST on 26 December 

2014. As Perennial looks towards fine-tuning 

its approach to sustainability, the Board 

of Directors (“Board”) has taken steps to 

review its current business strategies taking 

sustainability issues into account and aligned 

its business objectives with the global agenda 

for sustainable development.

The Board considers the Environmental, 

Social and Governance (“ESG”) impacts 

which Perennial’s business activities have on 

its environment and the community. This year, 

the reporting scope has been expanded to 

include its Healthcare business, focusing on 

Eldercare and Senior Housing, starting from 

Yixian Eldercare and Retirement Home located 

in Fengxian District, Shanghai, China. This 

provides stakeholders with a wider perspective 

of the interactions that Perennial’s businesses 

have with the community at large. 

In light of this development, the management 

has conducted a thorough review of the eight 

existing ESG factors (five material and three 

industry-relevant) and affirmed their continued 

relevance to Perennial’s businesses. The Board 

remains centrally involved in determining, 

managing and monitoring Perennial’s material 

ESG factors and its performance. The Board 

has reviewed and validated the eight existing 

ESG factors for FY2019. 

Aside to assessing and managing ESG 

impacts, Perennial has adopted two United 

Nations (“UN”) Sustainability Development 

Goals (“SDGs”): SDGs 13 (Climate Change) 

and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) 

and mapped existing initiatives and targets 

under each of these goals. Perennial looks 

towards adopting more SDGs in the years to 

come and urges stakeholders to embark on 

their journey too. 

Feedback

Perennial welcomes all feedback from 

stakeholders 

on 

this 

report 

and 

its 

sustainability efforts. Please send your 

comments and suggestions to sustainability@

perennialrealestate.com.sg.

OVERVIEW

This 

report 

reflects 

information 

about 

Perennial’s sustainability performance from 

1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 

(“FY2019”), with prior period performance 

(“FY2018”) indicated where applicable for 

comparison. This report covers its Real 

Estate and Healthcare businesses, located in 

Singapore and China. Unless otherwise noted, 

all sustainability data and information relate to 

the entities in Table 1.

In FY2019, Perennial divested its entire stake 

in Chinatown Point’s retail mall and four strata 

office units. As the Company still oversees 

the day-to-day operations of the property, the 

property will remain in its reporting scope as 

Perennial has adopted an operational control 

approach for data consolidation. 

Since FY2016, Perennial has acquired an 

effective interest of 49.9% in Shanghai RST 

Chinese Medicine Co. Ltd (“Renshoutang”), 

an established pioneer of private integrated 

eldercare with medical and pharmacy services 

in China. This year, Perennial has included 

Fengxian, an eldercare and retirement home in 

China under the Renshoutang’s portfolio, into 

the reporting scope. As Perennial manages 

Fengxian on a strategic level, the management 

approach 

comprising 

policies, 

practices 

and relevant initiatives at the facility will be 

disclosed in this report. 

For more details on the properties, please refer 

to the Business Review sections in the Annual 

Report 2019. 

Perennial continues to adopt the GRI 

Standards 

as 

it 

is 

an 

internationally 

recognised framework that encompasses a 

comprehensive range of disclosures suitable 

for Perennial. The GRI Standards encourage 

transparent and consistent reporting and 

allow for comparability against that of its  

industry peers. 

Building upon the GRI Standards, Perennial 

also commits towards the UN 2030 Agenda 

for 

Sustainable 

Development 

through 

the adoption of two SDGs. Through the 

mapping of its targets, existing initiatives 

and GRI disclosures, it guides Perennial on 

the formulation of business objectives as 

well as the development of future actions to 

further its contribution towards sustainable 

development. 

Perennial has not sought external assurance 

for the information within this report but will 

consider doing so as its sustainability reporting 

matures over time.

The full SR2019, as well as Perennial’s 

Annual 

Report 

2019 

(“AR2019”) 

(including the Sustainability Summary 

Report) to be published in due course, 

will be made available for download at

APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

Sustainability Governance Structure

As part of Perennial’s strategic formulation, 

the Board maintains oversight on the 

implementation of sustainability practices 

throughout the Company. Closely supported 

by the Sustainability Committee, they ensure 

that various policies, targets and initiatives 

are established and cascaded down to the 

Sustainability Reporting Team. 

The Sustainability Reporting Team works 

closely with different departments, listed in 

Figure 1, to monitor progress against targets 

set and collect relevant information. They are 

also responsible for driving initiatives within 

their divisions and ensuring continuity of 

these projects. Thereafter, regular updates 

will be consolidated monthly and submitted 

to the Sustainability Committee for review. 

The Board then reviews the Sustainability 

Report submitted by the Committee on an 

annual basis. 

Perennial considers sustainability risks as part 

of its Enterprise Risk Management Framework. 

After the materiality assessment, the Audit and 

Risk Committee (“ARC”) reviewed the key 

risks associated with the eight selected ESG 

factors to ensure alignment. These key risks 

Figure 1: Sustainability Governance Structure of Perennial

Figure 2: Perennial’s Materiality Assessment Process

Materiality Assessment Process

Perennial 

conducted 

its 

first 

materiality 

assessment for its inaugural Sustainability 

Report in FY2017. Eight ESG factors (five 

material and three industry-relevant) were 

selected to provide an accurate reflection of 

key areas of stakeholder interests and their 

significant impact on the community as a result 

of the Company’s business activities. The 

process also guides Perennial in responding 

adequately and accurately to its stakeholders’ 

concerns. This process is outlined in Figure 

2 which follows the phases of identification, 

prioritisation, validation and review. 

The Board has reaffirmed the relevance 

of 

these 

eight 

existing 

ESG 

factors  

(Figure 3) in FY2019. The corresponding 

policies, initiatives, targets and performance 

measurement indicators under each material 

factor are disclosed in this report.

were also reviewed to ensure its relevance with

mapped to their associated key risks has been 

included in Table 2.

Mapping to the SDGs

In 2015, the UN SDGs were launched as 

a global approach towards sustainable 

development. The 17 SDGs highlight the 

critical roles that global stakeholders play 

on sustainable and inclusive development. 

Together with its 169 underlying targets, 

they provide a comprehensive guide for 

stakeholders tackling global issues such 

as 

gender 

inequality, 

climate 

change, 

socioeconomic development and strong 

governance, through respective means of 

their businesses. 

In FY2019, Perennial has adopted two key 

SDGs identified as integral to its sustainability 

approach. With guidance from external 

consultants and reference from the SDG 

Compass1, Perennial’s existing targets and 

initiatives have been mapped under each 

of these goals. The SDG Compass, building 

upon the GRI Standards as well as several 

other recognised standards, allows the 

measurement of progress as well as highlights 

potential areas for improvement. 

1 The SDG Compass provides guidance for companies on how to align their strategies as well as measure and manage their contributions to the realisation of the SDGs. For more information,

REVIEW

These material topics were 

subsequently validated by 

the Board.

With each reporting cycle, 

the Management reviews 

the existing eight material 

factors for its relevance to 

the reporting scope. 

With the inclusion of the 

healthcare business, the  

material factors remain 

unchanged for SR2019.

The Management 

participated in an unbiased 

voting exercise managed 

by an independent 

consultant, and a total 

of eight ESG factors 

(five material and three 

industry-relevant) were 

prioritised for reporting.

A comprehensive list 

of material topics were 

consolidated through a 

series of desktop research, 

peers benchmarking and 

internal interviews.

ENVIRONMENT

Perennial 

recognises 

the 

importance 

of reducing the impacts of its business 

operations on the environment. Led by the 

Sustainability Committee, the Environment 

and Climate Change Mitigation Policy was 

established, guiding not only improvements 

on energy consumption performance across 

several Singapore properties through energy-

efficient AEIs but also the promotion of 

environmental awareness in all employees 

and stakeholders. 

Throughout 

its 

day-to-day 

operations, 

Perennial also explores opportunities to adopt 

energy-saving practices while meeting all legal 

and environmental standards where Perennial 

operates. 

Across both Real Estate and Healthcare 

businesses, a management team located at 

each property monitors consumption levels, 

conducts cost-benefit analysis and explores 

ways to improve usage efficiency. 

In Real Estate properties, an Asset Control 

Group (“ACG”) at each property is responsible 

for analysing consumption data. Anomalies or 

spikes in electricity and water usage will be 

discussed during monthly review meetings. 

Consumption from previous months and years 

will be used as comparison during the analysis 

and any drastic deviations will be promptly 

raised for further actions to be taken. Through 

trend analysis, the ACG also guides towards 

future target setting and adoption of energy-

saving initiatives.

Energy, GHG Emissions and 

Alternative Energy Sources

Improving Energy Efficiency across 

Properties

This year, Perennial has fully completed 

LED light fitting replacements for retail areas 

across almost all3 of its real estate properties 

in Singapore and China. All other light fittings 

will be replaced upon end of life or as and 

when necessary. Energy-saving escalators 

with sensors were also installed in Singapore, 

which reduces consumption during non-peak 

hours at these properties. 

Another major source of energy in commercial 

buildings is attributed to the chiller systems. 

At 111 Somerset, a designed chiller system 

servicing four retail level floors achieved a 

high energy efficiency of below 0.7kW/RT. 

This has helped to relieve the higher energy 

consumption in the midst of AEI works. 

In 

China, 

energy-related 

trainings 

were 

conducted for employees which aimed to 

improve existing skillsets and their knowledge 

in latest energy monitoring systems. Perennial 

plans to carry out trainings for more employees 

in the near future. At Fengxian, the installation 

of power meters was also completed during 

the year and the team onsite will continue to 

assess its sufficiency and may propose further 

installations if necessary. 

Purchased electricity from the grid remains 

as the primary source of energy used across 

Singapore and China, with a small portion of 

natural gas consumed at Perennial Qingyang 

Mall during the winter months. In FY2019, 

Perennial’s total energy consumption was

Cooperation’s website.

of 20,037 tonnes CO2e, of which 270 tonnes 

CO2e were Scope 1 GHG emissions. 

For the purpose of like-for-like comparison, 

Perennial reports the major source of energy 

consumption – purchased electricity (Figure 5) 

and corresponding Scope 2 GHG emissions 

(Figure 

6). 

In 

FY2019, 

total 

electricity 

consumption was recorded at 45,013 MWh, 

a 5% increase from FY2018. Correspondingly, 

Scope 2 GHG from electricity consumption 

also increased from 19,234 tonnes CO2e in 

FY2018 to 19,767 tonnes CO2e in FY2019. 

Overall, Perennial has maintained a stable 

consumption of energy used across both 

years. The ACGs at each property will continue 

to monitor performance and explore new 

ways to reduce consumption while increasing 

efficiency of existing equipment.

 Relevant UN SDG

5 FY2018 energy consumption and intensity data were restated, as an estimated figure was used for December 2018 consumption. The actual consumption was only available in FY2019, 

hence actual consumption has been reflected this year. 

6 FY2018 carbon emissions and intensity data were restated due to the revised energy consumption and intensity data. Please refer to Footnote 5.

In the year, properties in China held various 

sustainability awareness events aimed at 

educating the public on the importance of 

sustainability and how they can contribute 

towards the environment. The events 

received support from the local government 

and media. Over 100 visitors, tenants and 

employees have actively participated in 

these events. 

In September 2019, a total of three anti-

trash run events were held at Perennial 

Jihua Mall (Foshan). The events attracted 

over 

500 

“eco-warriors” 

dressed 

in 

traditional Chinese clothing who actively 

picked up litter along the running route. 

The event promoted the integration 

of Chinese culture and also aimed to 

inculcate the right attitude towards waste 

disposal by placing waste where it belongs 

– in a rubbish bin. 

An online game “Where Does The 

Garbage Go” was launched on Weibo to 

educate the public on the importance of 

segregating recyclables such as glass, 

plastic, metal from general waste. Scores

were displayed on a leaderboard and 

players with the highest scores were 

awarded with attractive prizes.

Water Management

Water Saving Measures 

Since FY2017, Perennial has consistently 

tracked water consumption levels and has 

introduced 

water-saving 

initiatives where 

appropriate. During the year, more water 

fittings with Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme 

ticks issued by PUB, Singapore’s National 

Water Agency were procured and installed 

during AEI works at 111 Somerset. In FY2019, 

installation of water meters has been fully 

completed at retail areas of AXA Tower 

and are currently ongoing amongst other 

properties in Singapore. With the installation 

of water meters, the ACG was able to obtain 

more accurate readings of water consumption 

and promptly respond to any water leakages.  

The data also allowed for more detailed 

analysis of consumption patterns across  

the assets. 

Similarly in the China properties, advanced 

water-efficient taps and several other water-

saving fittings have been introduced. In 

FY2019, Perennial Qingyang and Perennial 

Jihua malls have also completed installation 

of water meters and will continue to monitor 

its sufficiency. Further measures will be 

introduced to better track water consumption 

when required. At Fengxian, used water is 

collected and treated at the onsite wastewater 

treatment station before it is discharged 

into the domestic wastewater system. The 

wastewater is thus returned to the water cycle 

with reduced impact on the environment. 

In FY2019, Perennial recorded a total water 

consumption of 508,261 m3 across Singapore 

and China assets. In Singapore, Perennial’s 

water consumption in FY2019 recorded an 

overall 17% increase from FY2018. This was 

attributed to an incident at Capitol Theatre 

where a fire alarm panel was triggered, 

activating the deluge system, causing water to 

flow out from the fire sprinklers. Upon further 

investigation, there was no fire detected on 

the premises. To prevent reoccurrence, the 

Operations Team will arrange regular facility 

maintenance works and enhance security 

patrol in public areas of Capitol Singapore. 

Perennial continues to align itself with 

Singapore’s movement towards being self-

reliant where NEWater is targeted to meet 

up to 55% of total water demand by 2060. 

In FY2019, 49% of Perennial’s water use 

in Singapore came from NEWater, a 10% 

increase from 172,606 m3 in FY2018. 

Moving forward, Perennial will continue to 

explore water saving initiatives to reduce 

usage as well as to educate stakeholders 

across all assets on the importance of  

water conservation.

Figure 7: Water Consumption in Singapore and China7

Figure 8: Breakdown of Water Consumption in Singapore

7 FY2018 water consumption data was restated, as an estimated figure was used for December 2018. The actual consumption was only available in FY2019, hence actual consumption 

has been reflected this year.

SOCIAL

Customer Satisfaction

Perennial remains dedicated to deliver a good 

customer service experience to its end-users 

(tenants, shoppers, residents and customers). 

The CMT located at each property comprising 

operations, marketing communications and 

leasing departments liaises and regularly 

engages with tenants while working in 

tandem with headquarters (“HQ”) to provide 

resources and tailored offerings for all  

end-users. The respective teams on site 

conduct daily walkabouts, checking on overall 

ambience, experience and interact with the 

various stakeholders.

At Fengxian, the Residents Democratic 

Management Committee’s staff members 

interact with the residents on a daily basis 

to understand their concerns, which allows 

Perennial to better meet their needs.

Asset Enhancement Initiatives 

Over the years, Perennial strives to be at the 

forefront of delivering a quality experience 

for its customers. Through numerous AEIs 

implemented, shoppers are now able to enjoy 

a wider range of amenities and retail options all 

within a more holistic environment. 

 

 How does Perennial Manage this?

• Tenant Liaison Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) are in place which guide 

Perennial on management of tenants for better Customer Satisfaction

 

Who at Perennial Oversees this?

• Perennial Corporate Office located at HQ

• CMT located at respective property

• Residents Democratic Management Committee at Fengxian

 

 Highlights of FY2019

• AEIs conducted to enhance customer experience across Perennial’s properties

• Training provided to concierge officers to improve customer service quality

• Regular engagement with tenants, shoppers, residents and customers to gather feedback 

on satisfaction levels

In FY2019, Perennial introduced several 

amenities such as addition of nursing 

rooms (111 Somerset) and wheelchair 

lifts (Chinatown Point) to provide greater 

convenience 

and 

accessibility. 

The 

installation of turnstiles with a lift destination 

control system at AXA Tower has provided 

even greater access control security to 

tenants and visitors with a reduction in 

waiting time.

Perennial advocates for a productive 

and healthy work environment across its 

commercial assets. In response to the 

Government’s call, End-of-Trip (“EOT”) 

facilities were introduced at AXA Tower and 

111 Somerset. Bicycle lots, lockers, shower 

rooms and toilets were installed to provide 

greater convenience for tenants and visitors 

who cycle to work. Rolled out in April 2019, 

these facilities have been welcomed by 

the tenants, shoppers and visitors. EOT 

facilities 

also 

demonstrate 

Perennial’s 

continued support for the environment 

by encouraging the use of non-motorised 

transport options, further reducing overall 

carbon footprint.

Supplier Management

While majority of Perennial’s operations are carried out by its employees, the supply chain is made up of suppliers which provide services such as 

cleaning and security works. As Perennial upholds its commitment to sustainability, it sets a similar expectation for its supply chain as well. Through 

a rigorous four-step approach, Perennial screens potential suppliers and vendors based on requirements specific to each project. For major projects 

such as AEIs, Perennial practises the approach illustrated below.

Figure 9: Perennial’s Supplier Management Process

1. PRE-QUALIFICATION

Perennial has in place an internal vendors’ assessment for all suppliers. 

New suppliers must present relevant financial statements, track records and ISO certifications. They must also meet respective guidelines 

such as:

(i) Police Licensing and Regulatory Department minimum B grade (for security suppliers)

(ii) Building &amp; Construction Authority and ISO certification (for builders and electrical vendors)

Current suppliers have to pass Perennial’s internal vendors’ assessment (minimum average grading).

2.  TENDER CALLING

Potential suppliers will undergo a second screening for projects which require tender calling.

For projects that require the calling of tender, potential suppliers will undergo two screenings. Should there be any deviation from the  

Pre-Qualification list, senior management’s approval would be sought.

Operations Team will determine the required scope of work and evaluate suppliers based on price and quality of materials used. Vendors are 

required to meet specified requirements set out in the tender document to ensure the quality of their goods and services.

For example, security officers will have to possess the Workforce Skills Qualifications (“WSQ”) Certificate in Security Operations, have relevant 

working experience and be physically fit. Cleaning service contractors should also be certified by WSQ/National Skills Recognition System 

(“NSRS”) or at minimum possess a Cleaning Business License from National Environmental Agency (“NEA”).

3. EXECUTION

All suppliers and vendors are mandated to comply with relevant laws and regulations in their countries of operations (e.g. Employment Act and 

WSH Act in Singapore and Law of People’s Republic of China on Work Safety in China). 

Suppliers are also required to ensure that service staff hired have received relevant service delivery training, in order to ensure that these staff 

possess a positive working attitude.

4. REVIEW

Supplier performance is closely monitored via activities carried out during the course of work. such as:

(i) Site inspection – To certify that work is carried out in a manner that safeguards workers’ health and safety.

(ii) Proper handover – Work carried out by contractors should be endorsed through proper handover documentation featuring sign-off from 

all parties.

(iii) Internal audit – Internal audit team will work together with independent external consultants to audit operational processes to ensure that 

standards are met.

(iv) Regular engagement – Regular meetings are held with suppliers and contractors for updates on projects and construction works.

Campaigns for Tenants and Visitors

Throughout the year, tenants were invited to 

participate in monthly advertising and promotion 

(“A&amp;P”) campaigns. Working closely with 

the participating tenants, exclusive food and 

shopping discounts were offered to shoppers 

as well, generating good press publicity and 

tenants in turn enjoy greater exposure. 

These campaigns have generated greater 

footfall for the malls and overall sales. Kids 

Fest held at 111 Somerset in October 2019 

saw a series of activities catered for children, 

ranging from roving magician to balloon art 

sculpture. It witnessed an increase in traffic 

by 9.7% compared with the previous week. 

In December 2019, Capitol Singapore held its 

first Christmas event with the transformation 

of the Outdoor Plaza into a European-inspired 

Capitol Kempinski Christmas Market. The 

three-week long market featured over 50 

festive booths selling Christmas goodies like 

panettone, log cakes, chilled mulled wine and 

many more. The event attracted over 876,000 

members of the public. 

 

In China, a series of sustainability-related 

events ranging from personal wellbeing, 

health talks to safety awareness were held 

throughout the year. Through a collaboration 

with the gym located within Perennial 

Jihua Mall, fitness activities were launched, 

encouraging shoppers to adopt an active 

lifestyle. Complimentary classes such as 

The Spirit of Giving

Aside to working with tenants, Singapore 

retail properties are equipped with facilities 

that cater to large-scale events and 

symposiums. In FY2019, Perennial offered 

over S$1 million in venue sponsorships 

for 

numerous 

events 

dedicated 

to 

its beneficiaries, some of which are 

showcased below: 

 

On 16 August 2019, Perennial welcomed 

over 

60 

volunteers 

from 

Voices 

of 

Singapore, Dementia Prevention Choral 

Group and Lions Befrienders for a delightful 

session 

of 

‘SingWithJoy@CHIJMES’. 

This event was one of the first of its kind 

which showcases Perennial’s efforts in 

raising awareness on dementia among 

the aged community. These regular choir 

practices function as exercises for the 

brain by stimulating and improving memory, 

which has been shown to delay onset  

of dementia. 

On 6 December 2019, The Perennial and 

The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore 

Charity Night was held and saw a 

night of triple celebrations as Perennial 

celebrated its 10th anniversary, as well as 

commemorated the 1st anniversary of The 

Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore and the 

115th anniversary of Stamford House with 

a charity dinner at Capitol Theatre graced 

by Minister for Education, Mr Ong Ye Kung,  

as Guest-of-Honour.

The Charity Night raised S$255,000 for 

beneficiaries of the Community Chest. 

Separately, 

Perennial 

also 

donated 

S$100,000 to the Straits Times School 

Pocket 

Money 

Fund 

(“STSPMF”).  

A charity silent auction was also held with 

full proceeds donated equally towards the 

Community Chest and STSPMF.

The night’s celebrations kicked off with 

the lighting up of the Capitol • Kempinski 

Supplier performance will be closely monitored 

based on the activities carried out during the 

course of work. This includes site inspection, 

proper handover, internal audits and regular 

engagements.

All suppliers and vendors are mandated to comply 

with relevant laws and regulations in their countries 

of operations (e.g. Employment Act and Workplace 

Safety and Health (“WSH”) Act in Singapore and 

Law of People’s Republic of China on Work Safety 

in China). They will also be accountable for ensuring 

their employees receive relevant training for the 

required works.

Perennial has in place an internal vendors’ 

assessment for all suppliers. Only pre-qualified 

ones will be invited for tender of which they 

will be required to prepare relevant financial 

statements, track records, ISO certifications and 

meet respective guidelines (applicable for security 

suppliers, builders and electrical vendors).

Potential suppliers will undergo a second screening 

for projects which require tender calling. Inputs 

will be sought from Operations Team on the 

required works to evaluate suppliers based on 

price and quality of materials used. Vendors will 

have specified requirements set out in the tender 

document upon awarding of contract.

Regular Engagement and Feedback

Stakeholders’ 

feedback 

is 

of 

utmost 

importance as it has a large impact on the 

marketing and business opportunities for 

the malls. While the feedback highlights 

potential areas for improvement, it also 

showcases 

the 

areas 

which 

Perennial 

has done well in. Through these regular 

interactions, the Company would be able to 

allocate the appropriate resources to address 

the stakeholders’ concerns. Feedback is 

gathered through various channels – mainly 

from daily walkabouts and survey forms to 

evaluate the effectiveness of each campaign. 

The Marketing and Communications team 

continues to support tenants on their 

advertising needs to boost sales and traffic. 

In FY2019, Perennial held over 150 A&amp;P 

campaigns and events, which were well 

received by both tenants and shoppers. 

Shoppers can provide feedback on their 

shopping experience at Perennial’s malls 

through the Concierge or an electronic form 

available on the respective mall’s website. 

All suggestions and opinions would be 

acknowledged by the Customer Service 

Team and escalated to the CMT should 

further actions be required. During the year, 

training programmes were also rolled out for 

mall technicians to improve their equipment 

knowledge to better serve the tenants. All 

concierge staff and technicians will be enrolled 

in customer and service training courses in 

FY2020.

Perennial aims to provide quality and 

efficient customer service to all. A dedicated 

team of Customer Service Assistants 

(“CSAs”) located at each mall are guided 

by the CSA Service Standard which sets 

out procedures on reacting and responding 

to customers in a professional manner.

CSAs provide a variety of services ranging 

from general services such as Lost &amp; Found 

and tenants’ promotions to incident and 

feedback reporting across all Perennial 

-owned 

and/or 

managed 

properties. 

Additionally, they also oversee operational 

aspects of the mall such as daily operating 

routines from before the start of the malls’ 

operations to after the malls’ closing.

Customers are also encouraged to leave 

their feedback regarding products, service 

quality, and the property’s facilities, security 

and cleanliness. When feedback is received, 

an acknowledgement message will be sent 

to the customer. All unsatisfactory feedback 

will be addressed by the Management 

team within 24 hours. Should the feedback 

involve tenants, the CSA will reach out to 

them for follow-up actions. A copy of the 

resolution document will be issued to the 

CASE STUDY: Customer Service Assistants across Malls

customer upon the closure and recorded 

within the system. All incident reports 

received will be reviewed for continuous 

improvement. These records may also be 

incorporated into customer quality trainings 

for future CSAs. 

This year, a customer satisfaction survey 

was 

conducted 

at 

Perennial 

Jihua 

Mall aimed to understand customers’ 

preference to promotions as well as areas 

for improvement. Over 600 responses 

were received with more than 50% of the 

respondents requesting for more dining 

options, of which 40% suggested hotpot 

restaurants. Since then, the feedback has 

been taken into consideration and Perennial 

Jihua Mall looks to explore these options.

Prioritising Patients in Eldercare

Perennial recognises the significant potential 

in China’s healthcare industry as demand for 

medical services and quality integrated elderly 

care is set to expand substantially amidst a 

rapidly ageing population. Perennial’s constant 

engagement with industry-relevant players in 

the market via partnerships and joint ventures 

continues to drive the implementation of its 

integrated real estate and healthcare model. 

Its healthcare business focuses on two core 

segments, namely Hospitals and Medical 

Centres, and Eldercare and Senior Housing. 

Under Renshoutang’s portfolio, Fengxian is 

the first eldercare home that has embarked 

on its sustainability reporting journey. It strives 

to provide a therapeutic environment for its 

residents through various eldercare facilities 

including a clinic, a library, and activity rooms 

which allow numerous social activities such 

as chess, painting and music appreciation. 

Holistic services ranging from daily nursing care 

to specific dementia care are also provided on 

site. Fengxian aims to deliver the best of both 

medical treatment and nursing services to its 

residents. Feedback is regularly gathered from 

residents to understand satisfaction levels and 

identify areas for enhancements.

 

 How does Perennial Manage this?

• Workplace Health, Safety and Security Policy (“HSS Policy”) for properties in Singapore

• SOPs on Work Safety and Production for properties in China

• Work Safety Guidelines in Fengxian

 

Who at Perennial Oversees this?

• Perennial Corporate Office Safety Team

• CMT located at each property in Singapore and China

• Safety Officers at Fengxian

 

 Highlights of FY2019

• Annual fire drills held across Singapore and China properties 

• Attained yearly recertification for Fire Safety Managers across all Singapore assets

• Fire safety awareness course held annually for residents at Fengxian

Health and Safety of Stakeholders

Maintaining a Safe Environment for All

Each day, thousands of stakeholders spend 

long hours at or pass through Perennial’s 

premises. Safeguarding their health and safety 

is important and considered an integral part of 

Perennial’s business. While the Group strives 

to provide a dynamic and holistic experience 

for stakeholders, pertinent steps are taken 

on the prompt identification, resolution and 

mitigation of health and safety risks. 

Since FY2015, Health, Security and Safety Risk 

has been considered as part of the Group’s 

Enterprise Risk Management Framework. 

Together with the other sustainability risks, 

it is reviewed annually to ensure appropriate 

actions are taken to mitigate associated 

impacts. 

The 

HSS 

Policy 

guides 

employees 

in 

conducting risk assessments (“RAs”) and 

incorporating several safety measures to 

safeguard lives of its stakeholders. Likewise, 

this policy also extends to Perennial’s tenants, 

shoppers and contractors. Cascading these 

stringent guidelines down its supply chain, 

Perennial only hires qualified contractors with 

a proven track record and relevant health, 

safety and environmental certifications such 

as bizSAFE (Level 3 and above), ISO 45001, 

OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001. 

All selected contractors will have to submit a 

series of safety document comprising RAs, 

safe work procedures (“SWPs”) and other 

relevant information to the Operations Team at 

the CMT for review. Prior to commencement 

of high-risk Mechanical &amp; Electrical and AEI 

works, a permit-to-work has to be obtained by 

the team before they can enter the work site. 

During the course of the works, contractors 

will have to arrange for qualified personnel 

such as a WSH coordinator and officers to be 

on site and attend site coordination meetings. 

Perennial monitors WSH performance of 

contractors for the entire duration of project 

as well. Sufficient safety hoardings are put 

up to prevent trespassing, and ample lighting 

installed to caution stakeholders from the 

dangers within the site.

In China, the SOPs on Work Safety 

and 

Production 

also 

include 

guidelines 

for stakeholders, with an emphasis on 

emergency response. Similar to the set of 

Crisis Management Standard Procedures8 

for Singapore assets, guidelines on handling 

situations such as electrical failure and gas 

leakage, as well as breakdown of lifts and 

elevators at malls have been established as 

well. Responsibilities of the relevant personnel 

and course of action to be taken are detailed 

within the guidelines, ensuring that employees 

are familiar during times of emergencies. 

All stakeholders are encouraged to promptly 

report any potential hazards or safety 

incidents to their immediate liaison or to 

the Customer Service Counters. Following 

which, the relevant department would step 

in and conduct further investigation where 

necessary.

Safeguarding Lives of the Elderly 

With close to 700 residents under Fengxian’s 

care, their safety and wellbeing are of 

utmost importance. Focusing on its core 

as a quality provider of elderly rehabilitative 

care, it is equipped with state-of-the-art 

health screening machines, supported by an 

experienced and professional medical team 

specialising in geriatric, rehabilitation medicine, 

nutrition and other relevant fields. Aside 

from providing quality homes and facilities, 

various landscaping features have also been 

considered and incorporated into its overall 

design. This brings the best of both facilities 

as well as a natural environment for all.

Aside to the provision of quality facilities and 

amenities, comprehensive SOPs on health, 

safety and wellbeing have been established. 

Overnight patrols and curfews are strictly 

enforced to ensure accountability and safety 

of the elderly residents. Also, in addition 

to the daily safety inspections conducted 

by respective Safety Personnel and Safety 

Officers, guidelines are in place to prioritise 

residents’ safety in the event of emergencies 

such as:

• Outbreak of diseases

• Injuries such as slip, trips and falls, burns 

and abrasions 

• Fire and other related accidents 

• Missing residents 

All medical staff are required to familiarise 

themselves with the follow-up actions for 

all of these situations. Throughout the year, 

table-top exercises and real-life simulation 

were conducted to test for responsiveness. 

Results from these exercises would be 

recorded. Existing SOPs may be reviewed to 

increase robustness.  

Throughout the premises, safety posters and 

evacuation response plans are displayed to 

remind residents of the actions to be taken 

in times of emergencies. Each year, a fire 

safety awareness course is conducted for  

all residents.

Providing a Holistic and Engaging Environment for Residents at Fengxian

The atrium garden and rooftop garden located within the building provides the residents access to the outdoors well within Fengxian’s safe 

and secure premises. Residents can also enjoy a myriad of activities ranging from calligraphy, board games to folding origami aimed at

Occupational Health and Safety

The provision of a safe and healthy workplace 

is key towards building a high-performing 

workforce. Across Singapore and China, 

policies and SOPs have been established to 

ensure operations remain in full compliance 

with 

all 

applicable 

legal 

requirements, 

standards and code of practices. 

Safe, Secure &amp; Well at Perennial

The HSS Policy guides both the Safety 

Team at Perennial HQ and respective CMTs 

located at each property on the processes 

towards achieving positive health and safety 

performance across its Singapore properties. 

This is done through holding regular fire drills 

and conducting safety trainings to ensure 

the well-being of employees during the 

course of work. 

Perennial is currently on track to achieve 

bizSAFE Level 3 certification for all CMTs in 

Singapore by FY2020, with CHIJMES being 

the first property to achieve this certification 

in FY2019. 

 

 How does Perennial Manage this?

• Workplace HSS Policy for properties in Singapore 

• SOPs on Work Safety and Production in China

• Work Safety Guidelines in Fengxian

 

Who at Perennial Oversees this?

• Perennial Corporate Office Safety Team

• CMT located at each property in Singapore and China 

• Safety Officer supported by respective Safety Personnel from various departments  

in Fengxian

 

 Highlights of FY2019

• Annual fire drills held across Singapore and China properties 

• Obtained bizSAFE Level 3 certification for CHIJMES 

• Work Safety Standardisation Certificate (Level 3) for Perennial Qingyang Mall and Perennial 

Jihua Mall 

In the event of emergencies such as fire, terrorist activities amongst other safety incidents, an Emergency Response workflow would be 

activated. It guides various functions on the necessary procedures during and after the emergency.

As Perennial continues to roll out bizSAFE 

Level 3 certification across other properties 

in Singapore, existing SOPs have been 

established covering areas of RA, SWP, and 

SGSecure knowledge. The Safety Team, 

with the help of Human Resources (“HR”) 

division would ensure the communication to 

employees across Perennial. During the year, 

should there be any major changes to the 

work activities, the Safety Team would review 

the existing risk register to update the SOPs 

and guidelines accordingly. In FY2019, the 

HSS policy and relevant SOPs were reviewed 

and validated for its continued relevance. 

All the executive officers, operations officers 

and technicians are required to be briefed on 

safety knowledge by respective supervisors 

before commencing with high-risk activities 

such as working at height. Based on the types 

of work to be carried out from daily checks 

on operations to regular maintenance work, 

appropriate personal protective equipment 

such as helmets, safety shoes would have 

to be worn by employees, depending on 

the severity of hazards. Additionally, first aid 

boxes are also easily accessible and placed 

strategically on site. 

For properties in China, relevant SOPs 

have been established in accordance to 

local regulations. In FY2019, both Perennial 

Qingyang Mall and Perennial Jihua Mall 

have attained Work Safety Standardisation 

Certificate (Level 3). They will work towards 

maintaining the validity of this certificate 

through regular review of SOPs by the safety 

engineers. These SOPs are made available

to employees in a handy guidebook which 

comprise, but are not limited to, guidelines 

on RA, SWP, emergency response plans 

and incident reporting channels. A reporting 

channel has also been designed to protect 

female employees. Annually, both malls 

conduct mandatory fire drills as stipulated 

by the national laws. These fire drills may 

involve tenants, shoppers and members of 

the public. While these fire drills function as a 

practice for the Fire Safety Team to improve 

responsiveness, they also enhance the 

employees’ awareness of the SOPs during 

emergencies.

Inculcating a Safe Work Culture  

at Fengxian 

Fengxian strives to be a one-stop centre where 

quality eldercare services are provided for all. 

Focusing on rehabilitative care, it also strives 

to deliver holistic care to all residents. The 

Work Safety Guidelines is a comprehensive 

set of SOPs prepared in accordance with 

national laws and regulations to ensure that all 

eldercare workers are well aware of the risks 

involved and mitigative actions, and that they 

receive adequate training to carry out their 

daily responsibilities. 

The SOPs define roles and responsibilities of 

various functions on operations management 

and crisis management. Specifically, it requires 

each department to appoint a Safety Personnel 

who will be responsible for daily walkabouts. 

The Safety Personnel will focus on identifying 

hazards and rectifying any safety-related 

issues within the premises. Thereafter, the 

Safety Officer would cross check on the daily 

findings. Every month, the Safety Officer chairs 

a Safety Review Meeting where all Safety 

Personnel will come together to review salient 

health and safety issues identified and share 

good practices.

To inculcate a safety-first culture among its 

medical staff, all new hires are required to 

undergo a compulsory induction training, 

comprising of a safety module where they will 

learn about safe working practices, measures 

to be taken during daily operations or in times 

of emergency. 

Performance

In FY2019, Perennial recorded zero fatalities 

and occupational diseases across its real 

estate and eldercare operations in Singapore 

and China. However, there was one work-

related incident where an employee sustained 

a minor injury while moving furniture due 

to inadequate lighting. Since the incident, 

corrective actions were taken to ensure 

sufficient lighting and care is provided for 

future work. 

Perennial strives to improve the safety 

culture within its properties through regular 

reviews of policies and work procedures. 

Plans are in the pipeline for properties in 

China to increase robustness of safety 

inspections and the frequency of facility and 

equipment maintenance. Moreover, regular 

communication between Management and 

employees also helps to raise awareness and 

emphasise the importance of a safety-first 

culture throughout Perennial. 

Profile of Our Workforce

Employees are the core of a successful 

business. Likewise, at Perennial, the Company 

values each and every individual, providing 

them with a conducive work environment 

where equal opportunities, fair compensation

GOVERNANCE

Perennial is committed to maintaining the 

highest standards of corporate governance 

and transparency in its business operations. 

This is underpinned by three interlinked 

aspects, namely business ethics, corporate 

governance and regulatory compliance. 

Business Ethics

Ethical business conduct is guided by a suite 

of policies and procedures comprising of the 

Employee Code of Conduct, Whistleblowing 

Policy and Grievance Handling Procedures 

which advises employees on responsible 

decision making. Additionally, a Grievance 

Handling Procedure informs employees on 

the actions to be taken when reporting any 

suspected wrongful activities within the Group. 

Annually, this set of policies and documents 

would be circulated to Management and 

employees of Perennial. While it serves as 

a refresher on the expected conduct, it also 

emphasises on the severity should they be 

found to be in violations of these policies. 

The Whistleblowing Policy comes under the 

purview of the ARC. All stakeholders including 

employees and third-party service providers, 

partners and strategic alliances have full 

access to it and are encouraged to report any 

possible concerns on malpractices. Identities 

of 

whistleblowers 

would 

be 

protected 

throughout any length of investigation. For 

more details of this Policy, please refer to 

http://perennialrealestate.listedcompany.com/

misc/whistle-blowing-policy.pdf.

In FY2019, Perennial is pleased to report 

that there were no reported cases of fraud, 

corruption and unethical actions. 

Corporate Governance

A strong culture of CG is key to economic 

growth as it improves investors’ confidence 

and reputation through the robust internal 

controls 

in 

place. 

Since 

incorporation, 

Perennial has emphasised on the importance 

of good CG through the annual CG report 

and review of internal policies and guidelines. 

More details on Perennial’s CG practices 

can be found on pages 97 to 115 of the CG 

section of AR2019.

Under the CG framework, a comprehensive 

ERM framework has been put in place 

to ensure risks arising from Perennial’s 

business 

activities 

are 

monitored 

and 

managed. Sustainability risks have been 

considered within this Framework which has 

strengthened the Group’s understanding of 

its full suite of risks, ultimately improving its 

sustainability management. Due to the rapidly 

changing business environment, the Risk 

Management Team reviews associated risks 

on an annual basis and works with relevant 

departments to implement mitigative actions. 

For more details on Perennial’s key risks, 

please refer to pages 116 to 121 of the Risk 

Management section of AR2019. 

In 

FY2019, 

several 

Management 

and 

Executive employees were also sent on 

relevant courses conducted to remain 

relevant with latest requirements in CG and 

related matters. Perennial is a signatory of 

the SIAS CG Statement of Support for the  

6th consecutive year. 

In the year, Perennial also achieved full 

compliance with the Code of CG 2018 and 

continues to prepare its CG Report in a timely 

manner within the Annual Report. 

Compliance with Laws  

and Regulations

Ensuring regulatory compliance across all 

business activities is critical in maintaining 

Perennial’s license to operate. With a diverse 

business portfolio spanning across numerous 

cities, it is imperative to consider the local 

regulations in areas of environment, labour 

practices and health and safety. Instances of

 Relevant UN SDG

non-compliance may bring about detrimental 

impact to reputation, incur penalties and 

hinder growth plans. As such, Perennial has 

in place a robust compliance framework 

which ensures regulatory obligations are  

met sufficiently. 

Perennial believes it is a shared responsibility 

that lies among the various functions as they 

interact with respective regulatory bodies 

as shown in Table 5. The various business 

functions ensure they remain well informed of 

any changes and make necessary updates 

to existing processes so as to remain within 

regulatory boundaries. This is done through 

regular participation in compliance trainings 

and seminars conducted by various regulatory 

institutions. Additionally, Perennial’s Legal 

department should also be consulted if 

departments 

require 

further 

assistance  

or advice. 

Under the oversight of the Risk Management 

Team, a quarterly reporting on incidences 

of 

non-compliance 

or 

regulatory 

and 

reputational impacts is submitted to the 

Board. In FY2019, Perennial has achieved 

its target of zero cases of non-compliance 

and will continue to upkeep this positive 

performance.
