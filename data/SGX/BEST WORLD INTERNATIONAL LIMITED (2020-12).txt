Board Statement

At Best World International Limited

(the  “Company”  or  Best  World”),  The  Board  

of Directors (the “Board”) believes that to fulfil 

our commitment to provide our stakeholders 

with long term value, sustainability needs 

to be ingrained in our business model. Since 

inception, Best World has always focused on our 

products, our customers and our people, while 

practicing good strong corporate governance and 

minimizing our impact on the environment.

The Board’s primary focus with respect to 

Sustainability Reporting are:

a. Considering sustainability issues including 

 

environmental and social factors in the  

 

 

formulation of the Group’s strategies;

b.  Overseeing the identification, monitoring and  

 

management of key Environmental, Social and  

 

Governance (“ESG”) topics; and

c.  Determining the Company’s values and  

 

 

standards including ethical standards

The Board will continue to work with the 

management to implement, monitor and report 

on our sustainability efforts for the long-term 

success of the Group. As we continue to build 

on our sustainability efforts, we look forward to 

establishing stronger ties with our stakeholders 

and growing along with our community at large.

Best World International Limited is 

pleased to present our fourth Sustainability 

Report.

The year of 2020 was truly unchartered waters, 

fraught with uncertainties due to the COVID-19 

outbreak. As it is with the circumstances, we 

had more efforts on the social aspect of ESG 

this year. The report continues to be based on 

the existing scope, comprising Singapore and 

Taiwan operations including activities relating 

to our Tuas manufacturing facilities. We will 

work towards expanding the reporting scope to 

include more entities of the Group in future.

This report covers the Financial Year 2020 

(“FY2020”) from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 

2020, with Financial Year 2019 (“FY2019”) from 1 

January 2019 to 31 December 2019 as the year of 

comparison.

Our report has been drafted in accordance with 

the internationally recognised framework, Global 

Reporting Initiatives (‘GRI’) Standards - Core 

option, and the Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited (‘SGX-ST’) Mainboard Listing Rule 

711(B).

No external assurance was sought for this report. 

We will consider doing so for future reports.

Moving forward, Best World shall continue to 

strengthen our sustainability efforts and report 

on the related non-financial metrics annually.

Materiality Assessment

Our initial assessment of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters was done in FY2017. 

Back in 2017, we engaged an independent sustainability consultant and initiated a formal materiality 

assessment process to identify the ESG matters that greatly affect our business and stakeholders. 

Both internal and external stakeholders were taken into consideration for the assessment. With the 

contributions from different representatives from relevant departments, we adopted a four-step 

materiality assessment process summarised in Figure 1 below:

We intend to revisit our assessment after our manufacturing facilities are completed, which will likely add 

on to our material factors in areas such as energy consumption and water usage.

Best World’s Materiality Index







STEP 1 - Identification and Selection

A preliminary list of ESG matters were 

identified and selected after conducting a 

desktop analysis of Sustainability Reports 

published by leading industry players 

and interviews with key personnel across 

departments.

 

STEP 2 - Prioritisation

The identified and selected ESG matters 

were rated and prioritised through 

an anonymous voting exercise by 

the representatives from the various 

departments, taking into consideration the 

perspective of both internal and external 

stakeholders.

STEP 3 - Validation

Material matters that were identified and 

selected in Step 2 were presented to the 

Board for validation and approval.

STEP 4 - Review

Material matters that were approved by 

the Board will continue to be reassessed 

in subsequent reporting periods to ensure 

that reported topics remain relevant and 

material.

Sustainability Governance



Conflict of Interest Policy 

 

 

Framework to guide employees on the measures 

to take to prevent conflicts of interest as well as 

action steps to take in the event a conflict arises.

Whistle-Blowing Policy

Provides details on the whistleblowing, a 

communication for employees to anonymously 

report suspected wrongful activities within 

the organisation to ensure an honest and 

transparent business conduct at Best World.

Gift and Entertainment Policy

Guidelines for employees on the proper 

procedures to process the gifts and 

entertainment from external parties to uphold 

business integrity.

Code of Ethical Conduct

The code that states the organisation’s 

responsibility towards employees, consumers, 

shareholders, suppliers and regulators.

All employees are trained on our corporate policies, anti-corruption policies and procedures during our 

mandatory new employee orientation programme. Our suppliers are also required to make an annual 

declaration that they have no conflict of interest before they will be engaged by our Logistics and 

Procurement team.

In FY2020, no cases of corruption were reported.

Business Ethics

At Best World, we are dedicated to operating our business in an honest and transparent manner. During 

the process of expanding into rapid-growth markets, where the operations are dependent on its local 

businesses and suppliers, there is a greater risk of exposure to corruption. Our group has adopted a 

zero-tolerance approach towards all corruption practices and have strived to embed a culture of anti-

corruption in all aspects of our operations. Our anti-corruption policies and reporting channels are 

available online to enhance communication to our stakeholders and act as a deterrence to corruption.

Components of 

Our Anti-Corruption Framework

Communicating Key 

Business Ethics Effectively

To promote understanding of key 

ethical business practices such 

as consumer rights, distributor’s 

responsibilities and obligations and 

the Company’s intellectual property 

rights, our Taiwan office rolled out a 

series of short comics on these topics 

to educate distributors. Refer to the 

link below for more information.



Perpetual Target

Keeping Guidance Handy 

In 2020, we developed a corporate governance 

handbook for the company. The handbook 

incorporated key tenets of good corporate 

governance to guide management and key 

personel and at the same time, highlight the 

Board’s perspective and areas of emphasis. 

Subjects covered include duties owed by 

directors, directors’ disclosure of interests, and 

the identification of conflicts of interests and 

guidelines on how to handle them. The handbook 

also took into account and incorporated the 

company’s existing policies, such as the Anti-

Corruption policy, Code of Ethical Conduct, 

Whistle Blowing, diversity, dividend and investor 

relations policies.

Responsible Business Practices

Consumers are at the heart of our business. 

Best World’s continued success depends on the 

trust and confidence that consumers place in 

our distributors and conforming to respective 

countries’ consumer legislation. We are also 

committed to the Code of Ethics and Conduct set 

out by the Direct Selling Association of Singapore 

(DSAS).

DSAS Code of Ethics and Conduct sets forth the 

basic fair and ethical principles and practices to 

which Members shall be required to adhere in 

the conduct of their business, which includes the 

following amongst others

• Obligations of the member

• Prohibited practices that no direct seller 

 

should engage in

• Accurate explanation of products or services

• Honouring customer order cancellation rights, 

 

the 7-Day “Cooling-off period”

• Respecting customer privacy

• Proper handling of customer complaints

Our Taiwan BWL subsidiary is also a member 

of the Taiwan R.O.C Direct Selling Association. 

The association was formally established on 

December 12, 1990, becoming Taiwan’s first direct 

selling industry charity organization.

The role and function of Taiwan R.O.C. Direct 

Selling Association is to act as a communication

Employees and Distributors Training

and Advancement

As a leading health and wellness company 

with a global presence, continuous learning is 

fundamental to the growth of our company. We 

recognize that training is an integral part of our 

business as it equips our employees with the 

necessary skills and enhances their ability to carry 

out their roles and responsibilities. In compliance 

with ISO9001: 2015 Quality Management System 

requirements, we have developed procedures to 

ensure quality assurance across our processes; 

we provide regular trainings related to these 

procedures to all, including distributors who 

market our products. 

The pandemic sent most mass activities online. 

After it became clear that the virus situation will 

take a long period to bring under control, HQ led 

the charge to curate a series of online training 

programs that can be deployed over zoom. These 

training programs covered a variety of topics, 

from product introduction, usage and its efficacy 

for the regular user to topics that hand hold 

distributors on selling techniques to build up a 

source of passive income. Our next step will be 

to dub these programs in a number of languages 

and put them up on our bwl app so that they are

Under the guidance of the respective

a minimum average of 16 hours of training per 

employee annually. 

The average training hours per employee 

in FY2020 was 11.3 hours. The drop was 

mainly due to less training hours achieved by 

employees in Singapore as traditional training 

classes were no longer conducted in response 

to pandemic control measures. Many trainings 

were either postponed or cancelled as the 

effectiveness of virtual trainings were uncertain 

at that time. On the other hand, Taiwan was not 

as impacted by the pandemic and were able 

to carry on with their normal activities. We will 

continue to strive towards providing all our 

employees with ample training opportunities 

to develop their capabilities and skillsets in the 

years ahead.

Our Products



Intellectual Property Protection and Counterfeit Products

Every year, we invest a considerable amount of resources to develop new and innovative premium 

products for our customers. Intellectual property (IP) protection, hence, is critical to us as it safeguards our 

investments and allows us to reap its full benefits.

We begin to manage and protect our IP before we launch the product to the market we operate in.

Intellectual Property Management System

Customers from all the markets that we operate in recognize our product brands as our unique identity 

and marks of premium quality. The protection of these intangible assets is one of the key elements of our 

business strategy.

We protect our brands through trademarks and

trade secrets. Our Intellectual Property Division 

(IP Division) focuses on establishing new brands 

and logos through trademarks registration and 

maintain registered marks from time to time to 

ensure that all logos and brands are properly 

protected.

Our logos and brands are widespread and well 

protected in many different jurisdictions. Till date, 

our IP Division has successfully registered more 

than 500 marks across the globe and including 

Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, 

Thailand, UAE, Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar,

Counsel Association (SCCA), International   

Association for the a (AIPPI) and International

Infringement and Counterfeit 

Management

Best World takes a strict approach in handling 

counterfeit goods and infringement matters.

In 2019, we strengthened our enforcement 

capabilities, establishing a worldwide watch 

notice on trademarks applications. This would 

ensure that identical or similar trademarks being 

registered will be quickly brought to our attention 

for our necessary action. We also enhanced our 

reporting channel, enabling suspected cases of 

infringement or counterfeit items to be directly 

reported to our HQ legal team, in a format that 

captures information essential for enforcement.

In essence, all major infringement matters 

will be handled directly by our IP Division. Our 

Legal Counsels work closely with relevant local 

authorities and the police to enforce raids against 

the infringers and also file infringement suits 

against them.

Responsible Labelling / Advertising

Lapses in labelling and advertising can affect not 

just our brands and reputation as an organization 

but potentially cause harm to our consumers as 

well. We care deeply about the people we serve. 

We recognize the consequences of mislabeling 

and false advertising of our products. The lack of 

transparency in reporting all product ingredients 

used or the effects it may cause prevents 

consumers from making an informed decision 

about the product they purchased, which can lead 

to undesirable consequences. By upholding our 

business integrity in marketing of our products, we 

aim to achieve zero cases of non- compliance with 

the Singapore Health Science Authority and Taiwan 

Food and Drug Administration’s labelling and 

product claim requirements. Labels are checked 

against the regional labelling requirements, 

product claim guidelines and code of advertising 

practices to ensure compliance by product 

development management team, content editors 

and regional product registration personnel.

Our brand incorporates regional labelling 

requirements into our products, complying with 

the guidelines of the local regulatory bodies. 

Information on the country of origin, product 

ingredients and directions for use are required to 

be printed on all products. Only products approved 

by these regulatory bodies can be marketed. 

Claim substantiation is also performed to prevent 

mislabeling or false advertising. The recycling 

symbol is included in our product labels for product 

packaging that can be recycled to encourage users 

to dispose them in an environmentally friendly 

manner.

In 2019, we enhanced our artwork management 

process with the addition of artwork code onto 

our product packaging to track printed artwork 

versions. This initiative improved communication 

between stakeholders involved in the transition 

process while ensuring that only the latest, 

approved artworks are being printed, minimizing 

human errors which may result in additional 

printing costs and at the same time supporting 

artwork proofing and regulatory compliance.



Also, we have expanded our QR code printing 

initiative to cover all products in our DR’s Secret 

and Aestier range, allowing users to scan the 

product packaging to determine whether the 

product is authentic.

Our Customers



Consumer Health and Safety

At Best World, we are committed to product 

excellence and strive to ensure regulatory 

compliance for all of our products. Throughout 

the development of our products, from product 

concept design, formulation review, product 

stability and compatibility study, consumer 

product trial and product lab testing, we 

implement stringent quality standards and abide 

by regulations or guidelines enforced by local 

regulatory boards. We collaborate with external 

accredited labs regularly for quality assurance of 

our cosmetic and health supplement products.  

To further monitor the performance of our 

products, we instituted a coherent and systematic 

process for customers to provide feedback on the 

products. Regional centres will receive customer 

feedbacks via digital channels or physically 

and will compile the feedbacks received into 

monthly report for submission to HQ. The Quality 

department at HQ will keep track of incidence rate 

and conduct necessary investigation or corrective 

actions where required.

Under the care of our Product Development team 

and Quality team, we recorded zero reported case 

pertaining to consumer health and safety in 2020. 

We aim to continue to assess health and safety 

impact of all our products.

Collaboration with Industry Professionals

In partnership with SGS Taiwan, Taiwan’s largest 

and most diverse independent quality testing 

facilities. Best World was able to establish our very 

own quality assurance zone on the SGS Taiwan 

Safety Information Platform. Contaminant test 

reports for microbial, heavy metals, western drug 

and cosmetic steroid etc., related to our products 

are uploaded on their website for customers’ 

reference. 

Our DR’s Secret Sunscreen #5 received the coveted 

certification from Taiwan’s Symbol of National 

Quality (SNQ), “2018 SNQ – Symbol of National 

Quality Certification” according to its excellent 

quality among a category of skin care products.

In 2019, our Dr’s Secret Cleanser #1 was awarded 

Fashion Guide Certification after going through 

the Fashion Guide Special Evaluation (FG特优评鉴), 

where our product was tested by a number of FG 

members and reviews in aggregate scored above 

80%. Reviewers loved that the product cleaned 

their faces thoroughly but yet was gentle on their 

skin and maintained their skin’s moisture.

Consumer Satisfaction

Sustaining a viable business cannot be done 

independently. At Best World, we understand 

the importance of customer engagement 

and channel much resources to it. Our latest 

initiative is the establishment of a more extensive 

Global Customer Satisfaction Survey to obtain 

customers’ opinions on their  experience with 

us on multiple touch points, including customer 

service, brand satisfaction and if applicable, 

social media interaction feedback. With a formal 

and systematic survey, we hope to gather 

regular consumer’s opinions and obtain good 

understanding on the degree of customer needs 

and expectations met by the organization to keep 

our service delivery in check and maintain high 

product quality for our customers. In addition, the 

survey is online based, reducing our paper usage 

and geographically reaching out more of the 

markets we operate in.

We managed to obtain 100% satisfaction rate 

(defined as a score of 1 to 2 out of a scale of 1 to 

4), 1 being the best on distributor satisfaction 

survey and member satisfaction surveys for 

the period between January to July of 2020. 

In August, we started a pilot test on the Global 

Customer Satisfaction Survey described above. 

We anticipate that we will be ready to launch 

the survey in 2021 after finalizing coordination 

needed with the departments involved.

We continue to invest in both our online platform 

and physicial stores to ensure our distributors 

have the best support they need to succeed in a 

competitive market.

Our BWL Mobile app complements our physical 

stores, allowing orders to be placed 24/7 and 

products to be delivered to the customer. 

Additionally, our apps also include features such 

as product details, updated promotions and order 

tracking that communicate useful information

FG has been in the beauty and fashion industry 

for more than 20 years. They have cultivated 

many members in their professional evaluation 

team, with the goal of establishing professional, 

objective and real product evaluations. FG has 

become the first choice for users to search for 

information or discuss topics and is deemed to be 

a credible consumer reference in Taiwan, because 

FG emphasizes 100% authenticity and serves as 

a communication bridge between consumers 

and brands from a most impartial third-party 

standpoint.

through Facebook, Instagram and Line also 

effectively connect with the younger generation, 

sharing beauty, health and product knowledge.

Our DRs Secret experience centre at Cuppage 

Singapore was purposefully built so customers 

can learn more about our products and enjoy 

personalised service, customised to their skin 

condition in a comfortable setting. Customer 

touchpoints are enhanced with available 

technologies give a modern experience, aligning to 

multigeneration of consumers’ expectations.

COVID-19 has shown us the importance of 

digitalization and bringing our business online. 

Our early investments on the digital front shined 

brightly during this period and we continued 

to boost our IT capabilities and hire during the 

circuit breaker period. We are grateful for the 

timely government assistance programs that help 

develop staff with industry level training.

Having gained experience and knowledge on how 

users are using our online platforms and mobile 

app, our team launched our revamped online 

store platform and mobile app in July 2020, with a 

new look and a more flexible interface to enhance 

our users’ experience. To complement our efforts 

on curating online training programs, we will be 

upgrading and building a proper studio to enhance 

the quality and audio visual effects of the media 

produced.

Rallying Behind Community Inititatives

One of the hardest hit groups in this pandemic 

was our Migrant Workers. As Singapore 

experienced the first wave of COVID-19 infection 

and the migrant workers became a key cluster of 

massive spread, we donated a total of 3,000 pieces 

of Vitamin C, probiotics and sanitiser products for 

their use. 

Best World was glad and honored to be able 

to participate in an ASME led initiative to raise 

funds to assist our migrant workers. With 

our government matching three dollars for 

every dollar raised, the initiative’s impact was 

substantially magnified. Best World contributed 

S$50,000 to the initiative.

Environmental Initiatives



Waste Disposal Management

Proper waste management is essential for the 

well-being of the environment. As a distributor 

of consumer products, waste in the forms of 

containers and plastics are inevitable in the 

packaging process. We seek to ensure that our 

waste is properly managed and disposed to ensure 

the safety of our community. We are only able to 

provide figures for waste that we engaged waste 

disposal vendors to dispose. We are not equipped 

to measure the weight of waste that is generated 

during our day-to-day activities that are disposed 

via the building’s waste disposal system. The 

waste disposed by the building management 

consist of waste generated by all tenants and a 

split of those figures are unavailable to us.

Singapore

Our Singapore operations are served by National 

Environment Agency registered waste collectors. 





No hazardous waste was disposed for FY2019 and 

FY2020. The increase in non-hazardous waste 

was mainly due to expired products, products 

damaged during shipping and some packing 

materials that were no longer in use being 

disposed in FY2020 compared to the previous 

year.

Taiwan

No hazardous waste was generated by our Taiwan 

operations in FY2019 and FY2020. The decrease 

in non- hazardous waste was due to disposal of 

certain products that did not meet our quality 

control standards in FY2019 but there was no 

incident of a similar scale in FY2020. The products 

were incinerated by a SGS approved vendor in 

Taiwan.

In FY2020, no waste were sent to landfills for both 

Taiwan and Singapore.

Construction of Our Tuas Manufacturing 

Facility

In line with building regulations, our company 

policies and commitment towards sustainability, 

our manufacturing facility was constructed 

with the intention of attaining the BCA Green 

Mark certification. Areas assessed by the 

company include 1) environmental attributes 

of building material, 2) energy consumption &amp; 

management, 3) GHG Emission &amp; management, 

4) waste management, 5) water consumption &amp; 

management and 6) environmental compliance.

Energy efficiency opportunities were also 

assessed for our boiler and cooling tower, 

reviewing its intended use and suitability, 

possible upgrades and savings payback period if 

any to enhance energy efficiency.  

Similarly, our policies on renovation projects 

revolve around principles of reusability and 

energy efficiency. During space planning, we 

seek to reuse the infrastructure in its existing 

condition where possible, minimising demolition 

works such as hacking of walls. Instead, we 

enhance them by repainting or resurfacing them 

with wallpaper to suit the intended purposes. 

To enhance energy efficiency, we use appliances 

that are certified with the energy star and all glass 

windows in our premises are fitted with solar 

film to reduce energy usage and at the same time 

lower cooling cost.

Perpetual Target

FY2020 Performance

To ensure that all waste in the production lines are disposed of properly

Achieved





Production Line Setup at Tai Seng

As we endeavour to familiarize ourselves with the manufacturing process, we have set up a tube filling 

and packaging line in Tai Seng for certain products in the DR’s Secret range. Certain discharge cannot 

be directly released into the sewers due to its viscosity. At the moment, as a temporary measure, we 

are reusing emptied intermediate bulk containers we received when buying other product raw material 

to contain these discharge and will send it to a certified vendor for processing and disposal when they 

becomes full and meet the vendor’s minimum order quantity. In future, we will be building a water 

treatment plant at the Tuas manufacturing facility to process this waste before releasing it into the sewers 

to fulfil the National Environment Agency’s requirements. In 2020, we accumulated 2 full bulk containers 

of waste. We will bring in the vendor when we have accumulated 4 full bulk containers. Corrugated carton 

boxes and empty drums accumulated during the production process are also consolidated and picked up 

by vendors for recycling.

32

Electronic Waste Disposal

Although not substantial, we are aware that 

electronic waste comprises many components 

and may contain heavy metals and substances 

of concern, which require specialized equipment 

to dismantle, process and extract the constituent 

materials that can then be turned into new 

products. Therefore, for both Taiwan and 

Singapore, we appoint certified vendors to help 

with disposal of electronic waste. At the same 

time, these vendors also make sure that any 

confidential data in the electronic devices are 

completely destroyed and irretrievable, thus 

preventing misuse.

Going Paperless and Transiting to Digital 

Invoices

Due to the pandemic pushing transactions online, 

our initiative to transit to digital invoices was 

put on the backburner as much less sales were 

transacted at our experience centre. Instead, we 

focused our resources on launching and updating 

our online stores, iOS and Andriod apps, indirectly 

setting up the infrastructure to save paper and 

trees.

Environmental Considerations in Our 

Corporate Office

Optimal use of space

Through the use of movable folding walls, we are 

able to use the same space for multiple purposes. 

In its usual configuration, the space is carved 

into 3 meeting rooms of various sizes to facilitate 

discussions and a fully functional pantry with 

a sitting area to create a café like environment, 

which is useful for meeting vendors or for our 

millennial workforce who sometimes work 

more effectively in an informal setting. When 

required, we can reconfigure the space to host 

a townhall meeting or have staff gatherings to 

enhance cohesion. The company also provides 

proper cutlery and cups so that we can cut down 

on disposable cutlery. At the end of lunch hour, 

the used cutlery and cups are loaded into the 

dishwasher for thorough cleaning.

Segregation of recyclable waste

We are also inculcating in our staff the practice 

to recycle and segregate recyclable waste from 

general waste. Labelled bins are situated around 

the office to consolidate recyclable waste.

Packaging Management

Our commitment to environment sustainability 

extends to our packaging materials. On top of 

ensuring that the packaging materials we use 

provide enough protection and are compatible 

with our products and brand image, we also strive 

to minimize their environmental impacts.

We adopted the use of eco-friendly ink on our 

carton boxes. The ink chemistry allows for more 

cost-effective and less energy intensive paper 

recycling, as it simplifies the usually tricky process 

of separating the ink from paper to obtain clean 

pulp.

In 2020, we changed the packaging for our DR’s 

Secret Vitalising Eye Mask, Aqua Boost Serum 

10, Lip Butter, Lip Glacier and Miraglo to FSCTM 

(Forest Stewardship Council) certified paper. The 

FSC certification is considered a “gold standard” 

designation where wood is harvested from forests 

that are responsibly managed, socially beneficial, 

environmentally conscious, and economically 

viable. Of the 3 FSC certification labels, we have 

adopted FSC mix for our product packaging. 

Products that bear FSC mix are made using a 

mixture of materials from FSC certified forests, 

recycled materials, and controlled wood.

In addition, through the optimization of product 

packaging, we have reduced the use packaging 

material and also protection material, such as the 

downsized air pillows that fill the gaps between 

products in shipment boxes for online orders. 

We will continue to explore new sustainability 

solutions and strive to become early adopters to 

support these initiatives to fulfil our commitment 

for sustainability.
