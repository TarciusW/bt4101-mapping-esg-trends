BUSINESS 

IN BRIEF

AUSTRALIA

• Thakral Capital Australia Pty Ltd

Brisbane and Sydney, Australia

• GemLife Group

Australia

• Thakral Capital Holdings Pte Ltd

Singapore

The Group’s businesses in Australia is now by far the 

largest component in terms of net assets as well as 

profitability. It participates in higher yielding, niche 

high-end property projects in gateway cities such 

as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane and has a joint 

venture in the over-50s lifestyle resorts sector.

Thakral Capital Holdings Pte Ltd (“TCH”), the holding company of the Group’s investment business in Australia, was 

incorporated in 2009 and the TCH group started operations in Australia as Thakral Capital Australia Pty Ltd (“TCAP”) 

in early 2011.

TCAP operates as a capital partner with real estate developers and provides value-added services including originating, 

packaging and managing investment projects. It has been the financial backer and investment partner for a slew of 

major apartment and townhouse developments in Australia since 2011, investing and committing in excess of A$490 

million of capital into projects with an end value surpassing A$5 billion. It has to date successfully completed 17 projects, 

with another 14 in the pipeline, and nine under construction. 

The Group’s retirement living joint venture with the 

Puljich family, marketed under the GemLife brand, has 

been successfully established as one of Australia’s 

most respected brands in the over-50s resort-style 

living sector within 4 years of its establishment.

To date, GemLife has 10 resorts with more than 

2,800 homes across the eastern seaboard in various 

development stages, where 600 homes have been 

occupied. It has a pipeline of five more sites, which 

may yield another 1,600 homes to be built. 

The Group’s diversification into the over-50s resort-

style living sector is expected to provide sustainable 

returns in a growing sector in Australia following 

achievement of a critical mass of occupied homes and 

maturity of the business from its current expansionary 

stage.

• TJP Pte Ltd

Singapore

• Thakral Umeda Properties Pte Ltd

Singapore

The Group has expanded its real estate investment portfolio to include properties in Japan and Singapore in recent 

years.

Its Japanese investment portfolio is structured through its pooled investment subsidiaries, Thakral Japan Properties 

Pte Ltd, TJP Pte Ltd and Thakral Umeda Properties Pte Ltd. The portfolio has grown significantly since establishment 

in 2014 and now comprises seven commercial buildings – Yotsubashi Nakano Building, Yotsubashi East Building, 

Itachibori Square, Utsubo East Building, River Point Kitahama Building, Yotsubashi Grand and Umeda Pacific Building; 

and three business hotels – Best Western Osaka Tsukamoto Hotel, R Hotels Inn Osaka Kita Umeda and Hotel WBF 

Namba Motomachi.

The Group looks forward to continuing to capitalise 

on the growing tenant demand in Osaka together 

with rising real estate values brought about by the 

limited supply of quality assets and the country’s 

low interest rates. While exploring options for 

alternate uses to boost long-term returns from its 

hotel investments, the Group may recycle some of 

its capital through sale of some of its properties 

to realise profits whilst continuing its search for 

reinvesting in niche properties.

The Group’s latest investment, the Umeda Pacific 

Building (the “Property”), is an excellently located 

11-storey office building 3-minutes’ walking 

distance from Hankyu and Umeda stations, the 

2 main Osaka stations. The Property is prominently 

located along Mido Suji with broad street frontage.

Immediately behind the Property is a Shinto Shrine 

– the Tsuyunotenjinja Shrine (more popularly known 

as Ohatsu Tenjin) – a legendary site where people 

pray for success in business, safe journeys and 

couples for lasting love and a good marriage. When 

the Hankyu and Umeda stations were first built 

between 1894 – 1907, the shrine along with the 

nearby Osaka Tenmangu Shrine, became known and is venerated as the protector of the central area, Umeda and 

Sonezaki.

The Property is built on freehold land with an area of 860.95m2 and has a gross floor area (“GFA”) of 9,179m2. The 

Property has 27 parking lots.

• Thakral Realty (S) Pte Ltd

Singapore

The Group’s office property at The Riverwalk, Singapore continues to provide a stable source of recurring rental income 

for the Group.

Recognising the opportunities and potential in e-commerce in Southeast Asia, the Group took a strategic initial 

investment in August 2020 in Intrepid Group, a fast-growing e-commerce startup which helps brands and small and 

medium enterprises accelerate their growth on e-commerce platforms such as Lazada, Shopee and others. The 

valuation of this investment has since risen due to the enormous growth potential for ecommerce in Asia.

In line with our strategy to expand our revenue streams to provide stability and diversify risks, we have recently taken 

a minority stake in W Capital Markets Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based investment banking firm with a strong pipeline of 

projects poised to tap Asia’s rising capital markets for growth.

HONG KONG 

The Group’s Hong Kong subsidiary, Thakral Corporation 

(HK) Limited, commenced distribution of Inta360 digital 

action cameras in mid-2020 and was presented with the 

“Best Partner Award of 2020” by Insta360, recognising 

its strong performance in developing its market for these 

products in the short period of representation. 

JAPAN

In March 2020, the Group divested its Nambanaka Thakral 

Building, a 6,588 sq ft retail property located in the heart 

of Osaka’s retail district. This divestment brought in a 

net profit of about S$6.1 million over original acquisition 

cost, allowing the Group to pay down debt taken up by 

Thakral Japan Properties Pte Ltd and recycle its capital 

for re-investment in other attractive deals.

SUSTAINABILITY BOARD STATEMENT

Dear Stakeholders,

2020 is a critical year for climate change, marking the Decade of Action’s start to achieve the United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals (“UN SDGs”) by 2030. To address the impacts of climate change and contribute to these global 

goals, many corporations have boosted their efforts in managing their material Environmental, Social and Governance 

(“ESG”) topics. Similarly, at Thakral, we recognise that sustainability is integral to our business operations’ long-term 

success and continuity. Hence, as the Group proceeded into the fourth year of our sustainability reporting journey, we 

have strengthened our commitment on integrating the ESG dimensions of sustainability into our business strategy to 

create enduring value for all our stakeholders.

BALANCING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY

The Group continued to deliver robust economic 

performance in FY2020 in spite of the COVID-19 global 

pandemic, with a profit of S$6.5 million attributable 

to equity holders and two interim dividends totalling 

$0.03 per share declared for FY2020. The Group is 

committed to striking a balance between financial growth 

and sustainable ESG performance, especially during 

times of economic slowdown due to COVID-19, while 

ensuring high standards of corporate accountability and 

transparency as the business grows.

ACHIEVING A MORE SUSTAINABLE TOMORROW

The Group is fully compliant with applicable environmental laws and regulations throughout its business operations. In 

FY2020, there were no incidences of regulatory non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations. Our core 

businesses in Australia achieved energy efficiency and green ratings while motivating our partners to adhere to green 

standards. GemLife also reduces the environmental impact on the development’s community through designing and 

incorporating eco-friendly materials. Providing vibrant, independent living for over-50s with a focus on health, wellbeing 

and social interaction is a fundamental mission of GemLife.

BUILDING THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR WORKFORCE

Apart from environmental efforts, the Group also emphasises on building and growing employees’ capabilities as it 

contributes to enhancing our brand profile. To support our employees’ professional development and occupational 

needs, we provide full support to upgrade their skills and increase productivity. Our core businesses in China and 

Hong Kong prioritise on-the-job training and targeted internal workshops due to the high level of physical involvement 

required and our work’s fast-evolving nature. These initiatives improve our team’s product knowledge while enhancing 

our sales and management skills to work with our brand and channel partners more efficiently, ultimately enhancing 

the customer experience.



“Sustainability is integral to 

the long-term success and 

continuity of our business 

operations”

GIVING BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES

Going beyond the workplace, the Group is also committed to supporting social and community causes. After joining 

hands with the Chinese equivalent of Red Cross, our China subsidiary, Thakral China Ltd, identified specific groups 

and regions in China experiencing difficulties and needing financial aid. The Group provided financial support to needy 

students and families while also making charitable donations to schools to upgrade and reconstruct their infrastructure.



NORTH EAST GROWTH FUND – MILK AND DIAPER PROGRAM



Apart from charitable donations to upgrade and build 

schools, the Group also prides itself to be one of the 

main sponsors of the North East Growth Fund (Milk &amp; 

Diaper). The Fund was established to provide needy 

families residing in Singapore’s North East district with 

financial aid to cover the costs of raising young children. 

With ongoing support of this Fund, the Group is able to 

support 250 children per year in Singapore for three years 

with the purchase of formula milk and diapers for needy 

families with children aged three years and below.

The Group made a charitable donation in 2019 to AWWA 

Ltd (“AWWA”), a Singapore-based registered charity that 

delivers a wide range of programmes and services. These 

include early intervention for pre-schoolers, education and 

integration support for children and adults with additional 

needs, social assistance for vulnerable families, and 

care services for seniors. This donation goes towards 

supporting the building of a second AWWA School to 

cater to 300 children with autism. The Group is pleased 

to update that the construction of the school is 70% 

completed. The school is expected to be operational from 

January 2022.

NAVIGATING THE UNCERTAINTIES DURING COVID-19

In 2020, the world was also faced with another unprecedented global crisis – the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the first 

reported cases at Wuhan, China in December 2019, this virus has spread to 222 countries and territories, resulting in 

more than 151 million cases and more than 3.1 million deaths worldwide as of 1 May 2021.1 

Globally, the Group is fully compliant with local laws and regulations regarding safe-distancing measures and lockdown 

protocols. We ensured that offices were closed during the respective lockdown periods in each country and rolled out 

various initiatives to protect our key stakeholders. Governments worldwide also helped to cushion the brunt felt by 

local individuals and businesses by introducing various schemes, such as the two-month rent-free period in Shanghai 

and the working capital support from the Singapore Government Enterprise Financing Scheme. To further support our 

employees through these difficult times, the Group used part of the funds set aside for corporate social responsibility. 

For further details, please refer to the COVID-19 Response section in the report.

During this tough period with unprecedented challenges brought upon by the pandemic, the Group increased its 

donations to charitable organisations to lend a helping hand to those in need. These included the UOB Heartbeat 

COVID-19 Relief Fund and ROW Plus: Reaching Out to Vulnerable Families during COVID-19 by the Malay Youth 

Literary Association.

MOVING TOWARDS A BETTER FUTURE

Looking ahead, the Group is committed to building a strong business and incorporating sustainable practices across 

all business operations. We will continue to prioritise sustainability as a core function of our business and integrate 

sustainability matters into the development of our strategies, management of key ESG issues and sustainability 

performance. Detailed materiality assessment review and extensive stakeholder engagement will provide guidance in 

addressing emerging ESG risks and opportunities. Together with the steady integration of sustainability measures into 

our corporate strategy, quality disclosures in key sustainability areas will ensure that our stakeholders are provided 

with a comprehensive breakdown of the Group’s sustainability performance and growth. Our over-arching goal to drive 

sustainable growth while generating value for our shareholders through a diversified portfolio in resilient Asian markets 

will continue to steer us towards a better future.

COVID-19 RESPONSE

Although the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in wide-spreading effects on global operations, the Group remains committed 

to safeguarding its stakeholders’ interests and helping vulnerable groups in need.

Face masks are essential components of personal protective equipment (“PPE”) to prevent the spread of COVID-19 

among communities. Due to the increased global demand for masks and disruptions in the global supply chain, there 

were shortages of masks, driving up the cost of PPE procurement. As a result, charitable organisations faced a huge 

challenge in the procurement process to provide masks for vulnerable communities. With our extensive supply chain 

network, we were able to source masks, as well as other PPE supplies like sanitisers, thermometers and disinfecting 

wipes. To date, we have supported charitable organisations to the tune of about S$2 million towards the fight against 

COVID-19 and to save lives.

MASK DONATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

At GemLife lifestyle resorts in Australia, the management team made swift adjustments to roll out several initiatives 

supporting resident communities in coping with COVID-19. These initiatives included free meal deliveries, private sales 

appointments, temporary closure of communal facilities and virus-related bulletins.

GemLife COVID-19 Bulletin news-sheets were dispatched at our resorts with the following objectives:

• Educate our communities about social distancing and hygiene practices;

• Update residents on the latest government directives;

• Share tips and advice to make day-to-day living easier; and

• Provide useful local and national contacts &amp; resources.











GEMLIFE COVID-19 BULLETIN NEWS-SHEETS

Potential residents could make private appointments to learn more about living in GemLife resorts. These appointments 

aimed to address all the questions potential residents might have while ensuring adherence to safe social distancing 

measures.

Going beyond physical appointments, GemLife Woodend launched 3D virtual tours with a 360-degree video camera 

in September 2020. This initiative allowed buyers to view every room from the comfort of their homes, as well as be 

aligned with the various lockdown restrictions imposed across Victoria.

Another notable initiative was GemLife Eats, which strived to reduce the need for supermarket trips by residents. 

From April 2020, this programme offered residents free home-made meals prepared freshly by GemLife Chef

practices across all its business operations are aligned and rooted to its sustainable business principles. Employees’ 

alignment to the Group’s Sustainability Approach is also reinforced through the training programs held which help to 

ensure that their roles and responsibilities continue to be well defined.

The Group utilises a risk-based approach which involves carrying out a periodic review of its policies and refreshing its 

breach response. To stay true to its core values and achieve its sustainability goals, the Group remains committed to 

integrate the best sustainable practices into its daily operations. A consistent incorporation of these positive practices 

into its workplace and business processes not only fosters trust among its business partners and within its communities, 

it also ensures transparency and sustainable growth for its investors.

The Group also strives towards its long-term goals of supporting local economies where it is involved in and cultivating 

a conducive workplace for its employees to reach their full potential. To reduce its environmental impact, the Group 

has implemented critical measures as part of its precautionary approach.

The Group is dedicated to be a responsible corporate citizen by consistently incorporating sustainability into its business 

operations. This Sustainability Approach ensures that the Group’s key stakeholders’ needs and concerns are taken 

into consideration in the development and execution of its business strategies.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

The Group regularly updates the assessment to maintain the accuracy and relevance of material Environmental, Social, 

and Governance (“ESG”) topics to its businesses. The Group identifies ESG topics by conducting a Stakeholder 

Engagement and Materiality Assessment Workshop during the year with its external consultant’s assistance. Through a 

review of the ESG topics that are important to the various stakeholders, the Group can better understand the concerns 

of its stakeholders and offer better solutions to safeguard the sustainability of its business.

In FY2018, the Group observed that six material ESG issues were of key priority in its sustainability agenda. For the 

following year, it reassessed and prioritised seven material ESG topics including a new topic, GRI 404: Training and 

Education.

This year, the Group engaged the Board of Directors, Senior and Middle Management, as well as a Major Shareholder 

to review and reassess the relevance of material ESG topics. The reporting scope was expanded to include Investment 

for GRI 202: Market Presence and GRI 417: Marketing and Labeling.

creating a win-win situation for all associated parties.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Group is committed to ensuring all its reporting exemplifies transparency, integrity, accountability and good 

governance by complying with stringent good governance standards. In the long run, this would support business 

development plans while safeguarding and adding value for stakeholders.

The Group’s FY2020 Annual Report provides further details regarding its corporate governance practices and guidance 

from the principles and provisions of the 2018 Code of Corporate Governance (the “Code”). Different corporate policies, 

Board matters and terms of reference for the Board Committees aligned with the Code, were also used as guidance. 

The Board is dedicated to ensuring high standards of corporate governance are adopted throughout the Group. In 

FY2020, the Group boasts zero incidences of regulatory non-compliance with environmental laws, and/or regulations 

and it strives to maintain this achievement.

PUSHING FOR SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IN AUSTRALIA

Aligning to Thakral’s commitment to business sustainability, the Group emphasises the need to embed 

environmental consciousness and practices in all our business strategies. The Management continues to strive for 

excellence in driving environmental practices across the region. This includes constant improvements in energy 

usage efficiencies for its day-to-day business operations.

In line with the Group’s environmental commitment, GemLife is incorporating renewable energy and natural 

water treatment technologies in the development in Bribie Island, Australia. GemLife and the Group believes in 

safeguarding the environment, and hence has invested in the implementation of technologies beneficial to the 

environment in our business operations and developments.

All GemLife homes are six-star energy rated and feature a host of eco-friendly standard inclusions, providing a 

good start for living sustainably. Every GemLife home and clubhouse is fitted with a 3kW solar Photovoltaic (PV) 

systems on the roofs as a standard inclusion to power the entire site. The electricity generated by the PV system 

is delivered directly to the homes for electrical needs. Any excess electricity is exported to the shared electricity 

grid where it can be drawn from at night during low electricity generation.

Solar energy is one of the best alternative energy sources to fossil fuel. With the extensive implementation of 

rooftop PV systems across all GemLife homes, our greenhouse gas emissions will see a significant reduction, 

making it a big step towards lowering our carbon footprint.

As part of GemLife’s effort to preserve the wetland in Dux Lake in Bribie Island, the lake is filled with an innovative 

floating man-made raft that houses hundreds of native wetland plants. Collectively, these plants form a biological 

Floating Water Treatment System (“FWTS”). FWTS fosters natural vegetation rehabilitation and provides a food 

source and refuge for fish for a biologically diverse and healthy ecosystem.

A fertigation system also works in conjunction with FWTS to maintain and monitor the plants’ condition. It replaces 

traditional fertilisation practices which release significant amounts of liquid or granular fertiliser several times a year.

These two systems have ensured a healthy and vibrant wetland in Bribie Island, preserving the natural habitat 

and biodiversity. The innovation has also reduced energy, water consumption and maintenance effort. GemLife 

is carrying out the phase 2 of the wetland preservation project in the future by expanding FWTS into other areas 

of Dux Lake.

The Group continues to seek new practices and innovation to implement in its development for environmental 

sustainability.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

GRI 307-1

The Group is dedicated to comply with environmental laws and utilise renewable energy. This will not only reduce the 

negative environmental impacts of its business operations, but also maintain long-term financial growth.

The opportunities to receive various solar rebates has placed the Group in an advantageous position to improve the 

operational aspect of its core businesses in Australia. Within GemLife, a review of environmental condition is conducted 

for every unique project taken up. This review considers the impact of the project’s development on the prevailing 

land, nature or wildlife. In addition, submissions to obtain development approval from local councils are made before 

commencement of any site works.

The Group also constantly explores different possibilities for renewable energy powered development. GemLife’s 

residential projects have solar panels installed to minimise the environmental impact on nature and the community, as 

well as reduce electricity costs in the long run.

Constant monitoring and review are conducted to ensure that targets are achieved. External reviews of construction 

projects are also carried out to verify that they are completed in compliance with the approved development application. 

These reviews help to assure that the construction projects are safe and adhere to local building legislation while 

protecting the environment.

Despite 2020 being one of the most turbulent years in modern history, the Group remained resilient, with staff turnover 

rates remaining at below 10% for our core businesses in Australia, Japan and Singapore. While the Group did not reduce 

headcount due to the impact of the coronavirus in any of its locations, a reduction was made in China headcount to 

align with its operational needs.

Moving forward, the Group will continue to provide fair and equal employment opportunities regardless of race, age, 

gender, religion or nationality. To cope with the ever-changing and complex conditions, the Group will also strengthen 

its business resilience through consistent review of its manpower needs and an improved management of its employee 

turnover. Necessary adjustments to the team composition and size will be made swiftly to complement its operational 

needs while accounting for local market conditions.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION

GRI 404-1/GRI 404-2

The Group believes that building its workforce capabilities is critical to the success of a sustainable business. The Group 

also recognises the benefits of creating a conducive learning environment, where skilled and motivated employees 

can thrive and improve productivity. To maintain operational efficiency and consistent standards, self-development is 

essential to refresh existing skills and keep up with the fast-paced era.

The Group started to disclose training and education information for its core businesses in China and Hong Kong in 

FY2019, with a total of 2,600 training hours for its employees and an average of 17.93 training hours per employee.

However, in FY2020, a total of 909 training hours was recorded, achieving an average of 8.74 training hours per 

employee, which was significantly lower compared to FY2019. Training activities were severely affected in 2020 by 

the COVID-19 pandemic. As the initial infection point, the operation in China was hit the hardest. During their first 

phase of public health response to COVID-19, workplace shutdowns, lockdowns, travel restrictions, and strict social 

distancing measures were implemented. As such, many training programmes under the Group’s core businesses in 

China and Hong Kong were impacted. This led to a decrease in the average training hours per employee for this year.

of alternative tech-centric solutions such as online learning platforms, virtual training sessions, etc. to cope with the 

impact of COVID-19 on training and education.

The Group aspires to invest a greater amount of time and resources to ensure that all employees are well-equipped 

with the necessary skills to adapt and excel under this changing business landscape and become highly efficient in 

completing complex tasks.

The Group firmly believes that its customers’ invaluable support is a key contributor to its steady business success. 

To attract and retain customers, the Group’s brand management and marketing businesses in China and Hong Kong 

continue to broaden the brands and product portfolio to provide a wider range/variety of quality products. Through 

the years, investment in brand building efforts has provided the Group with opportunities to expand into beauty and 

wellness categories. Boasting a broad portfolio of at-home beauty and wellness products, the Group has become a 

leader in these market segments.

Beyond the beauty and wellness market segments, the Group also has a strong market presence in real estate 

investments especially in Australia. Thakral Capital Australia Pty Ltd (“TCAP”) functions as a capital partner for real estate 

developers and provides value-added services, including originating, packaging and managing investment projects.

MARKETING AND LABELING

GRI 417-2

The Group remains committed to being fully compliant with all advertising and labeling rules and regulations in its 

respective countries. In addition, the Group expanded its reporting scope to include the core businesses in Australia 

for this disclosure in FY2020.

To ensure that all marketing and labeling activities of their products and services adhere to the respective rules and 

regulations in the countries which they are sold, the Group carefully manages marketing efforts in regions where its 

products are distributed. The Group also gives brand owners constant feedback to ensure they remain compliant with 

relevant rules and regulations in the Group’s markets.

In FY2020, the Group achieved zero incidents of non-compliance regarding product and service information and

CUSTOMER PRIVACY

GRI 418-1

The Group believes that protection and proper use of corporate and personal data are key factors in influencing its 

ability to conduct business, forge trust and abide by laws and regulations. The Personal Data Protection Policy in 

Singapore has been put in place to serve as a manual for employees to inculcate awareness and facilitate compliance 

with applicable data protection laws amongst employees.

As part of efforts to implement effective record management applicable to Singapore, the Group updated its data 

collection procedures and documentation to adhere to the Advisory Guidelines relating to NRIC and Other National 

Identification Numbers used by Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Commission.

Finance legislation affecting the Group’s core businesses in Australia frequently requires specific information to be 

recorded and retained. The Group has stepped up its controls to safeguard its customers’ personal data in this age

Below are some of the community events that the Group has been involved in in FY2020.

EDUCATING THE NEXT GENERATION

The Group makes charitable donations to schools, such as the Xiao Man Bie Wan Quan Primary School and Manhattan 

Primary School in Yunnan Province, China.

With the donations provided, Xiao Man Bie Wan Quan Primary School in Teng Chong City undertook roof reconstruction 

and refurbishment of their floor, kitchen and canteen, as well as upgraded their sports facilities. As a form of 

appreciation, the school was renamed to Xiao Man Bie Caritas Thakral Hope Primary School (小曼别博爱德加拉希望

小学) upon completion of their 3-stage reconstruction/refurbishment project.





XIAO MAN BIE CARITAS THAKRAL HOPE PRIMARY SCHOOL (小曼别博爱德加拉希望小学)

The Manhattan Primary School in Tuantian Township, Yunnan Province completed by August 2020 the various 

restoration and construction works involving the school’s wall, gate, concrete floor as well as its campus greening 

project for which the Group had donated funds. This effort brought a safe studying environment for around 185 students 

in the school. The Group also provided financial assistance to 30 needy students in 10 schools in Pu’er City, Yunnan 

Province to aid them with various essentials such as school uniforms, textbooks, shoes, food and bedding.

SUPPORTING THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES

Australia faced a devastating fire season in late 2019 which resulted in a state of emergency as dozens of bushfires 

erupted in New South Wales. The fires continued to spread across all states, burning roughly 25.5 million acres and 

destroying around 3,000 homes and 24 percent of koala habitat.

Throughout 2020, GemLife staff and residents joined hands, participating in several fundraising activities for various 

causes across Australia. Apart from fundraising initiatives to support COVID-19 causes, events were also held to support 

rebuilding efforts after the fires, such as bake sales, barbecues, and knitting pouches for native wildlife injured in the 

summer bushfires. Some of the causes supported by GemLife this year included the Australian Koala Foundation, 

Australian Red Cross, Cancer Council Australia, WIRES Wildlife Rescue Organisation, Polished Man, Red Cross and 

Helping our Hospital Heroes. The generosity of the GemLife community is commendable as they dedicated their time 

and effort and raised approximately A$19,000 for the community.

In Singapore, the Group increased its donations to local charitable organisations during the pandemic to give a hand 

to more people in need during this difficult period. These included the UOB Heartbeat – COVID-19 Relief Fund and 

ROW Plus: Reaching Out to Vulnerable Families during COVID-19 by the Malay Youth Literary Association.

The Group is also blessed to be able to contribute in making a difference to the lives of persons with dementia through
