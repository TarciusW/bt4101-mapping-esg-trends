PROFILE



VCPlus Limited (the “Company”), incorporated on 30 September 2010 was formerly known as Anchor Resources 

Limited. It was listed on the Catalist board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX”) in March 2016.

Prior to 2021, the Group was in the gold and granite mining business in Malaysia. The Company disposed of the gold 

mining business in 2020 and is in the process of disposing the granite dimension stone business.

In April 2021, the Company diversified its business into the provision of custodian services for digital assets and the

as well as adoption of FinTech strategies and technology (“FinTech Business”), with an accompanying change of name 

to “VCPlus Limited” to reflect the new business as the engine of future growth for the Company.

Today, we are a Singapore-based and Singapore-listed company focusing on the financial and blockchain technology 

and its applications. We embarked on this journey with a clear vision in sight.

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS 

On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), we are pleased to present the 7th 

Annual Report of VCPlus Limited (formerly known as Anchor Resources Limited) 

(the “Company”) and together with its subsidiaries, (the “Group”) for the financial year 

ended 31 December 2021 (“FY2021”).

Since the start of the Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic in early 2020, the global 

economy has been severely impacted. In 2021, however, governments across the world 

started making considerable strides in dealing with the pandemic. As vaccination rates 

around the world have risen, more countries are experimenting with vaccinated travel 

arrangements. While these developments give us cause for cautious optimism, we are 

far from the status quo ante.

Countries like China and Japan still impose restrictions on international and intranational 

movement and activities. These continue to be an impediment to businesses. Moreover, 

inflationary fears around the world, intensified by the recent flare-up of the longstanding 

Russia-Ukraine conflict, has cast a pall over the global macroeconomic outlook.

However, amidst these grey clouds lie some silver linings. The rapid pace of digital 

transformation and high usage of internet and mobile services in our daily activities have 

led to a tremendous growth in financial technology, or “FinTech”. In particular, innovation 

and investment in blockchains and distributed ledger technologies are accelerating at a 

rapid pace. According to a 2022 report published in February 2022 by professional services 

firm KPMG, the FinTech sector in Singapore achieved a five-year high last year, with a total 

transaction value of US$3.94 billion (S$5.29 billion) across venture capital, private equity, 

and merger and acquisitions. The report also noted that funding for cryptocurrencies 

and blockchain technology projects accounted for nearly half of the total value raised by 

Singapore fintech firms last year. The Company’s diversification into the FinTech business 

positions it to capture new growth opportunities in this fast-growing space.

A REVIEW OF FY2021

The Group recorded revenue of RM0.63 million in FY2021 as compared to revenue of 

RM0.13 million in FY2020. The higher revenue was mainly due to maiden revenue 

contribution from the FinTech Business, partially offset by lower revenue contribution 

from the Granite Dimension Stone Business.

The Group incurred a lower net loss after tax of RM7.64 million in FY2021 as compared to 

RM18.18 million in FY2020.

In FY2021, the Company’s financial position improved significantly. It registered net assets 

of RM19.28 million as at 31 December 2021 as compared to net liabilities of RM7.08 million 

as at 31 December 2020. During the same period, cash and cash equivalents increased to 

RM6.22 million as at 31 December 2021 from RM2.64 million as at 31 December 2020. In 

addition, the Group had no borrowings as at 31 December 2021 compared to borrowings 

of RM10.86 million as at 31 December 2020.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

Granite Dimension Stone Business

The Granite Dimension Stone Business comprises the Company’s mining assets in Bukit 

Chetai granite quarry site and the green field Bukit Machang granite quarry site. The Granite 

Dimension Stone Business has been halted since COVID-19 was first identified globally 

at the end of 2019. Since then, the Company had implemented various cost reduction 

measures to reduce the operating costs of the Granite Dimension Stone Business.

CHAIRMAN’S 



STATEMENT









MR. CHUA 

SER MIANG

Non-Executive Chairman 

and Lead Independent 

Director

4

VCPLUS LIMITED


In the Company’s continued effort to reduce the operating 

costs of the Granite Dimension Stone Business, the 

Company announced on 13 January 2022 that Perbadanan 

Memajukan Iktisad Negeri Terengganu (Terengganu 

State Economic Development Corporation) (“PMINT”) 

had agreed, among others, to reduce quit rent payable 

to PMINT by reducing the mining concession area from 

300.9019 hectares to 196.135 hectares. As a result, the 

Group had returned the mining concession rights of the 

Bukit Chetai granite quarry site to PMINT and the Group’s 

mining right will be limited to the green field Bukit Machang 

granite quarry site only, which will require material capital 

investment to commence production.

On 14 March 2022, the Company announced the proposed 

disposal of GGTM Sdn. Bhd. which holds the mining rights 

for Bukit Machang.

FinTech Business

I am pleased to share that the appointment of both Mr. Lim 

Beng Chew to the Board as an Executive Director, and Mr. 

Chong Heng Loong as Chief Executive Officer in February 

and April last year respectively, has positioned the Group 

well to capture opportunities for future growth in the 

FinTech industry.

Under their leadership, the Company has obtained 

shareholders’ approval in April 2021 to diversify the Group’s 

business into the provision of custodian services for digital 

assets and the provision of advisory, consultancy and/

or management services relating to financial technology 

regulation and licencing as well as adoption of FinTech 

strategies and technology (“FinTech Business”), with an 

accompanying change of name to VCPlus Limited to reflect 

the new business’ role as an engine of future growth for 

the Company.

Shortly thereafter, the Company announced a joint 

venture, Custody Plus Pte. Ltd. (“Custody Plus”), in May 

2021 to provide custodial services for digital assets. To 

fund the new business, the Company raised net proceeds 

of S$2.61 million in a private placement. In November 

2021, Custody Plus applied to the Monetary Authority of 

Singapore for a capital markets services licence in respect 

of the regulated activity of providing custodial services, 

among others, which may take one to two years after 

application to obtain an outcome from the application.

VCPlus has also been active in growing its technology 

consultancy services under the FinTech Business. In July 

2021, the Company secured a two-year collaboration 

with Chartwell Compliance, a wholly owned subsidiary 

of MVB Bank in the United States of America, to provide 

fintech licensing and compliance consultancy services to 

businesses in North America and the Asia-Pacific region.

To grow the Company’s internal capabilities in the fintech 

and blockchain services business, we acquired APEC 

Solutions Pte. Ltd. and its subsidiaries (“APEC Solutions”) in 

October 2021. APEC Solutions is a technology consultancy 

firm that develops and integrates technology solutions 

for enterprises. Its suite of solutions includes blockchain 

and FinTech solutions development, enterprise software 

solutions, e-commerce, and digital marketing services.

In 2021, VCPlus made some headway in the provision of 

blockchain advisory services to companies in the media 

and energy sector. In November 2021, the Company 

secured an advisory role to a landmark security token 

offering project with Tree Roots Entertainment Group, 

a joint venture between Magnolia Quality Development 

Corporation Limited, one of Thailand’s premier property 

developers and T&amp;B Media Global, one of Thailand’s 

largest private IP management and entertainment 

investment companies.

The Company was also appointed to advise GENES Group 

on the development and adoption of blockchain and other 

technology solutions to help companies reduce their 

carbon footprint.

November 2021 also saw the appointment of Messrs 

Esmond Choo and Desmond Tan as the Group’s advisors, 

and Mr. Yuen Keng Yin as Head of Technology and 

Innovation to further strengthen the Company’s ability to 

tap into growth opportunities in the fintech and blockchain 

industry. They have over 80 years of combined experience 

in the securities and futures industry between them, 

having been former senior executives at the Monetary 

Authority of Singapore, OCBC Bank and UOB-Kay Hian.

LOOKING AHEAD

Moving forward, the management team is cautiously 

optimistic for the year to come as we expect the growth 

in FinTech Business to continue riding on the pace of 

digital transformation and assimilation of more digital 

applications in our daily activities.

While the Group develops its new businesses towards 

revenue generation, it will be vigilant in managing its 

expenses. In addition, the Group will continue to establish 

collaboration with strategic partners and explore business 

opportunity in the financial and blockchain technology 

sector.

WORDS OF APPRECIATION

On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my deepest 

gratitude to our management and staff for their resilience 

and commitment they showed in the face of a very 

challenging and difficult business environment. In addition, 

I would like to thank our shareholders, customers, suppliers, 

bankers and business associates for their unwavering 

support.

Last but not least, I would like to extend my gratitude to our 

dedicated Board of Directors for their guidance and advice. 

As we embark on a challenging journey post COVID-19, we 

will seize the opportunity on potential new businesses and 

to deliver greater value to our shareholders.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATION



 



REVIEW



REVENUE AND OTHER INCOME

The Group recorded revenue of RM0.63 million in FY2021 as 

compared to revenue of RM0.13 million in FY2020. The higher 

revenue was mainly due to maiden revenue contribution 

from the FinTech Business, partially offset by lower revenue 

contribution from the Granite Dimension Stone Business.

The Group also recorded other income of RM2.78 million 

in FY2021, representing an increase of RM2.50 million from 

RM0.28 million for FY2020. The increase was mainly due 

to (i) other income recognised of RM1.67 million relating 

to the final account settlement for PB Hotel project with 

Eco Group International Sdn Bhd, which arose from over 

provision of cost for the entire project; (ii) management fee 

income from Angka Alamjaya Sdn Bhd of RM0.15 million; 

and (iii) reversal of impairment losses RM0.5 million.

PROFITABILITY

Total operating expenses increased by RM2.61 million to 

RM11.06 million in FY2021 from RM8.45 million in FY2020. 

The increase in total operating expenses was mainly due to:

· 

The Group recorded changes in inventories in FY2021 

and FY2020 amounted to RM0.19 million and RM0.10 

million, respectively. The changes in inventories 

of RM0.19 million incurred in FY2021 was due the 

unsold inventories that were expensed off arising 

from the return of Bukit Chetai quarry as announced 

by the Company on 13 January 2022.

· 

Increase in employee benefits expenses by RM2.26 

million from RM1.75 million in FY2020 to RM4.01 

million in FY2021 due to an increase of employee 

headcount arising from the Company’s new 

business diversification to the FinTech Business and 

acquisition of APEC Solutions.

· 

Increase in other expenses by RM2.69 million from 

RM2.97 million in FY2020 to RM5.66 million in 

FY2021 mainly due to write-offs of fixed assets and 

mines properties arising from the return of Bukit 

Chetai quarry as announced by the Company on 13 

January 2022 amounting to RM1.43 million, loss on 

disposal of fixed assets of RM0.21 million and general 

operating expenses of RM0.71 million arising from 

the operation in Singapore for the FinTech Business.

· 

Decrease in finance costs of RM2.11 million from RM2.28 

million in FY2021 to RM0.17 million in FY2021 mainly 

due to the full redemption of bonds in February 2021.

As a result of the above, the Group incurred net loss before 

tax of RM7.64 million and RM8.04 million in FY2021 and 

FY2020, respectively excluding loss from discontinued 

operations of RM10.15 million recorded in FY2020.

FINANCIAL POSITION

In FY2021, the Company’s financial position improved 

significantly. It registered net assets of RM19.28 million 

as at 31 December 2021 as compared to net liabilities of 

RM7.08 million as at 31 December 2020. During the same 

period, cash and cash equivalents increased to RM6.22 

million as at 31 December 2021 from RM2.64 million as at 31 

December 2020. In addition, the Group had no borrowings 

as at 31 December 2021 compared to borrowings of 

RM10.86 million as at 31 December 2020

As at 31 December 2021, total equity attributable to owners 

of parent amounted to RM18.06 million, comprising 

mainly of share capital of RM298.60 million, negative 

other reserve of RM119.16 million and accumulated losses 

of RM161.37 million. It increased from negative RM7.08 

million mainly due to the increase of share capital of 

RM33.49 million partially offset by the additional losses  

after tax of RM7.64 million.

The Group’s total assets was RM24.30 million as at 31 

December 2021 compared to RM10.95 million as at 31 

December 2020. The increase was mainly due to the 

acquisition of APEC Solutions in 2021.

The Group’s total liabilities was RM5.03 million as at 31 

December 2021 compared to RM18.03 million as at 31 

December 2020. The decrease was mainly due to full 

settlement of borrowings amounted to RM10.86 million.

CASH FLOWS

In FY2021, the Group recorded a net cash outflow for 

operating activities of RM6.04 million. The net operating 

cash outflow was mainly due to operating cashflows 

before working capital changes of RM7.09 million. Working 

capital outflow was mainly attributable to the increase in 

trade and other receivables to RM2.82 million and decrease 

in in trade and other payable by RM1.18 million.

The Group recorded a net cash inflow for investing activities 

of approximately RM1.53 million in FY2021 mainly due to 

acquisition of APEC Solutions. This was financed by a net 

cash inflow from financing activities of RM8.09 million as 

a result of proceeds from issuance of new ordinary shares 

in FY2021 which was partially offset by the repayment of 

lease liabilities.

Cash and cash equivalents increased by RM3.58 million 

from RM2.64 million as at 31 December 2020 to RM6.22 

million as at 31 December 2021 mainly due to completion 

of the placement exercise in FY2021.

BOARD



 



STATEMENT



The Board of directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present VCPlus Limited’s 

(formerly known as Anchor Resources Limited) (the “Company” or “VCPlus”, 

together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) sustainability report for the financial 

year ended 31 December 2021 (“FY2021”) (“Sustainability Report 2021”).

The Sustainability Report 2021 covers data and information for FY2021 and 

has been prepared with reference to the widely recognised Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core Option as well as on a “Comply and Explain” 

basis pursuant to Rule 711A, 711B and Practice Note 7F of the Singapore 

Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules 

of Catalist (“Catalist Rules”). The data and information provided have not been 

verified by an independent third party.

With the full support from the Board, the management establishes the policies 

and practices to address and manage the material environment, social and 

governance (“ESG”) factors. The Board has (i) considered sustainability issues 

as part of its strategic formulation, (ii) determined the material ESG factors, and 

(iii) overseen the management and monitoring of the material ESG factors. The 

Company remains committed to further improve and strengthen its engagement 

with various stakeholders in relation to the material issues.

In April 2021, VCPlus obtained shareholders’ approval to diversify into the 

financial technology and blockchain technology (collectively, the “FinTech”) 

sector including custodian for digital assets and consultancy businesses (the 

“FinTech Business”) from its former core granite dimension stone quarrying and 

management services (collectively the “Granite Dimension Stone Business”). 

VCPlus joined as a member of Singapore Fintech Association in 2021. 

The Company’s FinTech Business currently relates to the provision of advisory, 

consultancy and/or management services related to FinTech regulation and 

licensing as well as the adoption of FinTech strategies and technology. We intend 

to expand into the business of providing custodian services for digital assets 

upon obtaining the relevant licenses from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

The Company’s Granite Dimension Stone Business is engaged in granite mining 

in Terengganu, Malaysia, which has been halted since November 2019. On 14 

March 2022, the Company announced the disposal of its remaining mining 

asset. Post disposal, the Group does not operate any mining business.

While the FinTech Business operations currently do not have material impact 

on the environment, VCPlus remains committed to reducing the environmental 

impact of its operations. VCPlus strives to enhance shareholder value and 

maintain cordial relationships with the local communities in the areas that 

VCPlus operates in. With its continuous efforts in sustainable operating model, 

VCPlus looks forward to sustainable growth for its businesses in the coming 

years.

MATERIAL TOPICS AND



 



BOUNDARIES



VCPlus, in the study and identification of the material 

topics, is guided by the GRI Reporting framework and 

reflects the Group’s commitments. The interests of the 

stakeholders were considered along with the overall 

operations of the Company. 

In this reporting period, VCPlus has performed a 

materiality review by analysing its business context, 

operating environment and the feedback received from 

the stakeholders to assess matters that have a material 

impact on the business. VCPlus determined the materiality 

of its sustainability topics based on the level of its impact 

on the environmental, social and governance of its area of 

operation and surroundings. 

Following the Company’s diversification into the FinTech 

Business in April 2021, the material topics are expanded 

upon in the various sections. Moving forward, the Company 

will enhance its reporting to include the remaining material 

matters progressively.

The materiality assessment process is outlined below:

Identification

 

• 

The key stakeholder groups were identified and prioritised to ensure their interests and concerns are 

reflected in the relevant material matters.

 

• 

An inventory of matters was created based on internal and external sources of information to determine 

the sustainability context and common definitions were agreed on across stakeholders.

Rating and Prioritisation

 

• 

Material sustainability matters were shortlisted and prioritised according to the importance of each matter 

to key stakeholders and the Group.

Validation

 

• 

The material matters were presented to the management for their endorsement and was thereafter 

validated by the Board of Directors.

VCPlus’ Dimension Stone Business operations have 

potential impacts on the land, air, water and ecosystems 

of the surrounding areas as well as significant economic, 

social and cultural impacts on the local communities in 

the areas that it operates in.

However, the Dimension Stone Business has been halted 

since November 2019 and hence, its economic, social and 

cultural impacts would have become less material.

Due to the nature of Company’s FinTech Business as a 

provider of advisory, consultancy and/or management 

services related to FinTech regulation and licensing as well 

as the adoption of FinTech strategies and technology, this 

report may cover aspects beyond the GRI reporting scope, 

and important materiality issues covered by GRI may not 

be entirely relevant to the Company, including scope 

relating to the Environment.

1. ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

Our operations are subject to extensive laws and 

regulations governing environmental protection. All of 

our operations require a variety of permits and licenses 

approvals from the government agencies. Key laws and 

regulations are related to air emissions, noise level, river 

water quality, waste management and chemicals storage. 

The Granite Dimension Stone Business has a fundamental 

responsibility to manage the impact of its operations on 

the environment. To accomplish VCPlus’ environmental 

policy, we conducted environmental impact assessment 

and environmental management plan for Bukit Chetai 

Granite Dimension Stone. 

Energy – Diesel and Electricity 

At Bukit Chetai Granite Dimension Stone, there was no 

diesel usage in FY2021 as the operation has been halted 

since November 2019.

Overall, GGTM’s usage of electricity recorded for the 

reporting period are 6,121 kwh (FY2020: 12,421 kwh) and 

no diesel consumption was recorded in both FY2021 and 

FY2020. The decrease in energy consumption in FY2021 

was due to the minimal activities carried out at GGTM 

during FY2021 amid COVID-19 pandemic. There has been 

no production for granite mine since operation was halted 

in November 2019.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

GGTM’s operations require certain energy inputs, which result in a variety of emissions, including Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) 

emissions. In turn, GHGs are integrally linked to climate change, which is one of the world’s most pressing challenges.

We commit to being part of the global solution to this challenge. By effectively managing our energy needs, we may 

contribute to the reduction in GHG emissions across the mining sector and collectively help achieve global reduction 

targets.

The carbon dioxide emission in Bukit Chetai Granite Mine decreased as the operation was halted since November 2019.

Employee Benefits And Development

VCPlus is committed to a policy of equal opportunity 

for all potential and current employees. The Company 

hires, promotes, develops and compensates employees 

based on meritocracy and without discrimination against 

age, gender, disability, marital status, race or colour, 

national origin, religion, sexual orientation or any other 

legally protected class or status. The Company believes 

in the merits of a diverse work force, where a wide range 

of varying expertise and perspectives can be brought 

together to bring the Company to the next level.

The Company will continue to adopt equal employment 

opportunity policy, and is committed to complying 

with all applicable government regulations pertaining 

to safety, health and environmental aspects, and 

establishing systems which provide a safe and healthy 

workplace for employees. Grievance-handling channels 

are also available to employees who believe that they 

have been subjected to discriminatory behaviour to raise 

their concerns, and such complaints will be looked into, 

with the Human Resource department determining the 

appropriate actions to be taken.

VCPlus aspires to create a work environment where 

employees remain engaged thus providing employees 

growth and learning opportunities and drive worker 

retention. We implement and adhere to best practices 

regarding 

employee 

engagement, 

including 

fair 

remuneration, 

employee 

benefits, 

training 

and 

development programs. We comply with local labour 

regulations and our employees are remunerated above 

minimum wage.

In addition, VCPlus recognises that timely and effective 

performance evaluation empowers employees to give 

their best. As such, manager &amp; their team members meet 

at least once a year to review their performance.

We take responsibility for the well-being of our employees 

and provide them with adequate healthcare benefits 

such as hospitalisation, surgical insurance and medical 

benefits.

In FY2021, our employee turnover rate was 16.13 % 

as compared to 12.60% in FY2020 mainly due to the 

Company’s business diversification into the FinTech 

Business in April 2021. As at 31 December 2021, total staff 

headcount was 31, an increase from 30 as at 31 December 

2020. Moreover, as at 31 December 2021, the Group had 

greater diversity of staff with a higher proportion of female 

staffs and a younger average age with more than 70% 

below age of 40.

Board Diversity

The Board recognises that board diversity is an important 

element which will better support the Company’s 

achievement of its strategic objectives for sustainable 

development by enhancing the decision-making process of 

the Board through varied perspectives, skills, experience, 

gender, age, knowledge and professional qualifications.

A breakdown on the diversity of our Board of Directors as 

at 31 December 2021 is set out on the side.

Occupational Health And Safety

The health and safety of our people is the highest priority 

at all our operations and across our entire company.

There are a variety of safety and health hazards and 

risks associated with mining operations. If not managed 

effectively, such risks can have significant consequences 

for our employees, contractors, communities and our 

business as a whole. Our commitments are based on a 

belief that all workers should go home safely after every 

shift. All new workers, visitors and suppliers’ workers 

are given a safety briefing by either the certified safety 

officer or safety supervisors before they are allowed into 

the mining areas and/or the processing plants. Refresher 

briefings for the employees are also carried out on, at 

least, an annual basis. Appropriate personal protective 

equipment (“PPE”) are provided to both our employees 

and our visitors. Suppliers’ workers are required to be 

equipped with the appropriate PPE. VCPlus employs safety 

officers or safety supervisors to maintain safety measures, 

including putting up safety signage to remind the workers 

of the safety matters. On an annual basis, the Company 

reports the Safety and Health status of the mines to the 

Department of Occupational Safety and Health.

VCPlus achieved zero fatality and zero loss time injury for 

both FY2021 and FY2020.

Covid-19

The impact of COVID-19 has affected every individual,

Company’s compliance or explanation

The Non-Executive Directors are kept well informed of the Group’s 

business and are knowledgeable about the industry the Group operates 

in. To ensure that the Non-Executive Directors are well supported by 

accurate, complete and timely information, they have unrestricted access 

to the Management, and have sufficient time and resources to discharge 

their oversight functions effectively.

During Board meetings, the Management also updates the Non-Executive 

Directors on the latest developments of the Group and its future plans. 

Forecast financials against budget are also presented to enable the Non-

Executive Directors to assess the performance of the Group.

The Non-Executive Directors had met and discussed in the absence of key 

management personnel as required in FY2021.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Principle 3 

Provision 3.1, 

3.2 and

3.3

There is a clear division 

of 

responsibilities 

between the leadership 

of 

the 

Board 

and 

Management, and no 

one individual has 

unfettered powers of 

decision-making.

As at the date of this Annual Report, Mr. Chua Ser Miang is the 

Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, Mr. Lim Chiau Woei is the Managing 

Director (“MD”), while Mr. Chong Heng Loong is the Chief Executive Officer 

(“CEO”).

The roles of the Non-Executive Chairman and the CEO as well as the MD 

are separate to ensure a clear division of their responsibilities, increased 

accountability and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision-

making. The Non-Executive Chairman is not related to the CEO or the MD.

Provision 3.1; 

3.3

The Non-Executive Chairman oversees the business and ensures the 

effectiveness of the Board. He leads the Board discussions and ensures 

that Board meetings are convened when necessary. He sets the Board’s 

meeting agenda in consultation with the CEO and the MD, and where 

necessary, other members of the Board as well as the Company Secretary 

and ensures the quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information 

between the Board and key management personnel to facilitate efficient 

decision-making.

The CEO takes a leading role in managing the business of the Group and 

manages the day-to- day operations, together with the other Executive 

Directors, with the assistance of the key management personnel. He is 

also responsible for setting the strategic direction of the Group together 

with the Board and steering the business of the Group for future growth 

and expansion, while the MD focuses on managing the mining business.

In view of the above, the Board is of the view that power is not unduly 

concentrated in the hands of any one individual nor is there any 

compromised accountability and independent decision-making as all 

major decisions and policy changes are conducted through the respective 

Board Committees, all of which are chaired by the Independent Directors.

his or her own capacity and ability to undertake other obligations or 

commitments together with serving on the Board effectively. The NC 

does not wish to omit from consideration outstanding individuals who, 

despite the demands on their time, have the capacity to participate and 

contribute as members of the Board.

The factors considered in assessing the capacity of Directors include the 

following:

l 

expected and/or competing time commitments of Directors;

Provision 4.4

The NC reviews the independence of each Independent Director 

annually. As part of the review process, the NC requires the Independent 

Directors to complete and execute declaration forms in relation to 

their independence. These declaration forms are drawn up based on 

the guidelines in the Code. The NC has reviewed the declaration form 

executed by each of the Independent Directors, and, pursuant to its 

review, the NC is of the view that Mr. Chua Ser Miang, Ms. Lee Kim Lian, 

Juliana and Mr. Gavin Mark McIntyre are independent in accordance with 

the Code.

Accordingly, the Board has identified each of the Independent Directors 

to be independent, after determining, taking into account the views of the 

NC, whether the Director is independent in character and judgement and 

whether there are any relationships or circumstances which are likely to 

affect, or could appear to affect, the Independent Director’s judgement.

There are no Directors who are deemed independent by the Board, 

notwithstanding the existence of a relationship as stated in the Code that 

would otherwise deem him not to be independent.

As at the date of this Annual Report, there is no Independent Director who 

has served beyond nine years since the date of his/her first appointment.

Pursuant to the Constitution, at each Annual General Meeting (“AGM”), 

at least one-third of the Directors for the time being (or, if their number is 

not a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not less than one-third) 

shall retire from office by rotation.

The Directors to retire in every year shall be those subject to retirement 

by rotation who have been longest in office since their last re-election or 

appointment and so that as between persons who became or were last 

re-elected Directors on the same day, those to retire shall (unless they 

otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot. A retiring 

Director shall be eligible for re-election.

The Directors who are standing for re-election at the forthcoming AGM 

pursuant to Article 114 of the Constitution are Mr. Chua Ser Miang and 

Ms. Lee Kim Lian, Juliana. After assessing each of their contributions and 

performance, the Board and NC is recommending Mr. Chua Ser Miang and 

Ms. Lee Kim Lian, Juliana for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.

The key information of the Directors, including their profiles and 

directorships held in the past 3 years, are set out on pages 9 to 11 of this

his/her performance or re-nomination as a Director. The Board will act on 

the results of the performance evaluation, and in consultation with the 

NC, propose, where appropriate, that new members be appointed to the

The annual review of the compensation is carried out by the RC to ensure 

that the remuneration of the Executive Directors and key management 

personnel are commensurate with their performance, contribution, giving 

due regard to the financial and commercial health and business needs 

of the Group. The performance of the Executive Directors (together with 

other key management personnel) is reviewed periodically by the RC and

Provision 7.3

The remuneration of the Executive Directors and the key management 

personnel consists of fixed salary and allowances. There was no variable 

compensation paid based on the level of achievement of corporate and 

individual performance objectives in FY2021.

In addition, the Company has put in place the Anchor Resources 

Performance Share Plan (“Performance Share Plan” or “PSP”) to reward 

key management for meeting their key performance indicators to promote 

higher performance goals and recognise exceptional achievements by 

individuals who have contributed to the Group’s growth. The Company 

does not have long-term incentive schemes.

The approval for the allotment and issue of new shares on the vesting of 

awards under the Performance Share Plan was last obtained at the AGM of 

the Company on 29 April 2021.

Provision 7.2

The Board concurred with the RC that the proposed Directors’ fees for

Executive Directors receive Directors’ fees in accordance with their level 

of contributions, taking into account factors such as effort and time 

spent for serving on the Board and Board Committees, as well as the 

responsibilities and obligations of the Directors. The Company also 

recognises the need to pay competitive fees to attract, motivate and retain 

directors without being excessive to the extent that their independence 

might be compromised.

Directors’ fees are recommended by the Board for approval by the 

shareholders at the AGM of the Company.

Having reviewed and considered there was no variable compensation 

paid to the Executive Directors and the key management personnel, the 

RC is of the view that there is no requirement to institute contractual 

provisions to allow the Company to reclaim incentive components of 

their remuneration paid in prior years in exceptional circumstances of 

misstatement of financial results, or of misconduct resulting in financial 

loss.

In addition, the Executive Directors owe a fiduciary duty to the Company. 

The Company should be able to avail itself to remedies against the 

Executive Directors in the event of such breach of fiduciary duties.

Principle/

Code Description

Company’s compliance or explanation

Principle 9

Provision 9.1

The Board is responsible 

for the governance of 

risk and ensures that 

Management maintains 

a sound system of 

risk management and 

internal controls, to 

safeguard the interests 

of the company and its 

shareholders.

The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the governance of risks 

and the overall internal control framework but recognises that no cost 

effective internal control system will preclude all errors and irregularities, 

as a system is designed to manage rather that eliminate the risk of failure 

to achieve business objective and can provide only reasonable and not 

absolute assurance against material misstatements or loss.

Risk assessment and evaluation has become an essential part of the 

business planning and monitoring process. Having identified the risks to 

the achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives, each business unit 

is required to document the mitigating actions in place and/or proposed 

in respect of each significant risk. Risk awareness and ownership of risk 

treatments are also continuously fostered across the organisation.

The Group has formed a Risk Management Steering Committee which is 

led by the MD, the CEO and the Finance Manager (“FM”) who would review 

the Group’s operating and business activities to identify new areas of 

significant business risk as well as appropriate measures to control and 

mitigate these risks. Similarly, they will identify any risks that may no 

longer be relevant and remove such risks accordingly. The management 

continuously reviews all the significant control policies and procedures 

and proposes an appropriate risk action plan for each identified risk. The 

Risk Management Steering Committee highlights all significant findings 

and matters to Directors and AC. The Board is ultimately responsible for 

the Group’s risk management.

The Company has engaged Tricor Axcelasia (SG) Pte Ltd (“IA” or 

“Tricor Axcelasia”) as its internal auditors in 2021, to assist the AC to 

independently evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the system of 

internal controls using a risk-based approach.

The role of the outsourced internal audit function is to provide 

independent and objective reports on the organisation’s key internal 

controls to the AC. The outsourced internal auditor performed its work in 

accordance with the International Professional Practices Framework, an 

internationally recognised framework. The outsourced internal auditor 

reports directly to the AC on a regular basis during the AC meeting.

Internal audits include evaluation of controls relating to significant 

risks. Such audits also ensure that instituted controls are appropriate, 

effectively applied and achieve acceptable risk exposures consistent 

with the Company’s risk management and internal control framework. 

The outsourced internal auditor would advise Management on areas for 

improvement and would subsequently carry out follow-up review on 

the status to which its recommendations have been implemented. The 

internal audit reports which contained the relevant audit finding and 

recommendations are submitted to the AC for deliberation. The AC meets 

with the outsourced internal auditor at least once a year to review the 

outsourced internal audit function and to assure itself on the soundness 

of internal control system.

is required and it is responsible for investigating and coordinating 

corrective action. All reports shall be handled with confidentiality, except 

where necessary or appropriate for the purpose to conduct investigation 

and to take remedial action, in accordance with the applicable laws and 

regulations. The identity of all whistle-blowers will be kept confidential

A summary of the Rules of the PSP is set out as follows:

 

Participants

 

Group Executives who have attained the age of 21 years and hold such rank as may be designated by the 

Remuneration Committee from time to time shall be eligible to participate in the PSP.

 

Controlling shareholders of the Company or associates of such controlling shareholders who meet the criteria 

above are also eligible to participate in the PSP if their participation and awards are approved by independent 

shareholders in separate resolutions for each such person and for each such award.

 

The selection of a participant and the number of Shares which are the subject of each Award to be granted to 

a participant in accordance with the PSP shall be determined at the absolute discretion of the Remuneration 

Committee, which shall take into account criteria such as his rank, job performance and potential for future 

development, his contribution to the success and development of the Group and, if applicable, the extent of 

effort to achieve the performance target(s) within the performance period.

 

Size of PSP

 

The aggregate number of Shares which may be issued or transferred pursuant to Awards granted under the 

PSP, when aggregated with the aggregate number of Shares over which options are granted under any other 

share option schemes of the Company, shall not exceed 15.0% of the total number issued Shares (excluding 

Shares held by the Company as treasury shares) from time to time.

awards granted under the PSP shall be determined by the Remuneration Committee:

Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) (Continued)

 

Awards

 

Awards represent the right of a participant to receive fully paid Shares free of charge, provided that certain 

prescribed performance targets (if any) are met and upon expiry of the prescribed performance period.

 

Shares which are allotted and issued or transferred to a participant pursuant to the release of an Award shall 

not be transferred, charged, assigned, pledged or otherwise disposed of, in whole or in part, during a specified 

period (as prescribed by the Remuneration Committee in the award letter), except to the extent approved by 

the Remuneration Committee.

 

Details of Awards

 

The Remuneration Committee shall decide, in relation to each Award to be granted to a participant:

 

(a) 

the date on which the Award is to be granted;

 

(b) 

the number of Shares which are the subject of the Award;

 

(c) 

the performance target(s) and the performance period during which such performance target(s) are to 

be satisfied, if any;

 

(d) 

the extent to which Shares, which are the subject of that Award, shall be released on each prescribed 

performance target(s) being satisfied (whether fully or partially) or exceeded or not being satisfied, as 

the case may be, at the end of the performance period; and

 

(e) 

any other condition which the Remuneration Committee may determine in relation to that Award.

 

Timing of Awards

 

While the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to grant Awards at any time in the year, it is currently 

anticipated that Awards would in general be made once a year. An Award letter confirming the Award and 

specifying, inter alia, the number of shares which are the subject of the Award, the prescribed performance 

target(s), the performance period during which the prescribed performance target(s) are to be attained 

or fulfilled and the schedule setting out the extent to which Shares will be released on satisfaction of the 

prescribed performance target(s), will be sent to each participant as soon as reasonably practicable after the 

making of an Award.

 

Vesting of Awards

 

Subject to the applicable laws, the Company will deliver Shares to participants upon vesting of their Awards by 

way of either an issue of new Shares; or a transfer of Shares then held by the Company in treasury.

 

In determining whether to issue new Shares to participants upon vesting of their Awards, the Company will 

take into account factors such as, but not limited to, the number of Shares to be delivered, the prevailing 

market price of the Shares and the cost to the Company of issuing new Shares or delivering existing Shares.

participant and the winding-up of the Company.

 

Rights of shares arising

 

New Shares allotted and issued and existing Shares procured by the Company for transfer on the release 

of an Award shall be eligible for all entitlements, including dividends or other distributions declared or 

recommended in respect of the then existing Shares, the record date for which is on or after the relevant date 

of issue or, as the case may be, delivery, and shall in all other respects rank pari passu with other existing 

Shares then in issue.

 

Duration of PSP

 

The PSP shall continue in force at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, subject to a maximum 

period of 10 years commencing on the date on which the PSP is adopted by the Company in general meeting, 

provided always that the PSP may continue beyond the above stipulated period with the approval of 

shareholders in general meeting and of any relevant authorities which may then be required.

 

Notwithstanding the expiry or termination of the PSP, any Awards made to participants prior to such expiry or 

termination will continue to remain valid.

 

Abstention from voting

 

Shareholders who are eligible to participate in the PSP are to abstain from voting on any shareholders’ 

resolution relating to the PSP and should not accept nominations as proxy or otherwise for voting unless 

specific instructions have been given in the proxy form on how the vote is to be cast.

Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) so as to give a 

true and fair view of the consolidated financial position 

of the Group and the financial position of the Company 

as at 31 December 2021, and of the consolidated 

financial performance, consolidated changes in equity 

and consolidated cash flows of the Group for the 

financial year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities 

under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 

Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and 

Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and 

Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 

financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 

these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 

appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit 

of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 

financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 

these matters.

Acquisition of APEC Solutions Pte. Ltd. and its subsidiaries (“APEC Solutions Group”)

On 15 October 2021, the Group completed the 

acquisition of 100% equity interest in APEC Solutions 

Group for a consideration of RM13,138,000. The 

consideration was satisfied by the issuance of 

172,413,793 new ordinary shares of the Company 

at S$0.025 per ordinary share. The acquisition was 

accounted for using the acquisition method in 

accordance with SFRS(I) 3 Business Combinations and 

a resultant goodwill of RM10,202,000 was recognised. 

The Group has engaged an external valuer to perform 

the purchase price allocation (“PPA”) to determine 

the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and 

liabilities assumed as at date of acquisition, including 

the intangible assets identified for this acquisition.

In accordance with SFRS(I) 1-36 Impairment of 

Assets, the Group is required to test its goodwill for 

impairment annually, or more frequently if there 

are indicators that the asset may be impaired. 

Other intangible assets are tested for impairment 

when there is an indication that the assets may be 

impaired. For the purpose of impairment assessment 

of these intangible assets and cost of investment in 

APEC Solutions Group as at end of the financial year, 

management has prepared discounted cash flow 

forecasts for APEC Solutions Group to determine if any 

impairment is required.

We have determined the business combination of the 

APEC Solutions Group and the impairment assessment 

of these intangible assets and cost of investment in 

APEC Solutions Group to be a key audit matter as 

the assessment involved significant management 

judgements and estimates with regard to the valuation 

process and key assumptions on the future market 

conditions, revenue and terminal growth rates and 

discount rates used in the discounted cash flow 

forecasts prepared by management.

Refer to Notes 3.2(i), 3.2(ii), 7 and 8 of the 

accompanying financial statements.

We performed the following audit procedures, amongst 

others:

l 

Discussed and reviewed management’s 

assessment of the acquisition which was 

accounted for as business combination, 

including the review of key terms of the sale and 

purchase agreement, fair value measurement 

of identifiable assets and liabilities, and the 

calculation of goodwill;

l 

Assessed the independence and competency of 

the external valuer which included considering 

their experiences and qualification in performing 

valuations for such business combinations;

l 

Discussed with the external valuer on the 

valuation methodologies used in the PPA and 

the results of their work;

l 

Engaged our internal valuation specialists to 

evaluate the valuation methodologies used in 

the PPA and the reasonableness of the discount 

rate applied; 

l 

Evaluated the reasonableness of the key 

assumptions made by management in preparing 

the discounted cash flows forecasts by checking 

against relevant underlying data;

l 

Performed sensitivity analysis around the key 

assumptions used in management’s impairment 

assessment of intangible assets and cost of 

investment in APEC Solutions Group, including 

the discount rate, revenue and terminal growth 

rates, used in cash flow forecasts; and

l 

Evaluated the adequacy of the related 

disclosures in the financial statements.

Reduction of mining concession area for granite quarry site

The Group operates mining and production of granite 

at Bukit Chetai Mine located in Terengganu, Malaysia. 

As at 31 December 2021, the assets related to mining 

operations (“Mining Assets”) mainly comprise the 

following:

l 

Mine properties

l 

Property, plant and equipment

l 

Inventories

During the financial year, GGTM Sdn. Bhd. (“GGTM”) 

entered into negotiations with relevant authorities to 

reduce concession-related expenses and operating 

costs of the granite mining business in view of 

the current economic conditions in Malaysia and 

continuing uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 

pandemic. Subsequent to financial year end, GGTM 

entered into a supplemental agreement with the 

relevant authorities to amend certain provisions of 

the concession agreement to reduce the concession-

related expenses and mining concession area which 

resulted in GGTM returning the mining concession 

rights of the Bukit Chetai granite quarry site to the 

relevant authorities. 

In connection with the reduction of mining 

concession area, the Group wrote off approximately 

RM1,021,000 of related mine properties, RM417,000 

of property, plant and equipment and RM185,000 of 

inventories. In addition, management also recognised 

impairment loss on the cost of investment in GGTM of 

approximately RM70,068,000 in the Company’s profit or 

loss.

We focused on this area as a key audit matter as 

significant judgements and estimates are involved in 

determining the impairment amounts of these Mining 

Assets and cost of investment in GGTM.

Refer to Notes 3.2(i), 5, 6, 8 and 9 of the accompanying 

financial statements.

We performed the following audit procedures, amongst 

others:

l 

Read the agreement to obtain an understanding 

on the reduction of the concession area and 

related expenses; 

l 

Evaluated 

management’s 

impairment 

assessment on the Mining assets and the 

recoverable amount of the investment in GGTM; 

and

l 

Evaluated the adequacy of the related 

disclosures in the financial statements.

Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included 

in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 

assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 

knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have 

performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report 

that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance 

with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting 

controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised 

use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the 

preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 

a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 

accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic 

alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 

with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 

and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 

economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional 

scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

n 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud 

or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 

that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 

misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 

collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 

n 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 

are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 

of the Group’s internal control.

n 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 

and related disclosures made by management.

n 

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 

based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 

that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 

that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 

disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 

conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 

future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. 

n 

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 

disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 

manner that achieves fair presentation.

n 

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business 

activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are 

responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible 

for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 

and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our 

audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 

regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably 

be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance 

in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 

these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 

when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report 

because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 

benefits of such communication.

Significant accounting policies

 

2.1 

Basis of preparation

 

 

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting 

Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”). The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost 

convention, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below and on a going concern basis as 

referred to in Note 4 to the financial statements.

 

 

The individual financial statements of each entity within the Group are measured and presented in the 

currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). 

The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the 

Company are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”) which is the functional currency of the Company 

and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements and all values presented are 

rounded to the nearest thousand (“RM’000”) as indicated.

 

 

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with SFRS(I)s requires management to make 

judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the Group’s application of accounting policies and 

reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Although these estimates are based 

on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ from those 

estimates. The areas where such judgements or estimates have significant effect on the financial 

statements are disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements.

they are either not relevant to the Group’s business activities or require accounting which is consistent 

with the Group’s current accounting policies.

 

 

SFRS(I)s issued but not yet effective

 

 

There are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations, which have been

Significant accounting policies (Continued)

 

2.2 

Basis of consolidation

 

 

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its 

subsidiaries made up to the end of the reporting period.

 

 

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control over the investee 

and cease from consolidation when the control is lost. Control is reassessed whenever the facts and 

circumstances indicate that there may be a change in the elements of control. All intra-group balances 

and transactions and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are 

eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides an 

impairment indicator of the transferred asset.

 

 

The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as that of the 

Company, using consistent accounting policies. Where necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries are 

changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

 

 

Non-controlling interests

 

 

Non-controlling interests represents the equity in subsidiaries which is not attributable directly or 

indirectly to the equity owners of the parent. They are shown separately in the consolidated statements 

of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement 

of financial position. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this 

results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

 

 

Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for 

as equity transactions (i.e. transactions with owners). The carrying amounts of the Group’s interests 

and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 

subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted 

and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to 

owners of the parent.

 

 

When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary 

and any non-controlling interest. The profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between 

(i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest 

and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary 

and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in 

relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to 

retained earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were 

disposed of. The fair value of any investments retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control 

is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under SFRS(I) 9 or, 

when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or joint venture.

Basis of consolidation (Continued)

 

 

Acquisitions under common control

 

 

Business combination arising from transfers of interest in entities that are under common control are 

accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative period 

presented or, if later, at the date that common control was established. For this purpose, comparatives 

are restated. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at the carrying amounts recognised 

previously and no adjustments are made to reflect the fair values or to recognise any new assets or 

liabilities, including no goodwill is recognised as a result of the combination. The components of equity 

of the acquired entities are added to the same components within the Group’s equity. Any difference 

between the consideration paid for the acquisition and share capital of acquirees is recognised directly 

to equity as merger reserve.

 

2.3 

Subsidiaries

 

 

Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an investee if the Group 

has power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and 

the ability to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and 

circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.

 

 

Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost, less any impairment loss, in the Company’s 

statement of financial position.

 

 

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration 

transferred for the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, 

of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange 

for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 

Consideration transferred also includes any contingent consideration measured at the fair value at the 

acquisition date. Subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration which is deemed to be an 

asset or liability, will be recognised in profit or loss.

 

 

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for 

recognition under SFRS(I) 3 are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.

 

 

Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the 

acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains 

control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from 

interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other 

comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if 

that interest were disposed of.

 

 

Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset at the acquisition date and initially measured at 

the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 

acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over net 

acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent 

liabilities assumed.

2.3 

Subsidiaries (Continued)

 

 

Goodwill on subsidiary is recognised separately as intangible assets (Note 7). Goodwill is initially 

recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 

 

2.4 

Property, plant and equipment

 

 

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. The cost includes its purchase 

price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary 

for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Dismantlement, removal 

or restoration costs are included as part of the cost if the obligation for dismantlement, removal or 

restoration is incurred as a consequence of acquiring or using the property, plant and equipment.

 

 

Subsequent expenditure on an item of property, plant and equipment is added to the carrying amount 

of the item if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group 

and the cost can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenses are recognised in 

profit or loss when incurred. 

 

 

Other items of property, plant and equipment are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated 

depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

 

 

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the depreciable amounts of the 

property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Years

Buildings

20

Furniture and fittings

5

Office equipment

5

Motor vehicles

5

Renovation

5

Plant and machinery

10

Road and infrastructure

20

Electrical installation works

5

Tools and equipment

5

 

 

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or 

changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 

 

 

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted as 

appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. 

 

 

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic 

benefits are expected from its use or disposal.

 

 

The gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is 

determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is 

recognised in profit or loss.

2.5 

Mine properties 

 

 

When production commences, carried forward development assets are transferred to mine properties 

and the accumulated costs for the relevant area of interest will then be amortised over the life of the 

area.

 

 

(i) 

Granite mine

 

 

 

Amortisation for granite mine properties is based on straight-line method over the concession 

period of the mine properties of 16 years (2020: 17 years).

 

 

(ii) 

Gold mine (Discontinued operation Note 27)

 

 

 

Amortisation for gold mine properties is according to the rate of depletion, on a unit-of-

production basis over the economically recoverable reserves of the mine concerned, except in the 

case of assets whose useful life is shorter than the life of the mine, in which case the straight-line 

method is applied. The unit of account for run of mines costs are recoverable ounces of gold for 

gold mine.

 

 

The unit-of-production rate and straight-line method for the amortisation of mine properties takes into 

account expenditure incurred to date, together with sanctioned future development expenditure.

 

2.6 

 Intangible assets acquired in a business combination

 

 

 

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from 

goodwill if the assets and their fair values can be measured reliably. The cost of such intangible assets is 

their fair value as at the acquisition date.

 

 

 

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported 

at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as 

intangible assets acquired separately (Note 2.10).

 

2.7 

Impairment of non-financial assets

 

 

Assets other than goodwill

 

 

At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets 

to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If 

any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the 

extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 

individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 

asset belongs. 

 

 

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell 

and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 

present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 

money and the risks specific to the asset. 

 

 

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying 

amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. 

An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

2.7 

Impairment of non-financial assets (Continued)

 

 

Assets other than goodwill (Continued)

 

 

 

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating 

unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying 

amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss 

been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 

recognised immediately in profit or loss.

 

 

Goodwill

 

 

 

Goodwill is recognised separately as intangible assets and is tested for impairment annually, or more 

frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. 

 

 

 

Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to 

benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is 

less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 

amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the 

basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 

reversed in a subsequent period. 

 

 

On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the 

gain or loss on disposal.

 

2.8 

Inventories

 

 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

 

 

Cost is determined on a weighted average basis and includes all costs of purchase, cost of conversion 

and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

 

 

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price at which inventories can be realised in the ordinary 

course of business, less estimated costs incurred in marketing and distribution. Where necessary, 

allowance is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventories to adjust the carrying value of 

those inventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.

 

2.9 

Financial instruments

 

 

The Group recognises a financial asset or a financial liability in its statements of financial position when, 

and only when, the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

 

 

Financial assets

 

 

The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories below, depending on the Group’s 

business model for managing the financial assets as well as the contractual terms of the cash flows of 

the financial asset. The Group shall reclassify its affected financial assets when and only when the Group 

changes its business model for managing these financial assets. The Group’s accounting policy for each 

category is as follows:

Financial assets (Continued)

 

 

Amortised cost

 

 

These assets arise principally from the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade 

receivables), but also incorporate other types of financial assets where the objective is to hold these 

assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of 

principal and interest. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly 

attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the 

effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. Interest income from these financial assets 

is included in interest income using the effective interest rate method.

 

 

Loss allowances for trade receivables are recognised based on the simplified approach within SFRS(I) 

9 using the lifetime expected credit losses. During this process, the probability of the non-payment of 

the trade receivables is assessed. This probability is then multiplied by the amount of the expected loss 

arising from default to determine the lifetime expected credit loss for the trade receivables. For trade 

receivables, which are reported net, such allowances are recorded in a separate allowance account with 

the loss being recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that 

the trade receivables will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against 

the associated allowance.

 

 

Loss allowances for receivables from other financial assets are recognised based on a forward looking 

expected credit loss model. The methodology used to determine the amount of the allowance is based 

on whether at each reporting date, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial 

recognition of the financial asset. For those where the credit risk has not increased significantly since 

initial recognition of the financial asset, twelve month expected credit losses along with gross interest 

income are recognised. For those for which credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime expected 

credit losses along with the gross interest income are recognised. For those that are determined to be 

credit impaired, lifetime expected credit losses along with interest income on a net basis are recognised.

 

 

The Group’s and the Company’s financial assets measured at amortised cost comprise trade and other 

receivables (excluding prepayments, advance payments to suppliers and goods and services tax (“GST”)) 

and cash and cash equivalents in the statements of financial position.

 

 

Derecognition of financial assets

 

 

The Group and the Company derecognise a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash 

flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards 

of ownership of the asset to another entity.

 

 

Financial liabilities and equity instruments

 

 

Classification as debt or equity

 

 

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group and the Company are classified 

according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a 

financial liability and an equity instrument.

Financial liabilities and equity instruments (Continued)

 

 

Equity instruments

 

 

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after 

deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct 

issue costs. The Company classifies ordinary shares as equity instruments.

 

 

Financial liabilities

 

 

The Group classifies all financial liabilities as subsequently measured at amortised cost, and financial 

liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

 

 

Trade and other payables

 

 

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at cost which represents the fair value of the 

consideration to be paid in the future, less transaction cost, for goods received or services rendered, 

whether or not billed to the Group and the Company, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost 

using the effective interest method.

 

 

Derecognition of financial liabilities

 

 

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are 

discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount and the consideration 

paid is recognised in profit or loss.

 

2.10 Intangible assets and goodwill

 

 

(a) 

Goodwill

 

 

 

Goodwill is recognised separately as intangible assets and is tested for impairment annually, or 

more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. 

 

 

 

Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected 

to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash-

generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first 

to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets 

of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment 

loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 

 

 

 

On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 

of the gain or loss on disposal.

(b) 

Intellectual property and unfinished contracts

 

 

 

Intellectual property and unfinished contracts are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 

and any accumulated impairment losses. Intellectual property is amortised to profit or loss using 

the straight-line method over 10 years. Unfinished contracts are amortised to profit and loss over 

the contractual periods. 

 

2.11 Cash and bank balances

 

 

Cash and bank balances in the consolidated statement of financial position comprise cash on hand, 

demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to known 

amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 

 

2.12 Revenue recognition

 

 

Revenue is recognised when a performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue is measured based on 

consideration of which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or 

services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (i.e. sales related taxes). 

The consideration promised in the contracts with customers is based on fixed amounts. The Group’s 

revenue is derived from the fixed price contracts and therefore, the amount of revenue earned for each 

contract is determined by reference to those fixed prices.

 

 

Advisory, consultancy and management services

 

 

Revenue is recognised when a performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue is measured progressively 

based on the work performed during the contract period. The Group bills the customer in accordance 

with the terms of the contract. Unbilled receivables represent the Group’s unconditional rights to 

consideration for services performed but not yet billed as at reporting date. Deferred revenue is 

recognised when the Group has yet to satisfy its performance obligation under the contract but have 

received advanced payments from the customer.

 

 

Sale of goods

 

 

Revenue from sale of semi-processed gold concentrate ore, processed gold ore, granite and aggregate 

are recognised at a point in time when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring 

control of a promised good to the customer. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount of the

to identify when the point of control passes to customers. There is no element of significant financing 

component in the Group’s revenue transactions as customers are required to pay within a credit term of 

30 to 90 days.

2.13 Employee benefits

 

 

Defined contribution plans

 

 

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expenses in profit or loss in the same 

financial year as the employment that gives rise to the contributions.

 

 

Employee leave entitlement

 

 

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. An accrual is 

made for estimated liability for unutilised annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up 

to the end of the reporting period.

 

2.14 Leases

 

 

As lessee

 

 

All leases are accounted for by recognising a right-of-use asset and a lease liability except for:

 

 

l 

leases of low value assets; and

 

 

l 

leases with a duration of twelve months or less.

 

 

The payments for leases of low value assets and short-term leases are recognised as an expense on a 

straight-line basis over the lease term.

 

 

Initial measurement

 

 

Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the contractual payments due to the lessor 

over the lease term, with the discount rate determined by reference to the rate inherent in the lease 

unless this is not readily determinable, in which case the Group’s incremental borrowing rate on 

commencement of the lease is used.

 

 

On initial recognition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities also includes:

 

 

l 

amounts expected to be payable under any residual value guarantee; 

 

 

l 

the exercise price of any purchase option granted in favour of the Group if it is reasonably certain 

to assess that option; and

 

 

l 

any penalties payables for terminating the lease, if the term of the lease has been estimated on 

the basis of termination option being exercised.

 

 

Right-of-use assets are initially measured at the amount of lease liabilities, reduced by any lease 

incentives received and increased for:

 

 

l 

lease payments made at or before commencement of the lease;

 

 

l 

initial direct costs incurred; and

 

 

l 

the amount of any provision recognised where the Group is contractually required to dismantle, 

remove or restore the leased asset.

 

 

The Group presents the right-of-use assets in “Property, plant and equipment” and lease liabilities 

separately from other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Subsequent measurement

 

 

Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, any 

accumulated impairment loss and, if applicable, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liabilities. 

The right-of-use assets under cost model are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter 

of either the remaining lease term or the remaining useful life of the right-of-use assets. If the lease 

transfers ownership of the underlying asset by the end of the lease term or if the cost of the right-of-use 

asset reflects that the Group will exercise the purchase option, the right-of-use assets are depreciated 

over the useful life of the underlying asset.

The carrying amount of right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes 

in circumstances indicate that the right-of-use asset may be impaired. The accounting policy on 

impairment is as described in Note 2.7 to the financial statements.

 

 

Subsequent to initial measurement, lease liabilities are adjusted to reflect interest charged at a constant 

periodic rate over the remaining lease liabilities, lease payment made and if applicable, account for any 

remeasurement due to reassessment or lease modifications.

 

 

After the commencement date, interest on the lease liabilities are recognised in profit or loss, unless the 

costs are eligible for capitalisation in accordance with other applicable standards.

 

 

When the Group revises its estimate of any lease term (i.e. probability of extension or termination option 

being exercised), it adjusts the carrying amount of the lease liability to reflect the payments over the 

revised term. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is similarly revised when the variable element 

of the future lease payment dependent on a rate or index is revised. In both cases, an equivalent 

adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets. If the carrying amount of the right-

of-use assets is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of lease liabilities, 

the remaining amount of the remeasurement is recognised directly in profit or loss.

 

 

When the Group renegotiates the contractual terms of a lease with the lessor, the accounting treatment 

depends on the nature of the modification:

 

 

l 

If the renegotiation results in one or more additional assets being leased for an amount 

commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right-of-use obtained, the 

modification is accounted for as a separate lease in accordance with the above policy;

 

 

l 

In all other cases where the renegotiation increases the scope of the lease (i.e. extension to the 

lease term, or one or more additional assets being leased), the lease liability is remeasured using 

the discount rate applicable on the modification date, with the right-of-use asset being adjusted 

by the same amount;

Subsequent measurement (Continued)

 

 

When the Group renegotiates the contractual terms of a lease with the lessor, the accounting treatment 

depends on the nature of the modification: (Continued)

 

 

l 

If the renegotiation results in a decrease in scope of the lease, both the carrying amount of the 

lease liability and right-of-use asset are reduced by the same proportion to reflect the partial 

or full termination of the lease with any difference being recognised in profit or loss. The 

lease liability is then further adjusted to ensure its carrying amount reflects the amount of the 

renegotiated payments over the renegotiated term, with the modified lease payments discounted 

at the rate applicable on the modification date. The right-of-use asset is adjusted by the same 

amount.

 

 

For lease contracts that convey a right to use an identified asset and require services to be provided 

by the lessor, the Group has elected to account for the entire contract as a lease. The Group does not 

allocate any amount of contractual payments to, and account separately for, any services provided by 

the lessor as part of the contract.

 

2.15 Borrowing costs

 

 

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, 

which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or 

sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their 

intended use or sale. Borrowing costs on general borrowings are capitalised by applying a capitalisation 

rate to construction or development expenditures that are financed by general borrowings. Investment 

income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on 

qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

 

 

All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred using 

the effective interest method.

 

2.16 Taxes

 

 

Income tax expense comprise current tax expense and deferred tax expense. 

 

 

Current income tax

 

 

Current income tax expense is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for a 

period. Current income tax liabilities for the current and prior periods shall be measured at the amount 

expected to be paid to the taxation authorities, using the tax rates and interpretation to applicable tax 

laws in the countries where the Group operates, that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 

end of the reporting period. Management evaluates its income tax provisions on periodical basis.

 

 

Current income tax expenses are recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that the tax relates to 

items recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Deferred tax

 

 

Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 

liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases of asset and liabilities, except 

when the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or other assets and 

liabilities that is not a business combination and affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit.

 

 

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments 

in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control 

the timing of reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will 

not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 

differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 

temporary difference can be utilised. 

 

 

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced 

to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or 

part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 

 

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply for the period 

when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rate and tax law that have been enacted 

or substantially enacted by the end of reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the 

tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects to recover or settle its 

assets and liabilities.

 

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax 

assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 

authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

 

 

Deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except when it relates to items recognised outside profit or 

loss, in which case the tax is also recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

 

 

Sales tax

 

 

Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:

 

 

l 

when the sales taxation that is incurred on purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from 

the taxation authorities, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of cost of acquisition of 

the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and

 

 

l 

receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.

 

 

The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of 

receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.

2.17 Foreign currency transactions and translation

 

 

In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the 

entity’s functional currency (“foreign currencies”) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the 

date of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign 

currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary 

items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates 

prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in 

terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not re-translated.

 

 

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on re-translation of monetary 

items are included in profit or loss for the financial year. Exchange differences arising on the re-

translation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the financial year 

except for differences arising on the re-translation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and 

losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that 

gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. 

 

 

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the 

Group’s foreign operations (including comparatives) are expressed in Ringgit Malaysia using exchange 

rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and expense items (including comparatives) 

are translated at the average exchange rates for the financial year, unless exchange rates fluctuated 

significantly during that financial year, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions 

are used. Exchange differences arising, are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and 

accumulated in the Group’s currency translation reserve.

 

 

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign 

entities (including monetary items that, in substance, form part of the net investment in foreign 

entities), and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, 

are taken to the currency translation reserve.

 

 

On disposal of a foreign operation, the accumulated currency translation reserve relating to that 

operation is reclassified to profit or loss.

 

2.18 Segment reporting

 

 

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 

chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating 

resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Group Chief 

Executive Officer who make strategic decisions.

 

2.19 Government grants

 

 

Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant 

will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with. Government grants related to asset 

are deducted against the carrying amount of the asset.

 

 

Government grants related to expenses are accounted for in the year where the related costs it intends 

to compensate is incurred and recognised in the profit or loss. Such government grants are presented 

under “Other income”.

2.20 Provisions

 

 

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 

past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate 

can be made of the amount of the obligation.

 

 

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the 

present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties 

surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the 

present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.

 

 

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered 

from a third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement 

will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. The increase in the 

provision due to the passage of time is recognised as finance expense.

 

 

Changes in the estimated timing or amount of the expenditure or discount rate are recognised in profit 

or loss when the changes arise.

 

2.21 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations

 

 

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be 

recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as 

met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate 

sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to 

qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.

 

 

Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the 

asset’s previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The assets are not depreciated or 

amortised while classified as held for sale. Any impairment loss on initial classification and subsequent 

measurement is recognised as an expense. Any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell (not 

exceeding the accumulated impairment loss that has been previously recognised) is recognised in profit 

or loss.

 

 

A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as 

held for sale, and 

 

 

(a) 

represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;

 

 

(b) 

is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line or geographical area of 

operations; or 

 

 

(c) 

is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

 

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to the financial statements, 

management made judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and 

liabilities that were not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions 

were based on historical experience and other factors that were considered to be reasonable under the 

circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

 

These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 

estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or 

in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

 

3.1 

Critical judgements made in applying the accounting policies

 

 

Management is of the opinion that there are no significant judgements made in applying accounting 

policies and estimates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 

amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

 

3.2 

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

 

 

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 

end of the financial year that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 

amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses within the next 

financial year are discussed below.

 

 

(i) 

Impairment of investments in subsidiaries

 

 

 

At the end of each financial year, an assessment is made on whether there are indications of 

impairment in the investments in subsidiaries. The management’s assessment of indicators is 

based on the expected future cash flows for the subsidiaries. The Company’s carrying amount 

of investments in subsidiaries as at 31 December 2021 is as disclosed in Note 8 to the financial 

statements.

 

 

(ii) 

Impairment of goodwill, intellectual property and unfinished contracts

 

 

 

 

Management performs impairment test on goodwill on an annual basis and whenever there is 

indication that they may be impaired. Intellectual property and unfinished contracts are assessed 

for impairment when there is indication that they may be impaired. The process of evaluating the 

potential impairment of goodwill, intellectual property and unfinished contracts is subjective and 

requires significant judgement and estimates. Management estimates the recoverable amount 

based on the expected future cash flows from the cash generating units to which the goodwill, 

intellectual property and unfinished contracts belong. The carrying values of the cash generating 

units are then compared against the recoverable amounts. Any excess of the carrying values 

over the discounted future cash flows are recognised as impairment loss in profit or loss. The 

carrying amounts of goodwill, intellectual property and unfinished contracts of the Group as at 31 

December 2021 are disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements.

Going concern

 

The Group incurred a net loss of approximately RM7,638,000 and had negative cash flows from operating 

activities of approximately RM6,043,000 for the financial year ended 31 December 2021. 

 

The Directors of the Company are of the opinion that the going concern basis is appropriate in the preparation 

of the financial statements based on the following:

 

(a) 

Management has prepared a cash flow forecast which shows that the Company and the Group will have 

adequate funds for its operational requirements and to meet their debt obligations as and when they fall 

due for at least 12 months from the end of the financial year, having taken account of the funds available 

and cash flows to be generated from the operations and the potential effects of COVID-19 pandemic;

 

(b) 

Continued financial support from two Directors, Mr. Lim Chiau Woei and Mr. Lim Beng Chew, who have 

undertaken to provide adequate funds to enable the Group to meet its payment obligations as and when 

they fall due.

The remaining useful life of the intellectual property is 10 years and unfinished contracts is over 1 to 2 years as 

at the end of the financial year.

 

Goodwill and impairment

 

Upon the completion of acquisition of APEC Solutions Group as disclosed in Note 8 to the financial statements, 

the Group engaged an external valuer to perform the purchase price allocation (“PPA”) to determine the fair 

value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed as at date of acquisition, including the intangible assets 

identified for this acquisition.

 

Based on the PPA report, goodwill, intellectual property and unfinished contracts were recognised in relation 

to the acquisition. The goodwill represents an excess on the cost of the acquisition over the estimated fair 

value of the net identifiable assets of APEC Solutions Group at date of acquisition. The intellectual property 

represents a decentralised business operating system that could be implemented in the automobile, logistic 

and courier industries for both service operators, retail customers and any mobility stakeholders. The 

unfinished contracts represents a series of service contracts that are expected to continue to generate future 

potential economic benefits.

 

The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The use 

of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and determination of a discount rate in order to 

calculate the present value of the cash flows.

 

The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from value in use calculations based on cash flow 

forecasts based on financial budgets approved by management for the next 4 years and projection to terminal 

year.

Key assumptions used in the cash flow projections are discount rate, revenue and terminal growth rates as 

follow:

31.12.21

Discount rate

34.9%

Revenue growth rate

16.5%

Terminal growth rate

1.5%

 

Management estimates discount rate using pre-tax rate that reflect current market assessments of the time 

value of money and risk specific to the CGU. Revenue and terminal growth rates were projected based on 

historical growth, past experience and management’s best estimation of future business outlook. The terminal 

growth rate is used to extrapolate budgeted cash flows to terminal year.

 

As at the end of the reporting period, no impairment loss was recognised as the recoverable amount of the CGU 

was determined to be higher than its carrying amount.

 

Based on the sensitivity analysis performed on the key assumptions in the impairment testing, no reasonably 

possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying amounts of the CGU and the related 

goodwill to exceed their recoverable amount.

Acquisition of APEC Solutions Pte Ltd and its subsidiaries (“APEC Solutions Group”)

 

On 15 October 2021, the Company acquired 100% equity interest in APEC Solutions Group for a consideration 

of RM13,138,000 as part of the Group’s diversification into the FinTech business. Upon the acquisition, APEC 

Solutions Pte Ltd and its subsidiaries became subsidiaries of the Group. The purchase consideration was 

satisfied by the issuance and allotment of an aggregate of 172,413,793 new ordinary shares of the Company.

 

The fair values of assets and liabilities from the acquisition had been determined based on fair value as at the 

date of acquisition as follows:

From the date of acquisition, APEC Solutions Group has contributed approximately RM608,000 and RM51,000 to 

the revenue and loss net of tax of the Group respectively. If the combination had taken place at the beginning 

of the financial year, the Group’s revenue and loss, net of tax would have been RM1,795,000 and RM7,712,000 

respectively. 

 

Goodwill of RM10,202,000 arising from the acquisition is attributable to the FinTech segment in Singapore 

and the expected synergies from combining the FinTech operations of the Group with those of APEC Solutions 

group. 

 

None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

 

Transaction costs related to the acquisition of approximately RM186,000 have been recognised in the “Other 

expenses” line item in the Group’s profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2021.

The Group applies the simplified approach to measure the expected credit losses for trade receivables. To 

measure expected credit losses on a collective basis, trade receivables excluding those determined to be credit-

impaired are grouped based on similar credit risk and ageing. 

 

The expected loss rates are based on the Group’s historical credit losses experienced. The historical loss rates 

are then adjusted for current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the Group’s 

customers.

 

Other receivables from third parties are considered to be a low credit risk and subject to immaterial credit loss. 

Credit risk for these assets has not increased significantly since their initial recognition.

Lease liabilities (Continued)

finance lease is on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental 

payments.

 

Certain leases of the Group are secured over the right-of-use assets. The right-of-use assets with a carrying 

amount of RM86,000 (2020: RM824,000) (Note 5) are secured over the lease liabilities of RM163,000 (2020: 

RM678,000).

 

The total cash outflow at Group level from continuing operations in respect of leases amounted to RM304,000 

(2020: RM133,000). In the previous financial year, the total cash outflow at Group level from discontinuing 

operations in respect of leases amounted to RM245,000.

As at 31 December 2021, the Group has unutilised tax losses and unabsorbed capital allowances of 

approximately RM6,563,000 (2020: RM6,563,000) and RM2,270,000 (2020: RM2,644,000) respectively available 

for offset against future taxable profits and subject to the agreement by the tax authorities and provisions of 

the tax legislations of the respective countries in which the Group operates.

 

These deferred tax assets have not been recognised as it is not certain whether future taxable profits will 

be available against which the Group can utilise these benefits. Accordingly, these deferred tax assets have 

not been recognised in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2.16 to the 

financial statements.

 

The unutilised tax losses of Malaysian subsidiaries may be carried forward for a maximum period of 10 years 

in accordance with the provision in Malaysian’s Finance Act 2021 and the unutilised tax losses of Singapore 

subsidiaries may be carried indefinitely subject to the conditions imposed by the law.

The calculations of basic loss per share for the relevant periods are based on loss attributable to owners of the Company for the financial years 

ended 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in the relevant periods.

 

Diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share because the potential ordinary shares to be converted are anti-dilutive as the effect 

of the shares conversion would be to decrease the loss per share.

Financial instruments, financial risks and capital management

 

The Group’s and the Company’s activities expose them to credit risks, market risks (including foreign currency 

risks) and liquidity risks arising in the ordinary course of business. The Group’s and the Company’s overall risk 

management strategy seeks to minimise adverse effects from the volatility of financial markets on the Group’s 

and the Company’s financial performance.

 

The Board of Directors is responsible for setting the objectives and underlying principles of financial risk 

management for the Group and the Company. The management then establishes the detailed policies such as 

risk identification and measurement, exposure limits and hedging strategies, in accordance with the objectives 

and underlying principles approved by the Board of Directors.

 

The Group and the Company do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or to 

hedge against fluctuations, if any, in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

 

There has been no change to the Group’s and the Company’s exposure to these financial risks or the manner 

in which it manages and measures the risk. If necessary, market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity 

analysis indicated below.

 

31.1 Credit risks

 

 

Credit risks refer to the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a 

loss to the Group and the Company. The Group and the Company have adopted a policy of only dealing 

with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The 

Group and the Company perform ongoing credit evaluation of its counterparties’ financial condition and 

generally does not require collaterals.

 

 

The Group and the Company do not have any significant credit exposure to any single counterparty 

or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics except the Group and the Company 

have trade receivables from a third party and non-trade receivables from its subsidiaries amounting 

to approximately RM Nil (2020: RM2,973,000) and RM Nil (2020: RM1,860,000), respectively. Further 

disclosures regarding trade and other receivables are provided in Note 9 to the financial statements.

 

 

The carrying amounts of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, grossed up for any 

allowances for impairment losses, represents the Group’s and the Company’s maximum exposure to 

credit risks.

 

 

As the Group and the Company do not hold any collateral, the carrying amount of financial assets 

represents the maximum exposure to credit risk, except as follows:

31.1 Credit risks (Continued)

 

 

Credit risk also arises from bank balances and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks 

and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum rating “BBB+” are accepted.

 

 

Cash and cash equivalents

 

 

The cash and cash equivalents as at the end of the reporting period are held with the financial 

institutions with the following credit ratings:

The credit ratings above are derived from Fitch Ratings. The Board of Directors monitors the credit 

ratings of counterparties regularly. Impairment of cash and cash equivalents has been measured based 

on 12-month expected credit loss model. At the reporting date, the Group and Company did not expect 

any credit losses from non-performance by the counterparties.

 

 

For the corporate guarantee issued, the Company has assessed that this subsidiary has sufficient 

financial capabilities to meet its contractual cash flows obligation in the near future hence, does not 

expect any material loss allowance under 12-month expected credit loss model.

 

31.2 Market risks

 

 

Foreign currency risks

 

 

The Group incurs foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies 

other than the functional currency of entities within the Group. The Group transacts business in various 

foreign currencies and therefore is exposed to foreign exchange risk mainly from Singapore dollar and 

United States dollar transactions.

The Group has investments in foreign subsidiaries, whose net assets are exposed to currency translation 

risk. The Group does not currently designate its foreign currency denominated debt as a hedging 

instrument for the purpose of hedging the translation of its foreign operations.

 

 

Exposure to foreign currency risk is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the Group’s risk 

management policies to ensure that the net exposure is at an acceptable level.

 

 

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis

 

 

The following table details the sensitivity to a 2% change in Singapore dollar (2020: a 1% change in 

Singapore dollar) respectively against the functional currency of entities within the Group. The 

sensitivity rates above were used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management 

personnel and represents the management’s assessment of the possible change in foreign exchange 

rates.

 

 

The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and 

adjusts their translation as at the end of the reporting period for 2% (2020: 1%) respectively, change in 

foreign currency rates.

 

 

The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in the foreign currency exchange rates from 

the end of the reporting period, with all other variables held constant. The results of the model are also 

constrained by the fact that only monetary items, which is denominated in Singapore dollar is included 

in the analysis. Consequentially, reported changes in the values of some of the financial instruments 

impacting the results of the sensitivity analysis are not matched with the offsetting changes in the 

values of certain excluded items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge.

Liquidity risks refer to the risks in which the Group and the Company encounter difficulties in meeting 

short-term obligations. Liquidity risks are managed by matching the payment and receipt cycle.

 

 

The Group and the Company actively manage their operating cash flows so as to ensure that all 

payment needs are met. As part of overall prudent liquidity management, the Group and the Company 

minimise liquidity risk by ensuring the availability of funding through equity and maintain sufficient 

levels of cash to meet working capital requirements. The Company obtained a letter of financial support 

from the Director of the Company as disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements.

 

 

Contractual maturity analysis

 

 

The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial

31.4 Capital management policies and objectives

 

 

The Group and the Company manage capital to ensure that the Group and the Company are able to 

continue as a going concern and maintain an optimal capital structure so as to maximise shareholders’ 

value. As mentioned in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Group is dependent on continued 

financial support from its two directors, Mr. Lim Chiau Woei and Mr. Lim Beng Chew.

 

 

The management reviews the capital structure to ensure that the Group and the Company are able to 

service any debt obligations (including principal repayment and interest) based on their operating cash 

flows. Upon review, the Group and the Company will balance their overall capital structure through new 

share issues and the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt, if necessary. The Group’s and 

the Company’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 31 December 2020.

 

 

The Group and the Company monitor capital based on a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total 

equity plus net debt. The Group and the Company include within net debt, trade and other payables, 

borrowings and lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents. Total equity comprises of share capital 

plus reserves.

31.5 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities

 

 

 

The carrying amounts of the Group’s and the Company’s current financial assets and current financial 

liabilities approximate their respective fair values as at the end of the reporting period due to the 

relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments.

 

 

The Group and the Company classifies fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects 

the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the 

following levels:

 

 

l 

Level 1 - the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and 

conditions and which trade in active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted 

market prices; 

 

 

l 

Level 2 - in the absence of quoted market prices, the fair values of the other financial assets and 

financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined using the other observable 

inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for 

identical or similar assets/liabilities in non-active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that 

are observable for the asset or liability; and 

 

 

l 

Level 3 - in the absence of observable inputs, the fair values of the remaining financial assets 

and financial liabilities (excluding derivatives instruments) are determined in accordance with 

generally accepted pricing models.

reducing the mining concession area. As a result, the Group had returned the mining concession rights of the 

Bukit Chetai granite quarry site to PMINT and the Group’s mining right will be limited to the green field Bukit 

Machang only, which will require material capital investment to commence production.

Minutes of the Meeting will be published on SGXNet and the Company’s website at https://www.vcplus.sg/investor-relations/, and the 

minutes would include the responses to the substantial and relevant questions addressed at the Meeting. 

4. 

Voting

 

As part of the Company’s efforts to minimise the risk of community spread of COVID-19, a member of the Company will not be able to attend 

the Meeting in person. If a member of the Company (whether individual or corporate) wishes to exercise his/her/its voting rights at the 

Meeting, he/she/it may cast his/her/its votes remotely in real time via the Live Webcast. 

 

As an alternative to the aforesaid real-time electronic voting, members may appoint a proxy or proxies to vote on his/her/its behalf at the 

Meeting. The proxy or proxies may cast his/her/its votes remotely in real time via the Live Webcast. 

 

A member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM (who is not a relevant intermediary as defined in Section 181 of the Companies Act 

1967) is entitled to appoint one or two proxies to attend and vote in his/her/its stead. Where a member appoints more than one proxy, the 

appointments shall be invalid unless he/she/it specifies the proportion of his/her/its shareholding (expressed as a percentage of the whole) 

to be represented by each proxy. 

 

A member who is a relevant intermediary entitled to attend and vote at the AGM is entitled to appoint more than one proxy to attend and 

vote instead of the member, but each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different Share or Shares held by such 

shareholder. Where such member appoints more than one proxy, it should annex to the Proxy Form the list of proxies, setting out, in respect 

of each proxy, the name, address, email address, NRIC/Passport Number and proportion of shareholding (number of Shares and percentage) 

in relation to which each proxy has been appointed. For the avoidance of doubt, a CPF Agent Bank/SRS Operator who intends to appoint 

CPF/SRS investors as its proxies shall comply with this Note. The appointments shall be invalid unless the member specifies the number of 

Shares in relation to which each proxy has been appointed in the Proxy Form.

 

Members may also vote at the AGM by appointing the Chairman of the AGM as his/her/its proxy to vote on his/her/its behalf at the Meeting. In 

appointing the Chairman of the AGM as proxy, a member of the Company (whether individual or corporate) must give specific instructions as 

to voting, or abstentions from voting, in the proxy form, failing which the appointment will be treated as invalid. 

 

In addition, CPF/SRS investors who have used their CPF/SRS monies to buy Shares in the Company: 

 

(a) 

may vote live via electronic means at the AGM if they are appointed as proxies by their respective CPF Agent Banks/SRS Operators, 

and should contact their respective CPF Agent Banks/SRS Operators if they have questions regarding their appointment as proxies; or 

 

(b) 

may appoint the Chairman of the AGM as proxy to vote on their behalf at the AGM, in which case they should approach their 

respective CPF Agent Banks/SRS Operators no later than 10.00 a.m. on 20 April 2022 (being seven (7) working days before the AGM).
