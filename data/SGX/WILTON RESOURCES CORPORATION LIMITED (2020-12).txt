BOARD STATEMENT

On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), we are pleased to present the third Sustainability Report of Wilton 

Resources Corporation Limited (“Wilton” or the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) for the 

financial year ended 31 December (“FY”) 20201. This report presents the Group’s sustainability strategy and performance 

as we embark on a journey to capture and create value, and promote sustainable development.

In this reporting period, there were no significant changes in the scale of our operation as we have not commenced our 

commercial production phase. 

With the spread of the Covid-19 virus globally in early 2020, new travel and social distancing restrictions were introduced 

which has resulted in delays to our projects during the year. As such, our priority in FY2020 was to adjust to the evolving 

environment while ensuring that the needs and concerns of our key stakholders are met, all employees and workers 

are healthy and safe. Despite the delays in the projects, we have worked closely with our Engineering, Procurement, 

Construction and Management (“EPCM”) Contractor for the Processing Facility to manage the project delays and plan for 

the restart of our construction activities at the Processing Facility. 

We also continued to uphold our pledge to provide a healthy and safe workplace for all our employees and contractors. 

In FY2020, we have made progress in advancing our occupational health and safety management system and it is in 

the process of being formalised. In addition, we are pleased to note that there were zero fatalities, injuries and high-

consequence injuries reported during the year. 

Looking ahead, there are some signs that recovery from the pandemic is well on its way. With the introduction of the 

Covid-19 vaccine and the private vaccination programme in Indonesia, we expect the situation to improve and that 

we will be able to resume our operations in a calibrated manner moving forward. Nonetheless, we will remain vigilant 

and responsive to the ever changing environment. We will also continue to uphold our commitment to ensure that our 

operations are sustainable and that we will create positive impacts for our employees, as well as the local communities.

ABOUT WILTON

OUR BUSINESS

Wilton Resources Corporation Limited is listed on the Catalist Board of the Singapore 

Exchange and the Company’s subsidiary, PT. Wilton Makmur Indonesia Tbk is listed on the 

Development Board of the Indonesian Stock Exchange. Wilton is headquartered in Jakarta 

and is engaged in the exploration, mining and production of gold dore in Indonesia - a 

major gold producing country. The Group’s concession area in West Java (“Ciemas Gold 

Project”) covers a total area of 3,078.5 hectares.

Most of our suppliers engaged to support our exploration and production activities includes consultants, legal entites, 

contractors, subcontractors and equipment providers. 

Based on the latest Independent Qualified Person’s Report (“IQPR”)2, it is estimated that the Ciemas Gold Project contains 

approximately 3,260 kilotonnes (“kt”) of ore reserves with an average grade of about 7.7 g/t of gold . In terms of mineral 

resources, it is estimated that the Ciemas Gold Project has approximately 3,415 kt of measured and indicated mineral 

resources and 2,559 kt of inferred mineral resources, with an average grade of approximately 8.6 g/t and 6.5 g/t of gold3, 

respectively.

As a result of the travel restrictions for China contractors and social distancing restrictions in Indonesia, operations at the 

mining site were delayed during the year to ensure employee and worker safety. As of 31 December 2020, the construction 

of the 500 tonnes per day Flotation and Carbon-In-Leech mineral processing plant and its associated supporting facilities 

were mostly completed. These facilities will play a key role in unclocking the potential of the Ciemas Gold Project as we 

enter into the production phase.

OUR PEOPLE

As at 31 December 2020, Wilton has a total of 44 employees across our operations in Indonesia and corporate office 

in Singapore. This is a decrease from 56 employees as compared to the previous reporting period4. The decrease in 

employees is primarily attributed to the slowdown in economic activity resulting from disruptions caused by the pandemic. 

All employees are hired on a full-time basis. Wilton’s operations are also supported by outsourced workers who provide 

cleaning, security and mining services. 

As the mining industry traditionally attracts more male applicants, our employee profile reflects a higher proportion of 

males as compared to females. During the reporting period, there was also a decrease in the proportion of females to 

males. This decrease is a result of a reduction in female staff working in departments such as purchasing, finance and 

human resources due to reduced operational requirements. In FY2020, 18.2% of our employees were female. Nonetheless, 

Wilton strives to maintain a diverse and inclusive environment. The profile of our employees are presented in Figures 4 

and 5 below.

ABOUT WILTON (Continued)

In FY2020, the new hire rate5 was 11.3% and the turnover rate6 was 38.6% respectively. This is a significant change when 

compared to the previous reporting period where the new hire rate was 19.6% and turnover rate was 21.4%. The change 

in both hiring and turnover rates were both a result of the economic slowdown due to the pandemic. To reduce overheads, 

Directors of the Company  have voluntarily offered a 30% reduction in director fees. Additionally, Wilton employees were 

provided additional training during the year to ensure that they are equipped with the skills and capabilities cover multiple 

roles and ensure that the company is able to continue operating with the reduced manpower. In the long term, Wilton 

intends to hire more employees as the mining operations enter into the production phase.

OUR COVID-19 RESPONSE

Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted economies globally, and our business was not spared. Wilton’s 

priority for the year was to adjust to the changing environment and ensure the health and safety of our key stakeholders. 

We have also implemented measures and taken steps to address our key stakeholders concerns and will continue to work 

closely with them moving forward.

We seek to maintain close communications with our suppliers to update them on the status of

Local communities



Wilton remains committed to contributing back and improving the livelihoods of the local 

communities where we operate in. However, due to the social distancing restrictions arising from 

Covid-19, we were not able to implement any CSR efforts in FY2020. We will continue to monitor 

the developments and look forward to recommence our CSR efforts soon. 

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

Wilton recognises that mining activities can generate significant environmental and social impacts. This includes impact 

on air, water and soil quality, wildlife and the livelihoods of the local communities. If not managed properly, this may 

result in operational and reputational risks to the company. To this end, we seek to manage these risks by identifying and 

addressing our material sustainability topics. 

Wilton defines our material sustainability topics as ESG matters that have significant impacts to our business and 

stakeholders. In our inaugural sustainability report issued on 18 April 2019, we undertook a three-step materiality 

assessment process, to identify our material sustainability topics. In this reporting period, we reviewed the existing material 

sustainability topics which was validated by our key management and confirmed that the four material sustainability topics 

are still relevant and applicable to Wilton. Figure 10 summarises our materiality assessment process.

Step 1: Consolidated potential ESG matters through high level peer reviews and series of 

interview with key internal stakeholders

Step 2: Prioritised potential ESG matters through a materiality assessment workshop. 

Both internal and external stakeholders’ perspectives were considered in the exercise.

Step 3: Validated material sustainability topics by the Board 

Step 4: Annual review of material sustainability topics to ensure the continued 

relevance to our business

As we embark on our growth journey, we plan to reassess our material sustainability topics and to progressively disclose 

more material sustainability topics in the future reporting periods. Our four material sustainabilitytopics are presented in 

Figure 11 below. The matters are not numbered in order of priority or importance.

Due to strict social restrictions in place arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, Wilton was unable to implement any of the planned CSR 

activities in FY2020. Instead, Wilton continued to support local communities by way of financial support to various local community 

beneficiaries and donated 208 million IDR in 2020.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2020

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

In the mining sector, the management of Operational Health and Safety (“OHS”) 

is a critical issue. As mining is a high risk activity, poor management of OHS can 

result in severe injury or even death, affecting all stakeholders. This reporting 

period, OHS  practices of businesses have also received increased scrutiny due 

to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Wilton believes that the good management of OHS is imperative to the 

sustainable growth of the group. Promoting a healthy and safe workplace has 

always been our highest priority, and we remain committed to working towards 

the goal of zero-work related incidents.

OUR APPROACH

Since the previous reporting period, Wilton has been in the process of formalising 

our Health, Safety and Environment (“HSE”) system. When complete, Wilton will 

certify its HSE system with ISO45001:2018 certification. Although the system 

has not been fully implemented due to delays arising from the pandemic, key 

elements of the HSE system have been implemented. The HSE management 

system will cover operations in Indonesia, including our headquarters in Jakarta 

and mining site in West Java.

The HSE system is managed by a “Zero Accident Committee” which is led 

by the Mining Head and Deputy Mining Head. This committee is supported 

by various project management team at our mining site. The committee is 

responsible for ensuring all OHS targets are met through the implementation 

of health and safety programmes, as well as reviewing the effectiveness of the 

management system. This committee will also work closely with employees and 

workers to obtain feedback on the management system and make appropriate 

amendments based on the inputs of Wilton’s employees.

Wilton’s HSE management system is established based on the plan-do-check 

action model. The iterative four-step cycle provides a framework to continually 

improve our HSE management system through identification of HSE key risks 

and hazards, implementation of HSE programmes, as well as regular monitoring 

and review of HSE performance. Wilton regularly conducts safety patrols and 

safety inspections to identify any unsafe conditions and implement necessary 

measures to prevent incident at our mining site. In the event that there is an 

incident, corrective actions will be discussed with the committee and measures 

will be taken, using the hierarchy of control, to reduce the risk of such incidents 

from occurring again. The HSE policy will be reviewed annually to ensure its 

continued relevance to our operations. Figure 14 illustrates Wilton’s HSE 

management framework.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (Continued)

Figure 14. Wilton’s OHS Management Framework

Further, as part of our efforts in minimising safety risks in our operation, we screen both our vendors and miners to ensure 

that they have relevant competencies and safety certifications in the mining sector prior to working with us. 

We advocate the “safety first” culture to all levels of the workforce through several avenues such as daily safety talks, 

safety training, and fire drills. We mandate that all our employees and contractors are responsible for their own safety as 

well as the safety of those working alongside them. We expect all employees to comply with relevant safety regulations 

and standards. 

During the FY2019 and FY2020, there were no work-related injuries reported. It should be noted that during this reporting 

period, Wilton’s mining operations have not started commercial operations and hence, the risk of work-related injuries 

is lower. As mining operations commence, we expect that  employees and workers may be subjected to higher risk of 

work-related injuries. In this regard, through our management system which will be formalised soon, Wilton will strive to 

achieve zero cases of work-related incidents even when our mines are fully operational. Figure 15 summarises our OHS 

performance for FY2019 and FY2020.

EMPOWERING LOCAL COMMUNITIES

Wilton recognises it has a responsibility to empower local communities in 

the places that it operates. We understand that the Group’s presence should 

bring positive impacts to the communities where we operate. Working closely 

with local communities can also prevent potential conflicts that may arise from 

misunderstanding. The empower of local communities not provides mutual 

benefits for the community as well as the Group’s business through various 

support from the communities to our operations.

OUR APPROACH

Wilton has implement a ‘Wilton Care programme’, to manage the Group’s 

various Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) initiatives. 

Apart from all our CSR efforts, we contribute to the livelihood of the local 

communities by providing direct and indirect economic benefits to local 

communities. Where possible, Wilton hires locals for outsourced employees 

and purchases supplies (sand, stones, cement etc) from local suppliers. Through 

on-the-job-training, we seek to upgrade the skillsets and competencies of 

outsourced employees in the mining sector. 

Regular engagements with the local community are conducted to understand 

their evolving needs better and to ensure that our CSR activities are able to 

address these needs. We strive to enhance our CSR activities so as to assist 

the local communities in improving their standard of living and contributing in 

developing of the local economy.

Due to strict social restrictions in place arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, Wilton 

was unable to implement any of the planned CSR activities for FY2020. Instead, 

Wilton provided financial support to various local community beneficiaries and 

donated 208 million IDR in FY2020. To this end, we will continue to monitor any 

Covid-19 developments and assess the situation before resuming any of our 

CSR activities to ensure the safety of the local communities.  

Conduct six corporate 

social responsibility 

activities 

In FY2019, corporate 

social responsibility 

activities were conducted. 

However, due to strict 

social restrictions arising 

from the Covid-19 

pandemic, Wilton was 

unable to implement 

any CSR activities in 

FY2020. Instead, Wilton 

continued to support 

local communities by way 

of financial support.

LAND MANAGEMENT

Wilton recognises that it has a responsibility towards managing the impacts 

that its operations has on the environment. Poorly managed mining operations 

can result in both short-term and long-term harm to the environment and local 

communities living in the periphery of the mine. Wilton takes all practicable 

efforts to ensure that it meets the regulatory requirements throughout the 

lifecycle of mine operations. 

OUR APPROACH

As part of our effort in managing the environmental impacts of our activities, 

we plan to carry out underground mining operation in the early phase of our 

commercial production before exploring the surface mining operation. This 

effort enables us to minimise the potential environmental impacts as the 

underground mining operation limits the disturbance to the surface landscape 

of the mine area.

To manage post-mining rehabilitation, Wilton has in place a mine closure 

plan before the commencement of mining activities. This plan consists of 

environmental and social management programmes, including reclamation and 

revegetation plan. The mine closure plan has been approved by the Ministry of 

Energy and Mineral Resources and is developed in alignment with the relevant 

laws and regulations. The plan serves as a guidance for our rehabilitation effort 

and considers the physical, biological, and social aspect of our mine area. It 

is expected that through this plan, the natural environment and local social 

function of the area can be restored for its future intended purposes.

Our commitment to land reclamation and rehabilitation also reflects through 

our financial commitments. We have identified the estimated investment for 

post-mining closure activities in our Environmental Impact Assessments study. 

Further, we have provided a monetary deposit to guarantee our reclamation 

efforts and mine closure to the Government of Indonesia. Figure 16 summarises 

our plans for land management at the post-mining phase.

We have also received the “Clear and Clean” certification by the Directorate 

General of Minerals and Coal through our subsidiaries, PT. Wilton Wahana 

Indonesia and PT. Liektucha Ciemas. The certification was given by the 

government to companies that have fully complied with the relevant 

environmental and mining laws and regulations in Indonesia. The “Clear and 

Clean” certificates can be found in Figure 17 below. 

Reclaim 230 hectares 

(“ha”) of land area at
