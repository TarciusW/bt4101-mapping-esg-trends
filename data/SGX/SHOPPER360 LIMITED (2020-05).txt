3. APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

 





 

The Board remains committed to building on the efforts in sustainability and progress made by the 

Group in the previous year. The Group believes that responding to rapidly changing stakeholder 

interests is crucial in sustaining its business growth and strongly recognises the importance of a 

meaningful engagement with its stakeholders to understand their key concerns and interests.  

 

 

 

The Group recognises the importance of effective communication to ensure that our stakeholders 

understand our business, governance, financial performance and prospects. An important point in 

sustainability reporting is to identify our stakeholders and the material aspects relevant to our 

business. 

 

We define our stakeholders as those impacted by our business activities, who have direct and 

indirect involvement and whose interest may have positive or negative consequences due to our 

business activities. The interests and requirements of key stakeholders are also taken into account 

when formulating corporate strategies. These key stakeholders include, but are not limited to 

suppliers, employees, investor and shareholders, customers, and government and regulators. We 

adopt both formal and informal channels of communication to understand the needs of key 

stakeholders, and incorporate these into our corporate strategies to achieve mutually beneficial 

relationships. 

 

Through the above steps, we were able to gain an understanding of the sustainability issues that 

matter most to our key stakeholders. We then earmarked the material factors and assessed their 

materiality in the context of our business operations, with reference to the respective GRI standards. 

 

The Group is committed in engaging all of our stakeholders as part of our continued sustainability 

endeavors. We view stakeholder engagement as a continual process and not a one-off event. The 

identification and management of material issues are carried out annually to ensure their relevance 

to our stakeholders.

3. APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 





 

We have identified these material topics for reporting based on the significance of our EESG factors 

and the degree of influence where we see the most potential for creating maximum value for our 

shareholders and stakeholders. The materiality assessment was guided by inputs from our 

management and key representatives from business units as well as some external stakeholders.  

Material topics are reviewed annually for their continued relevance according to current global and 

local trends.  

In FY2020, we have assessed the EESG issues previously identified in FY2019 through continuous 

stakeholder engagement and conclude that they continue to be relevant to our business and 

stakeholders. In addition, through our assessment and prioritisation of material topics, we have 

identified 1 new material topic, namely Diversity and Equal Opportunity.

this value has been communicated to all of our employees,

laws and regulations in FY2020.  

The Group has established a whistle-blowing policy with 

the aim of providing a structured mechanism for employees and other stakeholders to report any 

concerns on any suspected or wrongful activities or wrongdoings. These refer to any potential 

violations or concerns relating to any laws, rules, regulations, acts, ethics, integrity and business 

conduct, including any violation or concerns relating to malpractice, illegal, immoral, embezzlement

with a fulfilling and meaningful career. 

 

Every employee plays an essential role in the Group. Continuous open dialogue is the main 

platform used to engage our employees. Open dialogues are conducted informally to encourage 

employees to raise any issues to management. We believe that this provides a more interactive 

and direct channel for any form of feedback.

Building and retaining talent are both critical in growing the Group as the continuous growth of the 

Group needs talented employees. Having a diverse workforce with equal opportunity regardless of 

age, race and gender is one of the ways to build and retain talent. Our employees are not covered by 

collective bargaining agreements but are given the rights to exercise freedom of association. 

 

Our diversity is not just limited to our employees but also represented in our Board of Directors. Our 

Directors come from different backgrounds which helps to expand the range of perspectives at the 

top and enables the Board to better advise the Group strategically. 

 

The Board of Directors comprises 5 members, of which three are women. The profile of each of our 

Directors can be found on pages 6 to 7 of our Annual Report 2020.

shopper360 believes in nurturing its employees to raise the 

employees’ learning and development capacity, yielding a 

capable and more agile workforce.  

 

We encourage and aim to provide all employees with equal 

opportunities for training and upgrading. We acknowledge 

that learning and training is an important, continuous and 

life-long process so that employees are equipped with the 

competencies needed to meet current and future business 

needs. This includes workshops, seminars, conferences, 

in-house company training and on-the-job training. We 

believe that the personal growth of the employees would elevate our organisational performance 

and help in achieving long-term business growth and sustainability for the Group. 

 

shopper360 has been recognised as one of the best companies to work for by HR Asia in the past. 

As a Group, we are continuously striving to create a collaborative and fulfilling working environment 

for all of our employees. This can only be achieved with carefully designed innovative employee 

engagement and development programmes. 

 

We have not stopped short in our efforts to be thought leaders in our industry, whether by attending 

overseas expo, hosting shopper marketing talks or constantly upskilling our staff through various 

training programs.  

 

Staff training and the continuing development of the employees are essential for the success of our 

Group. In a rapid changing business environment, we will need to ensure that the training needs 

are optimised, and meet the purpose of upgrading the skillset of our workforce. We believe as the 

market evolves, so must the skill set of learning professionals. As such, we have continued to be 

adaptive to the employees training requirements. Despite the prevailing market conditions, 

shopper360 has managed to achieve an average training hour of 9.89 hours per staff (permanent 

staff) for FY2020. The courses attended by our employees in FY2020 included Microsoft Excel, winning 

debt collection skills, the five steps selling process and problem solving.  

 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to organise internal and external trainings has been 

uncertain and disrupted.  Hence, for FY2021, we are moving more to a virtual learning environment 

including self-learning platforms and webinar workshops utilising technology to enable learning 

whenever possible even when there is a work from home order.  Courses to be conducted include 

but not limited to English language, leadership, soft skills, Microsoft Excel and other business 

related topics.
