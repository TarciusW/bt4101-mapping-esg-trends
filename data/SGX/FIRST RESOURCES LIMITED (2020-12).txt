CEO'S 

MESSAGE



Dear Stakeholders, 

I 

am pleased to present First 

Resources’ Sustainability 

Report 2020, communicating 

our sustainability commitments, 

approach and progress. 

MANAGING THE COVID-19 

PANDEMIC

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 

has resulted in unprecedented 

impacts across the world in 2020. 

While early signs of recovery are 

under way, the pandemic has 

reinforced the importance of 

integrating sustainable practices 

within our business strategy and 

operations to ensure resilience and 

support in our ability to create long-

term value for stakeholders. 

With over 20,000 employees 

supporting our operations, we 

have a responsibility to ensure their 

livelihoods and wellbeing continue to 

be protected during the pandemic. 

The safety and wellbeing of our 

workforce, as well as the surrounding 

communities where we operate, 

became our priority from the onset 

of the pandemic. To minimise the 

risk of transmission among our 

employees, we put in place safe 

working measures aligned with the 

latest regulations and provided 

equipment to facilitate working from 

home wherever possible. Given 

the onsite nature of much of our 

labour force, we also provided face 

masks, hand sanitisers and ensured 

safe-distancing measures and self-

isolation protocol are observed. 

Furthermore, we have been very 

cognisant of the impact that the 

pandemic also had on the livelihoods 

of communities. As a result, we worked 

closely with local authorities to provide 

our local community stakeholders with 

food staples, such as rice, cooking 

oil and sugar, as well as contributed 

personal protective equipment (PPE), 

including face masks and suits for the 

local medical teams.  

PROGRESS IN 2020

Through our swift response and 

collective action of our employees, 

our business has remained resilient 

through the events of 2020, and the 

pandemic has had minimal impact 

to our operations. This is partly due 

to our digitalisation efforts, which 

had begun before the pandemic, 

that allowed us to quickly adapt and 

switch to web-based communication 

channels and intensify the usage of 

digital tools to manage the business. 

As a key cog in the global food 

supply network, the palm plantation 

sector has also been deemed an 

essential sector and has been 

allowed to continue operations 

subject to suitable safety protocols 

being established. However, there 

has been operational challenges 

brought about by the pandemic. 

The impediment to movements 

has hindered our ability to recruit 

workers, the flexibility for workers to 

travel home for their annual mudik

exercise during the Hari Raya Idul Fitri  

celebration, and implementation of 

on-site audits for certifications of our 

mills and plantations. 

Despite these challenges, we are 

pleased that we have continued 

to make meaningful progress in a 

number of areas. Having achieved 

a 100% traceability to mills since 

2017, we are also proud to announce 

that we have met our 2020 target of 

100% traceability to plantations for 

fresh fruit bunches (FFB) processed  

at our mills. 

Through our oil palm breeding 

programmes, we are currently 

developing a second generation 

of higher-yielding oil palm planting 

materials and studying the potential 

of the interspecific hybrid of different 

oil palm species Elaeis oleifera x 

Elaeis guineensis to be one of our 

own planting materials. We aim to 

produce oil palm trees with better oil 

quality, slower trunk height increment 

plus shorter frond length, which will 

help with harvesting and increase the 

oil palm density per hectare.

On the environmental front, we 

successfully phased out the use 

of paraquat, a herbicide with high 

toxicity levels, replacing it with more 

environmentally-friendly alternatives. 

We also achieved an improved water 

consumption intensity of 0.94 cubic 

metres per tonne of FFB processed, 

meeting our target of 1.0 cubic 

metres per tonne of FFB processed. 

Two new methane capture facilities 

were installed in 2020. One has 

begun its operations in the fourth 

quarter of 2020 and another is 

being commissioned right now. The 

new methane capture facilities are 

expected to avoid greenhouse gas 

emissions by approximately 50,000 

tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 

per year which is comparable to 

10,8021 passenger vehicles driven for 

one year. 

For employees, during the 

past year we introduced a new 

leadership training programme 

called the Executive Development 

Programme to identify and develop 

future leaders. Candidates will be 

trained in topics ranging from labour 

laws to leadership and financial 

management. We also continued to 

train our wider employee base on 

a variety of topics through virtual 

channels. 

LOOKING AHEAD

Our Board regularly reviews the 

material Environmental, Social 

and Governance factors facing the 

business and consider them as part 

of our strategy formulation, making 

sure they are properly managed and 

monitored, and that we continue to 

strive for continuous improvement 

going forward. 

2020 served as a checkpoint for 

the palm oil sector as it reviews

the achievements made against No 

Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation 

(NDPE) commitments. While the 

palm oil industry has made progress 

on the deforestation and peat front, 

there is still work to be done to limit 

deforestation and promote sustainable 

agricultural practices. We remain 

committed to our NDPE Policy and to 

influencing others in our value chain to  

do the same.

The next step is to increase our focus 

on the social aspects of our business, 

particularly our labour practices and 

how we respect and protect human 

rights. As a human centric business, 

we see the impact we have on people 

as both a critical responsibility and an 

important factor to our own success. 

We will need to carefully consider our 

impact on people when developing and 

implementing our sustainability policies 

and practices. 

As we recover from the pandemic 

and resume our audit and certification 

processes, I am hopeful that we will 

see more progress in 2021 as we 

continue our certification programme. 

In particular, we have set ourselves a 

target to execute the Roundtable on 

Sustainable Palm Oil audits for six of our 

mills within the year, if conditions allow 

us to do so safely. 

Finally, let me thank our employees and 

all our stakeholders for staying with us 

on our sustainability journey, particularly 

in these difficult times. I do hope that 

the sustainability achievements and 

positive impacts made by the industry 

thus far are recognised, as it has not 

yet received its due credit. This will 

encourage more producers to come 

onboard this journey as we transform 

the industry together. Our commitment 

to sustainability is unwavering and I 

believe that with this focus, we will 

emerge stronger from this pandemic.

Supported by a workforce of 21,169 

employees, we manage a total of 213,461 

hectares of both nucleus and plasma planted 

area across the Indonesian provinces of Riau, 

West Kalimantan and East Kalimantan. Of 

the total, 182,029 hectares are our oil palm 

plantations while another 31,432 hectares 

belong to smallholder plasma schemes. 

Almost half of our plantations are of prime 

age and approximately 6% are in their 

immature age. Our largest planted area is 

located in Riau, which contributes to 69% 

of our fresh fruit bunches (FFB) production, 

while the remaining 31% are provided by our 

plantations in West and East Kalimantan. In 

2020, First Resources produced more than  

3.2 million tonnes of FFB (from both nucleus 

and plasma estates).

Apart from our plantations, we also 

operate 18 palm oil mills, one of which was 

commissioned in 2020, one kernel crushing 

plant and two processing plants in Indonesia. 

Our total crude palm oil production in 2020 was 

855,668 tonnes.

Established in 1992 and 

listed on the Singapore 

Exchange (SGX) since 

2007, First Resources 

is one of the leading 

palm oil producers in the 

region and has grown 

into an integrated player 

with its own processing 

capabilities. As of 12th 

March 2021, Eight 

Capital Inc. holds 66% 

of our company shares 

(excluding treasury shares), 

a further 18% are held by 

three other substantial 

shareholders, while the rest 

are held by the public.

OUR APPROACH 

TO SUSTAINABILITY

[102-16]

As an agribusiness, our success 

depends on the health of the 

environment and our ability to 

create long-term value for our 

stakeholders. Sustainability is 

therefore implicit within our values, 

which guide our behaviours, actions 

and decisions. Our values, described 

on our website, are Loyalty, Integrity, 

Diligence, Persistence and Care.

Our approach to sustainability is 

also informed by the interests and 

concerns of key stakeholders whom 

we engage with regularly. We take 

an inclusive approach and work 

constructively with them to ensure 

that we maintain an open dialogue. 

A summary of our main stakeholder 

engagement efforts in 2020 can 

be found in the Materiality and 

Stakeholder Engagement section 

of this report.  

OUR POLICY ON 

SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL 

In 2015, we launched our  

Policy on Sustainable Palm Oil, 

which sets out our commitments 

to “No Deforestation, No Peat and 

No Exploitation”, also referred to as 

our NDPE Policy. Our commitments 

guide us towards our goal of 

ensuring that the establishment 

and management of our oil palm 

plantations provide genuine long-

term economic and social benefits 

for the local communities where 

we operate and beyond, while 

protecting the environment. It 

communicates the environmental 

and social standards that we expect 

to be upheld across our operations, 

including our subsidiaries and 

associated companies, as well as 

by our third-party suppliers. 

We engage and train all relevant 

employees on our Policy. We also 

socialise our Policy with all our 

suppliers, through our supplier 

onboarding process, one-on-

one meetings or group sessions 

to help them understand our 

commitments and the importance 

of aligning their practices with our 

requirements. For more details on 

our engagement with our suppliers, 

see the section on Supply Chain. 

Our Policy encompasses commitments around four main areas:

ENVIRONMENTAL  

MANAGEMENT

Ensuring zero burning and no development on High 

Carbon Stock (HCS) forests, High Conservation Value 

(HCV) areas and peat areas, as well as increasing 

yield, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) 

progressively and adopting agronomic best practices 

to minimise our environmental impact 

SUPPLY CHAIN

Working towards a traceable and transparent 

supply chain, with an aim to build a network 

of suppliers that upholds our sustainability 

goals and practices, as set out in our Policy

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS 

AND WORKPLACE

Respecting labour standards and human 

rights of all our employees, including 

contract and temporary workers

COMMUNITY

OUR APPROACH  

TO SUSTAINABILITY

GOVERNANCE OF 

SUSTAINABILITY [102-18,  

102-19, 102-20, 102-21, 102-26,  

102-32, 103-3]

We are committed to maintaining 

the highest standards of corporate 

governance at First Resources. This is 

crucial for the effective implementation 

of our policies and ensuring that 

we improve our performance on an 

ongoing basis. The Board, led by the 

Chairman, has oversight of sustainability 

matters and receives regular updates 

on important sustainability issues. 

Sustainability topics are further 

discussed and addressed in quarterly 

management meetings, where 

representatives from all key areas of our 

operations are present. 

Responsibility for the day-to-day 

implementation of our sustainability 

policy is delegated to our Head of 

Sustainability, who reports directly to 

the CEO, and is supported by a team of 

skilled experts from across our business. 

We have integrated sustainability 

throughout our management systems, 

professionalism and work ethics, 

conflicts of interest, political impartiality, 

anti-corruption and zero tolerance to 

fraud. All our employees are required to 

comply with all applicable country laws, 

regulations and legal requirements. 

Any breach of the Code of Conduct 

can result in disciplinary action and 

termination of employment. 

We socialise the Code of Conduct 

with all new employees as part of their 

onboarding process. An email reminder 

on compliance with the Code of 

Conduct as well as any relevant updates 

is sent to all employees on an annual 

basis. We also disseminate the Code of 

Conduct to all our suppliers and other 

business partners.  

In addition, we have put in place 

procedures to prevent conflict of 

interest in relation to procurement as 

well as to ensure that only authorised 

persons can approve business processes 

and transactions. 

including the key performance indicators 

of relevant senior executives and other 

employees with functional responsibility 

at an operational level. Operational 

teams are required to provide regular 

cross-departmental updates on key 

issues – including hotspots and fire 

incidents, the status of land clearing, 

and any incidents of conflict with local 

communities – to the regional and 

corporate sustainability teams.

BUSINESS CONDUCT AND 

ETHICS [103-1, 103-2, 103-3,  

205-2]

Our Code of Conduct, developed in 

line with the Group’s vision and mission,

OUR APPROACH  

TO SUSTAINABILITY

MONITORING AND 

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 

[102-17, 103-3]

To ensure that our commitments 

are implemented, we have set up 

a robust system where practices 

and performance related to our 

policies can be monitored and 

reported. We have two distinct 

mechanisms for reporting concerns 

or complaints: our whistleblowing 

procedure and our grievance 

procedure. Both mechanisms 

are open to external and internal 

stakeholders. 

WHISTLEBLOWING PROCEDURE 

Our whistleblowing procedure is 

designed to ensure that employees 

and business partners have a safe, 

anonymous and straightforward 

channel to alert us to concerns, 

non-compliances or grievances. 

The system makes use of channels 

such as anonymous complaint 

boxes in estates, short message 

service, phone and email, to 

ensure easy access. Complaints 

raised through these channels 

are generally handled locally but 

can be escalated to the Audit 

Committee when necessary. 

First Resources does not tolerate 

or condone any retaliatory actions 

taken against any employee for 

raising a compliance or integrity 

issue. The Company may take 

disciplinary action against any 

party found to have taken 

such retaliatory actions against 

whistleblowers. Anyone wishing to 

make a whistleblowing report may 

refer to the details on our website. 

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 

Our grievance procedure allows 

stakeholders to register sustainability-

related concerns, particularly with 

regard to our Policy on Sustainable 

Palm Oil, such as those related to 

deforestation, land disputes, human 

rights or general labour issues.

Grievances can be submitted via 

email to our Grievance Officer or 

can be posted via mail to our office 

address as follows:

Singapore 038988

Attn: Grievance Officer 

(Sustainability Department)

E sustainability@first-resources.com

Our philosophy is to work collaboratively and 

constructively with all our stakeholders. We 

want stakeholders to engage us directly with 

their concerns so that these can be 

investigated and addressed through 

remediation, if necessary, and as quickly 

as possible. We appreciate and welcome 

stakeholders, including non-governmental 

organisations, to engage positively with 

us and help us to address any gaps in our 

operations. Our grievance list is updated 

regularly and is available on our website.

YIELD AND EXTRACTION 

IMPROVEMENTS [103-1,  

103-2, 103-3]

Palm oil has the highest yield 

compared to other alternative oil 

crops, demonstrating efficiency 

in terms of output harvested per 

hectare. The versatility of palm oil 

also allows it to be used in various 

food and non-food products, 

thus driving demand but at the 

same time raising concerns on 

the environmental impacts of 

the industry. One of the biggest 

concerns is the clearing of land  

for plantations. 

To protect the environment and 

ensure the long-term success of  

our business, we continue to 

explore opportunities for more 

sustainable production through 

research and development 

initiatives. A key area of opportunity 

is the improvement of yield and 

extraction rates which can support 

our business growth without the 

need to develop new land. 

YIELD AND EXTRACTION RATES 

Palm oil yield and extraction rates 

are dependent on a combination of 

complex factors including plantation 

age profile, weather changes, 

diseases and pests management, 

soil type, fertiliser application and 

harvesting efficiency. 

To ensure high yields, we focus on 

ensuring that the age profile of our 

oil palm plantations is largely within 

the prime age of 8-17 years old.  

Oil palms that exceed their prime 

age are scheduled for replanting.  

In addition, we also employ 

practices to improve productivity 

such as: 

• Replanting with our higher 

yielding planting materials 

developed through research 

which can be harvested in two 

and a half years instead of three; 

• Customised fertilisation by 

plantation blocks to optimise 

nutritional uptake by the  

oil palms;

• Increased mechanisation which reduces 

our reliance on manual labour. This 

includes the use of a fertiliser spreader, 

empty fruit bunch (EFB) spreader and 

battery-operated herbicide sprayers; and 

• Transportation of fresh fruit bunches 

(FFB) from the field to the main road by 

motorcycles instead of wheelbarrows.

We observed a lower FFB yield per hectare 

in 2020 compared to the previous year  

partly due to replanting efforts which has 

been ramped up since 2018, particularly 

in the Riau region. Two years prior to 

replanting, there will be no more fertiliser 

application for old plantings as there is no 

need for further growth of the old plantings. 

This practice will have a slight impact on 

yields as the bunch weight of the FFB will 

be reduced. We expect to see higher FFB 

yield as our new plantings reach their prime 

productive age. 

In 2020, we managed to increase our  

overall crude palm oil (CPO) extraction 

rate. This is partially attributed to a higher 

extraction rate from our plantations in 

Kalimantan which has a larger proportion of 

oil palms in their prime age.  

We continued to provide support for our 

smallholders to help them increase their 

productivity. With operational support 

provided by First Resources, we observed 

an increase in our plasma smallholder’s FFB 

yield compared to the previous year. For 

more information on our engagement with 

smallholder farmers, please see the section 

on Supporting Smallholders.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

First Resources operates 

three dedicated Research and 

Development (R&amp;D) facilities –  

the First Resources Research 

Centre based in Riau and two 

research stations in West and  

East Kalimantan. Our research 

focuses on aspects related to  

yield improvement and climate 

change resiliency. 

A major part of our research 

focuses on our oil palm breeding 

programme. The programme aims 

to develop planting materials 

which have better oil quality, slower 

height increment and shorter frond 

length which helps with harvesting 

and increasing oil palm density per 

hectare, as well as identifying traits 

that make ripened FFB more easily 

identifiable to harvesters. The 

breeding programme also seeks to 

develop resilient planting materials 

that can better cope with diseases 

such as basal stem rot disease 

caused by Ganoderma, and other 

impacts from climate change such 

as weather fluctuations. 

In 2020, we replanted 

approximately 3,000 hectares of 

our old oil palm trees with our 

new planting materials. The yield 

estimate from these enhanced 

planting materials is 20% higher 

compared to existing planting 

materials, allowing us to achieve 

greater overall productivity. These 

are our first generation of new 

planting materials and there are 

two varieties, the FR-1 and the  

FR-2. We are currently developing 

a third variety.

At the same time, we are 

researching a second generation 

of high-yielding oil palm 

planting materials through our 

breeding programme. We are 

also committed to continuously 

enrich our oil palm tissue or 

germplasm diversity. To achieve 

that, we collaborated with the 

Konsorsium Plasma Nutfah Kelapa 

Sawit Indonesia (Indonesian Oil 

Palm Germplasm Consortium). 

Recently, we begun studying our 

new germplasm from Angola and 

the interspecific hybrid of different 

oil palm species, the Elaeis oleifera 

x Elaeis guineensis from Ecuador 

to explore potential valuable novel 

traits that can be incorporated in 

future breeding programmes.

We have also been working with 

oil palm tissue culture to clone oil 

palms with desired characteristics. 

In 2020, we began planting 

trials with our clonal materials. 

These clonal palms have been 

successfully transplanted from the 

nursery to the field with ongoing 

monitoring of their progress.

MANAGEMENT 

CONSERVATION AND FOREST 

MANAGEMENT [103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Indonesia’s rainforests are one of the 

world’s largest and are home to a rich 

biodiversity consisting of various flora 

and fauna species. We recognise that 

land clearing for agriculture can result 

in the loss of such biodiversity as well 

as the release of stored carbon which 

contributes to climate change. We  

are committed to conserving and 

managing forests through the  

protection of High Conservation Value 

(HCV) areas, including riparian zones,  

as well as High Carbon Stock (HCS) 

forests and peatland. 

IDENTIFYING CONSERVATION 

AREAS [304-4]

Our Policy on Sustainable Palm Oil 

sets out our commitment to No 

Deforestation and No Peat.

We have been following the Roundtable 

on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) New 

Planting Procedures (NPP) where all new 

developments within our plantations 

are subjected to third-party HCV 

assessments conducted by RSPO-

approved assessors. Results of these 

assessments covering topics such as 

habitat quality, soil conditions, peat 

presence, river quality and community 

cultural identity are available on the 

RSPO website.

Through these HCV assessments, 

we identified areas for conservation 

and excluded them from our oil palm 

plantation development plans. Rare 

and endangered species were also 

identified within our concessions and 

the surrounding areas through this 

process. See our website for the full list 

of identified threatened species under 

Indonesia’s National Law of Protected 

Species (Indonesian Government 

Regulation No. 92 of 2018), or under 

the International Union for Conservation 

of Nature’s Red List (IUCN Red List).

Following the release of our Policy 

in 2015, we identified additional 

conservation areas by referencing the 

HCS Approach (HCSA) methodology 

and engaging third-party HCS experts. 

By 2017, we have identified 

approximately 20,000 hectares of land 

as conservation areas. These are areas 

with potential HCS forests, HCV areas or 

peat areas.

Going forward, all new land clearing 

for oil palm plantation will be preceded 

by an integrated High Conservation 

Value – High Carbon Stock Approach 

(HCV-HCSA) assessment. This is in line 

with the requirement of criterion 7.12 of 

the revised RSPO Principles and Criteria 

which was released in November 2018. 

In 2020, the assessment was conducted 

for two of our concessions. The 

assessments are currently undergoing  

a quality control process under the  

HCV Network. 

PROTECTING CONSERVATION 

AREAS [304-1,304-2, 304-3, 304-4]

Our sustainability team conduct pre 

and post development checks to ensure 

that only non-conservation areas are 

demarcated for new development. 

We also put in place buffer zones to 

mitigate the risks of accidental non-

compliance. In addition, our plantation 

managers have key performance 

indicators tied to no development on 

conservation areas.

We maintain a strict policy against 

the hunting, injuring, possessing 

and killing of rare and endangered 

wildlife within our plantations. Any 

employee who breaches this policy 

will undergo disciplinary measures, 

including termination of employment. 

We also place reminders in the form of 

signboards at strategic locations and 

conduct daily monitoring patrols.  

For two of our concessions in West 

Kalimantan where the presence of 

orangutans have been identified, 

our conservation taskforce has been 

working with a local non-governmental 

organisation (NGO) to undertake HCV 

monitoring, handling of orangutans 

and other wildlife species, and use 

conservation software tools. We 

installed cameras to provide 24/7 

surveillance and organised joint patrols 

between the taskforce and the NGO 

to record the presence of orangutans

and other wildlife species regularly. The 

results of these patrols are subsequently 

shared with the NGO to determine 

areas for improvement. Despite the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we managed 

to continue conducting monitoring 

activities in 2020.  

To emphasise the importance of 

conserving HCV areas and HCS forests, 

we conducted internal trainings for 

our employees across Riau, West 

Kalimantan and East Kalimantan. In 

2020, a total of 121 employees in 17 

estates were trained. 

Many communities in Indonesia are 

still unaware of the HCV and HCS 

concept and may choose not to support 

conservation practices. Education is 

an important tool in bringing these 

communities on board. Despite the 

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we were 

able to conduct HCV and HCS trainings 

for six villages in West Kalimantan 

and East Kalimantan with a total of 64 

participants. To protect the safety of 

the participants, trainings were held 

in smaller groups and safety measures 

were put in place. Depending on the 

conditions going forward, we aim to 

conduct engagements with at least two 

communities annually.  

In East Kalimantan, we continued our 

partnership with the Research and 

Technology Development Agency  

of the Ministry of Environment and 

Forestry to identify strategies to 

conserve the Lembonah Forest in  

East Kalimantan. Through a study 

conducted by a research agency in 

2015, it is recommended that the 

forest be used to raise awareness 

on conservation. Together with the 

agency, we developed modules on the 

Lembonah Forest and its surrounding 

environment to educate children from 

nearby schools on the importance of 

conservation. However, due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable 

to carry out the programme in 2020.

REHABILITATING CONSERVATION 

AREAS [304-3]

Rehabilitation projects are being 

implemented to restore degraded HCV 

and HCS areas to their prior conditions. 

Restoration work commenced in the 

second half of 2016 in one of the 

identified HCV areas at PT Limpah 

Sejahtera, which was damaged by fires 

in 2015. Between 2016-2019, almost 

15,000 forest trees have been  

planted in three of our concession  

areas, covering 43 hectares. In 2019, 

some of these areas were affected 

by forest fires which originated from 

outside our concessions, dampening 

our efforts. In 2020, we rehabilitated  

27 hectares of HCV areas spanning 

three concessions by planting more  

than 6,800 forest trees, exceeding our 

target of 26 hectares.

MANAGEMENT 

PEAT MANAGEMENT [103-1, 103-2, 

103-3]

Since the introduction of our Policy  

on Sustainable Palm Oil in 2015,  

First Resources has not carried out any 

new plantings on peatland at any depth. 

For existing plantations on peat, we 

implement best management practices. 

Any peat areas which are assessed to be 

unsuitable for replanting, we will explore 

options for restoration or environmentally 

beneficial alternative uses. 

Our specialised peat taskforce focuses 

on conducting detailed peat surveys and 

peat assessments in our estates. The 

taskforce is led by our R&amp;D department 

and supported by our agronomy and 

sustainability departments. Since 2019, 

peat surveys in all estates have been 

completed. Results from the peat surveys 

inform our land use planning and guide 

the enhancement of water management 

plans for our plantations on peat. 

Groundwater levels are maintained 

at optimal levels to minimise peat 

subsidence and the release of carbon 

dioxide. To monitor water tables, we  

have installed piezometers and automatic 

data loggers at our plantations to record 

data every 12 hours. As at end 2020, 

we have completed the installation of 

piezometers and data loggers in all 

estates with peat. We will continue to 

perform routine measurement of the 

water table in the field. 

To regulate and manage water levels, we 

have also blocked canals and built water 

gates at selected estates in accordance 

with the guidelines of the Indonesian 

Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and 

Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency. 

Between 2017 and 2019, we revised the 

canal blocking design for 11 estates due 

to changes in environmental conditions. 

Adjustments to the canal blocking at 

these estates are ongoing, with one 

completed in 2020. In the same year, 

we installed peat subsidence poles in six 

estates, and plan to install these poles in 

another two estates in 2021. 

We have also begun conducting 

peat drainability assessments. These 

assessments are required by the RSPO 

and are conducted at least five years 

prior to replanting of existing oil palms 

on peatlands. The assessment results 

are used to set the timeframe for future 

replanting as well as for the phasing out 

of oil palm cultivation. In 2020, we have 

conducted these assessments on four of 

our estates with peatland. The outcome 

of the assessments indicate that we can 

continue replanting in these four estates. 

We will continue with the assessments for 

another three estates in 2021.  

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, field  

activities in 2020 that required supervision 

by the Ministry of Environment and 

Forestry were postponed. We continued 

to update the two government agencies 

regularly on our progress in peatland 

management. In 2021, we will continue to 

work with the ministry to comply with the 

government’s policy regarding  

peatland management.

MANAGEMENT 

FIRE PREVENTION [103-1, 103-2, 

103-3]

First Resources follows a strict Zero 

Burning policy for land clearing in 

all new developments and future 

replanting. This policy is also 

socialised with our suppliers who 

are made aware that any deliberate 

breach may result in an immediate 

termination of contract. 

Launched in 2016, our Integrated 

Fire Management (IFM) programme 

covers an in-depth workplan for 

fire prevention, preparedness, 

response and recovery. 

OVERVIEW OF OUR APPROACH TO FIRE PREVENTION, MONITORING AND RESPONSE 

1

Each estate has a Peta Rawan 

Kebakaran (Fire Prone Map) 

mapping out risk areas and 

facilities available. These facilities 

include roads, patrol paths, fire 

equipment store, fire lookout 

tower, water reservoirs/sources and 

warning signs. Location of villages 

and important telephone numbers 

are noted on the Fire Prone Map. 

Our patrol teams also conduct 

regular checks on fire-fighting 

facilities to ensure they are in 

working order.

In the case of a fire breaking 

out, the firefighting team will be 

mobilised immediately, and a 

police report will be made for an 

investigation to be carried out.

Fire Danger Indices (FDI) are used to assess risk levels. The FDI has 

4 levels: Low, Medium, High, and Extreme, depending on humidity, 

rain and fuel conditions. Fire risk levels are clearly and prominently 

displayed in fire prone areas during the hot and dry season to remind 

workers to be vigilant. We will deploy routine patrol teams depending 

on the FDI level. During severe conditions, patrol teams will bring 

along fire extinguishing equipment to extinguish any fire detected.

We conduct satellite monitoring daily, overlapping 

hotspots captured by the satellite with our concession 

maps to keep track of the situation on the ground.

Once hotspots are detected, on-the-ground verification 

is carried out, including checks for the presence of 

smoke from fire lookout towers and sending fire-

fighting teams to the affected areas. The towers are 

also important to assess fire conditions (e.g. movement 

of fire, size of fire). We also work closely with external 

stakeholders such as the RSPO, who actively detects 

fire hotspots within RSPO members’ concessions.

ENVIRONMENTAL 

MANAGEMENT 

In peat areas, we create firebreaks, 

prepare water reservoirs/sources, build 

canal blockings and implement water 

management practices. During the dry 

season, we take further precautions by 

increasing the water levels in the peat 

area to prevent incoming fire and/or 

prevent fire from spreading.

We have more than 1,500 firefighters 

assigned within our operations to 

ensure fires are handled swiftly and 

adequately. In 2020, we provided 

refresher trainings to approximately 

460 firefighters in 36 estates cross Riau, 

West Kalimantan and East Kalimantan. 

These trainings were conducted either 

in-person or virtually. 

Land clearing using fire in Indonesia 

is prohibited. However, this rule is 

exempted for communities who 

abide by their customary practices. 

This rule dates back to 2009. In 2010, 

the Ministry of Environment issued a 

ruling with regards to the prevention 

of environmental pollution caused by 

fire. Similar to the rule in 2009, there 

are exceptions whereby each family is 

allowed to clear up to two hectares of

land using fire based on customary practices. Exemption for 

communities using fire for land clearing is also mentioned in 

the Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 Year 2020,  

or more commonly known as Indonesia’s Omnibus Law.

In 2020, a local government regulation was introduced 

with regards to land clearing using fire based on customary 

practices in West Kalimantan. To protect forests and prevent 

the spread of fire, communities who are permitted to clear 

land using fire will have to abide by rules such as: 

• Clearing of land only for subsistence farming;

• Building of adequate firebreaks to prevent fire from 

spreading;

• Coordination with owners of neighbouring lands; 

• Ensuring fire extinguishing equipment is on standby; and

• No burning on peat.

These regulations have an impact on us as there are 

communities who live in or within close proximity to our 

concession areas, as concession rights do not confer 

ownership rights. It is therefore challenging to prevent 

communities from engaging in small-scale burning on areas 

within our concessions that are owned and controlled by the 

community. Such burning practices can result in fire events 

which are difficult to monitor and control as it is not known 

when and where they will occur.

As we expect fire incidences of such nature to continue,  

we seek to have closer collaborations with the communities 

and local authorities in managing fire. This includes raising 

awareness about fire risks as well as fire management practices. 

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we  

were not able to engage with communities due to  

movement restrictions.

In 2020, we saw an increase in the number of fire incidences, 

particularly in West Kalimantan. However, the affected area 

per incident is smaller compared to 2019. The increase 

in incidences may be due to burning practices by the 

community. There were no fire incidences in our planted area.

CLIMATE CHANGE [103-1, 103-2, 

103-3]

Climate change remains one of the 

world’s most pressing issues. As a palm 

oil company, we have a role to play 

in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions, especially from land use 

change. We must also continue to build 

our resilience against climate hazards 

such as changes in rainfall pattern, 

drought and extreme weather events 

which may impact our productivity. 

REDUCING OUR GHG EMISSIONS 

[305-5]

One of the biggest contributors of GHG 

emissions in the production of palm oil 

comes from the clearance of peatland 

and HCS forests for the development 

of plantations. To avoid the release of 

stored carbon into the atmosphere, First 

Resources does not undertake any new 

developments on HCS forests or peat 

areas at any depth. For more details 

on our approach, see the sections on 

Conservation and Forest Management, 

and Peat Management.

Palm oil mill effluent (POME), which is 

wastewater from the processing of FFB, 

is a significant source of GHG emissions. 

Since 2014, we have been establishing 

methane capture facilities which allow 

POME to be treated in a closed system 

where methane is captured, compared 

to open ponds where the gas is 

released into the atmosphere. 

As at end 2020, we have operational 

methane capture facilities at five of our 

mills. At four of these mills, the methane 

captured is used as an alternative fuel 

source for our milling operation. For the 

fifth mill, the captured methane is flared, 

producing water and carbon dioxide 

which is less potent as a greenhouse 

gas compared to methane. 

Based on the International Sustainability 

&amp; Carbon Certification (ISCC) calculation 

methodology, the estimated avoidance 

in GHG emissions for each facility is 

Number of Methane Capture Facilities and Estimated GHG Emissions (tCO2e) 

Avoided per year

Note: Number of methane capture facilities is based on the number of operational methane capture facilities  

per year. While a new methane capture facility may only start operations in the middle of the year, the estimation 

of total GHG emission reduction is based on the full year CPO production of its mill. The CPO production is then 

multiplied by 0.51 tCO2e for each tonne of CPO produced based on the ISCC calculation methodology.

approximately 0.51 tonnes of carbon 

dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) for each 

tonne of CPO produced. In 2020, 

the five methane capture facilities 

collectively helped us to avoid 

approximately 128,000 tCO2e in GHG 

emissions. This is equivalent to 27,5641 

passenger vehicles driven for one year. 

In 2020, we built additional methane 

capture facilities at two of our mills, one 

in Riau and another in West Kalimantan. 

The facility in Riau has begun its 

operations in the fourth quarter of 2020, 

while the one in West Kalimantan will be 

commissioned in 2021. We expect both 

methane capture facilities to help us 

avoid GHG emissions by approximately 

50,000 tCO2e per year, equivalent to 

10,8021 passenger vehicles driven for 

one year.

OUR OPERATIONAL FOOTPRINT 

Since 2020, we started using the latest 

RSPO PalmGHG calculator (version 4) 

to calculate our GHG emissions. With 

the new version, the GHG emissions 

indicators have been revised. Emissions 

of nitrous oxide (N2O) have now been 

split into emissions from fertiliser use 

and from peat. Emissions from third-

party FFB suppliers has also been 

extracted as a standalone indicator.

The total GHG emissions of a mill is 

obtained through the summation of 

emissions from the mill, supplying 

own and group plantations, and third-

party FFB suppliers. For third-party 

FFB suppliers, a reference emission 

value is used. The reference value can 

be obtained from research, national 

value or based on the emission value of 

another plantation. 

The GHG data included in this report 

represents only our mills integrated 

with plantations that are RSPO certified. 

They are PT Arindo Trisejahtera (ATS), 

PT Meridan Sejati Surya Plantation 

(MSSP) and PT Subur Arum Makmur 1 

(SAM-1). The slight increase in net GHG 

emissions intensity in 2020 for PT ATS  

was due to the mill's temporary  

ceasing of operation resulting in  

a significant decrease in CPO 

production which is the denominator 

used for the calculation of net GHG 

emissions intensity. 

For PT MSSP, more than 50% reduction 

in GHG emissions intensity is observed 

as there was a restructuring of our 

internal FFB supply chain. A portion  

of FFB which was previously supplied  

to PT MSSP has now been redirected  

to other mills which is located much 

closer to the FFB source.

WATER AND WASTE 

MANAGEMENT [103-1] 

Implementing responsible consumption 

and production practices is crucial to 

safeguarding the health of our people 

and the planet, as well as ensuring that 

resources continue to be available. For 

First Resources, this includes managing 

our water use and discharge, and 

reusing, recovering or recycling the 

waste generated from our operations 

where possible. 

WATER MANAGEMENT [103-2, 103-3, 

303-1] 

At our mills, a large proportion of the 

water we use is for the processing of 

FFB. All of the water used at our mills is 

drawn from nearby rivers which is also 

shared with our employees’ houses as 

well as any of our plantation offices and 

housing in the vicinity. Water is also 

drawn for nursery irrigation. So far, there 

are no known communities or other 

companies located near our mills which 

share the same water source. 

Our oil palm plantations are 100% 

rain-fed. For plantations on marginal 

land and hilly terrains as well as areas 

where there is limited rainfall, drains are 

constructed to capture rainwater. 

In 2020, we achieved our water 

consumption intensity target of 1.0 cubic 

metres per tonne of FFB processed at  

our mills. This was attributed to a 

combination of automating mill processes 

and increased monitoring to ensure 

efficient water consumption. We also 

reuse water where possible, which 

contributed to the achievement of our 

intensity target. In 2020, we reused a 

total of 280,832 cubic metres of water. 

This water comes from the cooling of 

machinery which powers the mill. 

To further minimise water withdrawal, 

a total of 655,223 cubic meters of 

steriliser condensate produced during 

the sterilisation process of FFB is 

recycled and used in the crude oil 

dilution process in 2020. Going forward 

we will continue to monitor the use 

of water and identify opportunities to 

reduce the amount of water drawn  

from rivers.

WASTE AND EFFLUENTS 

MANAGEMENT [103-2, 103-3, 

303-4, 306-3] 

The main waste products from our 

milling process include organic 

waste such as EFB, fibres, palm 

kernel (PK) shells and POME, 

which are predominantly reused, 

recovered and recycled. EFB is 

applied as mulch in the plantations 

to conserve moisture in soil, 

improve soil fertility, and reduce 

weed growth. Fibres and PK shells 

are used to generate power in our 

palm oil mills and refineries. In the 

plantations, oil palm trunks from 

replanting and oil palm fronds 

from field upkeep are left in the 

plantations to decompose naturally, 

acting as fertiliser. We will continue 

to reuse the bulk of our organic 

waste. Non-hazardous waste 

generated downstream such as filter 

bags are collected and disposed by 

local licensed waste collectors. 

We ensure that any effluent 

discharges comply with the quality 

limits for priority substances of 

concern defined and set by the 

relevant local authorities.

To minimise effluent discharge, 

POME generated is repurposed  

as organic fertiliser which reduces 

our need for commercial fertilisers. 

For land application of treated 

POME, its biological oxygen 

demand (BOD) level is kept  

below the legal threshold of  

5,000 milligrams per litre.

As our mill in Bangsal Aceh is not 

integrated with a plantation unlike 

our other mills, treated POME is 

discharged to the sea instead. The 

BOD of treated POME discharged 

to sea is kept below the legal 

threshold of 100 milligrams per 

litre. In 2020, a total of 127,865 

cubic metres of treated POME was 

discharged into the sea. There were 

no incidents of non-compliance 

with discharge limits in 2020.

Hazardous Waste 

Hazardous waste generated from our operations 

include pesticide packaging, expired pesticides,  

used batteries, used lubricants and filters, empty  

paint cans, printer cartridges, and needles from health 

clinics. We also have power plants at our palm oil 

processing complexes which supplies electricity to our 

factories and facilities. Coal and EFB fibre are used 

as fuel in our power plants which produces waste 

including Fly Ash and Bottom Ash (FABA). Spent 

bleaching earth (SBE) is another solid waste generated 

from our refineries. 

All hazardous waste is segregated, labelled and  

stored within secure, fire resistant temporary storage 

facilities that are equipped with spillage containment 

kits, alarms, firefighting equipment and first aid kits. 

We also put in place operational procedures which 

covers leakage handling. These facilities are inspected 

weekly. Hazardous waste is then collected by licensed 

third-parties for proper disposal in accordance with 

national legislations.

PROGRAMME FOR POLLUTION CONTROL, 

EVALUATION AND RATING (PROPER)  

First Resources participates annually in the 

Programme for Pollution Control, Evaluation and 

Rating (PROPER), a national public environmental 

reporting initiative by the Indonesian Ministry of 

Environment. The objective is to promote industrial 

compliance with pollution control regulations, 

facilitate and enforce the adoption of practices 

contributing to cleaner technologies, and ensure a 

better environmental management system. 

The programme uses a colour-coded rating to 

determine performance, as per the rating categories 

below. Areas assessed include: air and water 

pollution control, hazardous waste management, 

environmental management system, implementation 

of Environmental Impact Assessment, community 

development and, conservation of resources. 

Between 2019-2020, five of our mills received the 

Blue rating, while three of our mills received the 

Red rating. For one of our mills, a Red rating was 

unexpected as the result of an initial assessment 

has been positive. As for the other two mills, 

challenges in communication during the COVID-19 

pandemic resulted in reporting errors which 

affected the audits. We are clarifying with the 

authorities to rectify the matter and these mills are 

being re-evaluated.

PEST MANAGEMENT AND 

CHEMICAL USAGE [103-1,103-2, 

103-3] 

The protection of our crops from pests 

and diseases and the use of fertilisers 

are essential to maintaining high 

yields and land use efficiency. Where 

possible, we use biological pest control 

methods and organic fertilisers derived 

from our waste products. Depending 

on the situation, these methods may 

be insufficient and unsuitable. For 

example, the use of organic fertilisers 

is insufficient to meet the nutritional 

requirements of oil palms, thus requiring 

the addition of inorganic fertilisers. 

Without proper management, the use 

of such chemicals may pose a risk to 

workers and the environment. We are 

therefore committed to managing these 

risks through the adoption of agronomic 

best practices. 

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT 

Our integrated pest management 

strategy includes a combination of 

biological controls as well as good 

agricultural practices such as selecting 

the right pesticides and controlling 

dosage. Barn owls (Tyto alba) are used 

in our plantations to control the rat 

population. To increase the population 

of barn owls in our young estates, we 

have implemented breeding projects in 

Riau and Kalimantan. We also plant crops 

such as Cassia cobanensis, Antigonon 

leptopus, and Turnera subulata, which 

attract predators of oil palm leaf-eating 

pests such as bagworms and nettle 

caterpillars. Other biological agents 

such as Cordyceps fungus is also used 

during outbreaks of nettle caterpillars. 

We also use Trichoderma, which we 

cultivate ourselves, as a bio-fungicide to 

control Ganoderma. 

Where pesticides are required, we 

monitor their usage and ensure they are 

permitted by the Ministry of Agriculture 

in Indonesia. These pesticides are 

available in either solid or liquid form. 

Some pesticides are also used in 

the form of pre-formulated mixtures 

and their classification is set by the 

manufacturer as per the World Health 

Organisation’s (WHO) guidelines. 

We are currently exploring ways to 

reduce herbicide waste and usage 

by increasing herbicide efficacy on 

weeds. In 2020, through our research 

trials, we were able to reduce the usual 

amount of glyphosate application, 

one of the herbicides used in our 

plantation by 50% through mixing it 

with catalysts and adjuvants to optimise 

its absorption. Such reductions ensure 

that less chemicals are introduced 

into the environment and at the same 

time reduce the chemical exposure to 

our workers. In addition, through our

Paraquat Phase-out

In 2020, we achieved our goal of phasing out the use of paraquat, a chemical 

herbicide with concerns on its high toxicity levels and the potential of misuse. 

Prior to phasing out paraquat, we needed to conduct research trials to identify 

suitable alternative herbicides. Not only do the research trials required months 

of testing, we needed to test different herbicides on different weeds in different 

conditions. We identified suitable alternatives but found that they came with 

an increased cost of more than 50% as opposed to using paraquat. However, 

we recognise that this is a necessary step to take to protect the environment as 

well as the health and safety of our employees. The decision was thus taken to 

phase out the use of paraquat.

research process, we were also able 

to reduce the frequency of overall 

herbicide application from every three 

months to every 4-6 months.

A common pest during the replanting 

stage is the rhinoceros beetle, which 

eats the soft young shoots of immature 

oil palms. To reduce its population,  

we employ a three-pronged approach: 

the spraying of insecticides on young 

palm; using of sex pheromones to 

attract and trap the beetles; and the use 

of fungus to kill the beetle’s larvae.

We only use the WHO’s Class 1A or 1B 

pesticides in specific and urgent situations 

such as during a bagworm outbreak as 

biological methods will not be effective. 

Adequate safety measures such as the 

use of personal protective equipment 

(PPE) are put in place to prevent any 

long-term health issues for our workers 

when using Class 1 chemicals.

ENVIRONMENTAL 

MANAGEMENT 

A challenge faced in the use of urea as 

nitrogen fertilisers in the industry is its 

volatility after application, reducing the 

amount available for uptake. In 2020, we 

commenced a trial in Riau using urease 

inhibitors, which reduces the volatility 

of urea. The trial can take up to two 

years and if successful, can increase the 

efficacy of fertilisation as well as reduce 

GHG emissions. 

Workers who handle chemicals within 

our operations are required to undergo 

regular trainings which are conducted 

by field, R&amp;D staff, learning centres 

and by the chemical vendors. The 

training includes handling of packaging, 

mixing chemicals solutions from 

concentrate, using chemical application 

tools and evaluating the success rate 

of application. We also ensure that 

adequate PPEs are provided and used 

on site. First Resources does not use 

chemicals listed under the Stockholm or 

Rotterdam Conventions.

While there is a higher proportion of 

inorganic fertiliser application on our 

younger plantings, an overall reduction 

in proportion is observed for plantations 

with a more mature profile. There will 

be a decrease in inorganic fertiliser 

application as our younger plantations 

reach maturity. 

Going forward, we will continue to 

optimise our fertiliser use with further 

research on fertiliser application at 

specific sites and encourage the 

implementation of the “4 Rights” in 

manuring (right source, right dosage, 

right time, and right place).

FERTILISER USAGE

The use of fertilisers in the field 

depends on total new plantings as 

well as the total hectarage of mature 

plantations, with oil palm plantings in 

their prime-yielding age requiring a 

higher input of nutrients. We aim to 

use organic fertilisers derived from 

waste products to the maximum 

extent possible. In 2020, 95% of our 

POME and EFB were reused as organic 

fertilisers in the field. 

To protect the environment, we have 

put in place procedures and guidelines 

to allow adequate intervals between 

fertiliser applications and to avoid 

applying fertilisers during periods of 

heavy rain to minimise waste and runoff. 

For riparian buffer zones, we have 

developed internal standard operating 

procedures which prevent fertilisers and 

chemicals to be applied in these areas. 

We continued to conduct research and 

trials to increase the accuracy of fertiliser 

application for our plantations, ensuring 

their optimal use. This also includes 

fine-tuning dosage recommendations for 

different areas which may have different 

requirements due to terrain and soil 

type, as well as zones with microclimates.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT 

AND DEVELOPMENT 

RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS AND LOCAL 

COMMUNITIES [103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

We recognise that if the acquisition of land for the 

development of new plantations is not handled 

properly, it may undermine the rights of local 

indigenous communities and negatively impact their 

livelihoods. To maintain positive relations with the 

communities where we operate, we are committed 

to upholding the rights of indigenous and local 

populations through constructive engagements. 

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT [413-1]

We conduct social impact assessments in all new 

areas that we plan to develop. The results of these 

assessments help guide our engagement with 

communities. The assessments also provide inputs 

in the planning and implementation of programmes 

to help mitigate the negative impacts that may 

result from our operations as well as support positive 

outcomes. 

In line with our Policy on Sustainable Palm Oil, we 

are committed to respecting the rights of indigenous 

and local communities to give or withhold their Free, 

Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) for the utilisation 

of land to which they hold legal or customary rights. 

Where there are conflicts with or grievances raised by 

local communities, we ensure that these are resolved 

through an open, transparent and consultative manner.

Land Compensation and Conflict Resolution [411-1, 

413-2] 

The processes to settle land rights and compensation 

are extremely complex in Indonesia, guided by multi-

layered national and provincial laws and procedures. 

Customary and indigenous land claims may be 

undefined and conflicting with the current legal 

context. The identification of land ownership can  

also be a challenge due to the common practice of 

shifting cultivations. 

Upon being granted a location permit (Ijin lokasi) for 

a new development, we will first identify the land that 

belongs to individuals within the local community. This 

is followed by a socialisation process which usually 

covers various key aspects designed to inform the 

communities about:

• The company’s permit granted by the government;

• The government’s and company’s land 

compensation policies;

• The development plans;

• The approach for land measurement;

• Land valuation approaches; and

• The process for verifying land ownership and the 

requirements for proof of ownership.

Following socialisation and the completion of due 

diligence, compensation is made to communities who 

have accepted the company’s offer for their land. All land 

transfers are documented and witnessed by members 

of the local government and community leaders.

Disputes involving rightful land ownership are  

amongst the most common conflicts that we 

encounter. Stakeholders may raise grievances involving 

land ownership through our grievance procedure. 

We are committed to resolving them in a responsive 

manner and through a process that is consultative, fair 

and transparent. Our grievance list is updated regularly 

and is available on our website.

COMMUNITY INVESTMENT  

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 203-1, 203-2]

The palm oil sector plays an 

important role in the Indonesian 

economy, lifting rural communities 

out of poverty through the 

creation of jobs and the provision 

of infrastructure. First Resources 

employs a large proportion of our 

workforce from local communities, 

which are often located in isolated 

areas that lack basic infrastructure 

and services. To help drive positive 

socio-economic impact where  

we operate, we implement 

community development 

programmes centred on education, 

healthcare, infrastructure and 

alternative livelihoods. 

Our Community Development 

Officers (CDOs) are the main 

liaison between our Company 

and community members. CDOs 

engage with local residents on a 

regular basis to build relationships 

and understand community 

members’ concerns and needs. 

A CDO’s typical task includes 

collecting data on living conditions 

and population numbers, 

brainstorming new development 

ideas with community members, 

designing and proposing new 

programmes to regional managers 

and sustainability coordinators, and 

implementing local projects. CDOs 

also act as ambassadors, engaging 

with local government agencies 

to present and explain First 

Resources’ operational activities, 

environmental initiatives and  

social programmes.

SUPPORTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 

impacting livelihoods in Indonesia,  

First Resources is committed to doing its 

part to support local communities during 

this difficult period. In 2020, we made 

monetary contributions to civil society 

organisations including Indonesian 

Rupiah (IDR) three billion to Tzu Chi 

Foundation Indonesia and IDR two billion 

to Yayasan Setiabudi Dharma Setia, a 

social services organisation. The money 

was used for the purchase of personal 

protective equipment (PPE), medical 

equipment, food and other necessities. 

We also provided in-kind contributions  

in the form of PPE including face masks 

and suits as well as disinfectant tools  

such as spraying equipment for medical 

teams. At the regency level where 

we operate in, PPE and food staples 

including rice, cooking oil and sugar were 

provided directly to communities located 

near our plantations or in collaboration 

with the local authority or government  

for areas which are further away from  

our operations.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT 

AND DEVELOPMENT 

EDUCATION

Access to quality education enables social mobility and 

reduces inequalities. To support community growth, 

First Resources is working to increase such access for 

both the current and future generations of children. 

We currently support 38 schools where the children 

of our employees go to, all of which are located 

within or near our oil palm estates. These include two 

preschools, 14 kindergartens, 19 elementary schools 

and three junior high schools. These institutions 

employ more than 400 teachers and educate more 

than 5,900 students. The curriculum adopted is similar 

to those at schools managed by the local government. 

We contribute to the schools’ facilities and teaching 

aids, such as furniture, electricity generators and 

books. In 2020, we built two new school buildings and 

rehabilitated one school. The rehabilitation includes 

repairing of roof and ceiling as well as painting of a 

study room.

All children of employees working in our estates 

are provided with free education at our schools. 

Scholarships are awarded to high-scoring children  

from less privileged families, selected by local 

education authorities. In 2020, we allocated and 

invested more than IDR 3.5 billion to support the 

education of children. 

First Resources has also established an internship 

programme that is run in collaboration with more 

than 30 Indonesian universities. The programme 

offers students an opportunity to apply what they 

have learned in university, expand their knowledge 

and benefit from valuable on-the-job experience. In 

2020, we recruited about 50 interns from Riau and 

West Kalimantan, consisting of students from various 

universities and high schools. Unfortunately, due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we have stopped our internship 

programme temporarily since June 2020.

ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO 

EDUCATION DURING THE COVID-19 

PANDEMIC 

The year was also particularly challenging for 

children. To curb the spread of the COVID-19 

virus, normal classroom sessions were not 

able to continue as usual, and poor internet 

connectivity made it difficult to implement 

online learning. To ensure that children were 

able to continue with lessons, we arranged 

for the children of our plantation workers to 

be brought to schools according to a weekly 

schedule to collect their lesson materials and 

homework. In some plantations, we arranged 

for lesson materials and homework to be 

collected from school and distributed to the 

children at their housing area. 

Where possible, small group learning sessions 

were also conducted at the housing area. 

Digital communication channels such as 

WhatsApp were used for homework purposes. 

As the situation improves, there are still 

limitations to the number of children per class 

and the team is thus exploring options such as 

conducting outdoor classes at huts or gazebos 

closer to housing areas.

HEALTHCARE

We have a total of 11 health clinics 

staffed with qualified medical 

professionals, including at least one 

doctor and two nurses in each facility. 

The primary purpose of the clinics 

is to serve our employees and their 

families, but they are also open to local 

community members. The operating 

hours of our clinics are longer than 

those of the health posts managed by 

the local government. We also have  

24 first-aid centres which are set up  

for emergencies.

Medical services such as immunisations 

for polio, measles and tuberculosis are 

available to communities upon request. 

We have also established health-related 

community programmes to improve 

the wellbeing of local residents and 

increase their awareness about the 

benefits of healthy living. Carried 

out in collaboration with local health 

authorities, the “Be Healthy with First 

Resources” programme includes health 

treatments and advice for children, 

pregnant women and the elderly, as well 

as the coordination of blood donation 

drives. These programmes are currently 

put on hold due to the COVID-19 

pandemic and will resume when 

conditions allow. 

INFRASTRUCTURE 

A better infrastructure system helps 

us not only to run our operations 

more efficiently, but also increases 

the mobility of local communities, 

improving access to healthcare, 

educational facilities and markets. 

Before undertaking any infrastructure 

project, First Resources will consult 

with local village leaders to better 

understand the needs of the community. 

The roads servicing our operating areas, 

which we share with local communities, 

are kept in good condition to minimise 

disruptions to our operations as well 

as to maintain strong links to the 

main transport network. In 2020, we 

repaired 20 kilometres of roads which 

connects a village to a town in Riau.

In East Kalimantan, 1.3 kilometres of 

roads which connects two villages were 

repaired. We also purchased a plot of 

land near our plantations but outside 

of our concession for the construction 

of a meeting hall. This request was put 

forth by the village head, school head 

and communities during one of our 

engagement sessions.  

ALTERNATIVE LIVELIHOODS

We often receive requests for support 

from community members, especially 

mothers and young adults who would 

like to start their home businesses 

such as selling food items like cassava 

crackers. Since 2015, First Resources 

has been providing start-up capital 

as well as raw materials to help these 

community members start their business, 

providing an alternative income source 

to improve their livelihoods.

EMPLOYEE ATTRACTION, 

RETENTION AND 

DEVELOPMENT [103-1,103-2, 

103-3]

As we face increasing competition 

for labour resources, we must 

adopt different ways of attracting 

and retaining talent, which is key 

to the long-term success of the 

business. This includes ensuring 

that we provide rewarding 

career and growth opportunities. 

Digitalisation and the incorporation 

of technology aimed at optimising 

work processes will also be crucial 

to attract a new generation of 

employees, meet our manpower 

needs and improve efficiency. We 

also continue to promote a fair and 

favourable working environment.

EMPLOYEE PROFILE [102-8, 

401-1]

We directly employ 21,169 

employees across our offices, 

plantations, mills and processing 

plants, 18,022 of whom are 

permanent employees and 3,147 

are temporary employees.

To support our operations, some 

of our workers are sourced through 

third-party contractors, including 

seasonal workers, security guards 

and those needed for special 

construction projects. Other 

seasonal workers are contracted 

during peak harvesting seasons. 

Some of these workers are the 

spouses of our existing employees 

or they may be located near our 

operations and prefer not to be 

bound to a company as it provides 

them with the flexibility to engage 

in other work.

Our new hire and turnover rates 

are attributed mainly to harvesters, 

who tend to prefer plantations 

with younger oil palm trees 

which are shorter, as the work is 

less strenuous and risky. Due to 

the COVID-19 pandemic, there 

were less new hires and less job 

positions which were replaced. 

Another contribution to the lower 

turnover rate which also affects 

new hires is the annual mudik, 

when migrant workers return to 

their hometown during the Hari 

Raya Idul Fitri celebration, a major 

holiday in Indonesia. Quite often, 

these workers do not return to 

work after going back to their 

hometown. Travel restrictions 

due to the COVID-19 pandemic 

prevented them from returning 

home, which therefore resulted in a 

drop in the turnover rate as well as 

new hire rate in 2020.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS [401-2]

Our permanent employees receive 

benefits which include life and 

health insurance coverage and an 

annual bonus which is determined 

by the Group and individual's 

performance. We also provide 

housing for all our plantation 

and mill employees. Through our 

programme called “17 Kehidupan 

Pondok”, we identified 17 areas 

of needs for workers living in 

the estates, including access to 

provisions as well as facilities and 

amenities that meet their needs. 

In addition to housing and 

sanitation, employees also 

have access to running water, 

electricity, medical care, sports and 

recreational facilities, and places 

of worship. Access to education 

for employees’ children, such as 

kindergartens and schools, day 

care centres, and school buses are 

also provided. More information on 

how we support education for our 

employees' children can be found 

in the section on Education.

As locations of mills and 

plantations are often far from 

towns, transportation is provided 

for workers to go to town over 

the weekends. However, due to 

the COVID-19 pandemic, we have 

suspended all unnecessary travel to 

prevent transmission of the virus. 

We ensure that cooperatives or 

shops within the plantations are 

sufficiently stocked, and peddlers 

can continue to sell fresh goods 

in a safe and controlled manner, 

so that our employees continue to 

have access to food and groceries.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 

[404-2]

Our Learning Centre runs five 

graduate training programmes for field 

assistants, palm oil mill assistants and 

administrative assistants. Spanning five 

to six months, these programmes cover 

the technical, managerial and interactive 

skills required to work in First Resources’ 

estates and palm oil mills. As these 

programmes take up to six months, 

the Learning Centre also provides 

accommodation facilities for the trainees. 

A plot of oil palm plantation is made 

available for the trainees to experience 

the operational activities in a plantation.

Every year, through our People 

Development Review, we assess the 

training needs of our employees which 

is prioritised in line with the Group’s 

business and operational requirements. 

We also conduct regular trainings 

for field assistants, mill assistants, 

administration assistants and foremen 

to ensure that they are able to carry 

out their jobs effectively and safely. 

We provide trainings on topics such 

as harvesting management, fertiliser 

management, e-plantation systems, 

problem solving, decision-making 

and other soft skills on an as-needed 

basis. All trainings are conducted by 

First Resources coaches and specialist 

vendors, while continual on-the-job 

training and mentorships are provided 

by managers and supervisors.

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 

we have had to conduct our trainings 

virtually due to travel restriction and 

safe-distancing measures. While it 

is more efficient in terms of time 

and resources required, it is difficult 

to assess the effectiveness of the 

online training sessions compared 

to a classroom setting which allows 

for more interaction. There were also 

certain trainings that could not be 

conducted, especially those which 

require social interaction and field work. 

We will continue to review our training 

programmes to determine the most 

suitable format of delivery and how to 

best conduct virtual trainings. 

As part of our recruitment drive, we 

formed partnerships with universities 

in Java and Sumatra to provide 

internships for undergraduates and 

vocational school students. Our 

internship programme exposes students 

to administrative duties, plantation 

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS  

AND WORKPLACE

activities and palm oil mill operations. 

Apart from allowing students to gain 

experience with the Company, the 

internship programme also provides  

an opportunity for us to identify 

potential candidates for a permanent 

role in the future.

To retain and develop high potential 

employees as future leaders of 

the Company, First Resources has 

established a career path system to 

offer different progression tracks. This 

is to ensure that all employees have 

the opportunity to develop at a pace 

that is suitable for them and employees 

with higher ambitions and better 

performance can progress faster. The 

People Development Review is also used 

to assess each employee’s performance 

annually, monitor their progress and 

facilitate their career development. 

In 2020, we introduced a training 

programme for managers with leadership 

potential. Called the Executive 

Development Programme, candidates 

will be trained in topics ranging from 

labour laws to leadership and financial 

management. Candidates are selected 

for the training programme based on 

the annual People Development Review. 

More than 30 candidates were selected 

for the programme in 2020.

To further improve the assessments 

of our employees and provide a more 

accurate review, we are developing a 

digital application that enables real-time 

performance feedback and monitoring. 

This application will be rolled out in 2021.

GENDER EQUALITY 

AND INCLUSION 

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3,  

405-1]

Women play a critical role 

in agricultural growth in 

developing countries but 

continue to face constraints 

that limit their inclusion in 

the sector. Employment in 

plantations continues to be 

male-dominated, stemming 

from deep-rooted cultural 

norms that men are the 

breadwinners while women 

are homemakers. As a result 

of these norms, women have 

had less access than men to 

resources and opportunities, 

including land, financial 

services and education.

At First Resources, we are 

committed to providing 

job opportunities based 

on competence, skills and 

experience, regardless of 

gender, ethnicity, race or 

religion. Due to the manual 

nature of oil palm cultivation 

and processing, most of 

our plantation and mill 

workers are men. Men are 

typically assigned heavier 

physical tasks, for example, 

harvesting and carrying fresh 

fruit bunches to trucks for 

transportation. Women are 

typically assigned tasks such 

as weeding, fertilising and 

the collection of oil palm 

loose fruits that have fallen to 

the ground. 

To support our female 

workers, we have 

implemented several 

measures. These include the 

reassignment of tasks if they 

are pregnant to ensure their 

health is protected. All of our

LABOUR CONDITIONS AND 

HUMAN RIGHTS [103-1,103-2, 

103-3]

Labour and human rights issues in the 

palm oil industry, especially in supply 

chains, remain a complex challenge 

which needs to be addressed. At  

First Resources, we prohibit the use 

of forced, trafficked or child labour 

and respect the workplace rights of all 

our employees, including temporary 

workers. This is also expected of the 

suppliers we work with. 

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS  

AND WORKPLACE

All action items from the pilot audit 

of our workers’ living and working 

conditions in Riau conducted by 

Neste in December 2017 are now 

closed. Some items will require active 

monitoring as well as time for cultural 

change. The audit was useful as we were 

able to gather external feedback in a 

constructive environment. 

FORCED OR COMPULSORY LABOUR 

AND CHILD LABOUR 

[408-1, 409-1]

In accordance with national labour laws 

and regulations, the Group does not 

tolerate forced or bonded labour, or the 

employment of under-aged workers. 

We ensure that employees at our 

plantation and mill operations are never 

subject to the unlawful withholding of 

wages, identification cards, passports 

or other travel documents without their 

consent. Where we have outsourced our 

manpower needs to external agencies, 

we have briefed these middlemen of our 

policies and practices. We will  

cease working with those who breach 

our policies. 

These external agencies will assist to 

identify and coordinate the recruitment 

of potential workers including ensuring 

the candidates are above 18 years of 

age. We will then meet and select the 

candidates. During this meeting, the 

Company will socialise and explain to 

the candidates the job requirements 

as well as the terms and conditions of 

the job such as wages, type of work, 

benefits, housing, and insurance. In 

line with our recruitment policies, work 

practices and procedures, we ensure 

that all employees understand their 

rights and obligations. 

As our workers may have families with 

them in the estates, we actively monitor 

to ensure that their children do not assist 

in the estate work, a common practice in 

many parts of Indonesia. We also display 

signboards to remind parents not to 

bring their children to the plantations, 

socialise the importance of education 

and provide educational facilities such 

as child-care centres and access to 

schools. Constant reminders are sent to 

all workers and warnings are issued to 

those who violate our policies.

FAIR WAGES

First Resources complies with the 

minimum wage regulated by the 

respective province or district where we 

operate. Wages are regularly updated 

based on new guidelines or revisions 

to the relevant existing agreements 

according to the Regulation (Peraturan 

Pemerintah) No. 78 year 2015.  

We acknowledge that groundwork 

conditions vary depending on the 

environment. For example, hilly terrains 

will require more time to reach the same 

work target compared to an environment 

with flat terrains. Such working 

conditions are taken into account to 

ensure fair compensation. It is also not 

uncommon for our workers to take 

home more than their minimum wage 

due to volume-based incentive pay.  

We keep records of all salaries paid to 

our employees and contractors, and 

we do not withhold payment of wages. 

These records are acknowledged by the 

payees and we provide clarification to 

ensure that they understand how the 

payments have been calculated. We 

also ensure that payslips provided to 

workers are standardised and contain 

the necessary information that is easy to 

understand. Overtime work undertaken 

by the workers is voluntary and they will 

be compensated accordingly. 

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND 

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING [102-41]

We support the freedom of all our 

employees to form unions as a channel 

to communicate their expectations 

and aspirations. We also provide office 

space where they can conduct their 

meetings. Our labour union is part 

of the Konfederasi Serikat Pekerja 

Seluruh Indonesia (Confederation of All 

Indonesian Workers' Union). 

Each subsidiary and its labour union 

representatives have agreed on a 

Collective Labour Agreement that 

aims to protect employees’ and 

employer's rights and obligations. All 

our employees are protected by the 

Collective Labour Agreement, which 

covers industrial relations, working 

hours, remuneration, out-of-post 

assignments and transfers, social 

security and welfare, occupational 

health and safety, and employment 

termination. These agreements will 

be renewed every two years. Prior 

to renewal, the Group will conduct a 

discussion with the labour union to 

identify improvements required. 

We hold focus group discussions and 

meetings together with labour unions 

periodically. These dialogues enable 

us to take into consideration the 

aspirations of our employees and solicit 

their suggestions, inputs and criticisms. 

Employees are also able to convey 

their aspirations through the human 

resources department. The Group 

communicates all changes related to 

employment via emails, circulars, or our 

internal portal.

In 2021, we plan to have a discussion 

with the labour union and local 

authorities to improve workers' welfare. 

In particular, we aim to help ensure that 

our workers are able to have access and 

options to affordable house ownership 

in town.

Occupational Health and Safety


OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

[103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 403-1]

Protecting human life and providing a safe working 

environment that upholds high standards of 

occupational health and safety is a fundamental 

responsibility of any company. It is also important 

to ensure that operations are not disrupted, and 

employees can perform at their best. 

To reduce the risks of health and safety incidents within 

our operations, we have implemented an Occupational 

Health and Safety (OHS) Management System across 

our estates, covering all our employees. Workers are 

consulted on the development of the management 

system which is based on the Occupational Health and 

Safety Assessment Series standard (OHSAS 18001), 

and complies with local regulatory requirements. 

PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE [403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 

403-5, 403-6, 403-7]

Our Health &amp; Safety Committees meet at least once 

every three months and comprise management and 

staff representatives. The committee is responsible 

for identifying and evaluating potential hazards, 

recommending corrective actions, following up on 

implemented recommendations, providing employees 

with education and training, and addressing safety 

issues raised by employees. 

The quality of our risk assessments is validated during 

external audits conducted by the Roundtable on 

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS  

AND WORKPLACE

Sustainable Palm Oil and Indonesian Sustainable 

Palm Oil. We have also developed OHS manuals 

and procedures and working instructions to guide 

employees to work safely and prevent injuries. 

Reminders on health and safety are covered during 

morning briefings. We also conduct emergency 

response drills and other activities to ensure 

preparedness. 

OHS considerations are also incorporated into the 

Collective Labour Agreement with the workers’ union. 

These include provisions for equipping plantation and 

mill workers with personal protective equipment (PPE) 

and the establishment of Health &amp; Safety Committees. 

We also maintain an Emergency Response Team on 

standby to attend to any immediate health and safety-

related crisis. 

Hazards and Incident Management 

At our plantations, the main hazards are falling sharp 

fronds and bunches during the harvesting process, and 



sharp fronds which are left on the ground to decompose 

and act as fertilisers. These are associated with 

relatively minor injuries such as cuts and thorn-pricks, 

so our severity rate remains consistently low. To minimise 

the risk of injury, all harvesters are required to put on 

PPE such as safety helmets, gloves and boots which 

are provided by First Resources. At our palm oil mills, 

safety hazards include overhead sling conveyors, slippery 

floors, hot steam and loud noises. Workers are regularly 

reminded to be vigilant and are briefed during daily shift 

meetings on any potential health and safety issues.

When a work-related accident occurs, first aid would 

be administered to the injured. If necessary, the injured 

party would be sent to the nearest clinic or hospital for 

treatment and monitored for progress. We will then 

investigate and prepare an accident report within 48 

hours. Following evaluation of the accident, corrective 

actions and preventive measures will be implemented 

to prevent a recurrence. These actions and measures 

will be socialised with the workers on site. 

Promoting Worker’s Health 

To support the health of our employees and their 

families, we have established medical teams in  

every operational area. Our medical teams conduct 

routine check-ups and deliver various health 

programmes that aim to increase awareness about  

the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. These include 

healthy living tips, health education, and counselling 

related to chronic diseases.

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS  

AND WORKPLACE

KEEPING OUR EMPLOYEES SAFE DURING COVID-19 

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 

we implemented measures aligned 

with the latest applicable regulations to 

protect the health of our employees. For 

example, office employees are allowed 

to work from home and manpower in 

the offices are maintained in accordance 

with the latest guidelines. To facilitate 

our employees working from home, 

we provided relevant technology 

hardware and software to facilitate 

teleconferencing and telecommuting. We 

also provide face masks, hand sanitisers 

as well as ensuring safe distancing 

measures are observed if employees 

have to be on-site or at the office. 

In the Group’s plantations, mills and 

processing plants in Indonesia, safety 

protocols and procedures according to 

Indonesia’s large scale social restrictions 

(the Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar 

or PSBB) were executed. Aside from 

educating employees on personal 

hygiene, and implementing safe 

distancing measures, movements in and 

out of mills, plantations and refinery sites 

were imposed to further prevent the 

spread of COVID-19. 

To promote mental wellbeing, we 

encourage our employees to exercise 

if they are working from home. Should 

any of our employees report that 

they are experiencing health issues, 

we will provide support such as 

recommendations to doctors. 

In mid-2020, we launched a new 

application which provides a self-

assessment questionnaire, at our 

Indonesia Corporate and Regional 

Offices. This will facilitate the monitoring 

of each employee’s health condition and 

tracing should someone be infected with 

the virus. The assessment is to be carried 

out on a daily-basis and will provide 

an evaluation if it is suitable for the 

employee to go into the office.

HEALTH AND SAFETY PERFORMANCE [102-48, 

403-9]

First Resources is committed to eliminating fatalities 

and reducing accidents and injuries in our operations. 

All work-related accidents are recorded and evaluated. 

Recommendations are then implemented to prevent 

or reduce the reoccurrence of similar incidents. Our 

existing whistleblowing procedure allows workers 

to report any work-related hazards and hazardous 

situations. To protect workers from reprisals, workers 

can make an anonymous report through a hotline 

number displayed in the office. The hotline is managed 

by our internal audit team, who will investigate the 

issues reported. Workers are also allowed to stop work 

if they do not feel safe. 

We strive to ensure the safety of our employees. 

However we regret to report that there were four 

fatalities in our operations in 2020. The nature of these 

accidents includes slips, trips and falls, getting caught 

in-between hazards and electrocution. In the same 

year, a total of one permanent injury was recorded 

where an employee’s hand was caught in a machinery. 

While the nature of our work involves a level of risk 

and uncertainties, the avoidance of such accidents is 

crucial and we will continue to ramp up our efforts to 

prevent recurrence in the future.

SUPPLY 

CHAIN

MANAGING OUR  

SUPPLY CHAIN [102-9,  

103-1] 

Developing a supply chain that 

is aligned with our sustainability 

policy is essential to the realisation 

of our commitment to producing 

sustainable palm oil. We are 

working towards achieving a fully 

traceable and transparent supply 

chain and engaging with our 

suppliers to bring them onboard 

our sustainability journey. 

Fresh fruit bunches (FFB), the 

feedstock for our mills, are supplied 

by our own nucleus estates, 

third-party estates, thousands of 

individual smallholders (plasma 

and independent), as well as FFB 

dealers who buy from smallholders. 

Crude palm oil (CPO) and palm 

kernel (PK), which are raw materials 

for our processing plants, are either 

provided by First Resources-owned 

mills or sourced from third-party 

suppliers in Indonesia. 

Developed in 2017, our Sustainable 

Supply Chain Framework provides 

a structure which helps us to 

identify and manage risks in our 

supply chain and support our FFB, 

CPO and PK suppliers to adopt 

more sustainable practices.

We also procure other products 

and services to run our business. 

Of our non-palm procurement,  

our most significant spend for  

our operations is on fertilisers 

which is sourced locally. Other  

spend categories for our 

operations include fuel, chemicals 

(methanol, bleaching earth and 

phosphoric acid), spare parts and 

other materials.

SUPPLY CHAIN TRACEABILITY [103-1, 

103-2, 103-3] 

A key commitment in our Policy on 

Sustainable Palm Oil is to ensure that our 

oil and refined products can be traced 

to their origin. Traceability presents a 

complex but essential first step towards 

our ultimate goal in providing the level 

of transparency and confidence to our 

customers that our products come from 

sustainable sources. 

Our sustainability team works closely 

with our commercial team to achieve our 

Group’s traceability targets through active 

engagement with suppliers. 

Traceability to Mills

For CPO and PK to be considered as fully 

traceable to mills, suppliers are required 

to provide the company name, parent 

company name, mill name, mill address 

and geographical coordinates. Where 

information is missing or incomplete, 

CPO and PK volumes from that particular 

supplier is treated as “untraceable”, even 

if we know the source. 

In 2020, approximately 5% of our CPO 

feedstock are purchased from external 

suppliers. A list of our CPO and PK 

suppliers, together with their coordinates 

and address, are available on our website. 

Starting from 2020, we have also included 

the unique universal IDs based on the 

Universal Mill List (UML) as required by 

the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 

for each mill listed in our traceability 

report available on our website. These 

unique UML IDs help to ensure that the 

mills listed reference a common dataset 

for the palm oil industry.

Traceability to Plantations

Approximately 87% of the FFB processed 

in our mills came from our own 

plantations and plasma schemes, while 

the remaining 13% was sourced from 

third-party FFB suppliers. These include 

neighbouring plantation companies and 

independent smallholders. FFB is also 

purchased from local dealers who collect 

FFB from the surrounding area. 

Quite often, third parties may be 

concerned about the sharing of data due 

to supplier confidentiality. Part of our 

socialisation process involves explaining 

our intention and that we will respect 

the confidentiality of the information 

shared. This has helped us obtain the 

details we require to achieve our target 

of 100% traceability to plantations for 

FFB processed at our mills by 2020. 

Going forward, we aim to achieve 100% 

traceability to plantations of the third-

party CPO and PK suppliers we source 

from. In 2021, we will be developing 

procedures and testing them before 

conducting socialisation and rolling out to 

the third-party suppliers.

SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT

Once we have traced the source of our raw materials, 

we are then able to focus on our engagements with 

key suppliers. These engagements include one-on-

one meetings and group sessions to communicate our 

Policy on Sustainable Palm Oil and expectations, as 

well as help suppliers understand the importance of 

these requirements. 

Through constant dialogue with our suppliers, 

especially smallholders, we hope to build and maintain 

a relationship of mutual trust for them to feel confident 

in sharing information about the challenges they face 

in meeting new sustainability standards. 

In 2020, we engaged two FFB dealers who supply to 

one of our newer mills to socialise our Policy and our 

requirements. We also engaged with another FFB 

supplier to get updates on an outstanding grievance 

as well as to discuss traceability requirements.

SUPPLIER ASSESSMENT [308-1,308-2,414-1, 414-2]

Given that most of our raw materials are supplied by 

our own mills and plantations, and we only purchase 

a small volume on an ad-hoc basis from third parties, 

our influence on external supplier practices may be 

limited. To minimise the risk of sourcing from non-

compliant suppliers, we keep a watch list on high-risk 

companies which is updated monthly.

SUPPLY 

CHAIN

Managing our Supply Chain

Supporting Smallholders

All our new suppliers are screened using social and 

environmental criteria during our supplier onboarding 

process. This process involves the signing of an 

onboarding form to acknowledge that they will comply 

with our Policy requirements, as well as providing 

their mill or estate information to fulfil our traceability 

requirements. We will verify the information provided, 

and companies who cannot meet our requirements will 

not be onboarded as a new supplier. 

Our existing suppliers are continuously monitored to 

ensure that their practices are in line with our Policy 

on Sustainable Palm Oil. Suppliers found to be non-

compliant are required to undertake corrective actions 

within a certain timeline. In line with our Policy, we will 

suspend sourcing from non-compliant suppliers who 

do not take immediate remedial actions. 

 

STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION

Getting suppliers to adopt more sustainable practices 

is not a task we can undertake on our own and we rely 

heavily on stakeholder collaboration. Thus, in addition 

to our own assessments, we leverage on external 

parties to help us identify suppliers that we should 

further assess and engage with. External stakeholders 

such as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) 

and customers may hold better monitoring tools 

and intelligence to detect potential errant or non-

compliant suppliers. For example, an NGO that works 

to protect the environment sends us monthly reports 

of their deforestation detection. We look through 

these to see if any of the highlighted companies are in 

our supply chain which requires us to undertake follow-

up actions.

SUPPLY 

CHAIN

SUPPORTING SMALLHOLDERS [103-1, 

103-2, 103-3] 

Approximately 40% of Indonesia’s palm oil 

plantation area are managed by smallholders, 

making them a key player in the transformation 

of the industry to a truly sustainable one.  

First Resources manages 182,029 hectares of 

nucleus plantations. This puts us in a unique 

position to share our experience on best 

agricultural practices with the smallholders we 

work with and facilitate their inclusion into our 

supply chain. 

We identify communities that are interested 

in partnering with us to develop plantations 

through the Free, Prior, and Informed Concert 

(FPIC) process, which is carried out before 

any new development. We work with these 

indigenous and local communities through 

various plasma scheme partnerships. In some 

of these schemes, the Company assists the 

smallholders to develop and manage their 

plots until the oil palm trees reach a productive 

age, and after which the plots are handed back 

to the smallholders for management. In other 

partnership schemes, the Company assumes 

responsibility for developing and managing the 

plantation plots on behalf of these smallholders, 

even after maturity. Plasma smallholders profit 

by selling their FFB harvests to the Company 

at government-determined prices. These 

partnerships provide a sustainable income for 

thousands of smallholders, and this in turn 

contributes to local economic growth and 

improve livelihoods. 

We work with our schemed smallholders to 

improve their yields. Without adequate support 

programmes in place, smallholders may not 

be able to cope with risks of price volatility. 

Our field officers provide technical assistance, 

practical training and advice on fertiliser and 

pesticide procurement and usage. We also share 

new farming technologies including our high 

yielding oil palm seeds, offer assistance with 

land titling and coordinate transportation of FFB 

to palm oil mills. All of our plasma smallholders 

are involved in our smallholder programmes. 

As at end 2020, we manage 31,432 hectares of 

schemed smallholders covering 15% of the total 

plantation area managed by First Resources, 

and 8% of the FFB we processed.

We also have more than 2,300 independent 

smallholders supplying to us as of end 

2020. FFB is also supplied by independent 

smallholders through dealers. For independent 

smallholders, we socialise our Policy on

adhere to our standards via workshops. During 

the workshops, we also take the opportunity 

to ask new independent smallholders to fill 

in our supplier onboarding form, in which 

they acknowledge they have received and 

understood our Policy requirements. Due to  

the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we were 

unable to carry out engagements with

CONSUMERS  

AND CUSTOMERS

[103-1]

PROTECTING CONSUMER HEALTH [102-6, 

102-9, 416-2]

Our customers are primarily traders, palm oil refiners, 

and renewable energy producers. We sell our products 

in both local and export markets. For our export sales, 

we mainly sell them on Free on Board basis to our 

customers who then ship the products globally, with 

the biggest markets being China, India and Europe. 

We work closely with our customers to meet their 

needs and respond to the growing market demand for 

traceable and sustainable palm oil. 

Although First Resources does not produce consumer 

brands, we remain committed to safeguarding 

consumer health. We have put in place relevant 

certification systems to ensure that our processing 

plants achieve and adhere to best practices for 

product quality and safety standards. Since 2013, our 

kernel crushing plant has been certified to the Hazard 

Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), and 

good manufacturing practices GMP+ B2 standards. 

One of our processing units, PT Adhitya Serayakorita 

is HACCP certified. We did not continue the HACCP 

certification for the other processing unit (PT Ciliandra 

Perkasa) as it is mainly used to supply biodiesel 

domestically, for which HACCP certification is not 

required. In 2020, there were no incidents of non-

compliance relating to the health and safety of our 

products and services.

SUSTAINABILITY CERTIFICATIONS [102-12, 

102-13, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3]

Certification of palm oil is a common industry practice 

to demonstrate that products are sourced and 

produced sustainably. To meet the growing demand 

for sustainable palm oil, we continue to actively 

participate in various industry schemes and work 

towards obtaining relevant industry certifications. 

These include the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 

Oil, the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil and the 

International Sustainability &amp; Carbon Certification. 

ROUNDTABLE ON SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL (RSPO) 

First Resources has been a member of the RSPO since 

2008. Since 2018, two of our mills with plantations 

in Riau have been RSPO certified. In 2020, we had 

planned to certify another six mills integrated with 

plantations. Although we managed to certify one mill 

integrated with plantation in Riau in the first quarter 

of 2020, we were not able to meet our target due to 

the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic resulting in travel 

restrictions which affected on-site RSPO audits. As at 

end 2020, a total of three of our mills integrated with 

plantations are RSPO certified. 

This has further affected our progress to meet our 

target to certify all of First Resources mills and 

plantations by 2024. We will continue to monitor the 

situation and review our 100% RSPO certification 

target. Nonetheless, we are committed to progressing 

in our certification process and have set ourselves 

a goal to execute RSPO audits for six of our mills in 

2021, if conditions allow.  

In addition, our bulking station, kernel crushing 

plant and one of our processing units (PT Adhitya 

Serayakorita) are certified against the RSPO Supply 

Chain Certification Standard. We did not continue 

the RSPO Supply Chain Certification Standard for our 

other processing unit (PT Ciliandra Perkasa) as it is 

mainly used to supply biodiesel domestically, for which 

RSPO certification is not required.  

INDONESIAN SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL (ISPO) 

With the ISPO certification system being enhanced in 

2020 following the issuance of Presidential Regulation 

No.44/2020, all new certifications were put on hold. 

We have thus maintained our ISPO certification for 

one of our plantations and nine of our mills which 

are integrated with plantations. To date, 49% of our 

plantations are ISPO certified. 

In November 2020, the enhanced ISPO certification 

system released under the Ministry of Agriculture 

means that we can now continue with our certification 

process. We target to certify another three mills 

integrated with plantation in 2021.  

INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY &amp; CARBON 

CERTIFICATION (ISCC) 

We successfully renewed all our ISCC certifications in 

2020. As at end 2020, 51,020 hectares of our nucleus 

plantations are certified under the ISCC scheme, which 

is approximately 28% of our total nucleus area. In 

addition, six of First Resources’ 18 palm oil mills, both 

our processing units and one bulking unit are also 

ISCC certified. We are thus able to provide customers 

with a fully traceable product under the ISCC scheme.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT [102-15, 102-32, 102-46, 102-47]

In 2019, we conducted an assessment of our material sustainability topics which follows a five-stage process:

5

VALIDATION

A working session with key persons from First 

Resources was held to present, test and validate the 

final list of material topics and the materiality matrix. The 

final list of material topics was signed off by our CEO on 

behalf of the Board of Directors.

3

INTERVIEWS

One-on-one interviews were conducted with 

First Resources' senior management team and 

key external stakeholders to gather additional 

context and insights into sustainability topics that 

are relevant for First Resources and the industry.

2

SURVEYS

Through an online survey, a selected list of internal and 

external stakeholders were asked to prioritise and rank 

the short-list of potentially material topics based on 

what is most important for First Resources to manage.

In line with best practice, we will continue to review our material sustainability topics annually 

and conduct an in-depth assessment on a regular basis.

1

SUSTAINABILITY 

CONTEXT AND ISSUE 

IDENTIFICATION

A benchmarking exercise and desktop 

research was conducted to identify 

emerging and any key topics missing from 

First Resources’ previous list of material 

sustainability topics. 

4

ANALYSIS

Information gathered during 

the survey and interview stages 

was analysed and consolidated 

to produce key insights and a 

prioritised list of material topics, 

represented in the form of a 

materiality matrix.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT [102-21, 102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-44]

A fundamental part of our approach to sustainability is 

engaging our stakeholders to better understand their 

interests and concerns. We seek to maintain an open 

dialogue with our stakeholders so that we can receive 

constructive feedback.

We have identified our key stakeholder groups 

through an internal mapping exercise based on our 

impacts on them and their importance to the success 

and continuity of our business. We then tailored our 

method of engagement for each of these groups. 

We regularly review and enhance our engagement 

approach to ensure that it remains effective. The table 

below summarises our stakeholder engagement efforts 

in 2020.

GLOSSARY  

OF TERMS

Biodiversity 

The diversity (number and variety of species) of plant and animal life within a region.

Biological Oxygen Demand 

(BOD)

The amount of oxygen consumed by bacteria and other microorganisms when decomposing organic matter under aerobic conditions 

(i.e., when oxygen is present) at a specified temperature.

Carbon Dioxide Equivalents 

(CO2e)

A standard unit for measuring carbon footprints. It is to express the impact of each different greenhouse gas in terms of the amount 

of carbon dioxide that would create the same amount of warming. That way, a carbon footprint consisting of different types of 

greenhouse gases can be expressed as a single number.

Chemical Oxygen Demand 

(COD) 

Another indicator of contamination that shows the amount of dissolved matter in water susceptible to being oxidised. While BOD uses 

bacteria and other microorganisms to test, COD uses chemicals to test. 

Crude Palm Oil (CPO) 

The oil extracted from the pulp of the FFB. 

Effluents

Waste water discharged from a source (such as mill) into a separate body of water.

Extraction rate

The amount of oil recovered from FFB (in percentage) at a mill. CPO is extracted from the flesh of the FFB’s fruitlets; Palm kernel oil 

from the kernel of the FFB’s fruitlets.

Empty fruit bunch (EFB)

The remains of the FFB after it has been processed and its fruitlets removed at the mill.

Fire Danger Indices (FDI) 

An internal index for fire risk assessment which has four levels: Low, Medium, High and Extreme, depending on humidity, rain and fuel 

conditions.  

Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB)

The ripe fruit bunch harvested from the oil palm tree. The weight of the FFB ranges between 10 kg to 40 kg depending on the size  

and age.

Free, Prior and Informed 

Consent (FPIC)

The principle that a community or indigenous people has a right to give or withhold its consent to projects that are proposed, which 

may affect them or their lands they customarily own, occupy or use.

Greenhouse gas (GHG)

A gas that has the property of absorbing and emitting infrared radiation, creating a greenhouse effect. 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) A multi-stakeholder standard for sustainability reporting, providing guidance on determining report content and indicators.

High Conservation Value (HCV)

Areas with biological, ecological, social or cultural values of outstanding significance at the national, regional or global level or of 

critical importance at the local level.

High Carbon Stock (HCS) 

Approach

A practical methodology for distinguishing forest areas that should be protected from degraded lands that may be developed. It is a 

sequence of processes and assessments undertaken within two overarching modules: a social requirements module, which focuses on 

respecting communities’ rights to their lands; and an integration module, which includes the FPIC and HCV processes.

Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil 

(ISPO)

A mandatory certification requirement for all oil palm growers and millers operating in Indonesia imposed by the government in an 

effort to preserve the environment, promote economic and social activities, and enforcement of Indonesian statutory laws in the palm 

oil sector. 

Integrated Fire Management 

(IFM)

An in-depth workplan for fire prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.

Integrated High Conservation 

Value - High Carbon Stock 

Approach (HCV-HCSA) 

assessments 

An integration of both the HCV and HCSA assessment to allow for greater efficiencies in team deployment, reduction of costs and 

avoidance of stakeholder confusion. As per the revised RSPO Principles and Criteria released in November 2018, any new land clearing 

(in existing plantations or new plantings) after November 2018 must be preceded by a HCV-HCSA assessment. 

Interspecific hybrid 

(Elaries oleifera x Elaeis 

guineensis) 

The Elaeis oleifera x Elaeis guineensis interspecific hybrid is a cross between the African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and the American 

oil palm (Elaeis oleifera). Further research is being carried out as the hybrid exhibits characteristics with the potential to improve the 

competitiveness and sustainability of the crop.

International Sustainability &amp; 

Carbon Certificate (ISCC)

A certification system that promotes the sustainable cultivation, processing and utilisation of biomass and bioenergy. It is geared 

towards GHG emissions reduction, sustainable land use, protection of natural biospheres and social sustainability.

International Union for 

Conservation of Nature’s Red 

List (IUCN Red List)

The world's most comprehensive inventory of the global conservation status of biological species. It is a critical indicator of the health 

of the world’s biodiversity. 

Nucleus plantation 

Plantations owned by the group.

RSPO New Planting Procedures 

(NPP)

The RSPO NPP consists of a set of assessments and verification activities to be conducted by grower members and certification 

bodies prior to a new oil palm development, in order to help guide responsible planting and ensure that social and environmental 

requirements have been met. 

PalmGHG Calculator 

A tool developed by the RSPO Greenhouse Gas Working Group 2 to allow palm oil producers to estimate and monitor their net 

GHG emissions. The Calculator also enables palm oil producers to identify crucial areas in their production chain and thereby guiding 

emission reduction opportunities.

Palm oil mill effluent (POME)

The by-product of processed FFB.
