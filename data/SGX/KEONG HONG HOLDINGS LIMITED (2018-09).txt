CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE 

OFFICER’S MESSAGE

Dear Stakeholders,

We are pleased to present the first annual Sustainability Report of Keong Hong Holdings Limited (“Keong 

Hong” or “the Group”), prepared in accordance with the global GRI Standards and in compliance with 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) guidelines on sustainability reporting. The report 

provides information about our economic, environmental and social topics and performance.

The Board of Directors and senior members of management are responsible for determining the sustainability 

issues as part of the strategic formulation of the Group. The Board is supported by the management’s 

Sustainability Task Force (“STF”) comprising heads of different business units which help to spearhead 

sustainability efforts in the organisation. The STF has put an extensive amount of effort into reviewing the 

Group’s sustainability objectives and tracking the sustainability data and progress. On behalf of the Board 

of Directors, I would like to commend and recognise their commitment and strong teamwork.

Keong Hong recognises the need to upgrade our digital skills to remain relevant in the digital economy. In 

recent years, we have made great strides in Technology Adoption (“TA”), in an effort towards improving 

productivity. Keong Hong will continue to innovate and implement new technologies in our operations to 

benefit our business, our industry and the community.

Keong Hong is committed to providing a safe working environment for all our employees. We have developed 

a culture of safety and put in place various safety and environmental awareness programmes to ensure 

that every employee believes in our Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) values. In 2018, we received 

the prestigious Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (“RoSPA”) Gold Award in recognition of our 

achievements in the health and safety management system and culture. I am also happy to report that our 

AFR (“Accident Frequency rate”) and ASR (“Accident Severity rate”) were much lower than the industry 

average.

The Group adopts a holistic approach to understanding and managing the environmental impact of our 

construction activities. We have been actively promoting green and gracious practices to raise environmental 

consciousness and to provide a pleasant environment for all our residents and members of the public. We 

are honoured to receive the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) Green and Gracious Builder Award 

(Excellent) in 2018 for our corporate social responsibility efforts to the environment and to the public.

At Keong Hong, our people are our greatest assets. We are committed to develop our people to their fullest 

potential and will continue to attract, nurture and retain capable and experienced people to support our growth 

and steer the Group ahead. We believe there is no limit to what a team with great camaraderie can do.

We will continue to integrate corporate social responsibility and sustainability into our corporate culture and 

business processes to ensure long-term value creation for our stakeholders. After all, we are in the business 

of building a better world.

The group is committed to prevent pollution and injury in all its construction operations. We are committed 

to provide quality products and services to meet customer requirements through the timely delivery of 

projects complying with applicable legal and other requirements, quality workmanship, good safety standard 

and minimising impact on the environment. We shall endeavour to provide a high standard of occupational 

health and safety environment and continue stringent due diligence checks on our suppliers.

monitoring and measuring these impacts. The Group will uphold our energy saving standards and invest in 

technologies to improve waste management and reduce emissions and effluents.

Whistle-Blowing Policy

The Group has implemented a whistle-blowing policy whereby accessible channels are provided for 

employees, shareholders, clients, consultants, vendor and sub-contractors. These channels allow our 

stakeholders to raise their concerns on possible improprieties in financial reporting, fraudulent acts and 

other irregularities. These communication channels will ensure independent investigations and timely 

implementation of appropriate preventive and corrective actions. The Audit Committee reviews all 

whistleblowing complaints at its quarterly meetings to ensure investigation and appropriate follow-up actions 

are taken. The Group did not receive any whistle-blowing report in FY2018.

Interested Person Transactions

The Group has set out procedures governing all interested person transactions to ensure that they are carried 

out on an arm’s length basis and on normal commercial terms and will not be prejudicial to the interests of 

the Group and its shareholders. The Group does not have a general shareholders’ mandate for interested 

person transactions pursuant to Rule 920 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual.

Dealing in Securities

The Group has adopted an internal compliance code of conduct that complies with SGX listing rule 

1207. It prohibits dealings in the securities of the Group by Directors and Officers while in possession of 

price-sensitive information.

The Group, Directors and Officers are prohibited from dealing in the securities of the Group on short-term 

considerations and during the period beginning two weeks prior to the announcement of financial results of 

each of the first three quarters of the financial year, and one month before the announcement of full year 

results and ending on the date of such announcements. In addition, Directors and Officers are expected to 

observe insider-trading laws at all times even when dealing in securities within the permitted trading period.

Anti-Corruption (GRI 205-1, 205-2, 205-3)

Keong Hong works diligently to ensure our employees adhere to the highest standards of ethics and integrity

unbiased professionalism and non-discriminatory actions in relation to all business dealings. We have

The Board is supported by the management’s STF which comprises heads of different business units and 

is chaired by Mr. Er Ang Hooa (Executive Director) who oversees achievement of all sustainability targets 

and report to the Board. The Task Force reviews the Group’s sustainability objectives and monitors the 

sustainability performance.

The Board considers sustainability issues as part of our strategic formulation, and approves the material 

environmental, social and economic topics identified. The Board also oversees that the factors identified 

are managed and monitored.

The Task Force has reviewed the option for external assurance of its sustainability report and assessed 

that external assurance is not required for this year as the Group wishes to progressively strengthen the 

sustainability reporting framework.

Keong Hong adopts a precautionary approach in strategic decision making and daily operations by 

implementing a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework which is aligned with 

the requirements of COSO Internal Controls Integrated Framework. An annual Group-wide risk assessment 

exercise is conducted to update the firm’s risk profile in the ERM framework and reflects changing business 

risk exposures and addresses the significant and relevant risks to the Group.

Market Presence (GRI 202-2)

Keong Hong has airport, resort and hotel operations in Maldives, and we strive to empower the local 

community through increasing employment opportunities for the local community. 100% of the staff at the 

Kooddoo Airport are hired from the local community, including all senior management staff. For our Maldives 

projects, the proportion of employees hired from the local community are as below:

Developing Technology and Indirect Economic Impacts (GRI 203-1, 203-2, 204-1)

Keong Hong has implemented various practices to ensure that we benefit the local economy and businesses 

during our operations.

Operations and Investment in Maldives

We endeavour to create more business opportunities for local suppliers. As such, we make a conscientious 

effort to procure from local suppliers directly, such as consumables, fire-fighting and medical equipment.

We also reduced the time required for construction at sites and improved productivity by using pre-fabricated 

roofs and water storage tanks. The structures for buggy path are precast on land before it is put together over 

water to allow comfortable access to over-water structures since early stages of construction and expedite 

the construction of permanent buggy path structures, ensuring safer working conditions and higher labour 

productivity. As a result, labour resource allocation and efficiency are optimised.

In addition, with our Kooddoo Airport expansion, the airport can accommodate more planes including private 

jets. Locals also have more convenient means of transport, and tourists can travel to resorts near Kooddoo 

via transit at the airport. This will help to promote the local tourism industry development and create more 

jobs for the locals. To date, 65 Maldivians are hired, and we intend to continue improving airport facilities 

to meet future demand.

Building and Construction, Property Development

Our construction projects have brought about indirect economic benefits to the local community. 

Our construction projects require the expertise of direct/indirect suppliers and specialists – concrete, 

reinforcement, tiles/stone and furniture which generates business opportunities within and among the 

supply chain.

We recognize the need to upgrade our digital skills to remain relevant in the digital economy. In recent years, 

Keong Hong has made great strides in Technology Adoption (TA), in its effort towards improving productivity. 

Published by BCA, Keong Hong's TA Index has improved from 57.22 % in July 2017 to 85.24% in July 2018.

TA SCORES IN FY 2018

We have upgraded our digital capability to Building Information Model (“BIM”) and Virtual Construction and 

Design (“VDC”), and we are now in a new frontier. We are proud to be one of the pioneers in adopting the 

Digit-alpha capability transformation Programme, a pilot project with Virtual Reality (VR) as a core module 

sponsored by IMDA. With the Digit-alpha Programme, we hope to streamline our operations and transform 

our business processes to improve our workforce productivity and achieve business growth.

We also adopt the use of Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (“PPVC”) methodology and 

Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (“DfMA”) technologies which improve productivity at construction 

sites as most of the manufacturing can be done off-site. Mobile technology is used to streamline inspection 

process, track rectification activities and generate real-time reports for effective quality control.

In addition, high productivity softwares based on mobile and cloud technology are used to enhance 

productivity on-site and improve the skillset of our workers hired from the local community. With a  

higher-skilled local workforce that is competent in wielding innovative technologies, this may stimulate 

greater working opportunities in the local community. For example, we use Novade Quality on the Seaside 

Residence project to manage the defect rectification process during quality inspections, handover and defect 

liability period for building projects. We intend to use this technology on multiple types of projects at various 

stages of each project.

Keong Hong will continue to innovate and implement new technologies in our operations to benefit our 

business, our industry and the community.

Financial Assistance Received from Government (GRI 201-4)

For FY2017, Keong Hong has received a total of S$129,000 in government grants to enhance the skillset 

and capabilities of manpower, improve productivity and encourage innovation. We also received a S$49,000

Keong Hong takes precautions to ensure that we comply with governmental laws and regulations, and 

implement measures to operate in an environmentally sustainable manner.

Recycled Input Materials (GRI 301-2)

The Group has undertaken methods to recycle input materials in our projects to reduce wastage and ensure 

sustainable operations.

Building and Construction

At Keong Hong, we are committed to using eco-friendly and recycled materials in our construction projects 

wherever possible. We conscientiously use green concrete to replace Ordinary Portland Cement for the 

construction of permanent structures in our Amore and Seaside Residences projects, and 10% of the 

green concrete is used for superstructure works. Together with our use of green material, this translates 

into reduction in carbon footprint for the construction projects as the materials can be recycled. Notably, 

our Raffles Hospital Extension project received a Green Mark Platinum rating, which is a testament to our 

corporate commitment to green practices.

In addition, to minimise wastage, we implemented predominantly aluminium system formwork which 

includes self-climbing formwork, vertical safety screen, table form, metal wall and slab formwork for all 

construction projects on-site, as aluminium can be reused with minimal wastage. We also used recycled 

construction materials like recycled timber and plywood for safety barricade, recycled steel hollow section 

for fabrication and recycled earth control measure tank and filtration systems to control water discharge 

drainage for temporary works.

Energy and Emissions Management (GRI 302-1, 302-3, 302-4, 302-5, 305-2, 305-4, 305-5)

Keong Hong is committed to the preservation of the environment by championing Green and Gracious 

practices to reduce energy and water consumption as well as carbon dioxide emissions. We have received 

the Green and Gracious Excellence Award from BCA in recognition of our efforts.

Building and Construction

During FY2017 and FY2018, the Group has completed four projects which consumed a total of 4,201,238 kWh. 

The total gross floor area used for these construction projects totalled 228,774 m². See below for the total

Keong Hong is committed to achieving our planned objectives and targets to ensure that we are operating 

sustainably. We strive to reduce energy consumption for all building and construction projects. See below 

for charts for energy consumption:

ACTUAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION VS PLANNED ENERGY CONSUMPTION (IN KWH) 

The Group endeavours to draw energy from renewable sources rather than non-renewable sources. This is to 

preserve the environment and meet compliance standards. The Group taps on solar energy to power noise 

meters and traffic warning signs. In addition, the Group uses green label appliances and energy efficient 

light fittings to reduce energy consumption and emissions.

For the projects mentioned above, other than the Raffles Hospital Extension project, the actual energy 

consumption deviates less than 10% from the planned energy consumption, which is an acceptable deviation. 

The deviation for Raffles Hospital Extension was higher than 10% as it was our first hospital project, thus we 

did not include intensive testing in our projection of energy consumption. We will work towards increasing 

the energy efficiency of our operations and reducing our actual energy consumption.

Operations and Investment in Maldives

The Group closely monitors operations in Maldives to ensure effective implementation of energy conservation 

measures. Some examples include using LED lights instead of incandescent bulbs to conserve energy and 

placing signage to create staff awareness and to promote an inherent culture of environmentally friendly 

practices amongst the employees. We endeavour to conserve energy consumption whenever possible, and 

we have plans to install false ceilings or glass partitions and monitor sensors in public toilets, fitness centre 

and other areas of the Resort and Hotel to conserve energy.

At Keong Hong, we are committed to reducing water consumption at construction sites to ensure sustainable 

operations. As seen from the graph below, our water consumption is generally lower than planned, which 

is testimonial of our water conservation efforts.

ACTUAL WATER CONSUMPTION VS PLANNED WATER CONSUMPTION (IN M3)

We have always engaged our Qualified Erosion Control Professional (“QECP”) to design our Earth Control 

Measures (“ECM”) plan integrated with washing bay system as part of our sediment control. It is an efficient 

way to conserve water as washing large volume of vehicles could mean high water consumption. Rainwater 

that is stored in the sump of the tank will be reused for the washing of vehicles entering or leaving the site. 

This allows us to conserve water used for washing of vehicles at our construction sites. We endeavour to 

implement more water conservation measures to further reduce water consumption on-site.

Managing Biodiversity (GRI 304-2, 304-3)

Keong Hong endeavours to protect and preserve the environment during our operations, by putting initiatives 

in place to ensure we operate sustainably.

Operations and Investment in Maldives

The Group has engaged specialists to preserve the vibrant biodiversity of the environment in Maldives. 

Before evacuation and construction commence, our specialists will transplant corals from all project sites 

to safe areas. The Group has plans to set up a coral conservation programme at the resort which includes a 

coral garden and coral nursery to preserve the coral reef. We endeavour to maintain the good condition of 

the coral colonies in the vicinity of our operations. Planting of corals under the rooms will only commence 

after all construction activities are completed to prevent any unnecessary coral stress and bleaching.

Coral nursery – coral beds installed and populated with coral pieces glued to a cement base

Due to the high volume of marine recreation activities at Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort, the Group has 

undertaken several initiatives to manage environmental impacts for all operations in Maldives. To circumvent 

any damage to the coral reef through the use of boats and marine equipment, the Group has imposed rules 

on boat operators on the island such as anchoring, boat operation, boat sewage and garbage disposal. For 

tourists engaging in recreational activities, strict rules on activities such as fishing, marine wildlife viewing, 

snorkelling, diving and scuba, have been established and enforced.

In an effort to ensure that our environmental protection efforts are regulated and implemented properly, we 

went the extra mile to perform Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) on the Pullman Maldives Maamutaa 

Resort project, and we successfully attained EIA approval in 2015. As such, proper precautionary measures 

have been implemented to guarantee environmental and biodiversity sustainability during operations.

Effluents and Waste Management (GRI 306-1, 306-2, 306-5)

Keong Hong endeavours to manage waste sustainably by implementing technologies and complying with 

the code of practice.

Building and Construction

We minimise construction waste by harnessing advanced technology, namely BIM, VDC and Virtual Reality. 

These technologies pre-empt costly abortive works by identifying clashes in a virtual environment before 

the project is actually built. High standard of workmanship and quality of works are also achieved through 

implementation of DfMA technology like PPVC and PBU by shifting work to a sheltered and controlled 

environment. Wherever feasible, construction materials used for our projects are Green Label certified from 

the Singapore Environmental Council. The Group implements on-site recycling policies to segregate different 

types of waste materials so they can be efficiently handled for disposal. Surface run-off water is treated 

before it is discharged to public drains.

Keong Hong is responsible in the disposal of its waste materials by using only approved methods to minimise 

any harm to the environment. Excess debris and general waste from construction are collected in designated 

bins for proper disposal by licensed disposal contractors. All leftover scrap metal from reinforcement bars 

are segregated and disposed by licensed waste collectors. Timbers that are not reusable are periodically 

disposed by the licensed contractor engaged by our appointed Environment Control Officer.

Operations and Investment in Maldives

To ensure proper management of sludge and effluents, the Group has constructed a sewer network grid 

over the island with a gravity flow system, as opposed to the conventional pump system used in previous 

projects which was less energy-efficient.

At Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel, sewage is disposed via a computerised chemical digestive system 

whereby sewage is pumped via a 150,000 litre capacity sewage treatment plant to process it into sludge. 

On the other hand, sewage at Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort is disposed via Membrane Bioreactor 

system whereby sewage is pumped via a 300,000 litre capacity sewage treatment plant to process it into 

sludge. Once the sludge is dried, it is sent to a nearby waste management centre and used for landfill. This 

system is established for both Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort, 

and complies with local standards and accepted code of practices.

We take care in wastewater disposal to ensure that we do not harm the environment during operations. 

At our properties, rejected brine from our RO plants are instantly mixed with the water column to reduce 

its concentration to negligible amounts before being discharged into the lagoon, thus this discharge has 

no effect on the surrounding environment. Sewerage is also recycled into portable water to be stored for 

irrigation usage, and only excess sewerage is discharged into the sea.

Division of waste type generated at our Kooddoo Airport, Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman 

Maldives Maamutaa Resort are completed at the waste management building which is equipped with 

incinerators, compactors and bottle crushers. We ensure that proper transportation and waste disposal 

methods are used in accordance to the type of waste.

In our effort to minimise plastic wastage, we own a water bottling facility which effectively cleans glass 

bottles and fills the bottles up with clean filtered potable water. These glass bottles of water have replaced 

plastic bottles in the rooms, thereby reducing plastic waste generated.

Managing our Suppliers (GRI 308-1, 308-2)

Operations and Investment in Maldives

When selecting suppliers, we entrust the recommendations from our internationally renowned hotel operator, 

AccorHotel (“Accor”), with their abundance of experience in the Maldives region. We evaluate and select 

suppliers that are approved and recommended by our hotel operator.

The suppliers have gone through stringent checks to ensure that they are in compliance with local regulations 

and sourcing of raw materials are done ethically and in an environmentally friendly manner. We also regularly 

review the supplies procured to ensure that sustainable products are used. For instance, at Mercure Maldives 

Kooddoo Hotel, the procured bed sheets, duvet and pillow covers are eco-friendly textile products certified 

according to Oeko-Tex Standard 100 technology. The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 is a globally uniform testing 

and certification system for textile products which covers multiple human-ecological attributes, and textile 

products may be certified according to Oeko-Tex Standard 100 only if all components strictly meet the 

required ecological criteria without exception. This shows our commitment to ensure a sustainable supply 

chain.

We have plans to start screening suppliers ourselves instead of through our hotel operator for future jobs 

to ensure quality, accountability and social responsibility within our supply chain.

Building and Construction

At Keong Hong, we take pride in our efforts to ensure that our suppliers and subcontractors are selected 

based on high quality and environmentally friendly practices. Before awarding contracts, we evaluate 

our suppliers and subcontractors based on their track record, workmanship, ISO certification and safety 

performance. We select those with satisfactory scores, and for some who are relatively new and failed the 

supplier assessment, we will monitor their site performance to ensure accountability and quality assurance.

During contract term, we continue to assess suppliers based on their compliance with material specification/

standards, response to replacement of defective material/emergency and their Green and Gracious practices. 

As for subcontractors, we assess their technical capability, safe performance and Green and Gracious 

practices. These continuous assessments show our commitment to maintain quality and sustainability of 

our operations.

In addition, subcontractors and external service providers procure materials and services for our contracts 

and project activities, we execute purchase control to ensure that they meet the needs of our project 

requirements during procurement. We go the extra mile in supplier management to insure quality, 

accountability and sustainability in our supply chain.

Environmental Compliance (GRI 307-1)

The Group’s compliance policies and regulations take into consideration data collected on Energy, Water, and 

Waste Disposal. The data are analysed for the various projects for project cost optimisation and resources.

Keong Hong has committed to a set of guidelines to manage environmental pollution at all our project sites. 

We are committed to controlling the combined cost of water, electricity, diesel consumption and generator 

rental to less than 1% of contract sum per project, as well as keeping waste disposal cost to less than 0.3% 

of contract sum per project.

Building and Construction

The Group strives to manage noise arising from construction activities by using a set of permissible noise 

limits and Noise Management Plans (NMP) compliant with National Environment Agency (NEA) Noise 

Regulation. 

To achieve minimization of noise, the Group has engaged a noise control vendor to perform real-time noise 

monitoring to ensure that the noise generated does not exceed the allowable limit NEA. Noise barriers 

are erected around the site to reduce noise from the construction equipment. Generators used on site are 

required to be ‘silent’ generators, so that noise generated is reduced.

The Group implements vector control plans at our sites to combat the issue of pest and mosquito breeding. 

Daily on-site housekeeping checks are conducted to control and pre-empt mosquito breeding. To further 

mitigate mosquito breeding, the Group engages pest control companies to manage our construction sites to 

clamp down on mosquito breeding. Allocation and implementation of proper disposal systems for construction 

debris and organic waste are in place to facilitate pest control.

We aim to receive no more than one NEA summon for noise, silt and mosquitos per project over a 12 months 

window period of construction activities.

We hold employee satisfaction and appreciation in high regard, and we recognise long-serving employees 

with annual long service awards. As we embrace diversity and encourage inclusivity, we employ workers 

from eight other countries. We also recognise the contributions of all employees equally and fairly. As such, 

there were no incidents of discrimination in our organization, and more than half of our construction workers 

have been with the company for over 5 years. With 71 employees with more than 10 years of service, this 

is a testament of our exemplary labour management.

Employee Benefits (GRI 401-2, 401-3)

At Keong Hong, we prioritise the welfare of our staff and workers by entitling them to a range of benefits 

including healthcare and insurance, parental leave and retirement benefits where eligible as we believe in a 

comprehensive welfare system for our employees. Long service employees are rewarded with increases in 

annual paid leave. Medical benefits, dental claims and fully paid Executive Health Screenings are extended 

to all employees.

Every female employee is entitled up to a maximum 16 weeks of paid maternity leave while male employees 

are entitled up to 2 weeks of paid paternity leave. Employee’s entitlement to childcare leave is in accordance 

to the Children Development Co-Savings Act. Adoptive mothers are entitled to 12 weeks of paid adoption 

leave to care for their adopted infants.

The physical and mental wellbeing of our staff is integral to their career development as well as the 

sustainability of our growth. As such, we implemented initiatives such as building a gym facility and Cosy 

Corner at our Headquarters for employees to exercise regularly and enhance their work-life balance. In 

addition, we regularly organise recreational events such as cricket and hockey games and festival celebrations 

for all staff and workers, including our sub-con workers, to promote bonding and social well-being.

Assessment of Supplier on Labour Management (GRI 408-1, 409-1, 414-1, 414-2)

Operations and Investment in Maldives

Our selected hotel operator, Accor, ensures strict compliance with the local legal framework, as well as 

various fundamental documents including International Labour Organisation’s fundamental conventions 

and the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact. As such, Accor exercises strict due diligence 

when assessing their suppliers and service providers to ensure that they are not at risk for incidents of child 

labour or forced or compulsory labour. In the event of non-compliance with local labour laws, Accor would 

immediately sever all ties with the supplier or service provider in question.

We entrust Accor with the hotel supplier management as they have expertise in that area. Majority of our 

suppliers are approved and recommended by our hotel operator. The suppliers have gone through stringent 

checks to ensure there is no child or prisoner labour. We have plans to start screening suppliers ourselves 

for future jobs to ensure quality and accountability.

To ensure compliance with Maldives labour regulations, our HQ key personnel regularly visit the Kooddoo 

airport site to conduct operational audit with the assistance of our local legal advisor. We ensure that all 

workers on the Pullman Maldives Maamutaa construction site are holding on to valid work permit.

We exercise stringent control on-site via biometric system to ensure only valid work permit holders can gain 

entry to the project site. Regular checks are conducted by our HR executive to ensure that only workers 

registered under the current worksite resident address are allowed to stay on-site. We mandate that our 

contractors and sub-constructors comply with labour regulations in Singapore.

Giving back to our Community (GRI 413-1, 413-2)

Since the Group’s beginning, we have recognised that giving back to our community is an ongoing 

commitment and a significant part of our efforts to make a difference to society. For many years, the 

Group has funded charitable organisations that focus on caring for the underprivileged, community chests, 

societies and religious communities. Since 2010, the Group has donated over S$609,000 to various charitable 

organisations and beneficiaries.

Our corporate social responsibility programme in FY2018 included adopting a tree at the Singapore University 

of Technology and Design campus for $8,000, as part of its “Campus in Bloom” fundraising drive to raise 

money for scholarships, bursaries, and student welfare and campus initiatives. This is in line with our 

support of educational initiatives to develop a future generation which will contribute to the growth of the 

country. We also made donations to other charitable and social causes such as the Community Chest, 

Singapore Association for Mental Health and The Singapore Scout Association. The Group places emphasis 

on dedicating resources towards the development of local communities and future leaders by investing in 

educational institutes and bursaries.

The Group has also been channelling a significant part of our efforts and resources into developing the talent 

pool for our industry. In FY2018, the Group has donated over $166,000 to bursaries and educational institutes. 

We have awarded scholarships and bursaries to deserving recipients for their pursuit of tertiary education. 

For example, the Built Environment Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme administered by BCA is awarded 

to promising individuals to pursue an undergraduate course in Built Environment Tenable at one of the local 

universities. We are also one of the participating companies in the Institute of Technical Education (“ITE”) 

Work-Learn Technical Diploma in Mechanical and Electrical Services Supervision (“TDMESS”) course under 

the “SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme”. We endeavour to contribute to the growth of our industry 

through the development of our future generation of talents.

More recently, we have worked closely with United Nations Development Programme (“UNDP”) to achieve 

global Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) to create sustainable localised solutions to the population. 

We have received several appreciation letters commending our efforts and commitment to the UNDP.

Keong Hong will continue with our contributions to the community and fulfil our duty as a socially responsible 

corporation.

Fines or Penalty (GRI 307-1, 416-1, 416-2, 419-1)

At Keong Hong, we strictly comply with social and economic laws and regulations where we operate.

Building and Construction

Keong Hong Construction Pte Ltd was fined S$352,500 by MOM for housing foreign workers in overcrowded 

conditions in temporary quarters and a debarment term of 2 years. This lapse was because of a shortage 

of short term foreign worker dormitories available in the market, coinciding with the completions of several 

Keong Hong projects within a short window period, resulting in a temporary spike in demand for worker 

accommodation. After providing the explanation to the Agency, the ban imposed on the group for the 

recruitment of new foreign workers was reduced to six months on 12 June 2018.

In order to prevent such recurrence, Project Managers and Supervisors are to meet weekly for an update of 

the workers’ housing and living conditions to ascertain compliance with the regulations set forth by MOM. In 

addition, regular inspection of the workers’ living quarters shall be conducted by the Supervisors to ensure 

that the hygiene level is maintained.

The Group has also received an S$2,500 fine from Public Utilities Board (“PUB”) due to the discharge of 

silty water into public drainage. Keong Hong takes such matters seriously and shall take the necessary steps 

to ensure that such issues do not surface again. Keong Hong shall seal the gaps between the hoarding and 

hoarding footing, provide humps at the site entrance and pave up the access paths/roads. The Group shall 

also regularly review our environmental policies and enforce them.

Protecting Customer Privacy and Data (GRI 418-1)

The Group takes utmost care in protecting our customers’ privacy and data and is in compliance with the 

Personal Data Protection Act (2012). There has been no reported breach in FY2018.
