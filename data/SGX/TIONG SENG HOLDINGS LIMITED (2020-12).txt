BOARD STATEMENT

The Board of Directors (Board) of Tiong Seng Holdings Limited (the “Company”, together with its

subsidiaries, the “Group”) is pleased to present the Group’s fourth Sustainability Report. Tiong Seng aims

to be the trusted investment choice in the real estate and built environment sector through delivering

excellence and creating long-term value for our stakeholders. The Board considers sustainability issues

as part of the business strategic formulation and decision-making processes. In this report, we are proud

to share our sustainability approach on managing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that

are important to us and our stakeholders.

Board Assurance

We believe strong sustainability governance is critical to our success. The Board plays an important role

in the selection and review of ESG factors that are material to us and oversees the management of the

performance relating to these factors. This report adheres to the Singapore Exchange (SGX)-ST Listing

Rules 711A and 711B and references the internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

Standards.

Sustainability Initiatives

Despite the major and evolving challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, Tiong Seng remains

committed to contributing to a safe, high quality and sustainable built environment as an established

contractor and property developer. In 2020, we achieved and exceeded our targets set for all our material

ESG factors apart from plywood waste, which was not achieved due to the increased plywood usage in

the effort to speed up project progress following delays caused by COVID-19.

We recognise the impact that our operations and activities may have on society and the environment

and seek to mitigate any potential negative impact by implementing relevant measures. Apart from our

efficient and sustainable construction methods such as recyclable and reusable Light Gauge Steel (LGS)

hoardings, precast slab, Green concrete, precast drain, DfMA staircase etc., we adopt innovative

technologies and processes to manage our energy consumption and waste. We also utilise mobile water

recycling systems at our construction sites in Singapore to recycle water and reduce the silt introduced

into drainage systems. In addition, we work closely with our suppliers, contractors and sub-contractors

to identify opportunities to improve our sustainability performance.

Resilience against COVID-19

Tiong Seng has taken and continues to take action to address the challenges posed by the pandemic to

minimise business disruptions and support recovery efforts. As the health and safety of our employees

and workers are of utmost importance, we ensure compliance with governmental regulations and

guidelines including the temporary ceasing of our construction activities following the Singapore

government’s Circuit Breaker measures and the implementation of Safe Management Measures (SMM)

once our operations reopened.




4 | P a g e

To adapt to new ways of working, we have embraced digitalisation to enable the continuance of meetings

and trainings. We remain committed to ensuring the physical and mental well-being of our employees by

helping them adjust to the new work-from-home arrangements via various means and initiatives.

Based on the following five key principles: i) Learn, ii)Re-think &amp; Innovate, iii) Share, iv) Care and v) Work,

we are placing focus on facilitating learning and innovation, maintaining productivity and implementing

initiatives that will boost morale during the Circuit Breaker period. For example, we encouraged self-

created learning and training amongst employees via Webinars, launched our TS CARE scheme to ensure

none of our employees will be neglected or left behind and TS DigiGo to allow our workers to familiarize

with our digital field tools in a fun and interactive manner while enabling them to be digitally connected.

We distributed food and daily essentials to our workers during the Circuit Breaker and contributed to

various COVID-19 relief funds and donation drives to help the local community tide through these difficult

times. As developments surrounding COVID-19 remain fluid, the Board will monitor the situation closely

and keep our stakeholders updated on material developments.

The Board would like to thank those who have been with us throughout our sustainability journey. We

will continue our sustainability efforts to enhance the long-term value for our stakeholders.

Green Projects

We have used recyclable and reusable Light Gauge Steel (LGS) hoardings for the Jurong Town Corporation

Space @ AMK and Sloane Residence projects as well as their site offices. In both projects, Prefabricated

Bathroom Units which reduce the need for manpower are used.

Jurong Town Corporation Space @ AMK

For Jurong Town Corporation Space, construction methods such as precast slab are used for the access

and 40% of the super structural concrete works. This prevents material wastage and reduces our carbon

footprint. Our initiative such as Green concrete (ingredients are recyclable materials), precast drain,

DfMA staircase, MEP precast, PPVC ICE room and MSU, and usage of recycled water for construction are

part of our efforts to reduce our environmental impacts.

Sloane Residence

For Sloane Residence, columns and walls, water tanks and boundary walls were precast to reduce cast

on site which would otherwise require more workers. Recycled water for construction is also used in this

project.

Materiality Assessment

In 2017, a formal materiality assessment was conducted to identify the ESG topics that are most

important to our business and stakeholders. The materiality assessment was guided by the GRI Principles

of Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement. The material topics were identified and prioritised based on

inputs from our stakeholders, consideration of trends and developments in the construction and real

estate development sectors as well as global and local sustainability issues. In 2020, we re-validated the

list of material topics identified in the prior years to ensure they remain relevant to our business and

stakeholders.

The following material topics in 2020 remain unchanged from the previous year:

Environmental

Social

Governance

• Energy, Emissions and

Pollution

• Water

• Effluents and Waste

• Health and Safety –

Occupational and Supplier

Assessment

• Human Capital Assets -

Training and Education,

Employment, and Diversity

and Equal Opportunity

• Local Community

• Compliance and Anti-

corruption

Managing Our Supply Chain

Our suppliers and sub-contractors play an important role in helping us deliver quality work as we rely on

them for various construction and building materials as well as reliable and timely services for our

operations. Before engaging the services of our suppliers and sub-contractors, they are assessed based

on their financial capacity and business track record, human resource capability, quality of work, and

other relevant criteria, such as environment, health and safety records. In addition, we conduct yearly

assessments on the performance of our suppliers and sub-contractors in order to maintain high

operational standards.

ENERGY, EMISSIONS AND POLLUTION

2020’s Highlights

The usage of electricity and diesel accounts for our total energy consumption and the corresponding GHG

emissions that we emit. Recognising the growing importance of climate risks to our business, we strive

to contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the

adoption of renewable energy projects and improvement of our energy efficiency.

In 2020, we reduce electricity consumption intensity by operating battery-operated tool technology on

site and reduce non-essential use of lighting and air-conditioning by ensuring that air-condition

temperatures are set at a minimum of 25 centigrade at HQ and site office. Solar energy is deployed for

our noise monitoring devices and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) monitoring systems. During the year, we

have also introduced the use of soil nailing which reduces concreting and the number of concrete trucks

used.

Our electricity consumption was 3,425,957 kWh [12,333 Giga Joules (GJ)] in 2020, an increase of 512%

from 560,187kWh (2,017 GJ) in 20193Fd due to heavy electricity consumption for tunnelling activities of

the civil construction projects scoped in this year. Nevertheless, our electricity intensity4Fe for building

projects decreased by 76% from 4.80 kWh per square metre of project area in 2019 to 1.16 kWh per

d The 2019 figures for electricity and diesel consumption and intensities have been restated due to updated data

inputs.

e Intensity is calculated using the total GFA/CFA of the building/civil projects in the report scope for 2020.

square metre of project area in 2020, meeting our target of less than 10 kWh per square metre for

building projects.

In addition, we consumed 3,206,379kWh of electricity for two large-scale civil construction projects (T220

and PUB5), especially for PUB5, for its tunnelling activities. The electricity intensity target of 10kWh per

square metre for 2020 was for building projects only and did not account for the different electricity

intensity profile of civil construction projects which required high electricity consumption for its

tunnelling activities. Going forward, targets for building projects and civil construction projects will be set

separately.

On the contrary, although there was an increase in Gross Floor Area (GFA) of the projects in 2020, our

diesel consumption decreased by 8% from 651,038 litres (23,625 GJ) in 2019 to 602,098 litres (21,849 GJ)

in 2020. Accordingly, our diesel intensity decreased by 67% from 5.58 litres to 1.86 litres per square metre

of project area. The total energy consumption of electricity and diesel is 34,182 GJ in 2020.

We strive to minimise our environmental footprint by ensuring that our electricity consumption remains

below 10 kWh per m2 of GFA and our diesel consumption remains below 6 litres of diesel per m2 of GFA.

We have met all our 2020 targets. The variation in the on-site energy intensity depends on the phase of

construction and whether workers’ quarters are included in the construction sites, which contributes

substantially to energy demand.

Lower energy intensities recorded in 2020 is attributed to the suspension of construction activities for

about 2 months due to COVID-19 regulations and subsequent delays in business resumption for up to 3

months. We will continue to review the data trends and adjust our targets accordingly.

The total GHG emissions from electricity and diesel have increased by 52% from 1,993 tonnes of carbon

dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in 2019 to 3,024 tCO2e in 2020. The GHG emissions intensity has decreased by

47% from 0.017 tCO2e per m2 in 2019 to 0.009 tCO2e per m2 in 2020.

Dust and exhaust gas generated in our operations pose a threat to the health of workers on site and

compromise the air quality of surrounding areas. We also recognise that noise and vibration generated

by tools and machines during construction activities can have significant health effects. Hence, various

measures have been taken to manage and reduce air and noise pollution from our operations to

safeguard the health of our workers and surrounding communities.

In addition, we comply with the National Environment Agency (NEA)’s regulations and industry standards

to improve air quality and to protect the environment by using instrumentation devices to measure and

monitor defined parameters of air quality and noise emission. We ensure that the Pollutant Standards

Index (PSI) reading remain below 50 and the average noise level is kept below 75 dB(A) during the day

(7am to 7pm) and below 65 dB(A) at night (7pm to 10pm), at applicable sites.

impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, we intend to continue our efforts on responsible resource

management and will continue to explore resource efficiency improvements. 2021’s target reflected are for building

projects, where separate target will be set for civil projects accordingly.

WATER

2020’s Highlights

Singapore’s total water demand is expected to double by 2060, with the non-domestic sector accounting

for 70% of Singapore’s water demand according to PUB9Fj. High levels of water use may put significant

strains on water resources and result in wastewater pollution that could compromise important

ecosystem services and affect the quality of life. In water-scarce Singapore, the consequences can be

severe as the threat to water security could be further exacerbated by the impact of climate change.

At Tiong Seng, we are committed to reducing our total water withdrawal by using water-saving features

and increasing our efforts to recycle water where applicable. At our construction sites, NEWater and site

recycled water is used in lieu of potable water and push-button water taps are installed in toilets and

washrooms to reduce water consumption.

To support the Singapore Government’s efforts to conserve water and to minimise water wastage, water

recycling plants are installed at each of our project sites. These water recycling plants use filtration

systems to recycle collected rainwater and site run-offs. The filtered water is used for construction

purpose, cleaning of construction vehicles and flushing of toilets.

In 2020, our water withdrawal from the Public Utilities Board for building projects decreased by 39% from

40,415 m3 in 201910F k to 24,802 m3 in 2020. Accordingly, our water intensity11F l for building projects

decreased by 63% from 0.35 m3 per m2 of project GFA in 2019 to 0.13 m3 per m2 of project GFA in 2020,

meeting our target of less than 1 m3 per m2 for building projects.

In addition, we withdrew 352,340 m3 of water for two large-scale civil construction projects (T220 and

PUB5) which involved a large number of recharge wells, translating to a water intensity of 2.62 m3 per m2

of project construction floor area (CFA) for civil construction projects. The water intensity target of 1

m3/m2 for 2020 was for building projects only and did not account for the different water intensity profile

of civil construction projects. Going forward, we will account for the different nature of our projects in

our target setting.

In 2021, we target to keep our water intensity below 1 m3 per m2 of GFA for building projects and 4 m3

per m2of CFA for civil construction projects. The variation in our water consumption depends largely on

the phase of construction and whether there is a presence of workers’ quarters at the construction sites.

Construction activities may generate large amounts of waste which may put a strain on our natural

resources and ultimately lead to environmental degradation. Proper waste management is necessary to

avoid air, water and soil pollution, which pose a threat to the environment and human health. Similarly,

effluents must be disposed properly especially where substantial quantities of chemicals and nutrients

(principally nitrogen, phosphorous, or potassium) are present. Failing to do so would affect water quality

and in turn negatively impact the ocean's biodiversity and aquatic ecosystems.

We strive to ensure proper management and disposal of effluents by conducting regular testing of water

discharged and complying with discharge quality standards. TSS Meters have been installed at the water

discharge points to monitor the quality of water discharged into public drains. The monitoring is

conducted using closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage and readings obtained from the TSS Meters.

We follow a robust framework to reduce, reuse and recycle the construction waste generated from our

operations. In addition, several measures have been taken to monitor the quantity and composition of

waste generated. Separate waste bins are placed at our construction sites for the collection of various

waste types - general construction waste, timber, plywood, scrap metal and food waste. In order to

monitor and improve on our waste management performance, vehicles carrying waste are weighed at

the work site’s weighing bridge before they leave for the respective disposal sites. We also work with

NEA-licenced waste collectors to ensure that the waste generated is properly disposed of. Our waste

management performance is tracked on a regular basis through monthly reviews and data submitted to

the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) each year under the Green and Gracious Builder Scheme.

Further, we adopt innovative technologies and processes to reduce waste. In lieu of conventional

construction methods, the Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) and pre-cast off-site production

methods are used to reduce the need for wet work at our construction sites. We also utilise system

formwork in our construction activities, which replaces and can be reused more than conventional metal

and timber formworks. In addition, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is used in the management of

steel design to reduce steel use and waste on site.

General construction, timber, plywood and scrap metal wastes decreased by 62%, 66%, 55% and 53%

respectively from 201913Fn to 2020. The waste intensities for general construction, timber, plywood and

scrap metal wastes decreased by 86%, 88%, 84% and 83% respectively from 2019 to 2020.

The decrease in waste is attributed to the suspension of construction activities for about 2 months due

to COVID-19 regulations and subsequent delays in business resumption for up to 3 months and better on

site waste control as well as increasing application of DfMA in construction project that cut down in situ

work and hence waste .

We have met our 2020 target of reducing our waste intensities to the targeted levels for each type of

waste, except for plywood waste. Our target for waste intensity of plywood was not met despite

substantial reduction in year 2020 due to increase plywood usage in the effort to speed up project

progress following delay resulted from COVID-19, which inevitably caused more plywood needed. At

times, adjustments to planned construction methodology were necessary to be made on site due to

various constraints and project-specific requirements, further contributing to the higher consumption of

materials including those that were of one-time usage.

2021’s Target(s)

In line with our commitment to provide a workplace where the risk of illness or injury to our workers,

community and customers are eliminated or minimalised, our Occupational Health and Safety

Management System was certified under the new ISO45001:2018 standard in 2020. The effectiveness of

our system is checked by an external certification body on a yearly basis. As such, our hazard identification

and risk assessment processes undergo constant review and improvement, in turn improving safety for

our stakeholders.

Employee Health and Safety

We have an occupational health and safety (OHS) policy in place to protect all employees against possible

occupational risks and prevent accidents from happening in the workplace. Information on the OHS policy

is provided to all employees and new employees are informed of the policy during the Quality,

Environmental, and Occupational Health &amp; Safety (QEHS) induction programme. For new employees at

our construction sites, the First-Day Environment, Health and Safety induction programme provides an

overview of the OHS policy implemented at Tiong Seng. The Corporate EHS team participates in virtual

forums and seminars on a regular basis to keep abreast of the latest regulations and to re-examine the

existing OHS policy to ensure regulatory compliance.

Safety updates, initiatives and our corporate health and safety targets are shared with our employees

during daily toolbox meetings and monthly EHS committee meetings held at all project sites via video

conferencing. Our employees are encouraged to take part in safety initiatives, which include quarterly

safety rewards, demonstrations, talks, and creating safety posters. In-person meetings were conducted

in small groups with safe distancing measures in place and the duration of the meetings kept to a

minimum. Each year, safety awards are presented to projects with the best safety record. We provide

our employees with OHS training relevant to their work scope and offer health reviews to eligible

employees annually.






25 | P a g e

We carry out risk assessments and safety inspections of machines and equipment once every 3 years to

ensure that they are maintained in good condition and meet safety requirements. In addition,

Construction Safety Audit Scoring System (ConSASS) audits are conducted every six months by external

auditors approved by MOM or Singapore Accreditation Council to assess the welfare of the workers’

quarters. Our Safe Management Officer also conducts inspections of toilet facilities on a monthly basis.

The accident frequency rate decreased from 1.37 accidents per million man-hours in 2019 to 0.3616Fq in

2020. The workplace injury rate17Fr decreased from 431.0 in 2019 to 147.1 in 2020 which was below the

rate of 424.1 for the construction industry in Singapore during the same period. There were no fatalities

as a result of work-related injury and no high-consequence work-related injuries in 2020. The injury

sustained in FY2020 was a foot fracture.

The work-related hazards that pose a risk of high-consequence injury were identified to include improper

storage of marbles, the risk of which is minimised through the use of a rack system and pallet jacks to

retrieve the marbles. In 2020, to eliminate work-related hazards and minimise risks, we implemented

clean and unobstructed pathways to worksites with the use of barricades and fences which provide

workers with proper site access and improves safety. Mandatory cut-resistant gloves were provided to

our workers where our risk assessment identifies the potential for cuts. We have also used Body-Worn

Cameras as part of our efforts to influence behavioural safety on sites. In addition, we use podium steps

and height-adjustable working platforms instead of ladders in our new construction sites.

q Accident frequency rate =

������ �� ��������� ��������

������ �� ����� ������ ������ ��� ���� × 1,000,000 hours worked. This excludes injuries

that resulted in less than three days of sick leave, per MOM’s definition. Data includes all workers and staff under

Tiong Seng Group employment at the stated projects and Singapore head office, as well as workers who are not

employees but whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the Tiong Seng. The number of hours worked during

the year was 2,776,601.

Sub-contractor Health and Safety

We strive to ensure the safety of our sub-contractors by creating a safe working environment at our

construction sites and assessing the safety performance of our sub-contractors.

Information on Tiong Seng’s Environment, Health and Safety policy and health and safety targets is

provided to our sub-contractors before and during commencement of work. Regular dialogues are held

to allow our sub-contractors to share any concerns or issues that they may have relating to health and

safety. Our sub-contractors are also provided with updates and information on incidents reported during

our daily toolbox meetings and monthly EHS committee meetings at all project sites conducted via video

conferencing.

We require all our contractors to have a minimum BizSAFE Level 3 certification and we have achieved our

2020 target in this respect. They are also required to participate in briefings relating to risk assessment

and safe work procedures as well as training relevant to their work scope. We will only engage new

contractors who are not BizSAFE Level 3-certified if they can achieve the BizSAFE Level 3 certification

within three months of the date of the new contract agreement.

All contractors (including our second and third tier suppliers) are encouraged to attain the Biz-SAFE-STAR

status within two years of their Level 3 certification. Safety inspections and audits are carried out every

six months to ensure that machines and equipment used by sub-contractors are in proper working

condition.

Besides conducting an evaluation on each sub-contractor, we provide training to the members of its

management team and share best safety practices with them.

We have taken various measures to prevent workplace injuries and fatalities, which include providing

additional training, developing management plans and carrying out a weekly inspection of our sites. We

also adopt the Design for Safe Construction (DfSC) principles in our projects and offer various training

courses to our employees and contractors such as the Incident Blackbox Learning.

Training and Education

We invest in the professional development of our employees to align with our changing business needs.

At Tiong Seng, we provide various learning opportunities throughout our employees’ careers to ensure

that they develop the skills needed to perform their duties and drive excellence in operations and safety.

We ensure that our workers are sent for Coretrade Training to equip them with the specific skills they

need based on their job scopes and we assist them to obtain certification to perform certain tasks or to

operate certain machineries. However, due to COVID-19 restrictions, construction activities were

suspended and delayed during 2020 and the Coretrade Training was suspended from April to June 2020.

In addition, per MOM’s regulations, all in-person Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) trainings and

assessments were suspended from 2 June 2020 until further notice to minimise physical interactions.

Despite the challenges of COVID-19, Tiong Seng continues to engage its staff through various means and

initiatives to facilitate learning and innovation, maintain productivity and boost employee morale by

encouraging self-created learning and training amongst employees via webinars. These include but not

limited to the launch of multiple applications such as TS DigiGo, a mechanism to allow our workers to

familiarize with our digital field tools in a fun and interactive manner and  DigiLearn for workers to

improve safety awareness by observing various safety videos uploaded and complete a question and

answer quiz thereafter.

As a result, in 2020, each employee received an average of 62.1 hours of training19Ft, an increase from 57.7

hours in 2019.

At Tiong Seng, we offer our chargehands (i.e. worker leaders) an opportunity to develop skills such as

leadership through the Chargehand Grooming Programme. We also have a comprehensive Scholarship

Social Responsibility

Our involvement in the local communities enables us to identify and channel our efforts to address local

needs and concerns. We strive to address those needs by focusing on philanthropic activities, which

include providing scholarships and bursaries to talented students at Ngee Ann, Nanyang and Singapore

Polytechnics, BCA Academy, Institute of Technical Education (ITE), Nanyang Technological University

(NTU), National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). Through

the ‘Tiong Seng Bursary’, we provide deserving and financially disadvantaged students an opportunity to

pursue a full-time undergraduate degree programme in engineering at SIT. The bursary covers the

recipient’s educational expenses and fees for educational activities organised by the institute. In 2020,

we contributed donations towards the SIT bursary which would eventually benefit up to 5 SIT students

on a yearly basis who may otherwise not have the financial means to attend university. In addition, we

awarded scholarships to 3 students.

During the year, we also made donations to various charity organisations including Law Society Pro Bono

Services, Vision 2030 Fund, Young Men’s Christian Association of Singapore, Migrant Workers’ Assistance

Fund and NCSS Charitable Fund. In addition, we contribute to trade organisations through donations.

To support the local community amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, we contributed to various COVID-19

relief funds including the Singapore Contractors Association Ltd (SCAL) COVID-19 Fund and the Student

Relief Fund at SIT (COVID-19). During the two months of Circuit Breaker, we provided food and essential

items to our workers. In addition, we donated surgical masks to the Ministry of Trade and Industry to aid

the government’s efforts in tackling the pandemic. The Company also answered the call from the nation

to undertake several essential services projects to work on quarters for workers and recovering COVID

patients.

On top of that, we partnered with one of our banker for the latter to launch the Value Chain Financing

(VCF) scheme for our strategic subcontractors and suppliers. In this VCF scheme, the bank will do a holistic

assessment of the financing needs of each firm within the projects’ value chain and to work out a program

for them, which some may not have previously been able to access to in the past.

We seek to build good relationships within the real estate development community and the general

public by, where opportunities arises, sharing our experiences at industry virtual events, forums and

learning initiatives, such as the Lean Construction initiative led by the Ministry of Manpower and the

publication of the HR Guidebook with the BCA. By sharing our expertise, we hope to do our part in

developing and increasing the pool of talent in the construction industry.
