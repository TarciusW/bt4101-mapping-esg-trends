BOARD STATEMENT 102-14 

 

Dear stakeholders,  

On behalf of the board of directors (“Board” 

or “Directors”) of Singapore eDevelopment 

Limited (“SeD” or “the Group”), we are pleased 

to present to you the second Sustainability 

Report (“SR”) of our Group for the financial 

year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”). 

This Report draws on the internationally 

recognized framework, the Global Reporting 

Initiative’s (“GRI”) Sustainability Reporting 

Standards. It aims to inform stakeholders of 

SeD about our sustainability performance in a 

transparent and accountable manner. In 

addition, it covers the Group’s strategies, 

policies, practices and performance in relation 

to economic, environmental, social and 

governance issues (“ESG”). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At SeD, we recognize that sustainability issues 

form an integral part of our operations and 

strategies, and we strive to drive our 

operations in the direction in which we can 

contribute positively to all our stakeholders.  

During the year, we conducted a materiality 

review and assessment with our external 

consultants and have identified 8 indicators 

that matter most to our business, and to both 

internal and external stakeholders. These 

material issues are taken into account through 

our four sustainability strategies – Business 

Integrity, 

Economic 

Performance, 

Environmental Sustainability and Human 

Capital.

BOARD STATEMENT 102-14 

 

Business Integrity 

We do not tolerate any form of corruption or 

fraud within the Group. Business integrity and 

corporate governance is an important core 

value of SeD. 

The Board is strongly committed to achieving 

high standards of corporate governance 

which is essential to the stability and 

sustainability of the Group’s performance, 

protection of the interests of shareholders of 

the Group and enhancement of long-term 

Shareholders’ value and returns. 

In 

addition 

to 

complying 

with 

the 

recommendations of the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012, policies have also been 

established to address business conduct 

expected 

of 

all 

employees. 

Our 

whistleblowing policy provides avenues for 

staff to raise concerns about suspected 

Reportable Conduct which may adversely 

affect the Group.  

 

Economic Performance  

SeD believes in the creation of long-term 

economic value and a stable economic 

performance of the Group. In addition to the 

Group’s financial performance, SeD also 

focuses on the indirect impact of our 

infrastructure 

investments 

on 

the 

stakeholders and the economy.  

 

Environmental Sustainability 

With the growing awareness and importance 

of sustainability in Singapore, we recognize 

that there is a need to contribute towards 

combatting climate change. 

 

 

SeD 

is 

committed 

to 

minimizing 

our 

environmental 

impact 

by 

focusing 

on 

reducing our energy footprint. 

 

Human Capital 

Employees are highly valued as they are a key 

to the contribution of SeD’s growth and 

success. Our headcount is 20 in FY2018 as 

compared to 23 in FY2017.  In addition, our 

gender ratio of employees has remained 

consistent as last year.  

 

Looking Ahead 

FY2019 continues to be a transformational 

year for the Group. We will focus on our 

portfolio of businesses to deliver improved 

returns in the coming years. At the same time, 

we will continue to integrate sustainability 

into our daily operations across the Group. We 

appreciate and are thankful to all our 

stakeholders who are embarking this journey 

with us to build a more sustainable future.  

 

 

The Board have considered sustainability 

issues as part of its strategic formulation, 

determined the material ESG factors and 

overseen the management and monitoring of 

the material ESG factors.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY  

 

Reporting Principles 102-46 

In defining our reporting content, we applied 

the GRI reporting principles for defining report 

content 

– 

stakeholder 

inclusiveness, 

the 

sustainability 

context, 

materiality 

and 

completeness – by considering the Group’s 

activities, impact and substantive expectations 

and interests of our stakeholders. 

 

Materiality Review Process 102-46 102-47 

As part of SeD’s process in determining 

materiality, an internal strategy review and 

sustainability workshop moderated by an 

external consultant was organized during the 

year. During these sessions, the Group reviewed 

its vision, mission and core values, strategic 

direction, sustainability impacts and material 

topics.  

 

We 

reflected 

on 

significant 

economic, 

environmental and social impacts to determine 

aspects that are material to the organization as 

they are integral to SeD’s success of building a 

sustainable future for all of our stakeholders.  

8 indicators, which are grouped into 3 main 

categories, 

were 

identified 

during 

the 

assessment conducted in accordance with GRI’s 

Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016. The 

materiality 

assessment 

was 

subsequently 

endorsed by SeD’s Sustainability Committee.

BUSINESS INTEGRITY 102-16 205-2 205-3 

 

SeD is committed to achieving and maintaining 

a high standard of corporate governance and 

business integrity within the Group. By doing 

so, it helps to ensure the stability and 

sustainability of the Group’s performance, 

protect the interests of shareholders of the 

Group and enhance long-term Shareholders’ 

value and returns. 

The Group has substantially complied with the 

recommendations of the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012 (“Code”) to outline the 

corporate governance practices adopted by 

the Group in our Corporate Governance Report.  

For FY2018, we have communicated such anti-

corruption policies and procedures to all our 

employees. There have been no incidents of 

corruption in FY2018. We aim to maintain this 

for FY2019. 

 

Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures  

Our whistleblowing policy was set up with the 

purpose to encourage the reporting in good 

faith of suspected Reportable Conduct by 

establishing clearly defined processes. 

The objectives of the whistle-blower protection 

policy are to: 

• 

Provide for the mechanisms by which 

Whistle-Blowers may report Reportable 

Conduct; 

• 

Enable the Group to effectively deal with 

reports from Whistle-Blowers, in a way that 

will protect the identity of the Whistle-

Blowers and persons who participate in 

investigations initiated under this policy, 

and provide for the secure storage of the 

information provided; 

 

 

• 

Establish the policies for protecting 

Whistle-Blowers 

and 

persons 

who 

participate 

in 

investigations 

initiated 

under this policy, against reprisal by any 

person internal or external to the Group; 

and 

provide 

for 

an 

appropriate 

infrastructure for receiving, investigating 

and taking corrective or remedial action in 

relation to such reports. 

SeD has designated the company’s secretary as 

the Receiving Officer, who reports directly to 

the Audit and Risk Management Committee 

Chairman on all matters arising under this 

policy. 

The summary of the policy process is 

highlighted below.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We are pleased to report that there were no 

instances of corruption during FY2018 and aim 

to maintain this performance for FY2019. 

Protected report (any good 

faith communication in 

relation to reportable 

conduct) is being issued.

Receiving Officer will retain 

all documents in a safe, 

secure and proper manner. 

Audit and Risk Management 

Committee Chairman will 

review the information 

disclosed and carry out 

investigations.

The Audit and Risk 

Management Committee 

Chairman will prepare a 

report of its findings, with 

recommendations on 

remedial actions.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE  

By adopting responsible business practices and 

embedding sustainability in the business, SeD 

believes it creates long-term economic value 

and 

contributes 

to 

a 

stable 

economic 

performance of the Group.  

 

Our Performance 201-1 

For FY2018, the Group recorded a total revenue 

of $26.9 million, an increase by S$11.9 million 

from FY2017. This was due to a contribution of 

revenue from the property development 

project located in Frederick County, Maryland 

USA and revenue from the sale of biomedical 

products. 

Total operating expenses decreased by S$1.5 

million or 16% from S$9.5 million in FY2017 to 

S$8.0 million in FY2018. This is mainly due to 

cost savings achieved through the streamlining 

of our corporate expenditure. 

For the full details of the Group’s economic 

performance, kindly refer to our Annual Report 

2018. 

 

Indirect Economic Impacts 203-1 

Besides the direct economic value being 

generated, SeD also focuses on the indirect 

impact our infrastructure investments can have 

on the stakeholders and the economy. 

Our investment in the community is shown by 

designing highways, streets, roads, or common 

driveways guided by the following principles: 

• Design for opportunities to create 

interconnections between adjoining 

parcels. 

• Provide for safety, efficiency, and 

convenience of all users of the 

transportation system. 

• Be 

suitably 

located 

and 

designed/improved to accommodate 

prospective traffic, emergency service 

vehicles, 

and 

road 

maintenance 

equipment. 

Transportation systems and parking areas are 

intended to be adequate to serve the proposed 

use in addition to existing uses by providing 

safe and efficient circulation, and design 

consideration that maximizes connections with 

surrounding land uses and accommodates 

public transit facilities. 

During our development for the Ballenger Run 

project, we worked with the Frederick County 

Board of Education (“BOE”). SeD agreed that it 

would convey to the BOE, with no monetary 

consideration 

paid, 

a 

public-school 

site 

totalling a minimum of 13+/- acres, to serve 

the project and the surrounding regions. 

In addition, we work closely with various parties 

to understand the most recent market demand.  

In view of this, management is pursuing the 

rezoning of the multi-family continuing care 

retirement community parcel to allow for 

approximately 36 age-restricted villa lots. 

 

Procurement Practices 204-1 

By supporting local suppliers, SeD can 

indirectly attract additional investment to the 

local economy. It can also help to provide 

supply, support a steady local economy, and 

sustain community relations. 

For the Ballenger Run and Black Oak Project, 

the contractors engaged are local companies. 

Manpower onsite for construction is generally 

sourced locally by third-party contractors. In 

addition, materials are generally sourced 

locally by third-party contractors.

ENVIRONMENT 

Energy Consumption 302-1 

We track our electricity consumption on a 

monthly basis to monitor and improve any 

initiatives in place.   

This year, our Singapore office at Suntec Tower 

consumed 5,575.90 kilowatts of electricity, a 

significant reduction from 11,924.81 kilowatts 

of electricity in FY2017. This was because we 

occupied 1 office in FY2018 as compared to 3 

offices in FY2017.  

Our 

Houston 

office 

reported 

a 

total 

consumption of 8,606 kilowatts of electricity, an 

increase from 6,375 kilowatts of electricity in 

FY2017.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reduction of Energy Consumption 302-4 

The 

actions 

taken 

to 

reduce 

energy 

consumption include changing most of our 

lights to LED to save electricity and educating 

staff to be more aware of reducing their 

electricity consumption (e.g. switching off their 

computer at the end of the day or switching off 

the lights in each room when they are not in 

use). 

While the Group is not able to promise a 

specific level of energy reduction, we will 

monitor our energy consumption and make 

plans to reduce our energy consumption levels 

through the implementation of other energy 

saving measures.

SOCIAL 

Employment 102-7 102-8 401-1 

Employees are a crucial asset to SeD as they 

play a significant role in ensuring a high level of 

efficiency and achieving greater output.  

Our headcount for the Property Development 

Division totalled to 20 for FY2018, a small 

decrease from 23 in FY2017.  

Being a global group, our headcount includes 

employees from Singapore, Hong Kong and the 

United States of America. 

There were no temporary or part-time 

employees in FY2018. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition to the Group’s employees, SeD also 

outsources the development and project 

management 

activities 

to 

third-party 

contractors and consultants.  

Similar as FY2017, our gender distribution is 

considerably fair with 60% of our staff being 

Male and 40% of our staff being Female.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

In terms of age distribution, the majority of our 

employees still fall within the category of “Age 

between 40 – 49”, with them making up 35% of 

our headcount.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Employee Turnover 

During the year, 3 employees resigned with the 

breakdown being 2 employees from Singapore 

and 1 employee from Hong Kong. The 

employee turnover rate for each location is 

derived by dividing the number of resigned 

employees 

by 

the 

average 

number 

of 

employees in that location.  

There were no new employee hires in FY2018.   

We will continue to practice fair employment.
