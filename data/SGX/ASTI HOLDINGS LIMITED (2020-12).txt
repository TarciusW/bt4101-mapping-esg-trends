Board Statement 

We are pleased to present our fourth Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 

December 2020 (“FY2020”). As with previous years, we are committed to the topic of 

sustainability and would like to share our progress pertaining to sustainability over the year, as 

well as our approach, practices and performance around relevant material factors. 

ASTI provides an integrated range of services with regards to the semiconductor industry. With 

the growing expectations and concerns with regards to sustainability from various 

stakeholders, we believe our business goes beyond simply providing these services and 

understand that the consideration of sustainability cannot be left out in strategic decisions. 

As such, we endeavour to maintain and improve current sustainability practices and are 

committed to have sustainability as a key consideration in all strategic decisions. By engaging 

with our stakeholders and assessing material factors, we have updated our material factors and 

identified 13 material factors for FY2020 which helped shaped our sustainability strategy and 

set time-based targets. 

Since the start of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak, we have continued implementing a 

series of measures to ensure the well-being of our stakeholders. We are monitoring the 

pandemic situation and its impacts on our business closely as well as maintaining ongoing 

communications on COVID-19 updates with our staff, customers and visitors. We have 

implemented precautionary measures to minimise the risk of spread of COVID-19, such as daily 

temperature-taking, mandatory health declarations for employees and customers and safe 

distancing measures. During this COVID-19 period, we have also facilitated the smooth 

transition of our employees to work from home and conducted our trainings online. We strive 

to continue safeguarding the well-being of our staff and customers and deliver products and 

services to our valued customers, with minimal disruptions to our operations. 

We seek to grow our role in sustainability and are sure that this will help enhance our quality of 

life while protecting our planet. We look forward to working with you and welcome you on our 

journey to sustainability.

Materiality Assessment 

Annually, the Board conducts an exercise, involving members of ASTI’s senior management 

team, to review the relevance of ASTI’s material factors in order to identify if there has been 

any shift in priorities among stakeholders and examine any emerging areas of concern. This 

was especially important this year as there were many changes in the organisation. As such, we 

have engaged an external consultant to assist management with the development of the 

sustainability report. 

The identification of material issues involved conducting research on global and local trends in 

our industry and material topics identified by our peers and industry best practices. In FY2020, 

we have identified 13 material topics reflective of our business directions as compared to the 

11 reported material topics in FY2019, there is also an increase in the number of GRI standards 

reported. This is due to a combination of the sustainability practices in ASTI maturing and our 

desire to put sustainability at the forefront of our strategic decision making. 

We will continue to assess these material topics on regular basis to ensure their relevance and 

importance to our business.

Impact of COVID-19 on Material Factors 

 

Globally, manufacturing industries have taken a major hit from the COVID-19 outbreak. The disruptions 

posed by the outbreak could affect the achievement of the ESG targets for FY2021. We will continue to 

assess the uncertainties of COVID-19 on our operations, and the targets for FY2021 will be closely 

monitored against this assessment and adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the latest developments of the 

pandemic.

4.2. 

Environmental 

4.2.1. Energy and Emissions 

A large portion of our operation costs are attributed to electricity usage in the manufacturing 

process. We recognise that an increase in electricity usage also leads to an increase in 

greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. As such, there is a focus on tracking both energy and 

emissions consumption and intensity. 

It is also to our belief that improving our energy and emissions performance will lead to 

benefits for our organisation by maximising the usage of energy sources, and therefore, 

reducing both consumption and cost. 

We acknowledge our responsibility to reduce the environmental impacts of our business 

operations and commit to minimise our environmental footprints through sustainable practices 

and initiatives. 

Management Approach 

ASTI places great emphasis on improving energy and emissions performance through energy reduction 

initiatives, for example, by increasing the usage of shared office spaces and increasing the awareness 

among employees on the importance of environmental sustainability. 

Regular monitoring of our energy consumption is conducted in areas such as equipment 

manufacturing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning by implementing a robust monitoring system. 

With implementation of energy monitoring initiatives, we have seen a reduction in operational costs.

Both energy intensity and GHG emissions intensity have decreased in FY2019 to FY2020 by 

approximately 3.6% and 5.4% respectively due to a decrease in office utilization as part of safety 

procedures in tackling the pandemic. This decrease is within target of maintaining intensity within 10% 

of FY2019 levels.

Economic 

4.3.1. Economic Performance 

It is our belief that in order to deliver value for all our stakeholders, particularly our 

shareholders, we have to focus on maintaining a strong financial position. ASTI carries out our 

operations in a responsible manner and builds resilience throughout our business operations 

for long-term sustainable growth. 

 

Our financial performance for FY2020 can be found in the Financial Highlights section and 

Appendix 2 – Audited Financial Statements of the Annual Report, to be released in due course. 

4.4. 

Social 

4.4.1. Talent Attraction and Retention 

We pride ourselves on our highly motivated and engaged workforce. Our success depends on 

the commitment of our workforce. We are committed to providing equal and fair employment 

opportunities as we believe in employing diverse talent which is required for growth and 

innovation in our business. 

 

Management Approach 

All our employees are dedicated to deliver the best customer experience, products and services to our 

stakeholders. We collect, track and monitor our human resources (“HR”) data, including overtime, 

vacation balances and the number of training days on a regular basis. We believe in a transparent 

talent acquisition system. We offer our employees a competitive compensation and a range of other 

benefits.  

We also learn from the employees who leave the company through the exit interviews where we 

gather feedback and comments. It gives us some key insights on improvement in our recruitment and 

talent retention system. Our career development initiatives focus on providing all our employees with a 

clear line of sight of their career growth in ASTI. 

We strive to promote a culture of continuous performance appraisal for all job grades, encouraging 

constructive and open communication between managers and their staff. Although the pandemic has 

limited physical interaction between employees, we have also adapted through the usage of 

technology to ascertain that transparent and open virtual communication channels remain accessible 

to all employees. 

These initiatives provide clear insight to our employees to take ownership of their careers and progress 

with acquired skill sets. Our employee annual appraisals are based on the career development 

framework. We believe in a more engaging appraisal system where a discussion with employee is 

initiated on their personal development and long-term goals. Our full-time employees are provided 

with benefits which include health care coverage, parental leave and retirement plans. There were no 

part-time employees at ASTI Holdings in FY2020.

improvement from the turnover rate (6.7%) for FY2019.  

 

Targets 

For FY2021, ASTI will continue to target to have a turnover rate lower than the industry average of that 

year. 

By reviewing our employee retention strategies ASTI hopes to increase the retention rates therefore 

decrease the turnover rate in 2021.

Management Approach 

Our HR department assesses the current and future skills requirements for our business operations and 

designs learning and development programmes to meet these requirements. These programmes are 

tailored to meet the needs of employees and enhance their personal and professional development.  

There are special training programmes for the Senior Management to identify and groom promising 

individuals as part of our succession planning. During COVID-19, instead of conventional physical 

trainings, ASTI has leveraged on technology and utilized webinar training sessions on imperative topics, 

such as financial reporting. These online trainings allow the company to remain in the forefront of the 

industry while staying physically safe. In addition, online trainings were consistently conducted 

individually by employees.  

We continue to monitor the training needs and progress of our employees on a regular basis; this helps 

them to take ownership of their career development. 

Performance Data 

In FY2020, the employees were given an average of 1 on-site training hour each compared to 2 hours in 

FY2019. In addition, employees completed a total of 61.25 hours of online training sessions in FY2020.  

Targets 

For FY2021, we will set our target to provide an average of 3 hours of training, both online and on-site, 

to our employees.

4.4.4. Occupational Health and Safety 

Keeping our employees safe is our top priority as we believe that our employees deserve a safe 

workplace environment. We are in adherence to global and industrial standards and guidelines 

while providing a safe and positive working environment to our employees. 

 

Management Approach 

ASTI has a workplace health and safety committee to promote health and safety initiatives and 

programmes. The committee comprises of management and employee representatives who work 

together to identify any health and safety issues in the workplace and develop and implement 

corrective and preventive action plans accordingly. The committee also holds meetings on a regular 

basis and provides recommendations to improve health, safety and working conditions at ASTI. 

There are also established processes to measure and monitor our occupational health and safety 

performance. We maintain standard operating procedures via a safety handbook which all our 

employees and contractors comply with to ensure safe work practices. We also provide emergency 

response training and regular health &amp; safety training to our employees. This helps our employees 

identify health and safety hazards and respond to incidents such as accidents, injuries and health 

hazards. 

Fire drills are conducted twice a year to ensure that our employees are familiar with emergency 

procedures during a fire. During our fire drills, all employees and contractors are trained to identify and 

operate fire extinguishers placed in various locations within our premises. Regular inspections on fire 

extinguishers are conducted and signed off. We display emergency evacuation plans in our premises 

which are visible to all our employees and occupants. They are instructed to follow the evacuation plan 

during an emergency. 

Regular maintenance and quality checks are carried out on our machines, equipment and work areas 

within our premises for any health and safety risks. Our health &amp; safety team conducts safety drills to 

identify any potential hazards and monitor the effectiveness of local risk controls implemented. 

In addition, we put in place measures to reduce noise and air pollution within and outside our 

manufacturing plants. For example, compressed air guns in our manufacturing plants are used in short 

intervals and regular maintenance and inspections of the compressors are carried out in order to cut 

noise and air pollution. We display signage to use Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to prevent 

noise pollution in local languages at high noise areas. 

With the emergence of COVID-19, we have put on hold on-site fire drills and safety drills as employees 

mainly work from home. However, if employees are required to come to the office, we have 

implemented a series of measures to maintain a safe working environment for our employees. Some of 

the measures include travel restrictions to countries of operations, on-going communications between 

management and staff on safety measures, temperature taking, provision of face masks on premises, 

and safe distancing among employees. 

To safeguard the health of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, our HR department has 

been vigilant in providing advisories for employees to adhere to safe management measures. We 

received guidance from the Ministry of Health (“MOH”) and Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”)’s COVID-

19 advisories and safe management measures, particularly those relevant for workplaces.

Mandated requirements by the government have also been implemented and compliance was ensured 

through safe management officers that conduct inspections. Social distancing and temperature taking 

are priorities and we also highly encourage hygiene practices by placing hand sanitisers at high touch 

points. For common meeting spaces such as the pantry and board rooms, advisories are placed at the 

entrance to indicate the maximum number of people allowed at each time. 

In addition, a split working operation for employees is arranged when it was necessary for work to take 

place in the office. Staffs are rotated to come to office on different days based on assigned teams and 

on staggered working hours to ensure that the safety regulations are complied with. HR is also required 

to be informed if any employees hold third-party meetings. 

Performance Data 

With zero reported workplace fatalities and zero major accidents among our employees in FY2020, we 

have hereby achieved our target set for zero workplace fatalities/ injuries for FY2020.

ASTI enjoys a good track record of zero workplace injuries and fatalities and would like to continue 

having it in the future. As such, ASTI’s FY2021 goal will be to continue achieve zero workplace fatalities 

and injuries.

goals and business success. Sustainable procurement is important to ASTI for us to continue 

adding value to our stakeholders by maintaining transparency in our value chain and ensuring 

smooth sailing, high quality and on-time production and delivery of our products.

terms of sustainable practices, quality and pricing where we ensure that our suppliers deliver top-

quality raw materials and products. 

During COVID-19, we continuously monitor and update our supplier selection process online and 

ensure that only the best raw materials are used in the production process. Our current suppliers of 

raw materials for our production of equipment are monitored on a regular basis based on their 

performance. Any supplier that fails to meet the expected quality and delivery requirement is removed 

from the list of raw material suppliers. 

Performance Data 

There were no new suppliers engaged in FY2020. As per the target set for FY2020, ASTI ensured that all 

our suppliers complied with the requirements of the Quality Management System ISO 9001:2015 and 

monitors their performance in yearly basis with regards to product quality, delivery and response to 

complaints. 

Targets 

For FY2021, our target would be to ensure that all suppliers comply with the applicable ISO standards 

(e.g. ISO9001:2015). 

 

4.4.7. Compliance with Laws and Regulations 

Compliance with the applicable laws and regulations forms one of the most important pillars 

for sustainable growth and is an essential component of corporate governance in any 

organisation. Our reputation is what it is today because we strive to comply with relevant laws. 

 

Management Approach 

ASTI constantly keeps abreast with changes in the evolving regulatory landscape and has various 

procedures and risk management standards in place. We ensure that all our employees adhere to 

company’s values to act with integrity and conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical 

standards. 

Performance Data

pollution. ASTI strives for full legal and regulatory compliance, which includes not only 

socioeconomic regulations, but also environmental laws to maintain our licence to operate in 

all our locations. 

 




18 | Sustainability Report FY2020 

 

 

 

Management Approach 

Our sites in Singapore are subjected to environmental laws and regulations set by the National 

Environmental Agency (“NEA”), the Public Utilities Board (“PUB”) and the Singapore Civil Defence Force 

(“SCDF”). We keep ourselves updated with any new regulations on environmental compliance which is 

applicable to our business, so that we identify and manage our regulatory risks beforehand. 

Performance Data 

There were zero incidents of non-compliance with environmental compliance in FY2020, as such; the 

target for FY2020 was met. 

Targets 

With zero incidents of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations in FY2020, we have

4.4.9. Cyber security 

Cyber security is a key emerging threat in Singapore, as such; we strive to ensure our defences 

against such breaches are sufficient in order to protect our and our stakeholders' interests. 

 

Management Approach 

Cyber security is handled by ASTI’s IT department which has routinely updated ASTI’s Active Antivirus 

Server to protect all of ASTI’s clients’ personal computers and servers. They also handle an annual 

health check for IT Infrastructure including Servers and Devices (Firewall, VPN Device and Wireless 

Router). During this session, the IT department will update the relevant firmware and related 

important patches. These updates and checks reduce the risk for the devices and servers to have 

loopholes or weaknesses in security. Moreover, ASTI has a good and reputable firewall which is 

constantly updated. There is a daily back up in place in any case of any breaches such as ransom-ware 

and we can easily reinstall the data from our backup tape. 

In ASTI, other controls include assigning data access rights to authorised users for particular data 

folders in the data server. Users are also made to reset their password annually to reduce the 

possibility of their account being accessed by unauthorised people.  

Employees have limited access to the server so that in the case of any malware, there will a lower 

chance of disrupting the data and operating system (“OS”) of the server. Furthermore, the company 

website is hosted by an external party and not ASTI’s own server, reducing the possibility of hacking 

into ASTI’s office server. Lastly, ASTI outsourced email services to Microsoft who possesses an 

advanced scanning system to scan all emails for possible virus and malware. These controls reduce 

ASTI’s cyber security risk significantly. 

Performance Data 

There were zero incidents of cyber security breaches in FY2020. 

Targets 

There were no cyber security breaches in FY2020 and we continue to target for zero cyber security 

breaches in FY2021.

includes information on workplace ethics and our whistle-blowing policy. We encourage our employees 

to raise their concerns regarding suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest practices or other similar 

matters in a very secured and responsible manner. Any suspicious practices or inappropriate activities 

in the workplace are reported immediately by our workforce to the Head of HR and/or any member of 

the Executive Committee in a fair, respectful and timely manner. ASTI takes disciplinary action on the 

employee who is found guilty of fraud, dishonesty or criminal conduct.
