1. Highlights 

1.1 Corporate profile 

Jiutian Chemical Group Limited (九天化工集团有限公司) (Jiutian or the ‘Company’), together with its 

subsidiaries (the ‘Group’), are engaged in the manufacture and production of dimethylformamide (DMF) and 

methylamine in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). We are also involved in the processing and sale of 

consumable carbon dioxide and oxygen. 

The business is divided into three main business divisions: 

• 

DMF division producing DMF as its main product and methylamine as our secondary product; 

• 

Sodium Hydrosulfite division producing Sodium Hydrosulfite; and 

• 

Gas and Oxygen 18 division producing consumable carbon dioxide, Oxygen 18 and deuterium-

depleted water. 

We are located in Henan Province in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Whilst economic development 

and industrialisation in the PRC began on the eastern and southern coast, this process has begun to spread 

rapidly inland, including to Henan and its surrounding regions, where cost of labour, land and raw materials 

are significantly lower. 

As a result, industrialisation and urbanisation are occurring at a rapid pace in these regions, and the 

consequent establishment of factories producing a wide range of consumer products is driving the demand for 

chemicals such as DMF and methylamine. Being the only significant DMF producer in the Henan Province 

(within 500km from the plant), we are well-positioned to take advantage of this trend. 

In addition, our location in PRC’s Coal Belt allow us to enjoy a cost advantage over other PRC DMF producers 

due to our secure and low-cost access to the coal-based raw materials that are used in the manufacture of our 

products. Our production efficiency and cost-effective supply chain management strategy, which include direct 

piping-in of raw materials from our main supplier, has provided us a relative cost advantage against our 

competitors. 

Henan Province is also on the Beijing-Guangzhou railway and its capital Zhengzhou, has one of Asia’s largest 

railway stations and network. Zhengzhou has been developed into a logistics central station for cargo 

transportation. This will further reduce the transportation costs of our products. Our customer base in China 

consists of customers in Henan, the surrounding provinces adjacent to Henan, namely Hebei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, 

Hubei, Shandong, and Anhui, and provinces in the Yangtze Delta Region, namely, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. 

Some of our customers are manufacturers of downstream products that use methylamine and DMF, while 

others, especially those located further away in the Yangtze Delta Region, are trading intermediaries that 

distribute these chemicals to customers that use these chemicals in their manufacturing processes. With our 

second DMF/methylamine facility of 120,000 annual ton capacity completed in late 2007, we have emerged 

as one of the world’s largest manufacturers of DMF with a total annual capacity of 150,000 tons of DMF and 

methylamine. 

Jiutian was listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST) on 4 May 2006.

1.2 Message to stakeholders 

As a leader in DMF and methylamine production in China, 

Jiutian is poised to take a leading role in the environmental, 

health and safety (EHS) aspects to ensure sustainability of 

our operations and fulfil our responsibility towards our 

stakeholders. 

In 2017, we continue to engage in constructive dialogue with our 

stakeholders and focus on our four key pillars of Quality Management, 

Production Safety, Environmental Protection and Employee Well-

being. 

During the year, we have increased our operational efficiency at 

Anyang Jiutian and increased the plant capacity utilisation rate from 

57% to 65% for DMF production and from 92% to 100% for 

methylamine production. This efficiency forms a solid base upon which 

we can grow our business. 

Looking ahead, we remain optimistic. The major maintenance of our 

DMF and methylamine plants undertaken in 3rd Quarter 2017 will allow 

our plants to operate at a high efficiency in 2018.  

We are aware that the Chinese government’s emphasis on 

environmentally-friendly industrial operations will necessitate us 

keeping abreast of related regulatory developments and consequently 

improving our operations to comply with these changes. This pro-active 

stance will in turn place Jiutian on a more sustainable growth trajectory. 

In addition, we wish to confirm that the Board has considered 

sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, determined the 

material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and 

overseen the management and monitoring of the material ESG factors. 

As part of Jiutian’s commitment to sustainable development, we will 

continue to strive to do business in a responsible way.

3. Our performance 

3.1 How we measure our performance 

Our sustainability strategy is embedded into the appropriate parts of our business, with dedicated teams for 

each focus area, and coordination by our relevant departmental managers. 

Progress will be tracked in two key ways: measuring performance against metrics, and evaluating how well 

the programs have advanced, through a series of ‘commitments’. 

Metrics and targets 

We have established key performance indicators for each of the four focus areas outlined in our sustainability 

strategy. As this is our first year adopting sustainability reporting, we will be establishing quantitative targets 

within the next year to hold ourselves accountable and track how we are doing. 

Periodically, we plan to introduce new metrics and update targets to ensure alignment with our strategy. 

Commitments 

To ensure we have a robust sustainability program in place, we will also publish the key initiatives we plan to 

implement within the next year.

3.2 Quality management 

Overview 

Anyang Jiutian is primarily engaged in the manufacture and 

production of high purity DMF and methylamine to support 

the needs of our customers, mainly for their use as 

feedstock in the production of polyurethane (PU). We have 

established comprehensive procedures to ensure quality 

throughout the production process. 

In addition, we believe that effective management of our 

supply chain can help us conserve resources, optimise 

processes, increase productivity and promote positive 

corporate values. We are dedicated to the consistent 

implementation 

of 

our 

procurement 

policies 

and 

procedures across our entire operation. 

Plant capacity utilisation 

During the year, we have increased our operational efficiency at 

Anyang Jiutian and increased the plant capacity utilisation rate from 

57% to 65% for DMF production and from 92% to 100% for 

methylamine production. This efficiency forms a solid base upon which 

we can grow our business. 

Ongoing maintenance and repairs 

On 14 August 2017, Anyang Jiutian commenced annual major 

maintenance and repairs on the DMF and methylamine production line, 

which lasts approximately one month. Production stops during this 

annual exercise, which comprises technological improvements, 

maintenance and repairs on piping, meters and insulation, and other 

structural reinforcements. These maintenance and repairs will improve 

production efficiency and quality, and also prepare the chemical plant 

to run smoothly during the harsh winter months. 

In addition, regular maintenance and repairs are also carried out which 

does not affect the daily operations of the chemical plants. In 2017, 

total expenditure on maintenance and repairs amounted to more than 

¥31 million. 

Even as the production of DMF and methylamine has been ongoing for 

more than 10 years, the Production, Equipment and Technical 

Departments are always on the look out to improve the efficiency and 

effectiveness of the current production work flow through process 

improvement initiatives. In 2017, total expenditure on process 

improvements amounted to close to ¥4 million.

Stringent quality management 

The main raw materials for DMF and methylamine are methanol and 

liquid ammonia. Each incoming raw material shipment will be subject 

to stringent analysis and inspection by our in-house laboratory to 

ensure that the raw materials meet our production requirements for 

high purity chemicals. Shipments that cannot meet the purity 

requirement are entirely rejected and returned to the suppliers. 

Ongoing production are also subject to hourly quality inspection to 

ensure the consistency of DMF and methylamine production. 

Backed by our stringent quality management process, we seek to 

continue to achieve 100% product acceptance rate by our customers 

in the coming year. 

Purchases from Anhua 

Commencing from 1 January 2005, Anyang Jiutian signed a 20-year 

raw materials and spare parts purchase agreement with our principal 

supplier and shareholder, Anhua Group (Anhua), including the supply 

of coal, distilled water, steam and electricity.  

We continue to enjoy a close working relationship with Anhua to ensure 

the quality and consistent supply of these essential raw materials and 

utilities to our facilities at a reasonable price. 

Supplier management 

Anyang Jiutian purchases entirely from reliable local suppliers. A 

secure and stable supply chain is very important to ensure the smooth 

and uninterrupted operation of our production activities. As such, we 

have established a set of Supplier Management Policies (供应商管理

办法) to be applied to all our suppliers. 

Some of the areas covered by our policies include: 

• 

Supplier classification, 

• 

New supplier qualification and authorisation, 

• 

Supplier evaluation, 

• 

Supplier disqualification,  

• 

Supplier selection through fair competition, and 

• 

Inventory management. 

Other matters 

In August 2017, we organised a symposium on “Improving Efficiency” 

(效率效能) for all our employees. During the talk, our Non-Executive 

and Non-Independent Chairman, Mr. Wang Yiming, and other 

distinguished speakers impressed upon our employees the importance 

to improve quality and efficiency in all aspects of our work, including 

change management, continued improvement, KPI evaluation, product 

quality, product delivery, and cost management. 

In addition, in the spirit of “learning new knowledge and competing 

technical skills” ( 学 知 识 、 比 技 能 ), we organised a technical 

competition from July to November 2017 to assess and reward the 

technical competency of our employees.

3.3 Production safety 

Overview 

Safety is of paramount importance in the chemicals 

industry, and we have always stressed the importance of 

production safety in all our operations, especially when we 

deal with hazardous chemicals in each stage of our 

production process.  

We believe that one of the keys to improving safety is the 

creation of a more effective safety culture – one that does 

not emphasise production over safety. 

Inculcating an effective safety culture 

Safety in the chemical industry relies heavily on following correct 

procedures. Having an effective safety culture is hence very important. 

By building an effective safety culture, we can not only reduce injuries, 

we can also strengthen production, increase operational agility and 

move ahead on the journey to becoming a high-performance business. 

At Anyang Jiutian, our Safety Committee is headed by our General 

Manager, and supported by our Vice General Manager (Technical), 

Equipment Manager, Production Manager and Safety Manager.  

Daily safety briefings are held before each production shift with weekly 

and monthly safety meetings to summarise and incorporate lessons 

learnt. There are also periodic sharing sessions from each department 

to highlight on important safety aspects. 

New employees are required to attend company and departmental 

orientation trainings where safety features prominently in the topics 

which are covered. They are also required to familiarise themselves on 

all safety aspects in relation to their job scope. 

In addition, we also organise monthly safety competitions between 

different production shifts and reward the winning team with additional 

salary incentives. We believe that this is an effective motivational tool 

to improve production without compromising safety. 

We seek to continue to achieve zero production stoppage due to safety 

incidences and zero serious accidents in the coming year.

Production safety management 

We have established a set of Production Safety Management Policies 

(安全生产管理制度) that requires all employees to adhere to the 

relevant safety laws and regulations and company standards.  

Our employees are required to familiarise themselves with and uphold 

safety standards in order to achieve “Safety First, Effective Prevention, 

and Comprehensive Management” (安全第一、预防为主、综合治理). 

Some of the areas covered by our policies include: 

• 

Effective safety culture, 

• 

Safety training and development, 

• 

Occupational health and safety, 

• 

Handling of hazardous chemicals, and 

• 

Fire safety and prevention. 

Emergency preparedness 

While we emphasise on preventing safety incidents, we also prepare 

the employees to handle and respond to emergencies, including 

potential explosions, fire and chemical spills. This is very important to 

reduce and limit the impact and casualty as a result of the any safety 

incidents that may happen in our line of work.  

In addition to departmental trainings and refresher courses, we also 

conduct annual fire safety and emergency preparedness drills involving 

company personnel and the local fire station.  

In November 2017, we kicked off a full month of activities in conjunction 

with the “119” National Fire Prevention Month to strengthen fire safety 

and emergency preparedness awareness within Anyang Jiutian and 

our local community.

3.4 Environmental protection 

Overview 

Environmental protection is fast gaining traction in China 

amongst policy makers and the public. This move has 

posed significant implications, especially to the chemicals 

industry. As one of the largest producers of DMF and 

methylamine in China, Anyang Jiutian is committed to 

ensuring our full compliance with national environmental 

regulations.  

Comprehensive policies are developed to ensure the 

Anyang Jiutian’s commitment towards environmental 

protection, 

reducing 

carbon 

emissions, 

preventing 

pollution, and minimising waste can be achieved during our 

daily operations.  

Environmental policy in China 

Environmental policy in China is set by the National People's Congress 

and managed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the 

People's Republic of China. The central government issues strict 

regulations for which the actual monitoring and enforcement is largely 

undertaken by the local governments. 

In January 2015, a new environmental law came into effect, covering 

land, water and air pollution. It contains strict penalties, including 

seizing of the property of illegal polluters, with company executives 

subject to prison sentences of 15 days. There is no upper limit on 

fines. More than 300 different groups will be able to sue on the 

behalf of people harmed by pollution. 

Anyang Jiutian is fully compliant with China’s environmental policy 

and has obtained the requisite clearance on its environmental 

protection facilities since November 2015. 

Environmental protection management 

At Anyang Jiutian, our Environmental Protection Committee is headed 

by our General Manager, and supported by our Vice General Manager 

(Technical), Equipment Manager, Production Manager and Safety 

Manager. They will oversee all environmental protection matters in the 

Company. 

In addition, we have established a set of Environmental Protection 

Management Policies (环境保护管理制度) that requires all employees 

to adhere to the relevant environmental protection laws and regulations 

and company standards. 

Some of the areas covered by our policies include: 

• 

Source pollution management, 

• 

Air pollution monitoring, 

• 

Proper discharge of solid and liquid waste 

• 

Pollution management, and 

• 

Pollution management diagrams for our production of DMF 

and methylamine.

Emissions reduction 

The corporate culture of protecting the environment is reflected in every 

operation undertaken by Anyang Jiutian. 

We are committed to positive action on climate change and dedicated 

to reducing the carbon emission in our daily operations. Employees are 

reminded to save electricity and fuel consumption through regular 

internal communications.  

To determine the carbon footprint, we collect energy usage data from 

each our businesses and then calculate our total annual greenhouse 

gas emissions.  

In 2017, Anyang Jiutian generated a carbon footprint of 1,018.59 

tonnes of carbon dioxide emission (tCO2e) with a carbon emission 

intensity of 4.03 kgCO2e per tonne of production. The emission mainly 

arises from purchased steam used in the production process which 

accounted for more than 74% of the total carbon emission of Anyang 

Jiutian. 

 

 

We follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol established by the World 

Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable 

Development, the standard manual for measuring corporate 

greenhouse gas emissions. Using the “control method”, we include 

100% of the emissions associated with businesses which we directly 

control. Our carbon footprint includes:  

• 

All fuels used directly by our companies (Scope 1 emissions) 

• 

All purchased electricity and steam used in our facilities (Scope 

2 emissions) 

• 

Impact of business air and rail travel, and transportation of 

goods to our customers (optional Scope 3 emissions) 

We will continue to monitor the performance on the carbon emission 

reduction. Progress and performance on the reduction of carbon 

emission will be reported in the following year.

Gaseous emissions 

DMF and methylamine production produces fumes containing 

hydrogen sulphide and ammonia respectively. These obnoxious fumes 

need to be securely collected and treated before they can be safely 

released into the atmosphere. 

Hydrogen sulphide gas from DMF production will undergo a 

desulphurisation process to remove the presence of sulphur to a level 

of less than 0.1 PPm. On the other hand, ammonia gas from 

methylamine production is recovered, purified and recycled as 

feedstock for the production. 

As a result, the fumes released into the atmosphere will be able to meet 

the requirements of the gas emission standard of the Henan Province. We 

seek to continue to ensure that 100% of our gaseous emissions meet 

the local emission standards in the coming year. 

Waste and wastewater management 

Waste materials from the production of DMF and methylamine are not 

significant. Any waste engine oils and materials recovered from 

maintenance of piping, meters and insulation will be aggregated in a 

locked and isolated container and disposed through proper biohazard 

disposal channels. 

Wastewater disposal is handled by Anhua on the company’s behalf. 

Anhua’s facilities are able to handle up to 15,000 m3 of wastewater a 

day, through a set of parallel biological treatment tanks.  

As a result, the treated wastewater discharge will be able to meet the 

requirements of the water emission standard of the Henan Province. 

We seek to continue to ensure that 100% of our wastewater discharge 

meet the local emission standards in the coming year. 

In 2017, Anyang Jiutian had a wastewater discharge intensity of 

2.27 m3 per tonne of production. The volume of wastewater discharged 

exceeds municipal water consumption due to water from condensed 

steam produced during production. 

Saving water 

Water scarcity is a growing concern around the world and a serious 

global challenge that we must work together to address.  

Water consumption in chemical plant are intensive. Where possible, 

Anyang Jiutian already has procedures in place to utilise recycled 

water for its processes.  

In 2017, Anyang Jiutian had a water consumption intensity of 0.86 m3 

per tonne of production. In addition, up to 27% of municipal water 

consumption is being recycled and reused. 

We will continue to monitor the performance on the water consumption 

reduction. Progress and performance on the reduction on water 

consumption will be reported in the following year.

3.5 Employee well-being 

Overview 

To increase the productivity, Anyang Jiutian has a 

comprehensive performance appraisal programme and 

rewards system based on the result of the appraisal. The 

performance appraisal programme is essential for us to 

understand the skills level of the employees and 

appropriate training programmes can be designed to fill up 

the skill gaps.  

We emphasise on the career path and progression of our 

employees. To achieve this, the management builds 

several two-way communication channels to ensure the 

career development needs of the employee are taken into 

consideration 

whenever 

it 

is 

possible.

opportunities are equal to all employees based on needs 

identified.  

Though these efforts, Anyang Jiutian is well-positioned to 

provide a constructive working experience to our 

employees and contribute to the economic development 

and skilled labour resources of the local community. 

Skills competency and employee training 

To ensure that our employee excel, we emphasise on continuous 

learning in the workplace. Every employee has equal opportunities to 

upgrade and sharpen their skill sets through formal and on-the-job 

internal training programs and inter-departmental competitions. 

In 2017, Anyang Jiutian invested an average of 84 hours of training on 

each employee. 

Performance appraisal  

To ensure the Company achieves its goals, we have various 

performance appraisal methods in place to determine the performance 

of the Company as well as each individual employee.  

The employee performance appraisal comprises mainly quantifiable 

evaluation criteria. In addition, we actively collects performance 

information for each employee each month through inputs from direct 

supervisors and feedbacks, as well as periodical employee 

communication sessions.  

These collected information allow us to understand the performance 

and skills development needs of each team and individual employee 

from multiple aspects. This is crucial for the Company to develop 

annual training programs for employee that are designed to enhance 

the skills of the employee and aims to improve the overall productivity.  

In 2017, all of our employees are at least subject to an annual 

performance appraisal by their superiors. We seek to continue this 

practice in the coming year.

Equal opportunity 

Anyang Jiutian has always been an equal opportunity employer to 

provide a fair workplace for employees, following the principles of 

equality 

and 

non-discrimination. 

Recruitment, 

remuneration, 

promotion, and benefits are required to be handled based on objective 

assessment, equal opportunity and non-discrimination regardless of 

gender, race, marital status, pregnancy, disability, age or family status.  

We attract talent through fair, and flexible recruitment strategy that 

includes recruitment application, job description, job applications, 

interview, selection, approval, and job offer. Promotion is based on 

performance and suitability.  

We offers competitive remuneration to attract and retain talented staff 

members. Remuneration packages (which includes the necessary 

social benefits) are reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with 

employment market. Dismissal also complies with employment laws 

and regulations relating to non-discrimination. 

In 2017, female employees comprise 40% of our entire workforce, with 

female representation in management at 28%. 

Encouraging work-life balance  

We organised a variety of employee activities to help them relax their 

mind and body, develop teamwork, explore their talent, so as to 

develop a positive attitude in both work and life.  

To enhance employee teamwork and cohesion, improve employee 

health and improve employee work-life balance, Anyang Jiutian has 

been organising periodic employee gatherings during major festivals 

and sports competitions.
