MESSAGE FROM  

GROUP PRESIDENT &amp; CEO

Dear shareholders,

ST Engineering is committed to sustainability.

2021 has been an eventful year for our sustainability 

journey, as we stepped up to decarbonise and better 

organise ourselves for sustainability across the Group.

Our efforts include:

• Setting a target to halve our absolute greenhouse 

gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 compared to 2010, 

as we continue our journey alongside global efforts 

towards net zero;

• Integrating sustainability considerations into our 

latest five-year business plans; 

• Launching Group-wide Eco-Initiatives to further 

increase eco-consciousness in our workplaces 

and align our work habits and culture; 

• Being accepted as a signatory of the UN Global 

Compact (UNGC) and committing to its 10 

principles in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, 

Environment and Anti-Corruption;

• Launching a new innovation platform - In.Vent -  

as a pathway for the Group to build new ventures, 

with a strong emphasis on business and 

sustainability impact; and 

• Incorporating Task Force on Climate-related 

Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Sustainability 

Accounting Standards Board (SASB) reporting 

elements in our Sustainability Report.

OUR APPROACH

We aim to positively impact people’s lives and the 

health of our planet by being a responsible global 

citizen. We do this by harnessing technology and 

innovation to address real-world problems. We also 

incorporate ESG practices into our businesses globally.

DOING OUR PART

We continue to reduce our impact on the environment, 

bring value to our people and maintain a high standard 

of governance practices. These actions build trust and 

credibility with our wide range of stakeholders.

We increased the number of buildings with solar 

photovoltaic (PV) systems to 39 in our Singapore 

operations. In the spirit of the circular economy, we 

provided over 1,000 decommissioned laptops to be 

refurbished for school children from families in need, 

to help in their home-based education. We contributed 

$2.8m in our philanthropic efforts and community 

investments. This is to encourage volunteerism among 

our employees and positively impact our communities. 

We significantly enhanced our policies for export 

control and intermediaries and strengthened our 

governance processes and disclosures.  

ENABLING OUR CUSTOMERS

We are committed to enabling a sustainable world 

through our products and solutions. 

Our aerospace products and conversion solutions 

significantly extend the life of aircraft. Our first floating 

power plant enables a reduction in emissions. Our 

suite of Smart City solutions helps cities reduce 

energy consumption and traffic congestion.

A PURPOSE-DRIVEN GROUP

ST Engineering will continue to harness technology 

and innovation to enable a more secure and 

sustainable world. Our focus is on long-term resilience 

and sustainable value creation for all our stakeholders 

– customers, employees, communities, shareholders, 

regulators and suppliers.

Sincerely,

→ VINCENT CHONG

OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE FOR SUSTAINABILITY

The Group Chief Strategy &amp; Sustainability Officer works 

with the Group Executive Committee (EXCO) and senior 

business leadership to ensure that sustainability is at 

the core of the Group's business strategy, and that ESG 

considerations are integrated into both our immediate 

and long term business plans.

Reporting to the EXCO, our business area management 

teams and Group Functions play critical roles in shaping 

and supporting our strategy. In addition, they work 

across the Group in key areas such as Technology &amp; 

Innovation, Operational Excellence and Sustainability. 

They are enabled by an annual planning process which 

is underpinned by our governance and enterprise risk 

management systems. 

Sustainability is the responsibility of every ST Engineering 

employee. We enable this by mobilising teams across the 

Group at every level. This includes the Group Sustainability 

Team at Corporate, the Operational Excellence Specialist 

Teams, the business area Sustainability Focus Teams, the 

Eco-initiatives Team, to the various operations-level teams 

and individuals across our global sites. Every employee's 

effort is important to ST Engineering's sustainability journey.

Group Executive Committee 

Leads the implementation of 

sustainability as an integral 

part of the Group’s business 

strategy, including business 

plans, product and technology 

development and operational 

processes.

Board of Directors

Provides strategic direction and 

considers sustainability issues, 

including the management 

of material ESG factors in the 

formulation of the Group’s 

strategies and policies.

Risk &amp; Sustainability 

Committee

OUR SUSTAINABILITY  

APPROACH

OUR COMMITMENT

We are committed to conducting our business in a 

responsible manner. We adhere to labour laws and 

regulations where we operate and have zero tolerance 

for unethical labour practices such as child labour, 

forced labour, slavery and human trafficking in any  

of our operations.

We prohibit discrimination and harassment at our 

workplaces, and are committed to safe and healthy 

working conditions and the dignity of the individual. 

We support the right to freedom of association, and 

encourage effective communication and consultation.

Our commitments are guided by international human 

rights principles encompassed in the Universal 

Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour 

Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles 

and Rights at Work, the United Nations Global 

Compact and the United Nations Guiding Principles 

on Business and Human Rights. These principles 

of respecting people’s dignity and their inherent 

rights are reflected in our policies, operations and 

relationships with our stakeholders.

Suppliers

We expect our supply chain 

partners to adhere to business 

principles consistent with our 

own, outlined in our Vendor Code 

of Conduct. This includes the  

fair and ethical treatment 

of labour within their own 

companies, as well as that  

of their suppliers.

Customers

We offer products and services 

that generate a positive impact 

for our customers as well as  

the communities they serve.  

This includes improvements  

in quality of life, health, safety 

and security.

HOW WE PRACTICE OUR COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS

We do not design, produce or sell anti-personnel  

mines, cluster munitions, white phosphorus munitions  

and their related key components.

We have zero tolerance for fraud and corrupt practices,  

and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code) 

forms the backbone of our commitment to ethical 

business conduct and regulatory compliance. We  

continue to commit to meeting all relevant regulatory and 

customers’ contractual requirements, including those 

relating to cybersecurity, data governance and protection 

and business continuity.  We source responsibly and invest 

in the people and the communities where we operate.

In support of our Code and good corporate governance 

practices, we established enterprise risk management and 

compliance policies and processes applicable.

Beyond full compliance with legal and regulatory 

requirements, we align our management systems to 

international and industry standards. Our enterprise 

risk management policy provides directions for 

managing and reporting enterprise risks across the 

Group, with the objective of building a robust risk 

management process where enterprise risks are 

evaluated, monitored and treated in a holistic and 

integrated manner. Accordingly, our processes adopt 

a precautionary approach, with risk identification 

being carried out at the initial stage as well as 

continuously as the business or project progresses. 

Risk analysis comprises material internal and external 

analysis to ensure that all aspects are considered.

Employees

All our workers are required to 

adhere to honest and ethical 

conduct and act in accordance 

to our Code of Business Conduct 

and Ethics. This includes treating 

each other with respect, and 

abiding by our core values of 

Integrity, Value Creation, 

Courage, Commitment and 

Compassion.

In assessing materiality,  

ST Engineering considers factors 

that impact our businesses and 

our stakeholders, from both 

the financial and non-financial 

perspectives. Our key stakeholders 

include shareholders and investors, 

customers, regulators and 

governments. employees and other 

workers, suppliers and collaborators, 

and local communities.

In 2013, the Group's Risk 

Management Department 

conducted our first materiality 

assessment according to GRI G4 

guidelines. Material ESG factors 

were identified and responsibilities 

for management and reporting 

were assigned to each material 

factor owner. The material factors 

were mapped onto the key 

business risks of the Group to 

ensure completeness and a clear 

understanding of the risks each 

material factor posed. In 2015, the 

key business risks and material 

factors were reviewed and revisions 

were made where relevant.

In 2019, the Group’s material 

ESG factors were reorganised 

into ten areas for greater focus 

and clarity. They were mapped 

into Environmental, Social and 

Governance categories and aligned 

with the UN SDGs.

Due to the evolving business 

environment and the recent 

reorganisation in 2021, the  

Group will conduct a review of  

its material ESG factors in 2022.

External Assurance Statements

ST Engineering is committed to providing a balanced 

and accurate sustainability report. The information 

disclosed is compiled from the submissions of our 

business entities worldwide.

Our Group Risk &amp; Assurance team verified this report 

from two perspectives:

1. At the process level, to ensure that it is robust and 

comprehensive

2. At the data level, to ensure that it is accurate and 

supported by proper documentation

The GHG emissions data reported by our Singapore 

entities are verified under ISO 14064-1:2006 – 

Greenhouse Gases by Lloyd’s Register Quality 

Assurance Ltd (LRQA). For 2021, all Singapore  

entities are consolidated under a single statement.

We are extending external verification for GHG 

emissions to all our material entities worldwide 

progressively over the next 2 years. We will also be 

transitioning in 2022 to the ISO 14064-1:2018 - 

Greenhouse Gases standard.

Our intention is for the external verification and

The effects of climate change have become 

increasingly pronounced. ST Engineering is aligned 

with our stakeholders' efforts to act responsibly and 

combat climate change. This includes implementing 

TCFD recommendations. In 2021, we joined the 

Singapore Low Carbon Network (SLCN) as an 

inaugural member. The SLCN aims to advance the 

sharing of best practices and insights on key carbon 

measurement and decarbonisation topics.

Governance

The Board provides oversight on all sustainability 

matters, including climate-related risks and 

opportunities. Briefing sessions on climate-related 

topics are conducted periodically for the Board, 

while detailed discussions on actions to be taken, 

are carried out by the Board’s Risk and Sustainability 

Committee.

The EXCO is accountable to the Board for the 

implementation of these climate-related strategies 

and directions. Business leaders at all levels are 

responsible for addressing the risks and opportunities 

in their respective business areas. Plans and actions  

needed are discussed at various management  

fora and incorporated into the strategic planning  

and annual budgeting processes. 

The Group Chief Strategy &amp; Sustainability Officer assists 

the EXCO in ensuring that the impact of climate change 

is taken into consideration in all business strategies 

and plans. Various committees, working groups and 

focus teams across the Group and its business areas 

support the execution of these plans. In particular, the 

Operational Excellence Steering Committee (OESC), 

comprising the global operations leaders across all our 

business areas, is a key platform for integrating and 

executing these efforts.

Strategy

We identify sustainability-related risks and 

opportunities as part of our annual five-year strategic 

plan review. This is discussed and endorsed by the 

Board’s Strategy and Finance Committee, and forms the 

foundation for initiatives relating to climate change in 

subsequent years.

Risk Management

A preliminary Physical Climate Risk Assessment was 

carried out for our major operating sites across the 

world in 2021. An in-depth climate risk assessment for 

key vulnerable locations will follow in 2022. We will also 

be examining our transition risks as we move into low 

carbon products and operational processes, including 

more detailed studies on the supply chains of our 

business areas.

Metrics &amp; Targets

We have identified relevant climate-related metrics and 

targets, and these are elaborated under the respective

UN SDGs

ENVIRONMENT

Environmental Protection

Climate change is an issue of urgency and importance. A low carbon business strategy is 

not only good for the environment, but also enables us to better respond to climate change 

related regulations and price volatilities of hydrocarbon resources.

Environmental efforts are coordinated by the Environment Committee. All our material 

business units in Singapore are certified ISO 14001 Environmental Management  

Systems. Our global operations abide by relevant environmental regulations  

and requirements.

Productivity

Staying lean, efficient and effective in our systems and process, optimises the use of our 

resources and is fundamental to maintaining our competitive edge.

Productivity efforts are coordinated by the Continuous Improvement Committee. 

Initiatives such as Kaizen, quality action teams and value innovation teams are 

embedded into day-to-day operations. We empower employees to identify and 

eliminate waste and also recognise exemplary contributions.

Green Products &amp; Services

Cities and organisations around the world are looking to minimise their carbon footprint 

while reducing operating costs.

Our technology community actively looks into the design and development of products  

that are more sustainable. Our engineers incorporate green considerations not just  

into end products, but also into responsible production and through-life support. 

Through these efforts, we are able to empower and enable our customers to become 

more sustainable.

People Excellence

We are only as strong as our people. With a capable, motivated and agile workforce, we are

GHG EMISSIONS, RENEWABLES AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY

In 2021, the Group achieved a 30% absolute reduction of GHG 

emissions with 2010 as the base year. This translated to a 

46% reduction in intensity. While there was a slight increase in 

emissions as operations recovered from 2020 the Group is still on 

track to achieve the target of a 50% absolute reduction by 2030.

Our Singapore operations consolidated their efforts into a single 

GHG emissions assurance statement. Our GHG emissions were 

verified in accordance with ISO 14064-1:2006 Greenhouse Gases. 

In 2022, we plan for the external assurance process to be aligned 

with ISO 14064-1:2018.

We continued our roll out of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems 

across our global operations to increase the proportion of 

renewables in our energy mix. We added about 44,000m2 of 

solar panels in Singapore, bringing the total to 110,000m2. This 

increased the number of buildings with solar panels deployed  

to 39, compared with 24 in 2020.

In our Singapore operations, the solar PV systems generated 8% 

of the total electricity used. This was the same proportion as in 

2020, as our businesses ramped up from a lower production rate. 

Our business units in Singapore initiated the use of electric 

vehicles with a pilot of eight vehicles and two charging stations. 

We intend to replace the current fleet of internal combustion 

engine vehicles in phases over the next few years.

Our businesses continue to replace production equipment

and cooling systems to reduce GHG emissions.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

ST Engineering’s Board, EXCO and senior management 

are committed to a pathway towards net zero. In 

addition, stewardship of resources, including energy, 

water, and non-renewables are essential to the 

competitiveness of the Group.

Commitment

In 2021, we set a new target to achieve a 50% absolute 

Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction by 2030 

compared to a 2010 base year. We will also continue to 

track overall emissions intensity for the Group. Over the 

next three years, we will also be expanding the tracking 

and disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions. The goal is to 

have a comprehensive global GHG emissions inventory 

by 2024, and to subsequently have the data externally 

verified under ISO 14064-1:2006 - Greenhouse Gases.

With our commitment to the TCFD journey, the Group 

has begun to report on both risks and opportunities 

from climate change, and will expand this reporting  

over the next 2 years. 

Our integrated Environment, Health and Safety 

(EHS) policy and Environmental Pledge sets out our 

environmental expectations and standards.

ENVIRONMENTAL

→ Environmental Protection

Governance and Organisation

The Group integrated multiple operations optimisation 

efforts into the Operational Excellence Steering 

Committee (OESC) in 2020. This comprises the 

operations leaders of each business area. In 2021, the 

OESC's Environment Committee was formed comprising 

representatives from each business area to focus on data 

gathering, reporting and initiatives for:

• GHG emissions

• Energy (fuel, electricity, heating, cooling)

• Water (including recycling)

• Waste (including recycling)

The Environment Committee also advises the respective 

business area management teams and project manages 

key environmental initiatives across the Group.

More details on our 

TCFD efforts are available on page 13





Emissions

In 2014, the Group set a target for its Singapore 

operations to reduce GHG intensity by 16% by 2025, 

compared to a 2010 base year. This target was raised 

in 2018 to 36% by 2030, in alignment with Singapore’s 

Nationally Determined Contribution pledge. This was 

met in 2019 and in 2021 we committed to achieve a 

50% absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction 

by 2030 compared to a 2010 base year. Our material 

Singapore business units' GHG emissions are validated  

in accordance with ISO 14064-1:2006 - Greenhouse 

Gases by a reputable third party auditor. We continue to 

reduce our emissions through the following:

• Optimising the energy efficiency of workplace 

processes and replace existing equipment with more 

energy efficient models when due for replacement

• Preventing the contamination of surrounding air using 

air pollution control equipment such as scrubbers 

and spray booth exhausts

• Monitoring and minimising stack emissions and the 

level of air pollutants

• Reducing Scope 1 emissions by optimising our 

operational activities such as delivery runs, engine test 

cell usage and vehicle testing

• Reducing Scope 2 emissions by installing solar PV 

systems across our global sites

• Reducing Scope 3 emissions by reducing air travel and 

conducting virtual meetings where possible

year emission was recalculated, where applicable, or 

estimated using proxies.  As of end-2021, our 2010 base 

year GHG emissions is estimated to be 170,000tCO2e.

Energy Efficiency

We do our part in mitigating and adapting to the effects 

of climate change by implementing initiatives that enable 

energy efficiency and efficient resource management. 

Our efforts include:

• Acquire equipment that are certified to be energy 

efficient

• Install additional solar PV systems on our premises

• Use energy efficient lighting and replacing legacy 

lighting systems

• Conduct energy audits and improve production 

energy efficiency

Water Management &amp; Conservation

Our businesses use water from municipal sources in their 

facilities mainly for cooling, cleaning, general sanitation 

and operational activities, such as aircraft and vehicle 

washing. In 2016, we set a water usage intensity reduction 

target of 15% on a business-as-usual basis by 2025 

with 2015 as base year for our Singapore operations. We 

continue to:

• Install smart water meters at more locations to 

enhance tracking

• Install water saving devices such as water thimbles 

and flow reducing valves

• Promote water conservation awareness through 

toolbox briefings and campaigns

• Perform regular checks to detect leakages in pipes 

and faucets

• Optimise our operations to reduce usage of water

Waste &amp; Effluent Management

We regularly promote 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) 

initiatives to help with the following:

• Reduce the use of materials and consumables

• Reduce the use of paper

• Reuse existing resources such as wooden pallets

• Recycle waste oil, manufacturing materials, paper  

and e-waste

To manage our toxic waste and effluent, we do the 

following:

• Optimise processes to reduce the generation of toxic 

waste and effluent

• Consolidate toxic waste at designated points for 

collection by licensed toxic waste collectors

• Ensure that necessary licensing is obtained and 

effluent discharge criteria are all met before 

discharging into the waterways and sewage systems

• Comply fully with national/local regulatory 

requirements (e.g. Singapore National Environment 

Agency - NEA) regarding the safe handling of 

radioactive materials used in non-destructive testing

Noise

Certain segments of our operations generate noise and 

we strive to be a good neighbour in the communities 

where we operate. Our measures include:

• Monitor and review noise emission levels from our 

operations

• Keep all noise within legal limits and within permitted 

hours

• Replace noisy equipment with quieter models and 

provide sound insulation where applicable

• Conduct boundary noise checks in accordance with 

regulatory guidelines

GROUP-WIDE ECO-INITIATIVES

ENVIRONMENTAL

→ Environmental Protection

1) 

Conserve

We focus on using only what resources we need and are 

constantly looking for ways to reduce our environmental 

footprint.

Many business units across the Group have installed 

energy efficient fittings such as smart lighting and motion 

sensor water taps to conserve electricity and water. 

Units also renewed their conservation publicity drives to 

remind all staff to switch off lights when not in use. 

Other efforts implemented include: 

• Installation of smart meters to detect water leakage 

and provide data on the consumption profile, which is 

analysed to help develop more targeted initiatives

• Use of data analytics to optimise the energy 

consumption of building cooling systems

• Digitalisation (e.g. QR codes in offices, sites and  

at events to reduce the use of paper)

2) Bring-Your-Own

Across the world, our units are phasing out the use of 

single-use plastics, including styrofoam packaging and 

bottled water at our canteens and meeting rooms. We 

provide environmentally friendly alternatives to plastic 

disposable cups in meeting rooms, while others bring 

their own mugs. Our colleagues bring their own F&amp;B 

containers for takeaway, and many of the units have 

pantries where dishware and utensils are available.



ST Engineering expects 

our employees across our 

global business units to be 

responsible for sustainability.  

In 2021, we launched the 

Group-wide Eco-Initiatives to 

enhance eco-consciousness 

and reinforce the existing eco-

practices across our global 

operations. This focused on 

three areas of stewardship, 

attitudes and actions.

3) Recycle

We are streamlining the way we track the waste we 

generate. Where possible, we reuse and recycle. This is 

part of our commitment to a circular economy approach 

to our business operations – doing our part for our planet 

and communities, while improving our cost efficiencies.

We carried out two e-waste initiatives:

• Collection and consolidation of used company and 

employees’ electronics in Singapore and Thailand

– We donated more than 1,000 decommissioned 

laptops to Engineering Good, an NGO in Singapore 

and to Mirror Foundation, an NGO in Thailand; 

– Laptops are refurbished and will be distributed to 

school children from low-income families and to 

other charitable causes.

• Facilitation of recycling used electronics 

– Provision of segregated e-waste receptacles across 

our sites in Singapore;

– E-waste brought by employees was sent for 

recycling together with our appointed waste 

collection vendor;

– More than 1.5 metric tons of e-waste recycled.

Continuous Improvement (CI) is at the heart of 

our engineering heritage. Over the years, our CI 

initiatives have enabled us to work smarter and 

more efficiently. 

Our budgeting tool allows for seamless 

collaboration across business functions while 

improving data accuracy and visibility. We 

introduced self-service online portals for our 

employees to request for mid- to back-office 

support. These service portals are capable of 

performance measurement and analytics that 

generate insights on areas for improvement. 

In addition, we recognise the importance of 

upskilling our staff through CI training. While  

5S, Kaizen and Root Cause Analysis are key tools 

used to improve work processes, we continue to 

grow our library of e-learning modules to ensure 

our staff are well trained on topics including 

problem-solving tools such as Value Stream 

Mapping (VSM) and Lean Management.

The Group achieved realised productivity savings 

of $23.5m from continuous improvement projects. 

This does not include realised savings from the 

Group’s Central Procurement initiatives, which 

saved another $85.2m. We achieved a value  

added per employment cost of 1.53 for our  

global operations.

In 2021, four additional continuous improvement 

e-learning courses were deployed. Consolidating 

all e-learning courses into a single platform has 

improved their accessibility and usability. 

Fifteen teams participated in the first ST Engineering  

Best-of-Best CI Award and showcased their 

accomplishments in value creation and productivity 

enhancements through the creative use of 

technology, innovation and CI tools. Cash prizes 

and sponsorships for a CI benchmark tour to share 

best practices with other business units were given 

to the winning team to recognise and leverage their 

achievements.

Harnessing technology and innovation to improve our processes and 

promoting skills upgrading are key drivers of the Group's productivity drive. 

By optimising resource efficiency, we minimise our environmental footprint.

stakeholders to investigate, as well as 

identify areas for improvement and 

correction in a timely manner.









iMaP Automation 

The iMaP (Intelligent Mapping and Profiling) machine 

deployed at our Aerospace Engines workshop 

helps reduce engine vibrations in flight. It does 

this by automating engine blade weighing, profile 

measurement, part number capture, and blade sorting 

and distribution. Data collected is used for further 

analysis including compressor and turbine efficiency 

and vibration analysis. iMaP automation has enabled 

estimated savings of more than 2,000 manhours 

annually for CFM56-5B &amp; 7B engine MRO.







Additive Manufacturing

We leveraged Additive Manufacturing (AM) to produce 

design-optimised parts for our customers within a more 

sustainable manufacturing ecosystem. AM effectively enables 

low-quantity, high-mix production, allowing us to produce 

near-to-shape products on demand and at locations close to 

our customers. This helps to greatly reduce waste, transport 

time and costs, enabling a leaner and more efficient supply 

chain. ST Engineering’s AM Community of Practice continues 

to promote adoption of AM across the Group.

The Group continued to innovate and deploy a diverse 

range of sustainable products and solutions to our 

customers. Examples in key industry domains include:

Land Transport

• Demand for electric vehicles (EV) and charging 

solutions have been growing globally as technology 

advances, lower battery prices as well as national 

incentives and targets drive EV adoption. Our end-

to-end AGILTM Electric Vehicle Charging solution 

comprises a modular EV management platform 

that supports a charging infrastructure catering to 

different charger makes and models

• We delivered 20 single-deck, fully electric buses 

to the Land Transport Authority of Singapore. 

These are the first in Singapore to be capable of 

quick charging using overhead pantographs at bus 

interchanges. The customised rapid charging lithium 

ion batteries have a capacity of  between 150-200 

kWh and charges up to 3 times faster compared to 

generic batteries. Every minute of charging using 

the high power inverted pantograph at the bus 

interchange will extend the travel range by additional 

5 km, making it an efficient and viable solution for 

intra-city transport

• We have developed the capability to retrofit diesel 

buses with electric drive trains to provide a solution 

aligned with the reuse principles of the Circular 

ENVIRONMENTAL

→ Green Products &amp; Solutions

Economy. A MAN A22 diesel bus retrofitted with 

an electric conversion kit was put into service in

Environmental Engineering

• We are working with consortium partners to design, 

construct, commission and deliver two process 

systems in the Integrated Waste Management Facility 

(IWMF). The IWMF is part of Tuas Nexus, which is 

the world’s first integrated waste and water treatment 

facility conceptualised and planned from the ground 

up. It is expected to contribute to carbon savings of 

more than 200,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, equivalent 

to removing 42,500 cars off the road

Aerospace

• Our Commercial Aerospace leverages Additive 

Manufacturing (AM) to produce design-optimised 

replacement parts for our customers. AM is a greener 

approach to manufacturing which does away with 

traditional moulds and tooling as it produces near-

to-shape products on demand. This eliminates 

intermediate wastage while allowing the manufacture  

of components with complex geometries. It enables  

low quantity, high mix production that empowers a lean 

and efficient supply chain for our global business units. 

We are continuing to scale up AM deployment as part  

of our commitment to a more sustainable 

manufacturing ecosystem

ST Engineering is designing and constructing 

two key process systems in the Integrated Waste 

Management Facility located in Tuas Nexus – a 

Material Recovery Facility and a Waste-to-Energy 

plant. These two facilities help close the loop on 

the waste management cycle in Singapore by 

increasing recycling efficiency, and generating 

energy from non-recyclable waste. This helps 

Singapore to achieve its zero waste goal while 

reducing our reliance on traditional energy sources.

 



Due to the synergies with the adjacent water treatment 

facility, the electricity generated by the IWMF can be 

used to sustain the operations of Tuas Nexus and 

export excess electricity to the grid. This contribution 

to the grid is estimated to be able to continually power 

up to 300,000 four-room HDB flats in Singapore. 

Additionally, the integration of both waste and water 

treatment facilities will result in footprint savings of

• We continue to provide market-leading passenger-

to-freighter (P2F) conversions -- converting and 

refurbishing older passenger aircraft into well-

optimised and reliable freighters. This is aligned to 

our commitment to the circular economy -- reducing 

the demand for mineral extraction and energy, while 

extending the life of the aircraft by up to 20 years 

and increasing the utility of the initial manufacturing 

effort. Our Airbus A321 P2F solution has more than 

28 metric tons of proven gross payload, which is 

the highest in the market currently. Furthermore, 

our medium widebody freighter solution, the 

Airbus A330P2F, offers more volume and payload. 

Our center of gravity optimised conversion design 

results in a well-balanced freighter that requires less 

trimming which results in fuel savings

• Our aerospace engine MRO operations have 

created the Intelligent Mapping and Profiling 

(iMaP) machine. This inhouse solution helps 

improve productivity through the automation of key 

processes including engine blade weighing, profile 

measurement, part number capture and blade 

sorting and distribution. The data for each blade is 

captured and analysed. The resulting compressor 

and turbine efficiency analysis as well as vibration 

analysis allows us to reduce vibrations in flight. In 

addition, iMaP have given us annual productivity 

savings of more than 2,000 manhours on CFM56 

engine MRO operations

• Our eco-engine wash services – EcoPower® – has 

significant environmental benefits. The team washes 

more than 9,000 aircraft engines annually using 

innovative and environmentally-friendly processes. 

These result in fuel savings which translate to an 

estimated emissions avoidance of 500,000 tons 

CO2e annually as well as the recovery and reuse of 

around 2 million liters of water

• Our aerospace MRO operations have adopted 

robotic laser paint stripping, which is a more precise 

and eco-friendly process to remove rust, paint, oxide 

and other contaminants from aircraft metal surfaces. 

The directed low-energy laser pulse beam breaks 

down paint and primer coatings resulting in a minimal 

waste stream. The waste is vapourised, extracted and 

captured via a fume extraction system minimising 

the release of paint, contaminants, dust particles and 

other toxic chemicals into the environment

ENVIRONMENTAL

→ Green Products &amp; Solutions

Digital Solutions

• Aircraft and marine pilot training is greatly augmented 

by our high-fidelity training simulators which are at 

Federal Aviation Administration Full Flight Simulator 

(FAA FFS) Level D and Det Norske Veritas group  

Level D. These simulators are alternatives to help 

pilots qualify for training hours instead of actual flight 

or sailing. Apart from reducing fuel consumption and 

environmental impact, the use of simulators also 

reduce operational costs

• We have deployed a zero carbon emission fully 

electric-powered autonomous flotsam clearance 

vessel prototype. Its enhanced features improve 

the detection and classification of flotsam in water 

bodies, improve object collection near obstacles 

while having greater endurance and speed. This 

is achieved through efficient power generation, 

intelligent control and reduced-drag design

Summary

ST Engineering continues to identify, develop and 

deploy core technologies to enable its sustainable 

business goals. These technologies include  

artificial intelligence machine learning, data  

analytics, blockchain, hybrid battery systems and 

autonomous systems.

We will also study emerging technologies in the area 

of sustainable materials, energy management systems 

and alternative low-carbon fuels to support our 

customers' end-to-end decarbonisation needs. We 

will invest appropriate resources early to capture green 

growth opportunities and support the energy transition.

Key initiative areas supporting our business areas 

include:

• Powertrain Electrification

• Fleet Management

• MRO Digitalisation

• Green Power Generation

• Environmental Engineering

Besides internal R&amp;D investment, we actively foster 

partnerships and collaborations, engaging technology 

start-ups and building new corporate ventures to bring 

new technologies to market quickly and scale up to 

meet global demand for green solutions.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Commitment

ST Engineering’s Board, EXCO and senior 

management are committed to enabling our 

customers on their sustainability journeys via green 

products and services. We will continue to quantify  

our GHG emissions impact on our customers, as  

we work with our supply chain to understand the  

product carbon footprint of each of our offerings.

Governance and Organisation

At Board-level, the Research, Development &amp; 

Technology Committee oversees policies for our 

technology development and innovation efforts. 

The Group’s Chief Operating Officer (Technology &amp; 

Innovation) and Chief Technology &amp; Digital Officer 

lead the efforts in R&amp;D, product development and 

innovation across our businesses globally. The 

Innovation Technology Committee (ITC) provides 

leadership and direction, and coordinates the 

prioritisation of R&amp;D and innovation investments, 

including in sustainability-related technology 

initiatives. 

The key function coordinating the efforts above is 

the Group Technology Office (GTO). Its roles include 

technology scanning and trend identification, R&amp;D 

data gathering and analysis and formulating group-

wide initiatives leading to new products, technologies 

and solutions across our global markets. GTO works in 

close partnership with the Group Engineering Centre 

(GEC), business area leaders, the Group Strategy &amp; 

Sustainability Office and ST Engineering Ventures. 

Externally, the GTO is plugged into the R&amp;D ecosystem, 

particularly in the geographies we operate in.

Environmental Outcomes

The Group defines sustainability-related revenue into 

three broad impact categories:

• Reduce GHG Emissions

• Solve Urban and City Issues

• Circular Economy

ENVIRONMENTAL

→ Green Products &amp; Solutions

Much of this is focused on environmental benefits, 

but there is significant social and governance benefit 

including safety, security, emergency response, crisis 

management, worker productivity, health and access to 

education.

Alongside product functionality and cost-effectiveness, 

the Group considers sustainability to be a key factor 

in product and process development. We go beyond 

functional innovation, taking into account ecological 

considerations such as water and energy consumption, 

waste streams, circular economy principles and avoid 

the use of single-use plastic. These considerations are 

covered in the specification and concept stage of our 

products and solutions development process.

In 2021, the GTO has ramped up its efforts to engage 

start-ups and ventures in environment technology 

areas, including in new materials, energy solutions and 

carbon removal. These are in current ST Engineering 

domain areas, as well as adjacent to them. We are open 

to partnerships with companies across the world which 

could lead to the above three sustainability impact 

outcomes.

It is both a personal and professional  

goal of mine to keep learning.  

ST Engineering offers LinkedIn  

Learning to employees and those 

recommended courses helped me 

gain much-needed technical skills 

and grow into a more thoughtful,  

well-rounded leader. It can be  

easy to only focus on daily  

tasks, meetings and deadlines,  

but investing in my personal 

and professional development  

has helped myself and  

my contributions to the  

team immensely.







My experience in the Group’s 

Marine Environmental 

Engineering team was fulfilling, 

knowing that our work 

contributes to Singapore’s clean 

water and energy. I believe 

sustainability transcends 

environmental protection, hence 

I am truly excited to embark 

on my next stint in our Group 

Strategy and Sustainability 

Office to contribute to realising 

ST Engineering’s sustainability 

agenda and strategies.

ST Engineering also collaborated with local 

educational institutions and approved Continuing 

Education and Training centres to train our engineers 

and technicians in new economy skill areas such 

as robotics, automation and design thinking. We 

launched the In.Vent venture building initiative to 

catalyze an innovative culture for business creation. 

We also offer personalised, bite-sized and on-demand 

learning opportunities to employees group-wide. More 

than 6,000 employees have been actively utilising 

these digital learning opportunities to build up their 

understanding in topics including data science, digital 

marketing and agile project management.

As part of career development and succession 

planning, we encourage structured rotations within 

and across our businesses globally. We partner with 

Singapore Economic Development Board to offer 

employees international postings under our Global 

Leaders Development Programme.  

To build a talent pipeline, our outreach programme 

includes a partnership with Enterprise Singapore 

and a SG United Traineeships Programme to offer 

internships in our Group.

In 2021, we continued to enhance our policies and 

realign work processes to support our employees. 

Several initiatives were rolled out focusing on three 

main pillars of wellbeing – physical, emotional  

and social.

The ST Engineering MOVEment demonstrates that 

employee wellbeing is our top priority. The MOVEment 

rallied employees to make health a focus through 

regular exercise while raising funds for charity. This 

four-week campaign garnered the participation of over 

3,300 employees, who completed more than 360,000km 

collectively by running, walking and cycling. Sharing 

experiences outside of work helped to increase team 

bonding and sparked spontaneous interactions across 

the Group, drawing employees closer as they motivated 

one another to “move more together”.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

We are only as strong as our people. With a capable, 

motivated and upwardly mobile workforce, we have a 

pipeline of talent to pursue sustainable growth.

Governance and Organisation

The Group Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) 

and the Human Resources (HR) leadership team 

oversee the policies and facilitate the engagement 

on all people issues across the Group. The CHRO 

reports directly to the Group President &amp; CEO.  He 

works closely with the EXCO and senior management 

to advise them on global best practices and the 

implementation of the Group’s people policies.

Our people and culture strategy seeks to:

• Enhance our capability and capacity for growth

• Build a passionate and engaged workforce

• Position us at the forefront of people practices

We implement our people and culture strategy in the 

following areas:

• Diversity and Inclusion

• Employee Engagement

• Health and Wellness

• Recruitment

• People Development &amp; Learning

• Performance Management and Rewards

• Labour Relations

1. Diversity and Inclusion

We recognise that we work in an industry where there 

are more male employees in our technical workforce. 

We are committed to fair employment practices and 

offer merit-based equal opportunities to all, including 

promoting training and skills development. We do not 

condone personal bias or prejudice and advocate for 

fair recognition. We do not discriminate according to 

age, race, nationality, religion, gender or marital status. 

We are committed to providing a work environment 

free from discrimination or harassment of any type.

ST Engineering embraces fair employment practices 

and complies with all national and local labour laws  

and regulations where we operate. We uphold 

Principle 6 of the United Nations Global Compact  

on eliminating discrimination.  

• We recruit and select employees based on merit, 

such as skills, experience or ability to perform the 

job -- regardless of age, race, gender, religion,  

marital status, family responsibilities or disability

• We treat our employees fairly and with respect  

and dignity

• We provide our employees with equal opportunities 

for training and development based on their 

strengths and needs to help them achieve their 

potential

• We reward employees based on their ability, 

performance, contribution and experience

ST Engineering employees are guided by our Code 

of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code). A vital tenet 

of the Code is to promote non-discrimination and 

anti-harassment at the workplace. Our employees 

develop an understanding of the different types of 

discrimination and how it can affect the workforce 

through our training session on the Code.

Our suppliers are similarly guided by our Vendor 

Code of Conduct that requires them to respect 

fundamental international principles regarding non-

discrimination, anti-harassment and practice fair 

employment practices.

Our HR Policy provides a process to manage 

grievances due to harassment, discrimination and 

other prohibited conduct. Employee grievances are 

promptly looked into and addressed. No individual 

will suffer reprisals or retaliation for reporting genuine 

grievances, making complaints, or participating in an 

investigation. Management at all levels, supported  

by their respective HR teams, is responsible for 

ensuring that we provide a work environment free  

from discrimination or harassment.

2. Employee Engagement

Employee engagement is a priority for the Group in 

order to obtain useful feedback and clarify and allay 

staff concerns.  It also helps us build confidence in 

our leadership actions and the direction of the Group 

as we address market challenges and opportunities.

During these unprecedented times, we acknowledge the 

additional pressure and stress on our employees and the 

need to place greater emphasis on people engagement.  

This helps build and strengthen the resilience and the 

wellbeing of our workforce. Internal and external people 

engagement activities were rolled out throughout the year 

and focused on key areas such as physical, emotional 

and social wellbeing of our people.

On top of periodic employee engagement surveys 

conducted to hear from our employees, we continuously 

engage our people to ensure that our workforce aligns 

with our purpose and core values as a Group. This is 

facilitated through regular town halls and staff focus 

group sessions with our Group P&amp;CEO and respective 

business leaders across different employee and 

business groups. The staff communication channels 

provide a platform for updates and dialogue on strategy, 

market developments and business, as well as people 

and policy matters.

3. Health and Wellbeing

We recognise that employees increasingly seek to 

integrate work and personal life commitments. We 

identified three focus areas that directly impact  

and strengthen the wellbeing of our employees.

 

Strong Bodies - Having good health and energy  

for enhanced productivity and efficiency. The  

ST Engineering MOVEment is both a charity drive  

and a healthy lifestyle campaign encouraging  

our employees throughout the Group to stay fit and 

healthy. Across our business areas, there were also other 

healthy lifestyle events organised such as participation 

in the Corporate National Steps Challenge.

Strong Minds - Positive emotions and strengthened 

resilience to overcome life challenges. The Group 

organised several activities relating to mental wellness 

and resilience. They include the Brown Bag talk on 

“5 Aspects of Resilience”, a virtual talk on mental 

wellness and Skillsfuture Advice by our inhouse union, 

ST Engineering Staff Union (STESU), and a series of 

mental wellness lunchtime talks and the latest virtual 

event by the Women@ST Engineering on“Managing 

Pandemic Fatigue”.

Strong Ties - Strong team spirit promotes cohesion  

and collaboration. The team category of the  

ST Engineering MOVEment was an effective way 

to encourage team building and bonding. The 323 

employee teams cycled/walked/ran a total of over 

236,000 km. Team activities were also organised 

throughout the year across our global business units.

The Group has a Flexible Work Arrangement policy 

that provides flexibility in work hours and work 

arrangements. Notwithstanding the pandemic, the 

Group constantly reviews these policies -- ensuring 

they evolve with business needs, market trends and 

compliance with in compliance with national or local 

mandated requirements.

We adopt a holistic approach to workplace wellness 

encompassing our employees’ physical, social, and 

emotional well-being. Our workplace wellness plans 

are supported by

• Regular reviews of the wellness initiatives and 

activities

• Setting aside a budget for activities that encourage 

employee wellbeing and team bonding

• Medical and health screenings for employees

 

4. Recruitment

Our talent attraction and management efforts focus 

on engaging, assessing and hiring qualified candidates 

based on the specific skills, knowledge, and experience 

they can bring to the job. We ensure our recruitment 

efforts generate a diverse candidate pipeline. Other than 

online job postings, outreach and referrals, we widened 

our search via social media posts or through the various 

networking groups. Our detailed job descriptions and 

specifications define goals, accountability, and success 

measures of the role. New employees are provided a 

head start with an overview of the Group's goals and 

philosophies through our comprehensive onboarding 

programme. We continually strive to engage, access and 

hire diverse talent with the right skills and characteristics 

that drive business success.

5.  People Development &amp; Learning 

We strive to increase performance, upskill and 

build a motivated workforce that drive towards the 

organisation’s success. We do so by putting in place 

structured Learning Programs and an integrated system 

of people development practices to achieve the full 

potential of our workforce.

 

Succession Planning

We manage our leadership succession by identifying 

key roles critical to the business as well as talent who 

can potentially fill these roles. Developmental actions 

are put in place to ensure that potential talent build 

their business and leadership capabilities to take on 

these key roles.

Leadership Development

Leaders are paramount in driving organisational 

growth and success. Our leadership competency 

framework is anchored on the following Leadership 

Dimensions – Think Global, Drive Performance, 

Drive Innovation and Engage &amp; Inspire. The attributes 

embedded in the Leadership Dimensions reflect 

the competencies needed to drive and accelerate 

ST Engineering’s strategic business priorities. Our 

manager development roadmap and learning 

programmes are curated to shape and build leaders 

who will enable our people and organisation to 

achieve our aspiration to be a global technology, 

defence and engineering powerhouse.

People Development

We are committed to investing in the development of 

our people. Our focus is on growing the capabilities 

of a future ready workforce that is equipped with new 

economy skills and empowered for success. We do 

this in partnership with local education institutions 

and approved Continuing Education and Training 

centres to upskill our engineers and technicians in 

technical (e.g. data analytics, robotics &amp; automation, 

design thinking) and soft skills (e.g. leadership, 

negotiation, management). We also adopt the 

70:20:10 learning and development model that blends 

experiential, collaborative and formal elements of 

learning.

Growing and maintaining a critical mass of qualified 

and experienced personnel is essential to achieving 

the Group’s strategic objectives. Our training 

development plans and performance management 

systems work in tandem to support the career 

progression of our employees. Our efforts include:

• Carry out Learning Needs Analysis and develop an 

annual training plan (including on-the-job training)

• Offer a Global Leaders Development Programme 

to develop globally-oriented management via 

postings to our business units across geographies

• Provide flexible career tracks where employees can 

move between management or technical tracks to 

gain exposure

• Create a pool of potential successors for key 

positions through our talent management 

programmes

a. Group Company Training Committee We built 

on our experience with the long-standing and 

successful Company Training Committee at our 

Aerospace business areas, to set up a Group 

Company Training Committee in partnership with 

STESU, our union in Singapore to better prepare 

employees of the Group's companies to meet 

the current and future needs of their respective 

industries through skills upgrading and retraining 

programmes. In doing so we hope to maintain 

and grow the capability and professionalism of all 

employees so that the businesses continue to be 

competitive as they transform and digitalise.

b. Group Engineering Competency Framework As 

part of the 2021 reorganisation, ST Engineering 

established the GEC. Alongside this, a group-wide 

engineering competency framework was also 

developed to benchmark our engineers’ technical 

capability, assess their competency and identify 

areas for further development. The framework also 

highlights which human capital competencies 

are required, as well as how we will systematically 

develop those capabilities to facilitate vertical 

and lateral career growth opportunities for our 

employees in engineering and technical roles.

Retirement and Lifelong Learning 

The Group complies with applicable local  

laws, regulations and guidelines for retirement and  

re-employment. For example, in Singapore, an 

employee who retires on attaining the statutory 

retirement age, may be re-employed on an offer and 

acceptance basis for special skills and/or project 

work. In keeping with our lifelong learning culture, 

relevant training will be provided to upgrade the 

skills of employees who are re-employed in different 

positions after their retirement age.

6. Performance Management and Rewards

Performance Management

A key driver of success is reinforcing a strong 

performance culture underpinned by our core 

values. In the short and medium-term, sustained 

contributions are rewarded through a pay-for-

performance principle where goals are linked to 

Group, business area and individual levels.

We adopt a performance based approach with 

direct linkages between performance and rewards. 

Annual performance appraisal sessions serve as a 

platform for employees to discuss their work progress

and career aspirations with their supervisors. Our 

performance-based pay practices consider the 

Group's KPI, individual performance, internal equity 

and industry practices. 

We conduct an annual performance management 

process involving goal-setting, continuous 

performance reviews and full-year assessments 

against targets.  We recognise outstanding employees 

with enhanced career opportunities and rewards.

During their annual performance review, all employees 

with direct reports are evaluated on their people 

management skills and outcomes. These include 

line managers in each business, those leading 

horizontal functions, as well as those with supervisory 

responsibilities in ad hoc teams.

Rewards 

The Group’s compensation and benefits framework 

is reported to the Board’s Executive Resource and 

Compensation Committee. The Executive Resource and 

Compensation Committee has access to consultants to 

advise on market trends and compensation and benefits 

matters. We also work closely with our employee unions 

on compensation and benefits issues.

Since 2019, ST Engineering has established a 

stronger link between employee remuneration and 

our ESG performance. ESG performance indicators 

have been incorporated into the Group’s KPI, which 

all employees, including ST Engineering’s senior 

management are assessed upon.  

The Group’s approach towards compensation 

includes near-term, mid-term and longer-term 

financial and non-financial performance targets 

to motivate and reward employees  for creating 

sustainable stakeholder value. Among others, 

our variable bonus pool to reward employees is 

determined by the achievement of our ESG key 

performance indicators. Since 2020, a specific  

section on sustainability has been incorporated into 

the scorecards to reflect the Group’s emphasis on 

ESG. Share plans are also available to incentivise 

eligible employees.

The Group’s compensation and benefits programmes 

are reviewed regularly and benchmarked against its 

respective markets using data from global market 

surveys and consultancy firms to ensure that we are 

internally equitable and market competitive.

The Group’s benefits are provided in accordance with 

local regulations and aligned to local employment 

practices. For example, in Singapore, benefit 

provisions include (but are not limited to) annual 

leave, marriage leave, compassionate leave and 

medical leave, as well as insurance for medical, life, 

personal accident, work injury compensation and 

business travel. Retirement provisions accordingly 

follow local legislated requirements.

The Group also rewards creative solutions and 

contributions through various business and employee 

recognition awards to celebrate role models and our 

employees’ innovative spirit.

7. Labour Relations

We recognise that harmonious labour management 

relations are built on trust and fairness. We respect 

all employees’ fundamental rights to freedom of 

association, including the right to be members of  

trade unions. We do the following:

• Take guidance from national or local industrial 

relations laws and regulations

• Maintain strong relationships with the unions through 

frequent activities and dialogues to discuss, clarify 

and resolve issues, and seek buy-in on new initiatives

• Ensure our unions, where applicable, are 

represented in key committees such as safety, 

welfare and training so that concerns can be 

promptly surfaced and addressed

The Group may embark on organisational or 

operational changes in response to external and 

internal factors. In consultation with our union (where 

applicable), such changes are communicated in a 

timely way to the affected employees.  This will help 

them understand and prepare for the upcoming 

changes.

In Singapore, the Group recognises the STESU as 

the collective negotiating body in respect of all terms 

and conditions of service of the employees covered 

under the scope of the collective agreement. 29% of 

employees in our Singapore operations are covered.

The union actively supports the Group’s effort to 

introduce multi-skilling and re-skilling of our workforce 

to increase the productivity of the workforce for the 

benefit of the Group and its employees. The Group will 

continue to provide the necessary training to ensure 

employees can perform the new tasks required.

As part of its 2021 workplan, the Workplace Safety 

&amp; Health (WSH) Committee reviewed and aligned 

our safety performance indicators. This included 

adopting ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety 

Management Systems revising our WSH indicators, 

carrying out a group-wide WSH promotion and 

campaign, enhancing WSH digital platforms (e.g. injury 

reporting, hazard reporting) and emphasising mental 

wellbeing at our workplaces.

In Singapore, the Group partnered the Workplace 

Safety and Health Council (WSHC) to offer health  

and safety workshops including health screening 

and coaching, infectious disease control and  

mental health. 

To ensure we remain compliant with relevant statutory 

and regulatory requirements, the Group continues to 

use control self-assessment and audit processes as 

part of our enterprise risk management initiatives. 

SAFETY PERFORMANCE

The Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) and Accident 

Severity Rate (ASR) in 2021 were 1.1 and 22.0 

respectively. The AFR of our global operations 

increased from 0.8 to 1.1, and the corresponding ASR 

increased from 17.2 to 22.0. One of the key factors  

that contributed to our slip in performance was due  

to human error in complying with safety procedures. 

We regard safety and wellness as paramount to our everyday work. Above and 

beyond legal requirements, we do our best to prevent occupational injuries and 

illnesses. We also strive to promote a healthy and balanced lifestyle among our staff.

WHAT WE ACHIEVED IN 2021

This is likely attributed to prolonged periods away 

from the workplace during the pandemic.  

In 2021, the two most frequent causes of injuries  

were cuts/stabbed by objects and being struck by 

objects. They accounted for 28% of all cases. Key 

mitigating measures are being adopted through 

continuous WSH education, assessments and 

surveillance activities within the group. They 

include cross sharing of best practices with our 

global operations, reviewing safe work procedures, 

conducting risk assessment on safe material and 

mechanical handling and stepping up enforcement 

on the use of specific personal protective equipment, 

tools and machinery safety as well as Lockout-Tagout. 

There was a decrease in falls from height incidents 

from 21% to 12%, the most frequent cause of injury 

in 2020. This can be attributed to our effective 

fall prevention programme which focuses on the 

following approaches such as intensive analysis of 

statistics; workforce direct engagement; series of 

comprehensive inspections; monitoring programme 

effectiveness; communication and feedback.

We continue to advocate the importance of safe 

work procedures to our employees via awareness 

briefings, site inspections and other safety initiatives, 

to constantly remind employees to take care of their 

safety and that of their co-workers.

In 2021, the Quality Committee stepped up efforts to 

bring our global quality professionals together for learning 

and to exchange best practices. This was carried out via 

multiple channels of engagement by each business area. 

Activities included working on QMS certifications, quality 

improvement projects, and quality training and sharing.

Conscientious efforts were made to encourage continuous 

learning and improvement while maintaining the highest 

standard of quality in our production lines and services. We 

developed various e-learning modules to promote the right 

quality processes and behaviours in our staff to enhance 

their quality knowledge and practices. We launched the 

Seven Quality Behaviours e-learning training programme in 

conjunction with World Quality Day on 11 November 2021, to 

stress the importance of quality to our staff. Staff were trained 

to internalise the behaviours of ability, customer focus,

teamwork, integrity, out-performance, nimbleness and

safety focus, and act to build and sustain our quality culture.

Staff are kept abreast of the latest quality and safety 

requirements, inhouse rules and industry best practices 

through regular training and briefings. They include  

system safety, Seven Quality Behaviours, as well as  

quality and safety awareness induction training 

as part of new employees’ orientation.

Systems Safety

System safety forms a key focus for  

ST Engineering as part of our quality promise 

to customers and employees. The concept 

employs a risk management approach based 

on the identification and analysis of potential 

hazards, and the application of mitigation 

measures using a systems-based approach. 

ST Engineering actively contributed to

ST Engineering has an extensive and extremely 

diverse supply chain. We buy goods and services 

to support our manufacturing, systems integration, 

MRO operations and services offerings in the 

aerospace, maritime and transport domains. 

We had 9,700 active suppliers supporting our 

Singapore operations in 2021 alone.

Despite the complexity of our global supply 

chains, we embarked on a journey to better 

steward our partnerships with our suppliers. 

We believe that collaborating and engaging 

with socially- and environmentally-conscious 

suppliers will mitigate a significant proportion  

of our ESG risks. 

In 2021, we obtained an acknowledgement to 

adhere to our Vendor Code of Conduct from 

100% of our strategic suppliers supporting 

our Singapore operations. We also started 

screening all new suppliers supporting Singapore 

operations on environment- and reputation-

related risks. Suppliers not meeting expectations 

must submit their recovery action plans and are 

further assessed before they are accepted.

We also seek to support local SMEs where possible 

-- for example, we spent $330m with local SMEs 

supporting our Singapore operations in 2021.

We will continue to strengthen our supply 

chain resilience by rolling out our procurement 

sustainability roadmap globally. We will build a 

firm foundation through setting guiding principles 

and standards for responsible procurement, and 

implement standards that are put into practice.  

We will constantly review them and obtain 

feedback from our global operations.

Over the next three years, our goals include:

• Conducting surveys and consolidating feedback 

on our Global Procurement Policy and Vendor 

Code of Conduct; 

• Getting acknowledgment of Vendor Code of 

Conduct from our strategic suppliers globally; 

and

• Implementing environmental screening for all 

new suppliers globally.

We aim to promote inclusive, ethical and sustainable procurement practices. 

We recognise that sustainable procurement helps us manage risks, improve 

efficiencies and reduce costs. To that end, we actively manage relationships 

with our suppliers to meet the needs of our businesses and deliver long-term 

value. We also seek to maximise social and economic benefits, while minimising 

damage to the environment and health.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Commitment

We believe in procuring responsibly to ensure a 

sustainable supply of goods and services to meet 

business needs. We are committed to managing our 

suppliers ethically and effectively to ensure a robust 

supply chain.

We are also committed to procure locally where 

feasible and work with the local suppliers in growing 

their capabilities to support our business needs.

Governance and Organisation

Our procurement community champions the  

effective management of our suppliers to align 

business behaviours, drive greater efficiencies, 

streamline processes and enable greater visibility.  

Our Responsible Procurement Framework helps  

us to work with our suppliers to embed our  

principles of responsible procurement.

Our approach towards responsible procurement is 

guided by five principles:

• We are committed to ethical procurement

• We do not compromise on the quality and safety  

of our products and services

• We practise value for money procurement

• We safeguard the health and safety of workers

• We protect the environment

These principles underpin our Responsible 

Procurement framework which comprises three pillars:

• Vendor Conduct – this is aligned to our 

sustainability agenda, defines our principles and 

standards, and lays down the basic behaviours and 

practices we require of our suppliers concerning 

their responsibilities towards their stakeholders and 

the environment

• Vendor Management – this streamlines the systems 

and processes we employ to screen, onboard and 

assess the performance of our suppliers, giving them 

a consistent experience working with the Group

• Vendor Relationship – this segments our suppliers 

based on profit impact and supplier risks into four 

categories; namely strategic, leverage, bottleneck 

and non-critical, for more effective management  

of the relationships

Supply Chain Management

ST Engineering's supply chain is diverse, mostly due to the 

range of businesses, as well as the multiple geographies 

we operate in. Singapore operations had over 9,700 

unique suppliers in 2021 alone. Of these, 75% are based 

in Singapore, 16% in Europe and North America and the 

remaining 9% in other parts of the world.

SOCIAL

→ Responsible Procurement

We engage suppliers through our vendor management 

programmes and maintain a close relationship. To 

communicate our business and ESG requirements, 

the Vendor Code of Conduct is progressively being 

included as part of Purchase Order terms and 

conditions. Suppliers are expected to adhere to it  

or we may disengage from them if they are either 

unwilling to do so or unresponsive with respect to 

implementing corrective action plans.

We adopt various sourcing strategies, which include 

the use of weighted criteria for tender contracts. 

This ensures that suppliers are assessed fairly both 

technically and commercially. For new suppliers, 

we actively screen each supplier against a defined 

set of ESG criteria including checking for reputation 

and negative feedback in the public domain, prior to 

establishing a business relationship with them.

Conflict Minerals Management

We do not procure conflict minerals. Our company’s 

offerings are typically at systems-level, and we 

procure finished electronics products. When we 

do buy electronics components, we mostly do so 

at sub-system level, and from reputable contract 

manufacturers. We expect these suppliers to have 

conflict minerals policies for their own supply chain.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Inclusive growth and value creation for the 

Group and stakeholders are key to our long 

term viability. We invest and contribute to the 

local communities where we operate so that 

they will thrive and become more resilient. 

We are committed to delivering a sustainable 

and balanced triple bottom line of “People, 

Planet, Profit”. We do this by creating 

employment and providing opportunities 

for local SMEs, partner with local education 

and training institutions, and collaborating 

with research organisations. We also assist 

our communities through our corporate 

community contributions.

Our strategic planning community reviews 

the Group’s strategy in the evolving context 

of global trends and developments. Our 

operations and support function teams 

focus on operational excellence to ensure 

the smooth delivery of quality products and 

services that add value for our stakeholders.

Wherever we operate, we are committed to 

paying our share of taxes and the transparent 

reporting of what we pay. We also support 

accountability in the way taxes and royalties  

are used.

gave out two Achievement awards and two  

Best Progress awards, placed 16 students on  

a two-week industry experiential programme, 

while supporting student enrichment and 

innovation projects.

We also helped set up the first Assumption 

Pathway School student-run, on-the-job training 

café open to the public at our Jurong East office in 

Singapore. The initiative creates authentic learning 

opportunities and experiences beyond the 

familiarity of the school compound to strengthen 

students’ competencies and employability.









Supporting Education through the Pandemic

Free Vehicle Roadworthiness Inspections 

Since 2020, our vehicle inspection business in Singapore 

has been drawing on its core capabilities to support 

social causes and non-profit organisations by providing 

complimentary vehicle roadworthiness inspections to 

Metta Welfare Association for their fleet of 11 ambulances 

and buses. In 2021, we extended these free inspections 

to SPD’s fleet of 11 vans so that they can also channel 

the waived inspection fees towards other pressing needs, 

especially given the additional operational challenges 

arising from COVID-19. 









Cybersecurity for the  

Non-Profit Sector

We helped the non-profit sector 

in Singapore achieve greater 

cyber resilience. By sharing our 

cybersecurity expertise, 235 

representatives from 167 social

to conducting its business in a responsible  

manner, supported by a group-wide enterprise  

risk management framework and backed by  

a strong Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.

Governance and Organisation

Governance refers to having the appropriate people, 

processes and structures to direct and manage the 

business and affairs of the company to enhance 

long-term stakeholder value and achieve long-term 

sustainable business performance. 

The Board has the dual role of setting strategic 

direction and the Group’s approach to governance. 

This includes establishing the appropriate culture, 

values and ethical standards of conduct at all levels of 

the Group. The Board not only provides oversight, but 

fosters more complete discussions, leading to better 

decisions and enhanced business performance. 

The Group Risk &amp; Assurance function assists the 

EXCO in overseeing matters relating to governance, 

risk and compliance. It has in place a regulatory 

compliance framework and compliance related 

policies, and continually conducts mandatory  

training of our global workforce on our Code of 

Business Conduct and Ethics (Code) and other 

relevant compliance topics.

The Code sets out the guiding principles and 

desired behaviour with which our employees are 

expected to operate, and embraces the business 

practices and standards of behaviour that support 

our commitment to honest and ethical business 

conduct. The standards set out in the Code have also 

been embedded in various corporate and operational 

policies and procedures. Ethical audits, based on our 

Code are conducted as part of internal audits by the

REPORT

Depending on their skill sets and background, 

Directors are sponsored to attend relevant courses, 

conferences and seminars to better equip them 

with the appropriate skills and knowledge to fulfil 

their governance role and to comply with Directors’ 

obligations. Directors are provided with opportunities 

to develop and maintain their skills and knowledge 

at the Company’s expense. Where there are statutory 

and regulatory changes that affect the obligations of 

Directors, the Company will update the Board and, 

where the changes are substantive, through briefings 

organised by external legal counsel. During the year, 

the Company arranged for the following briefings for 

the Board:

(i) 

Update on Cyber Threat Landscape;

(ii) Global Sustainability Trends 2021; and

(iii) Global fraud, bribery and corruption threat 

landscape and emerging trends.

The Directors were also informed of relevant courses 

organised by Singapore Institute of Directors or other 

external professional organisations for their enrolment.

The Directors’ trainings and developments were 

funded by the Company. For new Director without any 

prior experience as a director of an issuer listed on the 

Exchange, the Company will arrange for the Director to 

attend training as prescribed by the Exchange.

Board Meetings

The Board convenes scheduled meetings on a 

quarterly basis to review the business performance 

and key activities of the Group and to deliberate 

significant business proposals. Board members 

participate actively in Board discussions, and 

decisions are taken objectively in the interests 

of the Company. Where warranted by particular 

circumstances, ad-hoc/special Board meetings  

may be convened to consider corporate actions 

requiring the Board’s guidance or approval.

To facilitate the Board and Board Committees’ 

decision-making process, the Company’s Constitution 

provides for Directors to participate in virtual meetings. 

If a Director is unable to attend a Board or Board 

Committee meeting, he/she will still receive all the 

materials to be tabled for discussion at that meeting, 

and where required, separate briefing sessions 

are arranged. Decisions of the Board and Board 

Committees may also be obtained via circulation. 

At the end of every Board meeting, the Chairman 

allocates time for its non-executive Directors to meet 

without the presence of management.

Information furnished to the Board is an ongoing 

process, which includes monthly consolidated 

management reports on the financial performance of 

the Group and the businesses. On a quarterly basis, 

the management reports would also include key 

business highlights and capital expenditure of the 

Group and the businesses to keep the Board apprised 

of business investments and performance updates.

The Board also has separate and unrestricted access 

to the Senior Management, the Company Secretary, 

internal and external auditors, risk management 

and sustainability teams. The Board may also seek 

independent professional advice, if necessary, to 

enable them to discharge their duties effectively. 

All engagements of external advisers are at the 

Company’s expense.

The Board and Board Committee meetings are 

scheduled well in advance. The Board and Board 

Committee members are provided with complete, 

adequate, relevant and timely information on matters 

to be discussed or considered at meetings.

The Board has, at all times, exercised independent 

judgment to make decisions, using its collective 

wisdom and experience to act in the best interests of 

the Company. Any Director who has an interest that 

may conflict with a subject under discussion by the 

Board, declares his/her interest and either recuses 

himself/herself from the information and discussion of 

the subject matter or abstains from decision-making.

The Company has adopted half-yearly reporting and 

provides operational updates in the first and third 

quarters to the market and analysts alike. Board 

and Audit Committee meetings continue to be held

During the year, the Board met quarterly to consider, 

among other things, the approval and release of the 

FY2020 and 1H2021 results, including the review of 

the 1Q2021 and 3Q2021 Market Updates. The Board

also scheduled additional meetings to discuss and

Board Composition and Guidance 

(Principle 2)

Board Composition and Diversity

The Board has an appropriate level of independence 

and diversity of thought and background in its 

composition to enable it to make decisions in the  

best interests of the Company. The Board comprises  

13 Directors and an Alternate Director. COL Cai Dexian 

is Alternate Director to LG Ong Su Kiat Melvyn. LG Ong, 

in his position as Chief of Defence Force, may be called 

away on duty at times and may not be able to attend all 

Board meetings. COL Cai is fully apprised of all Board 

matters, receives notices to attend Board meetings 

and Board papers, as well as Board resolutions by 

circulation. As Alternate Director, he is in a position  

to act on behalf of LG Ong in the latter’s absence.

The Board adopted a Board Diversity Policy since 

2019. The Board, through the Nominating Committee 

(NC), reviews and assess the size and composition 

of the Board taking into consideration the age, skill 

sets, knowledge, experience, background, gender, 

cultural ethnicity, tenure, independence of Directors 

and other relevant factors. The Board also recognises 

that diversity is not limited merely to gender or 

any personal attributes and believes that having 

experienced directors with an independent mindset  

is important for the Board to be effective. 

There are two female Directors on the Board. The 

Directors’ ages range from the forties to seventies, and 

they have served on the Board for various tenures. 

The Board consists of members with established 

track records in defence, business leadership and 

professional experience in energy, finance (including 

audit and accounting), banking, technology, legal, 

business management and risk and management 

domains. Each Director brings to the Board an 

independent perspective based on his/her training 

and professional expertise to enable the Board to 

make balanced and well-considered decisions.

The Board of Directors with their combined 

business, management and professional experience, 

knowledge and expertise, provide the core 

competencies to allow for diverse and objective 

perspectives on the Group’s business and direction. 

Having considered the scope and nature of the 

operations of the Group, the NC and the Board are 

satisfied that the current composition and size of the 

Board provide for diversity and allow for informed 

and constructive discussion and effective decision 

making at Board and Board Committee meetings.

The Board is committed to observe the need for 

diversity when selecting its members. The contribution 

each Director brings and the composition thereof 

provides a good reflection on the range and adequacy 

of diversity on the Board.

(ii) Tan Peng Yam was appointed as non-

(iv) COL Cai Dexian was appointed as Alternate

Board Independence 

The Board has 12 non-executive Directors of which 

nine are independent Directors. The Code requires 

non-executive directors to make up a majority of 

the Board. The independence of each Director is 

determined upon appointment and reviewed  

annually, and as and when circumstances require,  

by the NC, in accordance with the requirements of  

the SGX-ST Listing Manual, the Code and where 

relevant, the recommendations set out in the Practice 

Guidance accompanying the Code.

The Board, taking into account the views of the  

NC, affirmed that the independent Directors are  

Kwa Chong Seng, Kevin Kwok Khien, Lim Ah Doo,  

Lim Chin Hu, Lim Sim Seng, Ng Bee Bee (May),  

Quek See Tiat, Song Su-Min and Teo Ming Kian.  

Each of the members of the NC and the Board  

recused himself/herself from the deliberations  

on his/her independence.

Kwa Chong Seng, Kevin Kwok Khien, Lim Ah Doo,  

Lim Chin Hu, Lim Sim Seng , Quek See Tiat,  

Song Su-Min and Teo Ming Kian declared that  

each of them does not have any relationships with  

the substantial shareholder, no management 

relationship and no business relationship with the 

Company and its group of companies, that could 

interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere,  

with the exercise of their independent business 

judgement in the best interests of ST Engineering. 

Kwa Chong Seng attained his nine years of service  

on the Company’s board on 1 September 2021.  

The NC has reviewed and affirmed that he is an 

independent Director.

The Company sought and obtained Shareholders’ 

approval at its AGM held in April 2021 by way of a two-

tier vote pursuant to Rule 210 (5)(d)(iii) of the SGX-ST 

Listing Manual, for Kwa Chong Seng to continue to be 

considered as independent Director with effect from 

1 September 2021 and the approval for Mr Kwa to be 

independent Director will remain in force until the 

earlier of the retirement or resignation of Mr Kwa or  

the conclusion of the third AGM following the  

passing of the resolution.

The Board had confirmed its previous determination 

that Mr Kwa remains objective and independent 

in Board and Board Committee deliberations. He 

constructively challenges Management during Board 

and various Board Committee meetings on which 

he serves and his extensive experience enables him 

to provide wise counsel and guidance to facilitate 

sound decision- making. Mr Kwa’s length of service 

on the Board neither interferes with his exercise of 

independent judgment nor hinders his ability to act  

in the best interests of the Company. On this basis,  

the Board is of the view that Mr Kwa will be able to 

continue to discharge his duties independently  

with integrity and competency. 

Lim Sim Seng is the Group Head of Consumer 

Banking Group and Wealth Management of DBS 

Bank (DBS). DBS is one of the many Banks which 

ST Engineering group companies has a banking 

relationship with. All transactions between DBS and 

ST Engineering group companies are conducted in 

the ordinary course of business and at arm’s length 

on normal commercial terms. Our facilities with DBS 

are under Corporate Banking and not Consumer 

Banking or Wealth Management. Mr Lim is not 

involved in the day-to-day business operations of 

ST Engineering. He only receives Director’s fees. Mr 

Lim recused himself from discussions and decisions 

involving DBS’s dealings with ST Engineering group 

companies. With the aforesaid, the NC determined 

that business relationships between ST Engineering 

group companies and DBS would not affect Mr Lim’s 

independence. The Board is of the view that the 

relationships set out above do not interfere with the 

exercise of Mr Lim’s independent business judgement 

in the best interests of ST Engineering and therefore, 

he is considered independent Director. 

Sister of Ng Bee Bee (May) is an Executive Director 

(Corporate Banking) in United Overseas Bank (UOB) 

Singapore, but she is not overseeing the banking 

relationship of ST Engineering group companies 

with UOB. UOB is one of the many banks with which 

ST Engineering group companies have a banking 

relationship. All transactions between UOB and  

ST Engineering group companies are conducted in 

the ordinary course of business and based on normal 

commercial terms. The NC determined that her sister’s 

position in UOB would not have any conflict or affect 

Ms Ng’s independence. In the event of any engagement 

of UOB requiring the Board’s approval, Ms Ng will 

recuse herself from discussions on UOB’s dealings with 

ST Engineering group companies. The Board is of the 

view that the relationships set out above do not interfere 

with the exercise of Ms Ng’s independent business 

judgement in the best interests of ST Engineering and 

therefore, she is considered independent Director.

Teo Ming Kian is a non-executive director of Temasek 

Holdings (Private) Limited (Temasek), which is a 

substantial shareholder of the Company. Mr Teo is not 

a nominee of Temasek on the Board of ST Engineering. 

His role on the Temasek board is non-executive 

in nature and he is not involved in the day-to-day 

conduct of the business of Temasek. Mr Teo is also 

not directly associated with Temasek in that he is not 

accustomed or under an obligation, whether formal 

or informal, to act in accordance with the directions, 

instructions or wishes of Temasek in relation to the 

corporate affairs of ST Engineering. It also does not 

generate any issue that may affect his independence 

as a Director of ST Engineering. The NC determined 

that Mr Teo’s position in Temasek would not have 

any conflict or did not impair his ability to act with 

independent judgement in the discharge of his duties 

and responsibilities as a Director. The Board is of the 

view that the relationships set out above do not interfere 

with the exercise of Mr Teo’s independent business

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

(Principle 3)

The Chairman and Group President &amp; CEO roles and 

responsibilities are kept separate in order to maintain 

effective oversight. The recommendation in the Code 

for a lead independent director is not applicable as the 

Chairman and the Group President &amp; CEO are separate 

individuals and are not related. No individual or small 

group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision 

making process. The Group President &amp; CEO and  

senior management regularly consult with individual 

Board members and seek the advice of members of  

the Board Committees through meetings, telephone 

calls, as well as by email.

The Chairman is responsible for leading the Board 

and ensuring the effective functioning of the Board 

to act in the best interests of the Company and its 

shareholders. The Chairman facilitates the relationship 

between the Board, Group President &amp; CEO and 

management, engaging them in open dialogue over 

various matters including strategic issues, sustainability, 

risks and business planning processes. He ensures 

that discussions at the Board level are conducted 

objectively and professionally where all views are heard 

and key issues are debated in a fair and open manner. 

The Chairman also ensures that adequate time is 

provided for discussion of strategic issues and key 

concerns at Board meetings. He represents the  

views of the Board to the shareholders.

Vincent Chong as an executive Director and Group 

President &amp; CEO, is accountable to the Board for 

the conduct and performance of the Group. He has

things, oversee governance, risks and sustainability 

within the Group’s business. When the need for a 

new director is identified, potential candidates are 

identified from various sources including internal 

references or recommendations made by Directors. 

The NC will assess a shortlist according to the type 

of expertise needed. The NC will also assess a 

candidate’s character, independence and experience 

to ensure that he/she has the requisite standard of 

competence to carry out his/her duties as a director 

of a listed company as well as to enhance the Board’s 

effectiveness.

The NC is tasked to oversee and review the succession 

planning process for board renewal including that of 

the Chairman of the Board, having regard to achieving 

a balance of skills, diversity, independence, knowledge 

and attributes required of an effective Board. The NC 

also oversees and reviews the succession planning 

for the Group President &amp; CEO and key senior 

management.

Board Evaluation

The NC conducted an annual Board Evaluation to 

gauge the effectiveness of the Board and Board 

Committees as well as the individual Board  

member’s performance.

With effect from FY2021, the Company engages an 

independent external consultant once every three 

years to facilitate the Board evaluation process and 

provide the Board with an independent perspective 

of the Board’s performance, including benchmarking 

against peer boards and best practices. 

In FY2021, Aon Solutions Singapore Pte. Ltd. (Aon), 

an independent external consultant was appointed 

to facilitate the Board evaluation process. The 

performance criteria includes Board composition, 

information management, Board processes, ESG, 

Board strategies and priorities, managing Company’s 

performance, CEO Development and succession 

planning, Director development and management, 

risk management, Board Committee effectiveness 

covering general evaluation of Committees, Committee 

self evaluation, overall perception and Directors’ peer 

evaluation on individual Director’s performance. The 

evaluation was conducted by way of questionnaire 

via online platform. A report on Board and Committee 

evaluation (including benchmarking against general 

market and recommendation) was shared with the 

NC and the Board. The Board took on board the 

recommendations and feedback in the report on areas 

for improvement. In respect of the Individual Director’s 

performance, the NC and Board Chairmen acted on 

the results of the evaluation and arrange for one-to-one 

feedback session with the director, where necessary.

Maximum Board Representation

The NC reviews directorships of the Board and determine 

if a Director is able to and has been adequately 

carrying out his or her duties as a Director, taking into 

consideration the Director’s number of listed company 

board representations and other principal commitments.

The NC noted the list of other directorships held by 

our Directors, taking into consideration their principal 

commitments. The NC and the Board are satisfied that 

each of the Directors is able to devote time to carry out 

his/her duties as Director in the Company.

The Board has considered and agreed not to set 

guidelines for a maximum directorship that a Director 

can hold. Annually, an incumbent Director is asked

to affirm that he/she has adequate time to devote to 

his/her Board responsibilities. ST Engineering Board 

members are selected on the basis of their ability to 

contribute to the Board through their relevant skill  

sets, experience, calibre and willingness to devote 

time. In addition, each director is required to provide 

an annual affirmation of commitment to his/her 

Board responsibilities. With these considerations,  

the Board is of the view that setting a maximum 

number of board representations for our Directors  

is not needed.

Re-election of Directors

The NC is also responsible for renewal and succession 

plans to ensure Board continuity. At each Annual 

General Meeting (AGM), one-third of the directors 

with those longest in office since his/her last  

re-election have to retire. Effectively, this results in  

all directors having to retire at least once every three  

years or even earlier, in compliance with Rule 720(5) 

of the SGX-ST Listing Manual. A retiring director may 

submit himself/herself for re- election. Under this 

provision,  Lim Chin Hu, Quek See Tiat and Song Su-

Min will retire at the 2022 AGM. Kevin Kwok Khien,  

Tan Peng Yam and Teo Ming Kian who are newly 

appointed during FY2021, will hold office until the 

forthcoming AGM of the Company. The retiring 

Directors, being eligible, have offered themselves for 

re-election. In accordance with Rule 720(6) of the 

SGX-ST Listing Manual, the information relating to the 

retiring Directors seeking re-election is found on pages 

25 to 27 of this Annual Report.

Each of the retiring non-executive Directors has 

confirmed that he/she does not have any relationship 

with his fellow Directors nor with the Company and  

its substantial shareholders.

The Board, acting on the recommendation of the  

NC, proposes that each of the retiring Directors be  

re-elected at the Company’s 2022 AGM.

are independent and are not related to the Group or 

any of its Directors.

Executive Remuneration Structure

Remuneration for the Senior Management Executives 

comprises a fixed compensation, variable cash- 

based incentives, share-based incentives and  

market-related benefits.

In 2020, as part of cost saving measures to mitigate 

COVID-19 impact, the Group implemented fee 

and salary reductions for the Board and senior 

management team ranging between 5% and 20%. 

Effective July 2021, the Group restored all fees  

and salary reductions. 

A. 

Fixed Compensation:

The fixed compensation comprises the base salary 

and compulsory employer’s Central Provident Fund 

(CPF) contributions.

B. 

Variable Cash-based Incentives:

The variable cash-based incentives include the 

Performance Target Bonus (PTB) and EVA-based 

Incentive Scheme.

Performance Target Bonus

The PTB is a cash-based incentive for Senior 

Management Executives which is linked to the 

achievement of annual performance targets that  

will vary depending on their job requirements.

Individual performance objectives are set at the 

beginning of each financial year. The performance 

targets are in financial, people, operational, customer 

and sustainability areas aligned to the business’ 

strategic goals. These objectives are cascaded  

down to a select group of key executives creating 

alignment between the performance of the Group, 

Company and the individual.

The individual PTB payouts for the Group President &amp; 

CEO and key management executives are determined 

by the ERCC based on the Group’s, Company’s  

and individual performance at the end of the  

financial year.

EVA-based Incentive Scheme

The EVA-based Incentive Scheme (EBIS), which is 

linked to the Company’s economic value-add and 

financial performance forms part of the short-term 

incentives for the Senior Management Executives.

Under the plan, a portion of EBIS bonus declared for 

the financial year will be paid out annually, while the 

remaining portions will be deferred in an EVA bank. 

Amounts in the EVA bank are at risk because negative 

EVA will result in a clawback of EVA accumulated in 

the bank. This mechanism encourages the Senior 

Management Executives to work for sustained EVA

generation and to adopt strategies that are aligned 

with the long-term interests of the Group.

In addition, the Group has a clawback facility with 

respect to the EVA bank in the event of a restatement 

of the financial results of the Group subsequent to an 

earlier misstatement, and provisions for the forfeiture 

of the remaining EVA bank balance on termination 

due to misconduct or fraud resulting in any financial 

loss to the Group.

Based on the ERCC’s assessment, the Group has

met the predetermined targets in financial year 2021.

C. 

Share-based Incentives:

Shares which were granted in financial year 2021  

were based on the Singapore Technologies 

Engineering Performance Share Plan 2020 

(“PSP2020”) and the Singapore Technologies 

Engineering Restricted Share Plan 2020 (“RSP2020” 

and together with the PSP2020, the “2020 Share 

Plans”) approved and adopted by shareholders of the 

Company at the 23rd AGM held on 15 May 2020.

The 2020 Share Plans replaced the Singapore 

Technologies Engineering PSP 2010 (“PSP2010”)  

and the Singapore Technologies Engineering  

RSP 2010 (“RSP2010” and together with the  

PSP2010, the “2010 Share Plans”), both of which 

expired on 20 April 2020. The expiry of the 2010  

Share Plans did not affect the awards under the 

2010 Share Plans which were granted prior to such 

expiry, whether such awards had been released to 

participants (whether fully or partially) or not.

The 2020 Share Plans have substantially the 

same terms as the 2010 Share Plans, save for the 

introduction of new malus and clawback rights, 

a reduction in size limit (from 8% under the 2010 

Share Plans to 5% under the 2020 Share Plans1), 

amendments to take into account the changes to 

relevant legislation and the SGX-ST Listing Manual, 

and changes to streamline and rationalise certain 

other provisions.

The malus and clawback rights under the 2020 Share 

Plans allow the ERCC to cancel all or part of any 

award to the extent not yet released to the participant, 

and to exercise the right to clawback the monetary 

value of shares which have been released to the 

participant within a six-year clawback period, if certain 

exceptional circumstances occur in relation to that 

participant. Such exceptional circumstances include 

(but are not limited to):

• 

the grant of the relevant award being based on 

inaccurate financial statements;

• 

the participant having engaged in conduct which 

resulted in or contributed to any financial loss or 

reputational harm to the Company or the Group; 

and

• 

the participant having engaged in misconduct 

or committed fraud or breach of trust or duty in 

relation to the Company or the Group.

The Group also has clawback policies for the unvested 

shares granted under the 2010 Share Plans in the 

event of exceptional circumstances of restatement 

of the financial results of the Group subsequent to 

an earlier misstatement, or of misconduct or fraud 

resulting in any financial loss to the Group.

Share grants under the 2020 Share Plans during 

financial year 2021 did not exceed 0.5% of the total 

number of issued shares of the Company (excluding 

treasury shares and subsidiary holdings), which is the 

yearly limit set by the ERCC for the 2020 Share Plans.

The aggregate number of shares issued and/or to be 

issued and the aggregate number of existing shares 

(including treasury shares) delivered and/or to be 

delivered, pursuant to the 2020 Share Plans, does not 

exceed 5% of the issued share capital of the Company 

(excluding treasury shares).

Details of the abovementioned share plans and grants 

are set out in the Share Plans section of the Directors’ 

Statement from pages 132 to 135 of this Annual Report.

PSP2020

The objective of the PSP2020 is to motivate Senior 

Management Executives to strive for sustained growth 

and performance of the Group.

Performance share awards are generally granted on 

an annual basis and are conditional on the Group 

meeting targets set for a three-year performance 

period. The performance measures used in 

performance share grants are:

• 

Absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) taking 

reference to the Group’s Cost of Equity; and

• 

Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth against pre- 

determined EPS growth targets over the relevant 

performance period.

1 Percentages are of the total number of issued shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings).

A minimum threshold performance is required for 

any shares to be released at the end of the applicable

performance period. The actual number of 

performance shares released will depend on the 

achievement of predetermined targets over the 

applicable performance period, capped at 170% of 

the shares granted.

The release of the shares is also conditional on 

satisfactory individual performance at the end of the 

performance period.

The performance share awards granted during 

financial year 2019 were conditional upon the 

performance of the Group from financial years 2019 

to 2021. For this grant, the Group has partially met 

the predetermined target performance levels set.

RSP2020

The objective of the RSP2020 is to retain and 

motivate managers and above to strive for sustained 

long-term growth of the Group. The plan also aims to 

foster a share ownership culture among employees 

within the Group and to better align employees’ 

incentives with shareholders’ interests. The RSP2020 

allows for restricted share awards to be granted to 

non-executive Directors (“NED Awards”) as part 

of their remuneration in respect of their office as 

such in lieu of cash. Such awards, which are meant 

to align the interests of the Directors with those of 

shareholders, will consist of fully paid shares with no 

vesting periods or performance conditions imposed 

although the Directors will be required to hold the 

shares for certain moratorium periods.

Restricted share awards are generally granted on 

an annual basis. Save for NED Awards, restricted 

share awards are generally conditional on the Group 

meeting a target set for a one-year performance 

period. The performance measure used in such 

restricted share grants is:

• 

Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)

Under such awards, a minimum threshold 

performance is required for any shares to be released 

after the end of the applicable performance period. 

The shares will vest equally over a four-year period, 

subject to continued employment with the Group 

and maintaining a satisfactory performance rating for 

the financial year preceding each tranche of vesting.

The restricted share awards granted during financial 

year 2021 were conditional upon the performance 

of the Group in financial year 2021. For this grant, 

the Group has met the predetermined performance 

threshold level set.

D. 

Market-related Benefits:

The benefits provided are comparable with local 

market practices.

The Code requires a company to disclose the names 

and remuneration of the CEO and at least the top 

five key management personnel (who are not also 

directors or the CEO). Details of the remuneration 

package for the Group President &amp; CEO are provided 

in the Summary Remuneration Table for directors on 

page 109. Details of the remuneration packages for 

the Key Management Executives are provided in the 

Summary Remuneration Table for Key Management 

Executives on page 110.

In performing the duties as required under its Terms 

of Reference, the ERCC ensures that remuneration 

paid to the Senior Management Executives are 

strongly linked to the achievement of business and 

individual performance targets.

 

This link is achieved in the following ways:

a. 

Allocating a significant portion of executives’ 

remuneration to be subjected to performance 

conditions and vesting schedules.

b. 

Incorporating appropriate individual 

performance objectives for awarding of annual 

PTB. The performance targets are in financial, 

people, operational, customer and sustainability 

areas aligned to the business’ strategic goals.

c. 

Linking variable incentives to Group’s 

performance conditions such as EVA, ROCE, 

EPS growth and Absolute TSR and requiring 

those conditions to be met for the incentives to 

be awarded or vested.

 

d. 

Setting realistic yet stretched performance 

targets each year to motivate a high degree of 

business performance with emphasis on both 

short and long-term quantifiable objectives.

An annual Pay-for-Performance Alignment study 

is conducted by the Remuneration Consultant and 

reviewed by the ERCC. The findings indicate strong 

Pay-for-Performance alignment for the Group in  

terms of both absolute and relative performance.

Under the Code, the compensation system shall 

take into account the risk policies of the Group, be 

symmetric with risk outcomes and be sensitive to  

the time horizon of risks. Having considered this,  

the ERCC has incorporated the following risk 

adjustments in the remuneration structure:

a. 

Setting a prudent funding mechanism of  

annual bonus;

b. 

Subjecting and deferring the vesting of 2020  

Share Plans to pre-determined performance 

conditions and potential forfeiture under malus 

and clawback rights;

c. 

Requiring the executive Director and key 

management personnel to hold a minimum 

number of shares under the share ownership 

guidelines; and

d. 

Applying discretion, whenever necessary, to 

ensure that remuneration outcomes align with 

the long-term interests and performance of the 

Group and discourage excessive risk-taking.

The ERCC undertakes periodic reviews of the 

compensation system to identify potential 

compensation-related risks and consider policies  

and processes to manage risk exposures identified.

The ERCC is of the view that the level and structure  

of remuneration align with the long-term interests  

and risk management policies of the Group.

During financial year 2021, there were no termination, 

retirement and post-employment benefits granted 

to directors, Group President &amp; CEO and Key 

Management Executives other than in accordance 

with the standard contractual agreement.

There were no employees who were immediate family 

members of a director or the Group President &amp; CEO 

and whose remuneration exceeded S$100,000 during 

the financial year 2021, except for Quek Gim Chuah, 

the brother of Quek Gim Pew, who retired as a Director 

of the Company on 1 August 2021. Quek Gim Chuah 

has been with ST Engineering for 34 years since April 

1987 and is currently the Vice President of Technical 

Training for the Commercial Aerospace’s MRO 

business. He reports to the EVP &amp; Head, Aerospace 

MRO, who functionally reports to President of the 

Commercial Aerospace business. In this role, he has 

no dealings with ST Engineering’s Board of Directors. 

Like all other non-executive Directors, Quek Gim 

Pew was not involved in operational matters and 

the hiring, appraisal and remuneration of middle 

management, including that of his brother Quek Gim 

Chuah. For these reasons, we decided to respect 

Quek Gim Chuah’s confidentiality by not disclosing his 

remuneration band.

Non-Executive Director Remuneration

Non-executive Directors (NEDs) have remuneration 

packages consisting of directors’ fees and attendance 

fees, which are approved in arrears by shareholders  

for services rendered in the previous year. The 

Directors’ Remuneration Framework comprises a 

basic retainer, attendance and additional fees for 

serving on Board committees.

For services rendered in financial year 2021, eligible 

NEDs will receive 70% of the total directors’ fees in 

cash and 30% of the total directors’ fees in the form  

of restricted shares which are governed by the terms 

of RSP2020, subject to shareholders’ approval at  

its AGM in April 2022.

As the restricted shares are granted in lieu of directors’ 

remuneration in cash, the shares will be granted 

outright as fully paid shares with no performance 

conditions attached and no vesting periods imposed. 

To encourage the alignment of interests of the NEDs 

with the interests of shareholders, the share grant has 

a moratorium on selling. Each eligible NED is required 

to hold shares in the Group worth the lower of: (a) 

the total number of shares in the Group granted to 

such NED as payment of the shares’ component of 

the NEDs’ fees for financial year 2011 and onwards; 

or (b) the number of shares of equivalent value to the 

prevailing annual basic retainer fee for a director of 

the Group. An NED can sell all his/ her shares in the 

Group a year after the end of his/her Board tenure.

The RSC is supported on risk related matters by  

the Risk and Assurance (R&amp;A) function which in turn 

works with Chief Risk Officers (CROs) of the respective 

businesses and management team. The R&amp;A function 

is key to making sure that ST Engineering manages 

its risks well, complies with legal and regulatory 

requirements where it operates and has the right 

governance and controls in place. Specifically,  

the R&amp;A function is to:

• 

work with Management to strengthen in-line 

controls and governance, risk management and 

compliance (GRC) culture;

• 

provide assurance to Management that the Group 

is conducting its business in compliance with 

all relevant and material regulations, customer 

requirements and internal procedures; and

• 

ensure the continued effectiveness of GRC 

frameworks, policies and procedures in Singapore 

and overseas business units.

Group Head, R&amp;A reports to Group CFO. The R&amp;A 

function provides leadership in the implementation 

of a Group-wide Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 

framework that allows risks to be identified, assessed, 

monitored and managed by the business managers.

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework

The Group has put in place an ERM framework to 

identify, assess, monitor and manage key business 

risks in the short, medium and long term. The ERM 

framework sets out a common and consistent 

understanding of risks and risk tolerance limits 

across the Group. The framework allows the Board 

and Management to have a shared understanding of 

the risk philosophy and overall risk appetites as they 

establish business strategies and objectives.

The annual risk work plan is approved by the RSC.

There is at least a member on the RSC who is also 

a member of the AC to facilitate communication 

and access of information between the two Board 

Committees.

During the year, the Board formalised the Group Risk 

Appetite Framework and Risk Appetite Statements 

to promote broader risk awareness and reinforce the 

desired risk culture across the Group. Additionally, the 

R&amp;A function has embarked on a review of the Control 

Self-Assessment Framework, aimed at fostering 

an integrated risk-based control environment and 

enhancing the basis of assurance from Management. 

This is expected to be progressively implemented 

for Singapore businesses in 2022, and for overseas 

business units in subsequent years.

a) 

Risk Appetite Framework

The Risk Appetite Framework defines the risk 

boundaries in line with our corporate strategy for 

compliance within the Group. Under this framework, 

the Board has approved the following Group Risk 

Appetite Statements with respect to our key risks in line 

with the Group’s material ESG factors. They serve as a 

key conduit for aligning the Group’s risk profile with the 

Group’s corporate strategy and business models.

Strategic

We are committed to pursuing sustainable and 

inclusive growth to enhance our competitive 

advantage whilst upholding our core values.

ESG

We subscribe to ESG best practices to benefit 

all stakeholders.

Financial

• We aim to maintain a resilient balance sheet.

• We have a defined governance framework 

to evaluate and approve all investment and 

business transactions.

Regulatory Compliance

• We comply with all applicable laws and 

regulations in the countries where we 

operate in.

• We adopt a zero tolerance policy towards 

fraud, bribery and corruption.

Operational

• We are committed to “Safety Before Profits”.

• We aim to achieve zero accidents at the 

workplace.

IT and Cyber

We are committed to protecting our data and 

systems including those entrusted to us by 

adopting best practices in cybersecurity.

The RSC provides oversight to the Group in 

formulating and reviewing risk policies and risk 

tolerance limits. These policies and limits are subject 

to periodic reviews to ensure that they continue  

to support the Group in achieving its strategic 

objectives and are aligned with the Group Risk 

Appetite Framework.

b) 

Risk Aware Culture and Training

Embedding the right culture throughout the 

organisation is important for effective risk 

management. The RSC recognises that good culture 

fosters openness that will enable management and 

staff to escalate concerns in a timely manner without 

fear. This will also promote better judgment and 

greater assurance to the Board and Management.

As part of the risk awareness and communication 

programme, annual risk management training plans 

covering ST Engineering Code of Business Conduct 

and Ethics, and key risk and compliance topics are 

rolled out at the Group level. The RSC is updated 

regularly on the status of these trainings.

c) 

Risk Review Process

Under the ERM framework, a risk dashboard of the 

top business risks is developed and maintained by 

each of the significant business units, rolling up into 

a summary dashboard for respective businesses. 

Once the top business risks are identified, measures 

will then be taken to develop and implement risk 

preventive and mitigating actions (collectively known 

as “controls”) and risk monitoring processes. The 

business managers are required to periodically  

review the effectiveness of the controls implemented, 

and initiate the necessary changes as the risk  

profile changes.

Quarterly, Cluster Presidents and Presidents of the 

Business Areas, as well as their respective CROs 

review respective dashboard of top business risks  

with the RSC. At the meetings, the risk management 

action plans and measures to address these risks  

will be discussed. At the same time, they will also 

highlight the following for discussion:

• 

emerging trends and issues in each business area;

• 

new risks or changes to existing risk profile;

• 

new risk incidents;

• 

major risk exposures; and

• 

risk management actions taken on previously  

identified risks.

The RSC continues to monitor the implementation 

of risk management policies and procedures and 

receives updates on the risk registers maintained  

by the respective businesses. Key activities during  

the year include regulatory compliance reviews,  

as well as assessment of business disruption risks  

and their corresponding continuity plans.

Control Self-Assessment Process

The Control Self-Assessment (CSA) is a process 

whereby the business risk owners, together with the 

respective control owners, evaluate and assess the 

effectiveness of the controls established to manage 

key risks. This self-assessment complements the basis 

of assurance from Management on the adequacy and 

effectiveness of the system of risk management and 

controls to manage the key business risks. 

System of Internal Control and Risk Management

The Board receives, at regular intervals, updates from 

the Board Committees on the key business risks, 

the material controls to manage these risks, and the 

internal audit reports on the operational effectiveness 

of the material controls. Accordingly, the Board, 

through the Board Committees and supported by the 

Group’s R&amp;A function and Internal Audit function, is 

satisfied that internal control issues are identified on a 

timely basis and remedial actions are taken promptly 

to minimise lapses. 

The Board has received assurance from the Group 

President &amp; CEO and Group CFO on the adequacy 

and effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls 

and risk management system. Based on the internal 

controls and risk management process established 

and maintained by the Group, work performed by the 

internal and external auditors, and reviews performed 

by management and various Board Committees, 

the Board is satisfied that the Group’s framework of 

internal controls (including financial, operational, 

compliance and information technology controls) as 

well as the risk management systems are adequate 

and effective as at 31 December 2021. 

The Audit Committee concurs with the Board on the 

adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls 

and risk management systems established and 

maintained by the Group as at 31 December 2021.

In this regard, the Board also notes that no framework 

of internal controls can provide absolute assurance 

against the occurrence of material errors, poor 

judgment in decision making, human error, fraud or 

other irregularities.

Audit Committee 

(Principle 10)

Independent and Non-Executive Directors

Quek See Tiat (Chairman) 

Kevin Kwok Khien 

Lim Ah Doo

Song Su-Min

The Audit Committee (AC) comprises all independent 

Directors with majority, including the AC Chairman, 

having relevant accounting or related financial 

management experience. The AC does not comprise 

any former partner or director of ST Engineering’s 

existing audit firm within two years preceding their 

appointment to the AC and none of them have any 

financial interest in the audit firm.

The duties of the AC include the following:

• 

reviewing the significant financial reporting issues 

and judgements so as to ensure the integrity of 

the financial statements and all announcements 

relating to financial performance;

• 

reviewing at least annually the adequacy and 

effectiveness of internal controls and risk 

management systems;

• 

reviewing the assurance from the Group President 

&amp; CEO and the Group CFO on the financial 

records and financial statements;

• 

making recommendation to the Board on the 

appointment, removal, remuneration and the  

terms of engagement of the external auditors;

• 

reviewing the adequacy, effectiveness, 

independence, scope and results of both the 

external and internal audit functions; and

• 

reviewing the whistleblowing policy and 

arrangements and all significant whistleblowing 

cases; the AC Chairman also chairs the Whistle- 

blowing Committee and is supported by the 

Group CFO, Group General Counsel, Group Chief 

Human Resource Officer, Group Head, R&amp;A and 

Group Head, Internal Audit (Group Head, IA). 

The Group Head, IA has unrestricted access to the AC. 

The AC reviews the appointment, remuneration and 

resignation of the Group Head, IA.

ST Engineering’s IA function (IA) is staffed with 

individuals with the relevant qualifications and 

experience and comprises a team of 20 staff 

members, including the Group Head, IA, who reports 

to the AC.

IA is a corporate member of the Singapore Chapter of 

the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and adopts the 

International Standards for the Professional Practice 

of Internal Auditing (the IIA Standards) laid down in 

the International Professional Practices Framework 

issued by the IIA.

The AC is satisfied that IA is independent, effective 

and adequately resourced.

The AC considered and approved the 2021 Audit Plans 

for the external and internal audits. In addition, the AC 

reviewed the adequacy of internal control procedures 

including cybersecurity issues, interested person 

transactions and the issues raised in all IA reports.

External Auditors

The appointment of external auditors is subject to 

approval at each AGM. In making its recommendations 

to shareholders on the appointment and re-

appointment of external auditors, the Board relies on 

the review and recommendations of the AC. The AC 

reviews the adequacy, effectiveness, independence, 

scope and results of the external audit and makes 

recommendation to the Board on the appointment, 

removal, remuneration and the terms of engagement  

of the external auditors. In compliance with the  

SGX-ST Listing Manual, an audit engagement partner 

may only be in charge of an audit for up to five 

consecutive years. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,  

first appointed in 2020, has met this requirement,  

and the current audit engagement partner also took 

over ST Engineering’s audit in 2020.

Fees paid to the external auditors for audit and  

non-audit services of the Group for financial year  

2021 totalled $4.5m, of which $0.21m or 5% were for 

non-audit services. The AC was satisfied that the  

non-audit services provided by the external auditors 

did not compromise their independence.

The Company has complied with Rules 712 and 

715 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual in relation to the 

engagement of its auditors.

REPORT

Significant matters

How the AC reviewed these matters

Impairment assessment  

of non-financial assets – 

goodwill

The AC reviewed the reasonableness of cash flow forecasts, the long-term growth rates 

and discount rates used in the valuation models in goodwill impairment assessments, as 

well as how the impact of COVID-19 has been considered in the cash flow forecasts. The 

AC also reviewed the stress testing of the valuation and its sensitivity to changes in key 

assumptions used in the valuation model.

Revenue recognition based 

on stage of completion

The AC reviewed the various controls that were designed and applied by the Group in 

the recognition of revenue and profit from contracts with customers to ensure that the 

estimates used in determining the amount of revenue and costs recognised for the 

performance obligations were appropriate.

The AC concluded that Management’s accounting 

treatment and estimates were appropriate for the 

above significant matters. All the key audit matters 

(KAMs) that were raised by the external auditors for 

the financial year ended 31 December 2021 have 

been addressed by the AC and discussed in the above 

commentary. The KAMs in the audit report for the 

financial year ended 31 December 2021 can be found 

on pages 139 to 140 of this Annual Report.

The AC was kept updated on relevant changes in 

accounting standards and their implications on the 

financial statements.

Whistleblowing Policy

The AC has reviewed the ST Engineering Whistleblowing 

Policy and is satisfied with the procedures through 

which the employees and other stakeholders 

may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible 

improprieties in business conduct, financial report or 

other matters without the fear of reprisals. No form of 

retaliation to the informant (internal or external)  

is tolerated for any report made in good faith. 

ST Engineering is committed to conducting business 

with integrity and adopts a zero-tolerance attitude 

towards any malpractice, impropriety, statutory 

non-compliance and/or any wrongdoing by board 

members, employees and any other parties with a 

business relationship with the Group. The Whistle-

blowing Committee - with the assistance of the Group 

Head, IA – reviews and deliberates over the contents 

of the incident raised and determines the subsequent 

measures to adopt, including making enquiries 

and pursuing investigations (internal or external). 

The AC reviews the adequacy of every investigation 

instituted with their corresponding outcomes. Under 

these procedures, arrangements are in place for 

independent investigation of reported concerns and 

for appropriate follow-up actions to be taken. 

Harassment or victimisation of the whistleblower is 

not tolerated. Reasonable and appropriate actions, 

subject to applicable laws, are taken to protect all 

whistleblowers who raise a concern in good faith.  

Appropriate disciplinary action may be taken against 

employees who retaliate against the whistleblower. 

During the year, the AC held five meetings, including a 

joint meeting with the RSC to review significant risks of 

the Company and related key controls.

The AC also met with the external auditors, and 

with the internal auditors, in each case without the 

presence of Management.

The AC reviewed the financial statements of the Group 

before the announcement of the Group’s half-yearly 

and full-year results. In the light of the COVID-19 

pandemic impacting the Group’s businesses, the AC 

reviewed the areas of financial statements affected 

by the pandemic. Amongst the matters discussed 

with Management and the external auditors, the 

following significant matters impacted the financial 

statements, and were reviewed by the AC in relation 

to their materiality and appropriateness in approach, 

methodology and assessment:

Our whistleblowing policy facilitates the in-confidence 

disclosures of possible impropriety or non-compliance.  

All reports, which may be made anonymously, are 

treated with strict confidentiality. Non-anonymous 

whistleblowers (with contactable details) are informed 

when investigations are concluded.

All stakeholders, including employees, customers, 

suppliers and the general public, can report 

incidents through various reporting channels that are 

independently managed.

View our 

 whistleblowing reporting channels

Whistleblowing Procedure

Employees and other stakeholders may raise their 

concerns anonymously or otherwise and/or write 

to seek advice on the ST Engineering’s anti-bribery 

programme through the various whistleblowing 

communication channels (i.e. dedicated email 

account, postal address, 22 geographical toll-free 

telephone numbers, web and mobile reporting 

applications, hosted by an independent external 

provider). 

Concerns involving any member of the Board or the 

Senior Management or the Group Head, IA may be 

reported directly to the Chairman of the Board, the 

AC Chairman and the Group President &amp; CEO via 

dedicated email at AC@stengg.com. The reporting 

channels are published on the Group’s website, 

intranet, and offices for accessibility and awareness. 

The Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures are 

reviewed by the AC from time to time to ensure that 

they remain relevant. 

Interested Person Transactions

The Group has established policies and procedures 

for reviewing and approving interested person 

transactions (IPTs) in accordance with the general 

mandate from shareholders to ensure that such 

transactions are conducted fairly on an arm’s length 

basis and will not be prejudicial to the interest of the 

Company and/or its minority shareholders. 

The Group maintains a register of interested persons 

to facilitate the identification of IPTs.

IPTs are reviewed by internal auditors and reported to 

the AC on a quarterly basis. 

Where any IPT requires shareholders’ approval, 

the interested person abstains from voting and the 

decision is made by other shareholders. 

The general mandate from shareholders is put up 

for approval at each AGM and stipulates the review 

procedures to ensure IPTs are undertaken on arm’s 

basis and on normal commercial terms consistent 

with the Group’s usual business practices and 

policies, which are generally no more favourable  

to the interested persons than those extended to 

unrelated third parties. 

Details of IPTs entered into by the Group for financial 

year 2021 are set out on page 281 of this annual report.

The Company convened an EGM on 15 December

LLC from TransCore Holdings, LLC. The Company 

recieved an overwhelming support of 99.92% approval 

for the proposed acquisition.

Read our 

AGM and EGM minutes

Provision 11.4 of the Code provides for a company’s 

constitution to allow for absentia voting at general 

meetings of shareholders. Presently, absentia voting 

(such as by mail, email or fax) is not permitted under 

the Company’s Constitution. The Company does 

not intend to amend its Constitution to provide for 

absentia voting until security, integrity and other 

pertinent issues relating to absentia voting are 

satisfactorily resolved. Nevertheless, the Company 

is of the view that notwithstanding its deviation from 

Provision 11.4 of the Code, shareholders are treated 

fairly and equitably and have the opportunity to 

communicate their views on matters affecting the 

Company. For instance, shareholders may appoint 

proxies to attend, speak and vote, on their behalf, at 

general meetings if they are unable to attend.

Dividend Policy

On 24 February 2022, the Board approved a dividend 

policy to declare dividends every quarter instead of 

twice a year previously. For FY2022, the plan is for 

dividends to be paid four times a year, at 4.0 cents per 

share each time resulting in total dividends of 16.0 

cents per share payable for FY2022 (compared to the 

15.0 cents per share paid or payable for FY2021).

The dividends for FY2022 are currently scheduled to 

be paid in June 2022, September 2022, December 

2022 and May 2023. As and when the Board declares 

an interim dividend for each of the first three quarters 

of FY2022, ST Engineering will announce the relevant 

record date and payment date on SGXNet. The final 

dividend payable in May 2023 is subject to shareholders’ 

approval at the ST Engineering AGM to be held in April 

2023, the record date and payment date for which will 

be announced in conjunction with the release of the 

Group’s full-year financial results for FY2022.

This change from declaring dividends semi-annually to 

quarterly will provide shareholders with more frequent 

income streams. Notwithstanding the new dividend 

policy, ST Engineering continues to focus on and has 

sufficient financial capacity to seek growth pursuant to 

the Group’s strategy as communicated at its Investor 

Day in November 2021, and as it has demonstrated in 

the last few years.

Engagement with Shareholders  

(Principle 12)

ST Engineering treats all shareholders fairly and 

equitably in order to enable them to exercise 

shareholders’ rights and have the opportunity to 

communicate their views on matters affecting 

the Company. The Company ensures that all 

communications of material information, including 

price-sensitive and trade-sensitive information, are 

timely, balanced and fair and in compliance with the 

SGX-ST Listing Manual and the Code. 

The Investor Relations (IR) department is an integral 

conduit between the Company and investment 

community. The Investor Relations team maintains 

regular dialogues with shareholders and the 

investment community through a multi-channel 

programme to promote effective communication 

that gives them a balanced and understandable 

assessment of the Company’s performance, position 

and prospects.

Targeted events such as AGMs, investor conferences, 

group briefings and one-on-one meetings offer 

opportunities for senior management and directors 

to interact first-hand with shareholders and the 

investment community to understand their views, 

gather feedback and address concerns. 

Material information relating to the Company’s 

financial performance, business and strategic 

developments are published on SGXNET, and/or on 

our corporate website www.stengg.com.

A dedicated “Investor Relations” section on our 

website houses current and past annual reports, 

half-yearly financial reports and webcasts, quarterly 

market updates, as well as information on AGM and 

other information considered to be of interest to

DEALINGS IN SECURITIES

The Company has in place a policy which prohibits 

our Directors and officers of the Company and the 

Group from dealing in ST Engineering’s securities 

one month before the announcement of half-year 

and full-year financial results (the black-out period). 

They are informed of the commencement date for 

each black-out period and are regularly reminded 

not to deal in ST Engineering’s securities at all times 

if they are privy to any unpublished material price-

sensitive or trade-sensitive information. They are also 

advised to observe the insider trading laws at all times 

even when engaging in dealings in ST Engineering’s 

securities within the permitted window periods, and 

not to deal in ST Engineering’s securities on short-

term consideration.

The Company will also not purchase or acquire its

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics

LOBBYING &amp; POLITICAL CONTRIBUTION

Political contributions, donations or sponsorships 

must be approved by management in accordance 

with the Group’s approval limits policy and be made 

with the highest ethical standards and in compliance 

with all applicable laws of the jurisdictions where we 

operate in. They must not confer a personal benefit, 

and must not be given to gain a business advantage or 

to influence a business outcome or an official action. 

CYBERSECURITY / DATA PRIVACY &amp; PROTECTION

ST Engineering understands the need for strong 

cybersecurity as digital technology and highly 

connected economies and businesses bring new 

vulnerabilities from a proliferation of cyber threats. 

We continue to strengthen our cyber resilience with a 

system of cybersecurity capabilities that comprises 

People, Process and Technology.

 

We also equip our employees with relevant 

cybersecurity knowhow through internal campaigns  

to protect the Group from cyber threats. 

Our Personal Data Policy is available on our website. 

We have implemented policies and practices in our 

organisation to ensure we comply with applicable 

data protection laws and regulations. These policies 

describe the types of personal data we may collect 

from individuals, how we may use that information, 

and to whom we may share it with. They also prescribe 

the measures that we take to protect the security of 

the personal data entrusted to us.

Personal Data Policy

ANTI-BRIBERY &amp; CORRUPTION 

The Group has zero tolerance for fraud and corruption 

and has detailed policies and compliance procedures 

related to anti-bribery and corruption. 

Employees 

The Group has detailed policies for our employees, as 

well as training, compliance procedures and whistle-

blowing channels that are accessible to employees and 

external parties. Our Code is designed to ensure our 

employees uphold the highest standards of business 

ethics and integrity. Severe disciplinary actions will be 

taken in the event of any breach or non-compliance.

Risks 

The Group’s operations are assessed for risks related to 

corruption as part of the Enterprise Risk Management 

framework. In addition, the Group’s R&amp;A function and 

IA collaborate closely to examine potential corrupt 

practices in the planning and conduct of their reviews. 

The significant corruption-related risks as identified 

relate primarily to using third-party suppliers and 

intermediaries, corruption by employees, and gifts, 

hospitality, donations and sponsorships to business 

partners and public officials.

 

Conflict of Interest 

Our Conflict of Interest policy provides guidance 

on the different types of conflicts, ranging from 

financial interest to employee relationships. All 

relevant employees are required to submit an annual 

declaration of conflict of interest. All declarations are 

subject to review by management, and employees are 

to comply with the recommended actions to address 

any conflict. 

Gifts and Hospitality 

The Group has a Gifts and Hospitality policy, setting out 

clear guidelines and principles on the giving and receipt 

of gifts and hospitality items. This includes charitable 

donations and sponsorships, where recipients are 

reviewed and subject to appropriate due diligence 

before approval by senior management. 

Intermediaries 

The appointment and re-engagement of intermediaries 

are governed by formal policy and procedures that 

entail a risk-based and thorough due diligence review 

process supported by independent, established service 

providers. The due diligence process includes (a) 

onboarding and ongoing screening against sanctions

with our anti-bribery and corruption policy and clauses 

as part of the terms and conditions of the agreement. 

In addition, intermediaries are subject to due diligence 

checks by established, independent third-party service 

providers prior to and post appointment.

EXPORT CONTROL

Our Export Control Policy aims to ensure that all our 

exports are kept out of the hands of unauthorised users 

and not used for unauthorised purposes. 

ST Engineering is committed to complying with all 

applicable laws, regulations, trade sanctions and 

embargoes (collectively referred to as “Export Control 

Regimes”) governing the export of goods, services, 

software, technology and information (“Controlled 

Items”) of all jurisdictions the Group operates in. 

ST Engineering is also committed to taking steps to 

ensure that transactions undertaken by any party 

operating on behalf of the Group, including agents, 

distributors, and resellers, comply with applicable 

Export Control Regimes. Strict adherence to this policy 

is required, except to the extent that a more stringent 

local law applies. 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The Group has in place a Regulatory Compliance 

Framework that proactively identifies applicable 

Export Control Regimes, and embeds compliance 

into the day-to-day business processes, namely 

commodities classification, screening of customers 

or end-users, end-use destinations, purposes, record 

keeping and tracking of Controlled Items. 

Compliance with Export Control Regimes is facilitated 

by the Group’s Export Control Support structure that  

is staffed by Export Control Officers who are  

appointed at the Group, regional, country and Line  

of Business levels. 

Regular awareness-level export compliance training 

is provided for all relevant employees, and targeted 

training for employees whose job functions entail 

greater involvement with Controlled Items. 

In the event of potential or actual violations, immediate 

reporting, decision-making and corrective measures 

are to be carried out under the supervision of senior 

management and the EXCO. Significant violations are 

reported to the Risk and Sustainability Committee, 

where lessons learnt are distilled and shared.

Employees may also utilise the reporting channels 

found in our website to report potential violations of 

Export Control Regimes.
