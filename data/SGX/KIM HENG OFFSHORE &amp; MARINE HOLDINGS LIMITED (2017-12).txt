SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017





Board Statement

The Board of Directors at Kim Heng Offshore and Marine 

Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (“Kim Heng” or 

the “Group”) are pleased to present the inaugural 

sustainability report of the Group. The board recognises 

that one of the keys to building a sustainable business 

involves finding a balance between addressing its 

business needs and the needs of the society and the 

environment in which the Group operates. The Board 

strongly believes that to grow sustainably as a forward-

looking corporate entity, the Group has to regularly 

reach out and work together with all its stakeholders, 

from its employees to the community, and be responsible 

stewards of its natural environment.  

About this Report

This is the inaugural sustainability report of Kim Heng 

and covers data and information from January 2017 – 31 

December 2017 for our Singapore operations. The report 

is organized and presented in reference to the Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and will be published on 

an annual basis going forward. 

The GRI Index at the end of this report sets out the relevant 

indicators and where information of such standards can be 

found. As this is our first sustainability report, we have not 

obtained any independent assurance of the information 

being reported, but may consider doing so as our reporting 

processes mature in the future. 

A soft copy of this report can be found on our website at 

www.kimheng.com.sg. Please reach out to our sustainability 

team at jocelyn.tan@kimheng.com.sg with any comments 

or questions.

Our Sustainability Approach

At Kim Heng, we aim to be the choice provider in the oil and gas industry and to be able to serve our customers with the 

finest integrated solutions and first class customer service. 

Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) has been an important part of the Group’s business philosophy, and is thus a key consideration 

in the Group’s daily operations. When doing business, be it launching a new service or working with partners, the Group 

always considers the socioeconomic aspect, as well as the environmental impact that any of our actions may have on the 

broader community. It is the Group’s view that a socially responsible business is a business that is valued by the community 

and all its stakeholders.

Sustainability Governance

Sustainability is governed right from the different business functions all the way to the top. Different departments such as 

Corporate Services, Health and Safety, etc. report on respective sustainability areas to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and 

these are further reported to the board for oversight. More details of our corporate governance practices can be found in the 

Corporate Governance Report in the Annual Report 2017.

Materiality Assessment

Materiality is a critical input into our corporate sustainability 

strategy because it ensures that we provide our stakeholders 

with the sustainability information most relevant to them and 

our business. In 2017, we completed materiality assessment 

for the entire Group. 

The process included interviews with internal stakeholders 

such as employees and management and internal workshops, 

to identify the most important sustainability issues. We will 

continue to examine our material issues periodically and will 

work to strengthen our internal sustainability management 

framework, processes and procedures.

From our assessment we identified 6 material topics and 

have divided them across three key pillars – Environmental, 

Social and Economic.

Environmental

Resource Management 

 

Why it is material

Our operations consume electricity and marine gas oil. 

Our shipyards and vessels also generate waste through the 

fabrication of the offshore platforms and the building and 

repairing of vessels. The ballast water that is discharged 

by our vessels may also impact the biodiversity of the 

waters. Such natural resource dependence increases our 

environmental impact.

Management Approach

Kim Heng actively reiterates to its workforce the significance 

of environmental conservation. The Group actively monitors 

operations and processes to avoid potential sources of waste 

and leakages. 

We have incorporated energy conservation measures in our 

standard operating procedures throughout the entire Group. 

We also follow best practices such as switching off our air-

conditioning units and electricity during non-working hours. 

Our vessels follow the Ship Energy Efficiency Management 

Plan (SEEMP), which is a tool introduced by International 

Maritime Organisation (IMO) to improve energy efficiency 

of a ship.

Our vessels have been surveyed in accordance to MARPOL 

Annex VI Regulations for the prevention of air pollution from 

ship and comply with the applicable requirement.

The recent International Convention for the Control and 

Management of Ship’s Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM 

Convention), requires all ships to implement a ballast water 

management plan where, inter alia, the ships are required 

to monitor and manage their ballast water discharge. Our 

Ballast Water Management Plan entered into force on 8 

September 2017. Our vessels above 400 gross tonnage have 

the approved BWM plan on board.

At our office and shipyard, we have been harvesting and 

reusing rainwater for our operations.

Kim Heng has strict waste management procedures and 

guidelines that have been developed with reference to 

local and international standards. Our vessels follow the 

MARPOL Annex V – Regulations for Prevention of Pollution 

by Garbage guidelines.

We have a risk management committee to monitor any 

risks of non-compliance in our operations and ensure that 

we adhere to environmental laws and regulations pertaining 

to our industry. In this regard, third party advisors will be 

considered and used where the Audit &amp; Risk Committee 

(“ARC”) deems it necessary.

Performance Indicators

1. Enhance data collection and include the fuel consumption 

of our vessels. 

2. Maintain compliance with the BWM convention. 

3. Increase cleaner energy use by exploring the possibility of 

installing solar panels and LED lights instalment for our 

operations.

4. Maintain compliance with environmental regulations.

5. Reduce our energy, water and waste by 2% within 5 

years.

Social

Health and Safety 

Why it is material

We recognise that the health and safety of our on-site 

workers and vessel crew can be at risk given the nature of 

their work. Ensuring that our staff are safe at work is our top 

most priority. 

Management Approach

The Group adheres to the best-in-class health &amp; safety 

standards to ensure that the necessary safety measures 

are implemented across the organization. We have in 

place a health, safety and environment (“HSE”) policy and 

department to carry out and monitor HSE related issues for 

the shipyard and vessels. We have appointed key safety 

and compliance officers across the different levels of the 

organization, as well as outlined the key requirements 

and attainment of relevant certifications. On top of our 

own stringent risk mitigation measures, comprehensive 

risk assessments are also carried out by external bodies 

on a regular basis to ensure that all areas of safety are in 

check. Doing so allows us to remain confident that we have 

reduced the risks of accidents, injuries, or illnesses to our 

employees and the local community.

Performance 

As a result of our commitment to our employees’ health 

and safety within our organization and processes, we 

obtained OHSAS 18001:2007 certification. Following this, 

comprehensive risk assessments are then carried out by 

external bodies on a regular basis to ensure all areas of 

safety are in check. 

Additionally, we have achieved the following certifications: 

• BizSafe level 3 

• BIZSAFE STAR

• ISO 22:000

• ISPS and ISM certified shipyard - International Ship and 

Port Security and International Safety Management code

• Our vessels carry medical supplies and equipment as per 

International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and World 

Health Organisation (WHO) conventions

Performance

Through our efforts, we have obtained ISO 9001: 2008, 

ISO 14001: 2004 certificates. We are also proud to have 

zero reported incidents on environmental non-compliance 

in 2017. Our energy, water and waste footprint is shown 

below.

Notes:

1. Injury rate* = (Number of injury x 200,000)/Number of 

hours worked

2. Lost day rate* = (Number of lost days due to injury x 

200,000)/Number of hours scheduled to be worked

3. Absentee rate (%) = Total days lost due to absenteeism/

Total days scheduled to be worked

- Employees include all permanent and temporary 

contracted staff

- Workers include sub-contracted staff

* - These rates are computed using a standardized base rate 

known as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 

(OSHA) Recordable Incident Rate, whereby the injury rate 

or lost day rate is calculated by multiplying the number of 

recordable cases by 200,000 and then dividing that number 

by the number of labour hours at the company.

Performance Indicators

1. Continue to lower injury rate

2. Increase safety training and awareness

3. Maintain zero workplace fatalities

Why it is material

Our employees are the greatest asset at Kim Heng and 

because of them we are able to continuously achieve 

success. It is crucial for us to retain our staff and we can 

do that only if we care for their development, provide them 

benefits and fair working conditions.

Management Approach

Fair working conditions

We aim to provide diverse and equal opportunities to all 

our employees at Kim Heng. We do not judge our potential 

employee candidates based on their gender, race, religion 

or nationality. Instead we assess shortlisted candidates’ 

based on qualification, relevant experience, skills and 

knowledge. We do not tolerate any form of grievance 

against our employees. Our staff are welcome to speak to 

their immediate superior should they have any grievances. 

Depending on the gravity of the issue, it will be solved by 

the superior or elevated to HR/management if it is assessed 

to be of greater severity. 

Training and development 

We are aware of the continuous advancement of skills sets in 

our operations. In order to continuously serve our customers 

with the finest integrated solutions and first-class service, we 

have provided specific training for specific job scopes such 

as Construction Safety Orientation Course (CSOC) for crane 

operators, Shipyard Safety Instruction Course (SSIC) for 

shipyard workers, and Basic Offshore Safety Induction and 

Emergency Training (BOSIET) for workers going for offshore 

projects.

We also provide internship opportunities to instil knowledge 

and skills to the younger generation and form a base of new 

talent.

Employee benefits

We comply with Ministry of Manpower (MOM’s) mandatory 

requirement for employee benefits but also provide 

competitive compensation compared to internal salary 

equity and external sources of the industry standards.

We seek to comply with our employees’ requests and 

consider transferring staff to other departments or another 

entity of the Company in order retain staff should the 

position be made redundant. This will be based on the 

relevance of their knowledge and skill set. 

Performance

Through our policies and various awareness programmes, 

we are pleased to have zero cases of employee grievances 

for 2017. Our headcount has continued to grow as we seek 

to acquire skills to support our business operations. The 

overall number of new hires in 2017 was 108 employees 

and we had a total of 82 resignations for the Group.

Economic

Ethics and Anti-corruption

Why it is material

We recognise that our industry is sensitive in the area of 

ethics and corruption. Any such issues can lead to significant 

reputational damage, legal consequences and loss of 

customers to our business. 

Management Approach

Kim Heng has no tolerance for bribery and corruption 

in its business. We strive to achieve the highest levels of 

corporate ethics and transparency through sound corporate 

governance and appropriate internal controls. 

We have developed an anti-bribery and corruption (“ABC”) 

policy to provide guidance to all management and staff 

in the mitigation of the risk consistently with regulatory 

requirements and marketplace expectations. 

We provide our staff with multiple platforms to report on 

anti-corruption and bribery if they feel that there are any 

potential incidents and any matters that arise are directly 

communicated to senior management. 

Performance

Our employees are briefed and have received communication 

and training on Kim Heng’s policy against anti-corruption 

and bribery.  There have been no cases of anti-corruption 

and bribery at Kim Heng. However, we have to remain 

vigilant and constantly monitor our operations by instilling 

strong values on anti-corruption and bribery to the Group. 

Future Outlook

We are in the process of including in our hiring policy that 

all new hires will be provided with an orientation handbook 

on anti-corruption and bribery. Subsequently, all new hires 

will be briefed on our policies on anti-corruption and 

bribery using our corporate video. The new hires will also 

be required to acknowledge the ABC policy. Furthermore, 

we aim to provide our employees with workshops on anti-

corruption and bribery on an annual basis and circulate 

regular handouts via emails.

 Regulatory Compliance

Why it is material

Kim Heng is governed by a number of laws and regulations 

in the social and economic area and any breach can result in 

significant legal fines as well as reputation damage.

Management Approach

Our employees are briefed with the management’s policy 

of non-compliance with social and environmental laws. Our 

code of ethics clearly states that Kim Heng adheres to all 

legal standards on dealing in securities, contracts and any 

other provisions and that we abide by all governing laws and 

regulations, both domestic and international.

Performance

We have not received any monetary fines, non-monetary 

sanctions, or have any open cases on social and economic 

non-compliance in FY2017. The Group is constantly vigilant 

to any non-compliance issues that may be non-compliant 

within our operations. 

Future Outlook

Our mission is to ensure that we maintain our track record 

of having no cases on social and economic non-compliance 

in our operations.

Financial Stability

Why it is material

Our industry is going through a cyclical downturn and 

maintaining financial stability is crucial to stay in business 

and serve our stakeholders. 

Management Approach

We strive to maintain our financial performance, particularly 

by improving our cash flows and lowering our credit risk.

Performance

In FY2017, the Group reported a net loss of S$15.3 million. 

This included an S$3.6 million one off non-cash impairment 

loss due to the write-down of some assets.  Excluding the 

assets impairment loss, the Group would have reported a 

net loss of S$11.7 million and a negative EBITDA of S$2.7 

million.

Future Outlook

As oil prices recently rallied to SGD 70 per barrel, we expect 

oil exploration and development spending by oil majors 

to slowly improve which will gradually lift the demand 

for the offshore and marine industry.  We believe we are 

well positioned for the eventual upturn in the oil industry 

to secure more jobs and contracts in the region. Barring 

unforeseen circumstances, the Group is cautiously optimistic 

that the financial performance may improve in the next 

twelve months.
