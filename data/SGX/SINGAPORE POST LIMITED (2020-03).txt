As we forge ahead with the 

strategic transformation of 

Singapore's evolving urban 

urban logistics and eCommerce 

landscape, the Board remains 

committed towards driving 

sustainability throughout the 

business, and creating long-

term value for our stakeholders. 

We believe that responsible 

corporate stewardship is integral 

to the organisation, and we 

remain focused on managing 

the Environmental, Social and 

Governance (“ESG”) facets of our 

business and operations towards 

the highest standards in our 

sustainability journey.

Over the financial year, 

SingPost continued to step up 

in our sustainability efforts on       

multiple fronts.

We conduct our business in 

accordance to the highest ethical 

standards and have rolled out 

a new Anti-Money Laundering 

and Countering the Financing of 

Terrorism Policy, as well as due 

diligence and compliance controls 

across the Group this year. As 

part of responsible supply chain 

management, we commenced 

on-site assessments for selected 

suppliers via a risk-based 

approach to ensure adherence to 

our Supplier Code of Conduct. We 

also embarked on social initiatives 

such as MyPostman to encourage 

communities to get to know their                 

neighbourhood postmen. 























































































































































































BOARD STATEMENT 

On the environmental front, we 

replaced lights at SingPost Centre, 

Regional eCommerce Logistics 

Hub and Kallang Delivery Base 

with LED lamps, which would 

generate energy savings of 

10,458,679 kWh – equivalent of 

powering up 5,909 units of 4-room 

HDB flats annually, and continued 

to explore various green initiatives. 

In our community-support efforts, 

we introduced the Blessings in a 

Box campaign to drive donations 

of health essentials for the elderly 

in need, and continued to run 

Postman Home Visits and the Food 

Distribution Initiative to help the 

underprivileged in our community. 

In the fourth quarter of the 

financial year, the COVID-19 

pandemic swept across the globe. 

Like many other organisations, 

the Group faced extraordinary 

challenges. Air freight disruptions 

interrupted cross-border 

fulfilment and international 

deliveries, with trickle-down 

effects for last-mile deliveries.   

We also faced a sudden manpower 

shortfall as a result of quarantine 

cases and lockdowns, and had 

to activate contingency plans 

overnight to ensure the continuity 

of mail operations. In response to 

the onset of these challenges, a 

multi-divisional SingPost COVID-19 

Task Force was formed in March 

2020 to tackle the challenges 

ahead. Various measures were put 

in place to safeguard the well-

being of our stakeholders. 

Even as the post COVID-19 world 

continues to pose challenges, 

SingPost will strive to improve our 

sustainability efforts and continue 

to have the Board oversee the 

strategic management of the 

sustainability-related risks and 

opportunities of the ESG matters 

of the Company. We thank all our 

stakeholders for their unwavering 

support during this trying period 

and seek their continual support, 

as we continue to battle against 

this pandemic together.

Conversations with our 

stakeholders help us align our 

priorities with the matters that 

affect them most. 

The Group has put in place 

practices that enable regular 

communication and engagement 

with stakeholders, so as to 

understand and address their 

needs and interests. 

Formal materiality assessment 

conversations with internal and 

external stakeholders were 

conducted from FY2017/18 to    

FY2018/19 to identify ESG topics 

that matter to them. The results 

SingPost defines material ESG matters as topics that reflect our significant ESG impacts and will substantially 

influence the decision-making process of our stakeholders. The following presents a summary of our 

materiality process.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT





2017/18

2018/19

A comprehensive list of potential material 

sustainability matter was drawn up, taking into 

account insights from internal stakeholder 

engagement (including consideration of the 

interests and concerns of external stakeholders), 

and benchmarking of industry peers’ and key 

customers’ ESG factors. Cross-functional 

interviews and focus group discussions were 

conducted with the management to refine the list 

of potential material sustainability matters.

Materiality assessment workshops were 

conducted with the management, followed 

by an anonymous electronic voting exercise 

by the management on 24 potential material 

sustainability matters.

The results were plotted on a materiality matrix 

that displays each matter’s position relative 

to the degree of impact to both internal and 

external stakeholders.

A total of six key material sustainability matters 

were selected by top management for reporting.

The result were presented to the Board for 

validation and approval.

External Stakeholder Engagement

We connected with several investors, customers and the 

trade union for their inputs on the sustainability matters 

that are important to them in their capacity as an external 

stakeholder of SingPost.

Their inputs resulted in two new material ESG matters for 

reporting.

The new list of sustainability matters was presented to the 

Board for validation and approval.

In subsequent reporting periods, reviews will be done to 

ensure continued relevance to SingPost’s business and 

operations.

matters, which remain relevant for reporting.

ENROUTE TO CARBON-VOYAGE 

 

Climate change has widespread consequences on the planet. We recognise the responsibilities 

corporations must bear in tackling climate change and the importance of rethinking the way we operate, 

all with the eventual aim of putting an end to the carbon-intensive business-as-usual.

OUR CHANGE MAKERS

Environment Committee

• Made up of representatives 

from operating units across the 

Group, the committee oversees 

environmental stewardship 

in the Group. Fuel and energy 

consumption are managed 

and monitored by the various 

operating units such as the 

conveyance and delivery teams 

in Post &amp; Parcel, Famous 

Holdings and by the Property 

division.

OUR TARGETS

OUR MANAGEMENT TOOLS

Environmental Policy

• The policy articulates our 

primary environmental 

objectives which focus on 

operational, fleet and building 

efficiency and stakeholder 

collaboration. 

 4Baseline level has been adjusted from FY2017/18 to FY2018/19 to reflect the 100% operational scope.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

We think about how we can change the way we operate in a world of climate change. As the scale of 

our operations grow, it is inherent that without actionable interventions, our carbon footprint will grow 

too. This accounts for why we are working on an environmental blueprint to operationalise change.  

We look forward to sharing this blueprint in future reporting periods.

Our Environmental Policy articulates our primary environmental objectives and commitments around 

four thrusts:

Aligning with global and local ambitions to reduce GHG emissions, we set a long-term target of 

35% reduction in our absolute GHG emissions from FY2018/19 baseline level4  by FY2029/30. In 

FY2019/20, we continue to collaborate with stakeholders and drive initiatives that aim to improve our 

environmental performance.

Stakeholders

Building efficiency

We aim to work closely with 

our investors, customers,

and regulators to establish 

environmentally sustainable 

and responsible business 

practices.

We commit to base 

our operations on key 

principles of international 

environmental management 

system standards and 

achieve resource efficiency 

through the optimisation of 

resources in our value chain.

We aim to apply innovative 

solutions that optimise and 

upgrade our fleets, reduce 

mileage, explore alternative 

fuel-saving options and 

implement initiatives to 

reduce delivery trips.

We are dedicated towards 

energy efficiency in our 

sites and facilities, utilising 

alternative energy sources in 

place of grid electricity, and 

progressively refurbishing 

outdated infrastructure.

KEY ACTIVITIES IN FY2019/20

Light-emitting diode (“LED”) fittings

Lights at SingPost Centre, Regional eCommerce Logistics Hub and Kallang Delivery Base 

have been replaced with LED lamps, which is projected to achieve estimated energy savings of 

10,458,679 kWh – the equivalent of powering up 2,576 four-room HDB flats in Singapore in a year, 

or, 30% in energy savings compared to the last financial year.

Waste management

ReCYCLE is a nationwide e-waste recycling initiative with our partner Singapore 

Telecommunications Limited (“Singtel”). Unwanted electronic devices can be dropped off into the 

ReCYCLE bins at selected Singtel Shop and Singtel Exclusive Retailer outlets and post offices, 

as well as other partner locations. All locations are listed on recycle.sg. Alternatively, members 

of the public can also ask for a ReCYCLE envelope from any Singtel Shop and Singtel Exclusive 

Retailer outlets, and Post Offices, and mail their unwanted mobile device and accessories at no 

charge as postage is waived. The programme collected 22,340 kg of e-waste in FY2019/20 from 61 

collection points island-wide. This is an increase of 42% from the previous year. 

Raising awareness

Every individual in SingPost can play their part in reducing their environmental footprint. We 

continually engage our employees through an array of communication tools and events such as 

Earth Hour to instill a shared sense of responsibility towards the environment. SingPost has been 

supporting Earth Hour since 2013 and in March 2020, the SingPost Centre switched off all facade 

lights and non-essential lighting for an hour as a show of commitment to our planet.

Installation of solar photovoltaic (“PV”) systems

These power systems are designed to supply usable solar power by means of solar panels. 

While we have invited tenders for our two larger buildings, Singapore Post Centre and Regional 

eCommerce Logistics Hub, this project is currently under evaluation and further planning.

Pilot test on electric vehicles (“EV”)

SingPost is currently exploring to pilot the use of Electric Vehicles (“EV”) as a more sustainable 

alternative to our current fleet of logistics. Our pilot trial has been put on hold in light of the 

COVID-19 situation.

Chiller upgrading

Chiller systems, which provide ventilation and air-conditioning, make up a significant portion of 

energy consumption within a building. We are currently assessing our chiller perfomance ratings 

and working with vendors to maintain equipment efficiency, and we are exploring chiller upgrades. 

Automatic lighting system

We are exploring the feasibility of implementing an automatic lights-off system after working 

hours for certain areas in our buildings.

Electricity is utilised for our leased spaces 

and properties owned or under SingPost’s 

operational control. Our two largest 

buildings are the Regional eCommerce 

Logistics Hub, an automated parcel sorting 

and warehousing facility, and SingPost 

Centre. In FY2019/20, our total energy 

indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions decreased 

by approximately 6% from FY2018/19, mainly 

attributable to our Logistics segment. This 

mainly relates to the closure of a warehouse 

and post office in the third and fourth 

quarters of FY2018/19 respectively, as well 

as a result of the installation of energy-

efficient LED light fittings at the Regional 

eCommerce Logistics Hub.

Across our business operations, we utilise 

motor gasoline and diesel oil for vehicles 

and equipment. A significant portion relates 

to fuel consumption of our own fleet and 

leased vehicles. In FY2019/20, there was a 

slight decrease in our total direct (Scope 

1) GHG emissions by approximately 3% 

from FY2018/19, mainly attributable to our 

Logistics segment. This relates to a slight 

reduction in cargo volume in our freight 

forwarding business, due in part to the 

global trade slowdown and the impact of the 

international COVID-19 pandemic.

We believe that SingPost will only succeed when our employees do – which is why we invest in shaping our 

workforce to be one that is future-fit. PRIDE, our people strategy, encompasses five objectives - all of which are 

integral to transforming the way we work and sustainable in a changing world.

As we continue on our transformation journey, it is important for us to develop a learning organisation by 

balancing the needs of today while future-proofing for tomorrow. We have taken a number of steps in 

this direction.

SingPost was one of the first few unionised companies in the Trade and Connectivity sector to seal our commitment 

to reskilling of our workers, through the formation of the Company Training Committee (“CTC”) in partnership with 

the Union of Telecoms Employees of Singapore (“UTES”). Within the first 6 months of its inception, more than 

500 front-line team members have received training relevant to their roles, aimed at increasing their digital 

readiness, productivity and service quality. Our goal is to train close to 1,500 staff over 3 years.

As a signatory to the Employers’ Pledge of Fair Employment Practices by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair &amp; 

Progressive Employment Practices (“TAFEP”), we strive to adopt fair and progressive practices on employment. 

From recruitment to development and the reward of our talents, meritocracy is one of the key values we uphold 

at SingPost.

We invest in developing our people and accompany them through their career journeys.

We offer our people a workplace built on trust and mutual respect.

Best Ambassador of the Year (“BAOY”) is SingPost’s annual 

award event held in October on World Post Day as we recognise 

exemplary members of our SingPost family who consistently 

demonstrate our Core Values, delight and positively impact our 

customers. In 2019, 24 staff across frontline and support units 

were given awards across 15 categories.

At SingPost, we pride ourselves as postal ambassadors, 

serving our customers with pride and confidence as we connect 

communities. In celebration of World Post Day on 9 October 2019, 

we launched a brand new set of uniforms for our frontline staff at 

our post offices and philatelic stores.

Workforce Skills Qualifications (“WSQ”) Professional Image &amp; 

Etiquette trainings were also provided for effective communication. 

The launch of our new uniforms for frontliners formed the 

‘hardware’ component while the training formed the ‘software’ soft 

skills component of our initiative to improve customer service standards. Together, they aimed to equip 

our staff to deliver an exemplary customer experience across the 56 post office touchpoints in Singapore. 

For more information on the WSQ training, please refer to the section on ‘Customer Satisfaction’.

fulfil their mission - we have to do 

the job and do it nicely and I cannot 

let down our senders." 

Mr James Wee, 60, has been delivering mail at an estate in Yishun for 7 years, covering 15 blocks 

and over 2,000 units each day. He recently emerged as one of five highest rated postmen10, which he

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS

Non-compliance to our legal and 

regulatory requirements may 

result in direct legal consequences 

that undermine our capability and 

reputation. To that end, we have 

in place a strong framework of 

policies, processes and procedures 

that serve to guard SingPost 

against such potential incidences. 

We regularly monitor, evaluate and 

audit our key business activities for 

continual improvement. 

BEING COMPLIANT IS OUR FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS

To strengthen the effectiveness 

of the compliance function 

within SingPost Group, the 

Group Compliance Function 

was established to oversee 

and monitor the Compliance 

Risk Management and control 

systems. In tandem, the Group 

Compliance Charter (“GCC”) 

has been rolled out to define the 

scope of the Compliance Function 

and the methodology behind 

compliance risk management. To 

further strengthen compliance at 

SingPost, the Local Compliance 

Function (“LCF”)  and Privacy 

Liaison (“PL”) perform supporting 

roles towards the Group 

Compliance on compliance areas 

across the Group.











































































































































GOING BEYOND COMPLIANCE

IMDA regulates and assesses

SingPost’s postal performance by

setting Quality of Service (“QoS”)

standards for letter deliveries. 

For the period of January to 

December 2019, SingPost met all QoS 

standards for the delivery of Local 

and International Basic Letters, but 

marginally failed to meet its QoS 

standard for “100% of Local Registered 

Letters to be delivered by the second 

working day” with the late delivery of 

four registered letters and a case of 

a misplaced registered letter, all of 

which occurred largely in the first half 

of the year before service improvement 

measures were implemented.

 

SingPost achieved 98.81% in January 

2019, and 99.63% in March, May, June 

and July 2019.

SAFEGUARDING A DIGITAL WORLD

         Data Security and Privacy

We live in a digital age. As data grows, so do the risks. Cyberattacks, data fraud and theft continue to

IT IS IMPORTANT TO US 

THAT WE MANAGE RISKS 

THAT MAY COMPROMISE 

OUR VALUES AND 

INDEPENDENCE

SingPost’s Code of Ethics 

describes the importance of 

safeguarding sensitive and 

confidential information as an 

employee. Employees are expected 

to conduct themselves in a 

professional manner with utmost 

integrity and total commitment to 

the Code.

Our employees are required to 

disclose when/if they are placed 

in a conflict of interest that 

could potentially lead to such 

a situation. They are required 

to make declarations annually 

and to provide updates where 

appropriate. Guidelines relating 

to entertainment, receipt and 

offer of gifts are also established. 

Moreover, our employees are 

required to ensure that all 

business dealings and decisions 

are legitimately made for the 

interest of SingPost and are not 

conducted under any improper 

influence or advantage. We are 

currently developing new training 

materials on this topic, which will 

be rolled out in due course.

OUR STAKEHOLDERS ARE 

EMPOWERED TO DRIVE 

OUR ETHICAL CULTURE

Our Whistle-Blowing Policy sets 

out the guidelines under which our 

internal and external stakeholders 

are able to raise concerns about 

possible matters of improprieties 

or wrongdoings in confidence. All 

whistle-blowing reports received 

will be investigated promptly, 

professionally, fairly and honestly. 

Where appropriate, the matter will 

be escalated to the relevant law 

enforcement authorities for their 

investigation and further action. 

Findings from the investigations 

and the follow-up actions taken or 

to be taken will be reported to the 

SingPost Audit Committee.

To be aligned with our newly 

rolled out AML and CFT Policy, 

we conduct proper due diligence 

on any company that SingPost 

will be establishing a business 

relationship with or has an 

established business relationship 

that involves the transfer or 

receipt of funds. Any suspicious 

transaction or red flag that 

has been determined will be 

escalated to the Group Compliance 

immediately. Furthermore, as part 

of record-keeping, employees are 

obliged to maintain records of 

proper due diligence undertaken.

KEY ACTIVITIES IN 

FY2019/20

Establishing our Ethics 

Committee

The Ethics Committee was 

officially established in 

June 2019 to implement the 

revamped Code of Ethics. 

The Committee comprises 

the Group General Counsel 

as Chairman, the Group 

CFO and Group CHRO as 

members. The Terms of 

Reference of the Committee 

is to:

• Establish;

• Embed; and

• Provide governance 

oversight and 

management of ethical 

principles and values to 

guide the behaviour and 

conduct of all  employees 

of the company.

New Anti-Money 

Laundering and Countering 

the Financing of Terrorism 

Policy (“AML and CFT 

Policy”)

In March 2020, our AML 

and CFT Policy was rolled 

out. This policy aims to 

reduce the risk of money 

laundering and prevent 

sophisticated terrorist 

financial transactions that 

assist in funding criminal 

activities around the world. 

SingPost will only conduct 

businesses with customers, 

suppliers or vendors and 

third parties involved 

in legitimate business 

activities, and whose funds 

are derived from lawful and 

legal sources.

A CONCERTED EFFORT WHERE EVERY 

EMPLOYEE IS AWARE AND ACCOUNTABLE

GREAT EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON 

RESPECTING THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF

ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS

Our employees are consistently reminded on the 

importance of data security and privacy and the 

role they must play. We do this through regular 

communication and education awareness on these 

topics. In addition, all staff are required to go through 

mandatory PDPA Awareness Training via e-learning 

modules to be equipped with a good understanding of 

data protection and how it applies to the workplace. 

Prudent handling, processing, storage and usage 

of our stakeholders’ information in our systems’ 

infrastructure is important to us as significant 

failure of our controls may result in litigation, 

penalties and most importantly, undermine trust of 

our stakeholders. We do our utmost in minimising 

the risk of privacy breaches and data leakages. We 

have in place an escalation process for incident 

management, which ensure timely response, 

internally and externally, to minimise the impact. 

To ensure SingPost’s data privacy compliance in the 

markets we operate in, we have acquired the privacy 

management resources that allow us to:

• Conduct research and track latest privacy and 

data protection developments in markets where 

SingPost is operating in;

• Compare global privacy and data protection 

standards; and 

• Utilise available tools and templates for 

adaption and deployment.

DATA PRIVACY

















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































DATA SECURITY

STRENGTHENING DATA INTEGRITY AND PROTECTION IS 

PARAMOUNT IN THE DIGITAL AGE

WE PUT OUR SYSTEMS TO THE TEST

Cybersecurity remains one 

of our top risk concerns. We 

are committed to protecting 

our customers’ personal data, 

building resilience in data security 

and improving our response to 

cyber threats. We are also focused 

on minimising any potential 

impact from cyber threats and 

recovery processes. 

As cyber threats evolve, SingPost will continuously build on cyber resilience and prepare its people to defend 

the business. We work with key stakeholders to deploy various means to monitor, measure our systems and 

stress-test our response across different scenarios. These include:

We have developed the 

Cybersecurity Framework and 

Group Information Security Policy 

as guiding principles and key 

controls to identify threats, protect, 

detect, respond to cyber-attacks 

and recover from incidents. As 

part of SingPost’s Enterprise Risk 

Management (“ERM”) Framework, 

our data security policies and 

manuals are communicated to 

all employees. These policies 

are reviewed yearly, and updated 

where necessary, to ensure 

continual relevance regulations 

and industry practices. 

 Audits

Cybersecurity ratings

Scenario-based exercises

We engage in rigorous internal and 

external audits on our information 

systems annually.

• We constantly review our 

Cybersecurity General Controls 

and identify areas to improve our 

security operations, with the help of 

Group Internal Audit. Scope of audit 

is reviewed annually following the 

organisation risk landscapes and to 

address any emerging threat.

• External consultants are engaged 

to assess and provide feedback on 

our Cybersecurity readiness. Its 

cybersecurity subject matter experts 

have conducted stress-testing security 

controls of our critical systems and 

review their compliance to Group 

Policy and regulatory requirements.

We conduct reviews of the cybersecurity 

threat landscape, our security posture 

and identify new methods to improve our 

cybersecurity resilience.

• We engage Bitsight, a cybersecurity 

ratings company, for a data-driven 

measurement of our cybersecurity 

performance and monitor our ratings 

every quarter to keep it within 

our target range. Should ratings 

fall, we will take the necessary 

improvement actions based on 

the recommendations provided                 

by Bitsight.

• Internally, we continue to implement 

a comprehensive threat and 

vulnerability management program, 

strengthen our cybersecurity hygiene 

and further invest into layered   

defence capabilities.

• Cybersecurity cuts across entire 

Group businesses, we provide regular 

updates to senior management and 

risk committees to keep them updated 

on key development of Cybersecurity 

program as well as cyber threat 

landscapes and incidents in relation  

to the Group.

While we continue to strengthen our 

cybersecurity capabilities, we also focus 

on improving our people-process in 

effectively responding to cybersecurity 

incidents via regular exercise and 

awareness programs.

• We work with industry stakeholders 

such as IMDA to together conduct 

a tabletop exercise on a specific 

topic annually. The tabletop exercise 

conducted recently was on the topic 

of registered articles. One of the 

scenarios presented was a cyber-

attack where the ‘compromised’ IT 

system rendered the disablement of 

the mail tracking function, resulting 

in registered articles not being 

tracked but are still delivered to the 

end customer. The exercise helped 

business stakeholders to improve its 

business continuity processes in order 

to minimise the service impacts to  

our customers.

• We conduct annual Disaster Recovery 

exercises for critical information 

systems across the SingPost 

organisation. The exercise simulates 

various types of IT disaster situations, 

in order to stress test our data and IT 

system recovery processes.

• This year, we have conducted 

the annual security awareness 

e-learning programme for more than              

1,500 employees.

RISK MANAGEMENT IS A CONTINUOUS, ITERATIVE 

AND INTEGRATED PROCESS

WE ENSURE OPERATIONAL 

READINESS THROUGH BUSINESS 

CONTINUITY

Risks come in various forms and from different sources that 

may impact our business. Some risks can be eliminated, some 

may be accepted, some can be mitigated by transferring the 

risks or via action plans, and managed as part of our business 

model. Our risk management strategy involves assessing 

and balancing risk probabilities, preparing for reasonable 

contingencies while minimising precautionary expenditure or 

activity. We adopt a top-down as well as bottom-up approach. 

The Group’s Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") framework 

is modelled largely on ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management 

– Principles and Guidelines, and covers the key strategic, 

operational, financial, compliance and information technology 

risks facing the Group. The ERM framework is supported by 

appropriate risk policies, procedures and provides guidance 

to the Group’s various business units and support units on 

managing risks. More information on risk management 

and internal controls can be found in our Annual Report,          

pages 81 – 88.

Our Business Continuity Management 

Council with Business Continuity 

Management Framework serves to drive 

business continuity plan (“BCP”) efforts 

across the organisation, in order to ensure 

minimal disruptions of our operations 

and a quick recovery and continuation of 

critical business and operational functions. 

Systems are in place for our operations to 

respond to incidents, crises and threats 

when they occur. We have contingency 

response plans for a broad span of events 

including emergencies, pandemics and 

security threats, as well as other forms of 

disruptions that might occur in the course of 

our business and operations.

In addition to operational response 

plans, we have also set out processes to 

communicate to our stakeholders in an open 

manner. We communicate timely accounts 

of all incidents and the progress of the 

recovery efforts that are being carried out to 

our stakeholders. 

Our crisis management and communication 

plans are reviewed and refined regularly, as 

well as updated in our BCPs. In addition, all 

BCPs are periodically tested, documented 

and maintained. This enables us to respond 

to crises in an organised and efficient 

manner, and expedite recovery processes.

ANTICIPATING WHAT’S IN STORE

         Business Continuity Planning

Global risks are interconnected and ever-shifting. As such, it is vital for us to remain vigilant, enhance our 

readiness and continually build resilience. Prudent business continuity planning enables us to manage 

risks and establish mitigative measures to safeguard against disruptive impacts. This is necessary for 

quick recovery of our critical functions so that we can continue to deliver for our stakeholders.

DELIVERING IN THE TIME 

OF THE CORONAVIRUS

In the last quarter of FY2019/20, COVID-19 

dealt a heavy hand on the world and the 

global economy. Along with alarming 

international infection numbers, the 

immediate wave of city lockdowns swiftly 

grounded the world economy to a halt. 

The aviation industry became the earliest 

corporate casualty of the pandemic and 

SingPost immediately felt the ripple effects 

of flight and air freight disruptions, crippling 

crossborder fulfilment and international 

deliveries.

With deep dislocations across the global 

supply chain causing unprecedented depths 

of economic disruption, our agility and 

resilience is critical, now more than ever. 

Bracing for headwinds and as a stand of 

solidarity, wage adjustments were made 

across the SingPost Group management 

team. A multi-divisional SingPost COVID-19 

Task Force was also formed in March 2020 

to manage the impact of the pandemic. 

Immediate measures were put in place to 

safeguard the well-being of employees, 

customers, tenants and shoppers across 

all SingPost touchpoints – the SingPost 

headquarters, SingPost Centre office 

building and mall, the Regional eCommerce 

Logistics Hub, mail delivery bases and post 

offices islandwide.

Despite the strictest of measures that 

included donning on personal protection 

equipment (“PPE”), team segregation and 

social distancing, the inevitable happened 

on 27 March as three positive cases of 

COVID-19 were identified amongst our 

staff. Subsequently, two additional full-time 

SingPost employees working on the same 

floor were tested positive for COVID-19 

as well. The curve of SingPost infections 

levelled at ten employees. All employees 

have since recovered.

KEY ACTIVITIES IN FY2019/20

OUR RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

Health and safety of our stakeholders

• 

Measures included strict team segregation, working from home arrangements where possible, 

daily temperature checks, reminders on personal hygiene practices as well as travel and health 

declarations.

• 

For the safety and well-being of our staff as well as customers, SingPost also made changes to 

its delivery protocol, implementing contactless deliveries for Registered Services and parcels.

• 

One of the biggest challenges for the postal service was Malaysia’s Movement Control Order 

announced in mid-March. SingPost raced against time to secure hotel accommodation for some 

600 Malaysian team members who commute over the Causeway and Second Link daily within 

24 hours of the announcement. This move garnered mainstream media attention, showcasing 

SingPost as the bright example of providing good welfare for its Malaysian employees.

Impact on our deliveries during the onset of pandemic

• 

Manpower posed an immediate challenge as quarantine orders and stay-home-notices were 

instantly issued to staff who were in close contact with the infected employees. As a result, mail 

and parcel delivery were impacted, with delays of up to three working days. Nevertheless, we 

remained committed to our deliveries.

Commitment to deliver and help our tenants tide through this difficult period

• 

Albeit the reduction in the number of post offices operating islandwide, which was in line 

with the government’s recommendation to minimise staff numbers working on-site, SingPost 

remained steadfast to our delivery commitment during the Circuit Breaker period.

• 

As landlord of the SingPost Centre Mall, we dished out rental support initiatives to tide our mall 

tenants through this difficult time by waiving rent, obtaining property tax rebate reimbursement 

from the government, utilising of security deposits for rental payment, marketing support for 

food and beverage tenants and extending the car park’s grace period to support delivery drivers 

and food-order pick-ups.

A WORLD WITHOUT CHAINS

          Responsible Supply Chain

At SingPost, we want to connect the world sustainably, linking up with stakeholders across our value 

chain to build a sustainable future. We envisage a world where people are free from the chains of forced 

labour and modern slavery; where generations of tomorrow do not suffer from a degraded environment 

left behind by previous generations. As a crucial player in the global postal, logistics and e-commerce 

sectors, we too recognise our importance in shaping a responsible supply chain of our partners.

RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN

Our Group Procurement function continues to play a key role in the management of SingPost’s supply 

chain. The function oversees the Company’s sourcing and purchasing processes, as well as the 

establishment and implementation of provisions laid out in the Group Procurement Policy. The team 

works with business users and other stakeholders across departments to source and procure goods and 

services in the most cost-effective and timely manner, at the same time ensuring that the contractual 

terms and conditions for the procurement process comply with the standard terms of contract.

In FY2019/20, we engaged a total of 783 suppliers, which is a slight decrease of 2.85% from 

FY2018/2019. Our spending in FY2019/20 has likewise reduced – a reflection of the continuous 

management of bought-in goods and services. SingPost continues to leverage on its relationship 

with key suppliers, which have remained mostly unchanged. Representing 11% of the supplier base, 

spending on 88 suppliers had accounted for 80% of total spend in FY2019/20. While this illustrates 

an increase in the proportion of key suppliers from 8% of supplier base in FY2018/19, contracted 

spend with these suppliers continue to be optimised and kept within our financial budgets and fair, 

transparent appointment. With our economies of scale, SingPost continues to leverage on our buying 

power with our key suppliers.

RESPONSIBILITY STARTS FROM THE WAY WE MAKE DECISIONS

102-9



































The SingPost Purchasing Manual continues to set 

out the objectives, approach, key principles and 

procedures for the sourcing and acquisition of goods 

and services to support the Group’s immediate 

and strategic needs. The Procurement Policy 

and Purchasing Manual commit all directors and 

employees who are involved with the procurement of 

goods and services to follow the key principles of:

• Able to support operational needs;

• Uphold all regulatory and legal requirements;

• Accountable, transparent and auditable;

• Ethical;

• Environmentally- friendly;

• Able to uphold social responsibility;

• Economically viable;

• Capable of being managed from a risk perspective;

• Capable of being improved continuously, and

• Giving a fair and equitable treatment to vendors 

who are supplying the goods and services.

The Procurement Policy and Purchasing Manual were 

reviewed during the period of reporting to keep up to 

date with procurement’s best practices and the

postal and supply chain delivery landscape.

The Supplier Code of Conduct is an important element of our supplier management approach. The contents 

of our Supplier Code of Conduct are based on The Ten Principles of the United Nations (“UN”) Global Compact 

around Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. The Supplier Code of Conduct allows our 

values and principles to be embedded in our supply chain and addresses the following key 

sustainability agendas:

SUPPLIER

CODE OF

CONDUCT

It is necessary for our suppliers and partners to 

observe, work towards and adhere to our social and 

environmental agenda laid out in our Supplier Code of 

Conduct. As such, when entering into a contract with 

SingPost and accepting our Conditions of Contract, 

our suppliers would have been deemed to have 

accessed and are ready to comply with the Supplier 

Code of Conduct. Our Conditions of Contract further 

compels suppliers to comply with and support the 

provisions of the PDPA. 

We have in place a risk-based approach to assess 

and follow up on selected suppliers’ observation 

of our Supplier Code of Conduct. This approach 

identifies suppliers operating in industry segments 

with potential risks, which is especially useful in 

targeting high-risk suppliers. In general, on-site 

assessments conducted in FY2019/20 have confirmed 

that these suppliers adhere within the limits of 

our Supplier Code of Conduct and are aware of 

its importance. In view of our key sustainability 

agendas, health and safety of human capital is 

highly prioritised in the suppliers’ management 

of their operating environment. Suppliers have 

also exemplified their support for environmental 

protection through sustainable sourcing of raw 

materials such as the FSC® certified paper, 

and implementation of soy-based products that 

substitute traditional petroleum-based products. In 

FY2019/20, SingPost’s procurement team continues 

to actively explore suppliers who are able to provide 

alternative energy adoption, such as the use of 

electric vehicles for delivery.



EVERY DELIVERY COUNTS

          Customer Satisfaction

At SingPost, we strive to make every delivery count. Our customers must be more than just satisfied, and we 

do our utmost to deliver a positive experience in every engagement. From mailing to freight and to enterprise 

solutions, we go the extra mile and help our customers address their growing needs and concerns.

OUR TARGETS

Perpetual Target

FY2019/20 Progress and Performance

IMDA regulates SingPost’s performance 

by setting Quality of Service (“QoS”) 

standards for deliveries, and our targets 

are to meet or exceed these standards.

The Company is required to submit 

quarterly reports regarding its service 

quality to the IMDA. Monthly letter tests 

and audits are conducted by appointed 

independent assessors to measure 

these service standards and the results 

are submitted to the IMDA. IMDA 

announces the results of SingPost’s QoS 

performance each year. 

SingPost’s Postal QoS standards remain 

one of the most stringent in the world, 

with delivery standards of 100% for 

basic letters and registered letters 

posted by the second working day. 

For the period of January to 

December 2019, SingPost met all QoS 

standards for the delivery of Local 

and International Basic Letters, but 

marginally failed to meet its QoS 

standard for “100% of Local Registered 

Letters to be delivered by the second 

working day” with the late delivery of 

four registered letters and a case of 

a misplaced registered letter, all of 

which occurred largely in the first half 

of the year before service improvement 

measures were implemented.

 

SingPost achieved 98.81% in January 

2019, and 99.63% in March, May, June 

and July 2019.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

In December 2019, the Customer Experience (“CX”) team was formed to bring about synergy in the work related 

to customers’ experience, feedback and satisfaction, as well as optimise the resources within SingPost. The CX 

team consists of four main pillars – Service Quality and Training, Customer Insights, User Experience/Interface, 

and Service Excellence. With these four main pillars as the foundation of the CX team, the team strives to drive 

service enhancements via the customer’s perspective, working hand-in-hand with our co-drivers from the 

product, sales, operations and technology business units. With the aim of enhancing products, processes and 

systems which directly or indirectly contribute to the experience of our customers, SingPost developed our 

Customer Experience framework comprising the following key aspects:

1.  Exploring and understanding customers’ experience with SingPost

2.  Prioritising the action steps identified

3.  Creating and implementing ideas for change

4.  Evaluating the effectiveness of implementation

We believe that a commitment to quality service 

standards is integral to achieving overall customer 

satisfaction. As the designated Public Postal Licensee 

in Singapore, we are entrusted with the responsibility 

to provide top-grade services and meet the Quality of 

Service standards set by the IMDA.

The SingPost End-to-End Customer Touchpoints 

diagram illustrates the numerous solutions we 

provide at each step of the value chain, to cater to 

the unique needs of every customer. In particular for 

our eCommerce business, we provide EzyCommerce 

as an end-to-end solution that integrates the entire 

process of parcel shipments, storage, fulfillment and 

delivery on a cloud-based platform for eCommerce 

customers. Ezy2Ship is our online shipment

processes. All these solutions allow for increased 

flexibility and unlimited scale for the business 

customer, as well as free up time for businesses to 

focus on their own growth.

We have been connecting communities through postal delivery operations since Singapore’s founding years. 

We have 56 post offices offering over 100 services that cover both postal and non-postal services such as the 

collection of licenses and passports. Additionally, POPStations (Pick Own Parcel Stations) are installed at 

160 locations island-wide with a total of 10,996 lockers to allow for convenient self-collection or returning of 

parcels. Self-service automated machines (“SAM”), which started as kiosks operating beyond operating hours 

of our post offices allow individuals to pay bills, fines, top-ups, purchase stamps, weigh packages and more. 

Today, SAM extends beyond physical kiosks into multi-channels (e.g. web and mobile) to make our services 

accessible anytime and anywhere.

Customers First is an organisation-wide change management programme that aims for every individual in the 

company to always be fully committed to our customers. This programme focuses on developing a conscious 

mindset and behaviour for all employees through various training programmes such that service becomes 

second nature. For example, a significant number of our service ambassadors and branch managers are able to 

converse in languages and dialects fluently with elderly, bringing great warmth to the community that we serve 

every day.

Front-liners in our post offices undergo mandatory training to improve service quality and their professional 

image, attaining an average of 20 hours per staff annually. They are also required to pass regulatory screenings 

and background checks under relevant institutions such as the Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”), 

Official Secrets Act (“OSA”), and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”).

We also provide our employees with learning opportunities to build on their personal service skillset. Together 

with the Union of Telecoms Employees of Singapore (“UTES”), we formed a company training council (“CTC”) 

in the Trade and Connectivity sector. This is to enhance the capabilities, knowledge and skillset of postal 

services employees to better equip them for their roles in the evolving logistics and eCommerce landscape. The 

commitment was inked with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on 13 May 2019 in the presence 

of Secretary-General of the NTUC Ng Chee Meng. Over the next three years, more than 1,500 frontline postal 

team members will receive training relevant to their roles, aimed at increasing productivity and service quality 

through the embrace of technology and adoption of an increasingly customer-centric mindset. 

Our Workforce Skills Qualifications  

(“WSQ”) Professional Image 

and Etiquette for Effective 

Communications training 

course is mandatory for our 

Post Office Network (“PON”), 

Financial Services (“FS”) and 

Philately front-liners to drive 

SingPost’s overarching objective 

of strengthening skill-sets, 

embedding learning mindsets 

and supporting staff career 

growth. Employees are assigned 

online training modules and 

their progress are tracked. 

Mandatory online training 

modules include postal Dangerous 

Good Regulations (“DGR”),                    

ICA and PDPA.

We work with our service partners to design and curate training topics that inspire, equip and empower 

our front-liners to elevate their image, etiquette and professional presence from vision to action. Through 

experiential learning sessions, our employees acquire the skills to present themselves with greater confidence 

in their day-to-day interactions with our communities. To optimise learning, interactive activities have been 

planned for every training module and employees’ hands-on and e-learning progress are being tracked.

We launched an internal campaign, Every Delivery Counts, to instil pride 

and to develop a service excellence mentality in our staff across our 

postal operations. We also have in place defined metrics to measure 

and monitor Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) performance for our services. 

Training roadmaps and development programmes are implemented to 

upskill our employees’ competencies and to enable them to deliver the 

best service, such as Powerhour training workshops, Leadership Café, 

learning events and roadshows, and eLearning Modules on our learning 

management intranet.

SingPost eCommerce provides end-to-end solutions for our business customers to help businesses reach 

out to a global market. We work on demand-generation, such as admail, digital marketing, tryversting, front-

end development and website management, as well as the creation and management of stores on various 

online platforms. 

The SingPost Group offers seamless warehousing, fulfilment and shipping solutions both in Singapore and 

overseas, allowing business customers to take their business across borders. We leverage on OMS, WMS 

and TMS tools in order to provide visibility for our customers throughout the logistics supply chain.

Internally, we continue to enhance our logistics capabilities. To further enhance the tracking of parcel 

delivery, SingPost is currently building up a dashboard that allows a holistic view of our end-to-end 

operations and delivery services, as well as to generate trends, insights and projections on areas critical 

for planning and forecasting. The dashboard is also designed to measure manpower, equipment, safety 

incidents, delivery volume and fulfilment, and reviewing of Key Performance Indicators (“KPI”). In addition, 

we have embarked on our journey in creating a Fleet Management System (“FMS”), a digitalised

system that tracks our fleet of vehicles with map visualisation and application support. The FMS is also able 

to track the total number, condition and exact location of our vehicles, thereby facilitating the optimisation of 

fleet usage and timely maintenance required.

In addition to our hotline, feedback forms on our website, email and whistle-blowing channels, we have 

rolled out the web-chat function and AI chatbot on the corporate website in 2019. Our Customer Service 

team manages customer service issues and contact centre operations. The team strives to ensure all 

enquires are attended to and resolved. We follow a workflow procedure catered to respective feedback 

channels, where we aim to investigate all enquires within the day itself and respond with a solution by the 

next day, regardless of the enquirer’s geographical location.

Voice of Customer (“VOC”) surveys continue to measure annual business-to-business (“B2B”) customer 

experience over the lifetime of a corporate customer, and monthly business-to-consumer (“B2C”) customer 

experience over a specific event or transaction. We adopt the Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) methodology, a 

customer loyalty metric, as a way of quantification for our VOC surveys, the score of which is reported to the 

IMDA annually. SingPost has seen stark improvements in this aspect on a yearly basis. Service improvement 

efforts paid off towards the end of 2019. During the year-end peak season, SingPost delivered 25% more 

eCommerce items domestically than the preceding year, while achieving significant improvements in NPS 

for both delivery services and at the post offices. SingPost conducts frequent evaluations across all key 

customer touchpoints, and information outlining key operational metrics such as postal related issues and 

SAM machine downtime are consolidated and circulated to management monthly. In the coming years, we 

will be exploring options that will enhance our service reliance and performance.

2. Demand-generation: Driving revenue to our customers

3. Logistics Solutions: Taking your business across borders 

SingPost recognises the importance of efficiently managing internal logistics such as manpower, 

equipment, safety incident(s), delivery volume and fulfilment, and reviewing of KPIs. To measure our delivery 

performance, our Customer Experience Team works closely with Domestic Post Products Team to identify 

and evaluate issues faced by our customers. The team then implements systemic changes to capture the 

root causes, and kickstarts initiatives to close these gaps. 

We aim to bring out the best performance in every postman, through an incentive scheme that encourages 

and rewards our postmen in their daily delivery KPIs. Our ‘Postman of the Month’ programme aims to 

recognise exemplary postmen and to motivate good service.

We have increased customer touchpoints throughout the delivery process using digital tools such as the 

parcel Estimated Time of Arrival (“ETA”) software and other scanning applications, so that customers are 

able to track their deliveries and be informed of their parcel ETA.

DELIVERING VALUE TO OUR COMMUNITIES

          Community Investment

As SingPost seeks to be a good steward of our postal heritage and uplift the well-being of the disadvantaged 

in the community, we remain committed to the communities that we operate in. Beyond efforts that uphold 

the brand and perception of SingPost, we strive to bring improvement to the lives of disadvantaged individuals 

and families through mobilising our people, leveraging our competencies and fostering collaborations to bring 

about sustainable and positive outcomes.

KEY ACTIVITIES IN FY2019/20

MyPostman Campaign

The MyPostman campaign was launched nationwide in 

2019 to encourage Singapore residents to get to know 

their postmen better, and this is a bid to elevate SingPost’s 

service levels and strengthen the bond between residents 

and postmen. The concept behind this campaign lends its 

roots from Singapore’s kampong days, where residents 

were deeply acquainted with their postmen, with whom they 

interact daily whenever mail was delivered. Over the two-

month trial period that covered over 130,000 households 

served by 80 postmen, about 1,000 ratings were garnered, 

with an average score of 4.8 stars out of a maximum of 5, 

given to the postmen.

Excellence Service Awards  (“EXSA”) 2019 

SingPost frontline staff members have 

once again won the annual national award 

organised by the Association of Singapore 

Attractions and Enterprise Singapore. 

In 2019, a total of 18 post office team 

members received the EXSA Star awards, 

which is EXSA’s highest  award category.

Cai Niao – Best Partner in Customer Service ‘Double-11’ Award 2019

We are pleased to have clinched the Best Partner in Customer Service ‘Double-11” Award by 

Alibaba Cai Niao, for the second time in a row. This award recognises Alibaba’s Best Customer 

Service partners based on a set of stringent customer service criteria, such as the quality of 

responses, on-time replies and resolution rate. With this, we strive to continue to meet these 

standards and deliver good customer experience.

As part of the campaign, close to 2 million sets of fridge magnets were distributed in phases to 

every household and business unit across Singapore in 2019. The set of colourful fridge magnets 

contain information on MyPostman.sg, as well as a QR code that users scan using their mobile 

devices to access the website. On the website, they can key in their postal code to find out which 

postman is serving their area and can subsequently provide feedback, words of encouragement or 

rate the service they have received.

This campaign has received positive feedback from the residents, who have helped in boosting 

the morale of our workforce and bolster the pride they take in being part of the Singapore postal 

workforce. With the aim of humanising the postal service, we have fostered a community spirit and 

heightened the community’s appreciation for our postmen.

COMMUNITY INVESTMENT 

Having served the Singapore community for over 160 years, we are thankful for every opportunity we have in 

reaching out to the public. Our initiatives aim to support causes that are able to create shared value for our 

community, our people and the Company. Our community investment policy focuses on three strategic pillars 

that reflect our values and expertise – Preserving Heritage, Environmental Stewardship and Community 

Support. For more information on Environmental Stewardship, please refer to Page 12 of this report. 

With over 160 years of history, we have a 

responsibility to preserve Singapore's postal heritage 

for future generations even as we embrace innovation 

and transform our businesses for the digital age. 

SingPost is a long-time partner and supporter of 

the Singapore Philatelic Museum, funding heritage 

preservation and public education programmes   

since 1995.

We make use of national stamp launches to 

celebrate historical events and shared memories 

of yesteryear. In 2019, we celebrated the Singapore 

Bicentennial, which marks the 200th anniversary 

of Sir Stamford Raffles’ arrival in Singapore. The 

Singapore Bicentennial stamp issue was released 

on 22 June 2019. Designed by Singaporean 

animator and illustrator Lim An-Ling, the stamp set 

features a tapestry of Singapore’s rich and varied 

history, tracking Singapore’s story from settlement 

to nationhood,before ending with a vision of 

Singapore’s future.

In addition, the 2019 National Day Parade was a special one for SingPost, as it included a segment featuring 

organisations from the 1800s that contributed to the founding years of Singapore. The organising committee for 

“Our Bicentennial” segment of the parade featured eight floats, including one for SingPost. The vibrant SingPost 

float showcased various aspects of the company in its early days, giving parade-goers a glimpse into our past 

through mock-ups of a colonial letterbox, a mail ship and the old General Post Office. Our long-serving staff 

members Sim Boon Soo, Raja Aishah Raja Ariffin, Abdul Rahuman Mohd Ismail, Nancy Choo and Cynthia Low 

also represented SingPost during the parade, dressed in historical postal uniforms.

SingPost invests resources to 

drive initiatives that support and 

improve the well-being of our 

communities. 

SingPost shows appreciation 

especially to the generation who 

had built our Nation by looking 

out for the elderly while making 

deliveries and encourages the 

donation of health essentials to 

vulnerable seniors. We work with 

other corporates to deliver food to 

families in need as well.

We continuously engage our 

community partners for feedback 

of our initiatives so that we can 

keep them relevant and bring 

greater value to our communities.

Feedback forms are provided after 

the various community events. 

We also hold annual volunteer 

appreciation gatherings to build 

PRESERVING OUR HERITAGE 

SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES





camaraderie among volunteers, 

recognise their efforts and obtain 

feedback. We record output data 

of our initiatives in order to track 

our performance. For example, 

the frequencies and length of 

visits made by our postmen for 

the Postman Home Visit initiative 

as well as the food saved for the 

Food Distribution initiative, are all 

recorded.

On top of these, SingPost also 

works with partners on cash and 

in-kind sponsorships, donations, 

fund raising and other activities 

where we can render support to 

the community. We have been a 

partner of Community Chest’s 

employee payroll donation 

matching programme, SHARE, 

since 2004, and contributed over 

S$10,000 towards the programme 

for FY2019/20. SingPost has also 

been a major corporate sponsor of 

the Singapore Philatelic Museum 

since 1995. We too continue to 

support the annual UTES – U Care 

Bursary awards, contributing 

S$80,000 towards bursaries 

for 289 children, including 110 

children of our employees. In a 

collaboration with Mercy Relief, 

SingPost places donation tins 

in our post offices for public 

donations. Our support for Mercy 

Relief over the financial year saw a 

contribution of over $17,000. Other 

forms of support that SingPost 

provides to partners and charity 

organisations include stamp 

and venue sponsorships for our 

community partners’ events.

KEY ACTIVITIES IN FY2019/20

Food Distribution Initiative

Our Food Distribution Initiative, which has been running for 

11 years, taps on our delivery network to distribute unsold 

food from bakeries and hotels, to collection centres for 

seniors and families in need. In FY2019/20, the fleet collected 

and delivered approximately 20,640 buns and loaves of bread 

valued at an estimated $40,450. This helped to reduce food 

wastage and supported about 420 families weekly.

PROGRAMME SILVER

FY2019/20 marks the second year of Programme Silver – a community-support programme 

we launched in FY2018/19 that addresses issues arising from Singapore’s ageing population. 

Currently, the programme consists of the Postman Home Visit Initiative, technology-related 

workshops for seniors and dementia awareness training for our postmen. The Postman Home 

Visits and Seniors for Smart Nation courses were temporarily stopped in March 2020 amid the 

coronavirus outbreak.

Dementia Awareness Training

Locally, one in 10 people aged 60 and above may have dementia14 . Hence, dementia awareness 

training sessions are conducted for our frontline postal teams to equip them with the practical 

know-how to assist those who suffer from dementia or are lost in their neighbourhoods. This 

complements the Postman Home Visit Initiative, as elderly beneficiaries diagnosed with dementia 

are often more vulnerable and therefore require greater care and companionship.

Postman Home Visit Initiative 

In collaboration with social welfare organisations, postmen 

volunteers visit vulnerable or isolated elderly residing within 

their mail delivery beats13 weekly. Training is provided for 

the postmen prior to home visits. During their house calls, 

they make simple observations about the elderly, and fill in 

a checklist for the relevant social service agency servicing 

the area for them to understand the seniors' mental and 

physical well-being. Over time, they befriend them such that 

issues can be addressed quickly. 

Technology-related Workshops for Seniors

In partnership with People’s Association, we conducted 

workshops quarterly under PA’s Seniors for Smart Nation 

programme for the second year. Led by SingPost staff 

volunteers, these workshops are aimed at helping seniors 

navigate new technologies and services at our new-

generation Smart Post Offices to facilitate a more hassle-

free process. Besides teaching them how to perform 

postal and bill payment services on self-service automated 

machine ("SAM") kiosks, the workshops also teach them 

how to deliver or collect parcels using the POPStation, as 

well as how to recycle e-waste.

SingPost Community Day 

We collaborated with TOUCH Community Services to purchase, pack and distribute Care Packages 

for vulnerable elderly living in rental flats in Geylang Bahru. 81 staff and family members came 

together on 6 September 2019 to pack 450 Care Packages consisting of daily household essentials 

such as food, cooking  tissue and cleaning items. In total, we contributed over $10,000 for the 

packages, including over $3,000 raised through a staff donation drive.





Blessings in a Box

Blessings come in many forms, and one of the most 

important is that of good health. Financial constraints can 

hinder some seniors in Singapore from taking care of their 

health. Some of them may even have a lack of basic health 

essentials such as plasters, thermometers and toothpaste.

From November 2019 to January 2020, SingPost 

collaborated with TOUCH Community Services, Shopee and 

Saturday Club to launch Blessings in a Box. Through this 

initiative, we introduced a specially designed delivery box 

that can be reused by customers to donate health-related 

items to vulnerable seniors through TOUCH Community 

Services. Customers who receive their online purchases in 

these boxes can donate these items by packing them into the same box and dropping them off at 

POPStations for free. They were then delivered to TOUCH Community Services for distribution to 

the elderly. 

A limited number of these boxes were also sold at selected post offices for the general public. 

Besides the free processing and delivery, for every Blessings in a Box sold, SingPost donated $1 to 

TOUCH Community Services to aid vulnerable seniors under their care. In total, we received close 

to 200 boxes of donations.

SINGPOST’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19

As the pandemic unfolds, and 

people are kept physically 

distanced from each other, we 

understand how important it is 

for us to stay close to our loved 

ones. We have a responsibility 

to Singapore and our customers 

through our postal network, to 

ensure that mail and parcels 

keep moving – within Singapore 

and across the world. SingPost 

continues to connect communities 

during this trying period, and to 

lend a hand to those in need by 

collaborating on initiatives with 

various organisations.

Some of these efforts include the 

distribution of pamphlets for the 

collection of hand sanitisers to 

households under the Temasek 

Foundation’s BYOBclean initiative, 

as well as the shipping of 

donated items to the families 

STANDING IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS DURING THE PANDEMIC

of three migrant workers in 

Bangladesh and India together 

with ItsRainingRaincoats, a 

community initiative for migrant 

workers in Singapore. SingPost 

also collaborated with People’s 

Association on their Mask Sewn 

with Love initiative, where 

members of the public placed their 

hand-woven masks into blank 

envelopes with the initiative’s 

name and place them in any 

posting box islandwide. Postage 

fees were not only waived but 

storage and delivery of the masks 

as well.  

SingPost also delivers medicines 

and other medical supplies for 

the National University Hospital 

as well as Geylang, Toa Payoh 

and Hougang Polyclinics. With 

our cold-chain capabilities such 

as cold rooms and temperature-

controlled ice boxes, we hope this 

initiative not only gives patients a 

peace of mind while still getting 

their medication on time, but also 

alleviates the load of our frontline         

healthcare workers.

THE FUTURE OF POST

          Product and Service Innovation

Innovation is at the heart of SingPost’s transformation strategy as we enhance our adaptability and resilience 

in the face of a changing business landscape. We believe that innovation will boost productivity and efficiency 

within the organisation and bring about quality enhancements to our products and services.

HARNESSING THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN 

UNPARALLELED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

SingPost has significantly developed its eCommerce logistics offerings locally and 

regionally by developing new packaging products and solutions in response to the 

burgeoning eCommerce demand today. We have developed a state-of-the-art, fully 

automated parcel sorting and warehousing facility, fully equipped with mail-sorting 

equipment, at our Regional eCommerce Logistics Hub.

We also continually upgrade our post offices and self-service automated machines 

to offer better customer experience, and the POPStation network of smart parcel 

lockers was also rolled out throughout Singapore over the last few years. This 

year, we increased the number new Point of Sales (“POS”) counters across our 

post offices in Singapore by 35 to reduce customer waiting time. Vending machines 

for packaging and philately products have been introduced in Smart Post Offices. 

In addition, we have successfully completed the implementation of our new 

SAM Omnichannel Platform project (please refer to the Key Activities section on 

following page for more information). 

For package deliveries, the Tracked Package service was introduced based on 

customer feedback reflecting that tracking capabilities and direct letterbox 

deliveries were preferred over doorstep deliveries that require signoffs. This 

service offers delivery progress tracking and notifications to update recipients on 

their package deliveries.

In addition, we re-aligned our service and product offerings in the area of 

eCommerce logistics. Our logistics and fulfilment business, Quantium Solutions, 

continues to be transformed with strong emphasis placed on revenue growth. 

We restructured the business, implemented a culture change programme with 

a customer-first ethos, and re-aligned the product-and-service portfolio with 

increased emphasis on simplification and sales, offering clearly differentiated 

products. Processes were also re-engineered to optimise cross-border networks. 

SingPost regularly evaluates the effectiveness of our new initiatives by monitoring 

indicators such as service levels, system responsiveness and customer 

satisfaction. We aim to continue improving our product and service offerings on  a 

regular basis.

KEY ACTIVITIES IN FY2019/20

SAM Omnichannel Platform

SAM started as kiosks to give customers self-service 

options for services ranging from the payment of bills and 

fines, purchasing of stamps, weighing of packages, beyond 

the operating hours of our post offices. Today, SAM extends 

beyond conventional kiosks to multi-channel platforms 

including web and mobile to bring our services even closer 

and more accessible to customers anytime and anywhere. 

We are also implementing the iSAM – a new and more user-

friendly Point of Sales (“POS”) terminal across our post 

offices for customers to perform transactions more quickly 

and efficiently, and thereby improve customer experience.

Smart Letterbox Prototype 

In September 2019, we unveiled a smart letterbox delivery 

system prototype, which aims to improve the efficiency 

of mail delivery. The system can sort mail by households 

in an apartment block. It also allows mail recipients in 

Singapore to track their mail items at every stage of their 

journey, receive notifications when they arrive, and retrieve 

them from a storage unit using facial recognition and other 

forms of authentication. The innovations, which are world 

firsts, are part of SingPost’s Future of Post transformational 

strategy to meet the needs of a changing postal landscape.

Tampines Central Post Office @Telepark

With the move of the Tampines Central Post Office to its 

new home, we showcased the new concept Tampines 

Post Office @Telepark, which offers a refreshing postal 

experience for web savvy customers, eCommerce shoppers 

and traditional mail users. This new concept post office 

features a Philatelic Store, 24/7 auto lobby, café, SAM 

kiosks, POPStation as well as local snacks kiosk. A queue 

management system has been implements to minimise 

queuing time - customers will receive an SMS notification 

to prompt their turn at the post office. On 28 February 2020, 

we were honoured to have Senior Minister of State, Ms Sim 

Ann, grace the official opening of our newest post office at 

Tampines Telepark.





INTEGRATING STATE-OF-THE-ART INNOVATION IN

OUR OPERATIONS

SingPost aims to build on the reliable and affordable postal services we have 

provided Singapore for more than 160 years by introducing innovations that 

support our transformational journey to becoming a leading regional eCommerce 

hub. SmartPost is our suite of technological solutions aimed at digitalising 

Singapore’s postal operations, in order to raise postal service quality and enhance 

operational efficiency. 

Under the initiative, the amalgamation of near-field communication (“NFC”), radio 

frequency identification (“RFID”) and mobile application technologies enable the 

tracking of packages. The system also enhances collection of detailed operational 

and productivity data, so as to generate insights for better optimisation of delivery 

operations. In addition, we have in place the Last-Mile Platform (“LaMP”), a first-

of-its-kind technology that consolidates various last-mile delivery services, such 

as courier services, parcel lockers and brick-and-mortar collection points onto 

a single platform. This brings together retailers and logistics providers to create 

open eCommerce ecosystems that offer businesses unparalleled control and 

flexibility with their parcel deliveries.

GREENHOUSE GAS (“GHG”) EMISSIONS

Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) refers to gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation. 

SingPost adopts the use of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and accounts for its 

direct (Scope 1) and energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions using the operational control criteria. 

• Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions: GHG emissions from combustion of fuel used for vehicles and equipment 

owned or under SingPost’s operational control. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) 

were included in the GHG emissions calculation and expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).

• 

GHG emissions were calculated using the default emissions factors from the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel 

on Climate Change (“IPCC”) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the respective global 

warming potential (“GWP”) on a 100-year time horizon from the 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.

• 

Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions: GHG emissions that result from the generation of purchased 

electricity used for offices and buildings owned or under SingPost’s operational control, and excludes 

tenant space. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is included in the GHG emissions calculation.

• 

GHG emissions were calculated using the grid emissions factors (“GEF”) sourced from the Singapore 

Energy Statistics, the Energy Market Authority’s (“EMA”) annual publication on energy statistics in 

Singapore.

Note: Restatements were made for FY2017/18 and FY2018/19 data for greater accuracy based on the 

aforementioned emissions factors used.

Note: Restatements were made for FY2017/18 and FY2018/19 data for greater accuracy based on the 

aforementioned emissions factors used. With data availability, FY2018/19 data was also restated to include an 

additional property which commenced operations in 2018.

EMA’s methodologies for the compilation of the GEF are based on the United Nations Framework Convention on 

Climate Change (“UNFCCC”) Clean Development Mechanism (“CDM”) Methodological Tool. The GEF measures 

the average CO2 emissions emitted per unit net electricity generated. It is calculated using the Average 

Operating Margin ("OM") method, the generation-weighted average CO2 emissions per unit of net electricity 

generation of all generating power plants serving the electricity grid. (Source: EMA)
