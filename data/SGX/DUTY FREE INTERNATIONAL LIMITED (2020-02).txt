SUSTAINABILITY AT DFI 

 

Sustainability is integrated into DFI’s business and its commitment to the triple bottom line of 

responsible economic development, environmental and social performance. 

Conducting business responsibly is a cornerstone of the Group’s strategy and culture and DFI is 

committed to: 

• 

Being a responsible and relevant driver of positive change in society; 

• 

Reducing risk throughout the Group and for its stakeholders; and 

• 

Minimising negative economic, environmental and social impacts.  

 

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE 

 

DFI’s sustainability governance model provides a solid foundation for developing and anchoring 

sustainability strategy and targets. It ensures that we focus on embedding sustainability into operations 

by implementing decisions in the relevant business areas. All units have different roles to play and 

duties regarding their support for the implementation. 

Members of the Board of Directors are responsible for overseeing responsibilities for sustainability, 

operations, systems, operational resilience as well as related frameworks and processes. The Board of 

Directors is the ultimate governing body and oversees the integration of our sustainability agenda and 

initiatives across the Group. The sustainability agenda is steered by the Managing Director, Executive 

Director and the Sustainability Working Group. The Board considers sustainability as part of its strategic 

formulation and in determining material Economic, Environmental, Social and Governance (EESG) 

factors of the Company.  

The Sustainability Working Group manages the day-to-day sustainability initiatives. It also ensures core 

business functions are able to complete their plans, meet their timelines and mitigate risks as required.

Sustainability Governance Structure at DFI 

 

Each business area and group function are represented in the Sustainability Working Group. The 

Working Group prepares sustainability issues related to policies, guidelines and strategy. The business 

areas and group functions are then responsible for implementing these into the business. 

 

DFI COMMITMENT TO ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR 

 

DFI is committed to integrity and strong business. Several governance policies and procedures have 

been introduced such as the Code of Conduct, Anti-Corruption procedures and Whistle-blowing Policy. 

Employees must commit to following the highest ethical standards while also familiarising themselves 

and abiding by applicable laws. All personal conduct must be above reproach and comply with the 

highest standards of conduct and business ethics. DFI’s Code of Business Ethics and Standards of

Defining clear and strong corporate values that cover the entire Group is important. Aligning all activities 

and procedures with these values builds a powerful image of integrity and transparency. The Code of

Business Ethics and Standard Conduct governs the entire value chain, emphasising professionalism 

and surpassing applicable laws. It guides employees on expected conduct with stakeholders and 

describes the directives and principles to follow when performing all duties.  

 

Principles and Key Ethical Conduct 

 

All employees receive a personal copy of the Code and are required to acknowledge their responsibility 

for complying with its policies and procedures.  

Training and communication familiarise all employee with the Group’s policy and helps reassert their 

commitment to it. The Code of Ethics, the anti-corruption policy, customer service and data protection 

are topics covered in Group training sessions.  

The internal audit team assess the Group’s adherence to its ethical values. Various audits assess 

employee and departmental compliance with policies, procedures, local laws and regulations. Business 

activities that pose a higher risk to compliance and the Group’s reputation are periodically audited such 

as financial management and reporting, corporate governance, employment issues, supply and capital 

expenditure transactions and other operational procedures. Any cases or suspected cases of activity 

involving corruption including bribery and fraud are investigated. The Board is regularly updated on the 

Group’s compliance status.

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND WHISTLEBLOWING 

Our anti-corruption policies and procedures are laid out in the Employee Handbook and also readily 

accessible through the Group’s intranet. This policy ensures strong business ethics and compliance 

with the new section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (“MACC Act”), which 

will take effect on 1 June 2020. In-house training was delivered to the management team on The New 

Corporate Liability Offence for Corruption under the MACC Act on 11 March 2020. 

The Group introduced a ‘whistleblowing’ communication procedure in 2012 to encourage employees to 

disclose any malpractice or misconduct they may become aware of. Whistleblowers may direct their 

concerns to the Audit Committee Chairman with background details, history of events and the reasons 

for the concern including the identity of the alleged person involved.  

Any information provided will be investigated depending on its severity, reliability and credibility. 

Employees using this channel are protected by the Group. We did not receive any whistleblowing cases 

during the year.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

 

Stakeholder engagement is the process of involving people who may be affected by DFI’s decisions or 

can influence the implementation of these decisions. As such, stakeholders are integral to the 

sustainability of our business. Engaging with stakeholders is fundamental as understanding their 

expectations and responding to their concerns increases accountability and strengthens stakeholders’ 

confidence in DFI.  

In FY2018, we conducted a materiality assessment workshop to identify key stakeholders who have 

direct influence in our business and operations. These stakeholder groups along with the engagement 

platforms, frequency of engagement and areas of concern are presented in the table below.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

Materiality is the principle of defining the economic, environmental and social topics that matter most to 

our business and stakeholders. We have adopted the following process for our materiality assessment. 

 

We commissioned a comprehensive study in the last quarter of FY2020. An external consultant was 

selected to secure the anonymity of the respondents and ensure the complete impartiality of the 

assessment. Stakeholder representatives were asked to rate the importance they placed on 17 areas 

of sustainability.

ECONOMIC 

 

Our Management Approach 

 

DFI continues to be a major player in Malaysia’s travel retail industry. This is due to the geographical 

and multi-diversification of DFI’s duty-free and duty-paid retailing outlets at all entry and exit points of 

Malaysia. Together with Brand Connect Group, as illustrated in the Diagram 2 below, DFI is able to 

develop and expand its beverage distribution business and market operations beyond the current sales 

channels in the Malaysian duty-free market to include South East Asia’s duty-paid market. All these 

outlets are centrally managed in Kuala Lumpur and Penang, Malaysia. 

We constantly seek ways of enhancing our service levels while continuing to: 

• 

Focus on strategies that improve operational efficiency; 

• 

Expand our customer base by improving product and service quality; and 

• 

Intensify efforts to strengthen our distribution network and marketing, expand product offerings 

and explore opportunities to expand the Group's distribution channels.

ECONOMIC IMPACT OF DUTY FREE AND TRAVEL RETAIL 

 

The duty-free and travel retail industry is a fast-growing sector of the Asia Pacific economy. It 

contributes significantly to the economic development of the country and region through the 

employment and activity it generates. Facilitating wider economic activity in other industrial sectors such 

as aviation, maritime travel and tourism, our operations support the growth and development of regional 

economies.

ENCOURAGING LOCAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 

 

A wide and varied geographical reach helps DFI bring value to local communities in which it operates. 

Committed to each community where operations are based, DFI aims to have a positive impact by 

actively contributing to the surrounding area.  

DFI hires local staff and purchases goods from local suppliers whenever possible. The Group helps 

develop the local markets in which it operates by procuring products and services from local distributors 

and suppliers as well as directly generating jobs. Goods are not only purchased from well-established 

brand partners but also smaller-scale souvenirs and crafts from local manufactures. 

DFI also delivers employee training at each location. Different courses and programmes help enhance 

the knowledge and skills of the local professional community. Improving local future employment 

opportunities contribute to the development of local markets. 

 


 

Duty Free International Limited / Sustainability Report 2020

ENVIRONMENTAL 

 

Since DFI’s core business activity consists of selling third party products, its direct environmental impact 

is low but not insignificant. 

DFI’s primary environmental aspects are related to energy use and waste generation. Our target is to 

manage these aspects effectively in order to minimise the environmental impact. The energy consumed 

by DFI’s outlets and logistics activities, fuel use as well as packaging and other waste, are the main 

aspects considered.  

We are also conscious that our liabilities are not limited to the impacts generated by our own actions. 

Airports, duty free zones, bordertowns, downtown and seaport concessionaires are also considered in 

order to minimise the impacts generated along the supply chain.  

 

Our Management Approach 

 

 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS 

 

DFI’s operational energy consumption has traditionally been high in its retail operations as optimal in-

store lighting and ambient temperature are required to create a luxury shopping experience. Food and 

beverage refrigeration, screen displays and other energy-consuming devices can increase this 

consumption considerably. Energy is also used for offices and warehouses.  

This energy consumption has an associated environmental impact with greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions being generated that contribute to climate change. DFI continued to focus its efforts on re-

defining processes and re-designing premises to lower energy requirements. All outlets monitor their 

energy consumption.

SWITCHING TO SMART METERS 

Currently, Malaysian electricity provider, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (“TNB”), is rolling out a smart meter 

programme. This initiative is part of the government’s nationwide initiative, endorsed by the Energy 

Commission. DFI complies fully when replacements are scheduled.  

Smart meters provide a better energy experience as they record information automatically to TNB via 

radio-frequency waves for monitoring and billing. Daily energy usage can be read more easily and billing 

is more accurate. This helps plan greener and more efficient energy use.

energy bulbs on ceilings and displays

air conditioners and fridges

RENEWABLE ENERGY 

As a form of renewable energy, solar energy from the sun’s radiation is converted to electricity. It has 

the least negative impact on the environment compared to other energy sources and does not produce 

greenhouse gases or pollute the water.  

The first solar panels were installed at our Bukit Kayu Hitam outlet in FY2019. During FY2020, solar 

panels were also installed at our Padang Besar outlet. Solar energy continues to help reduce the 

Group’s energy consumption. We will continue to study the feasibility of expanding the installation of 

solar panels to our other outlets as we progressively transition to the use of renewable energy. 

The installed solar panels’ performance is tracked using a vendor’s photovoltaic (PV) system — Sunny 

Portal. This system allows DFI to access and analyse key system data remotely in real-time. The 

monitoring mechanism measures both the overall assumption of internal power and external energy as 

power is generated for self-consumption. 

This energy data is available on a daily, monthly and yearly basis and includes historical data. The 

system is also able to detect minor deviations and resolve them quickly. There is also a built-in 

community portal for DFI to benchmark its PV system data with other peer users.

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

 

DFI works with its supply chain partners to reduce excess packaging entering the waste stream, 

addressing the problem at its source. Our waste is disposed of at a place designated by the local 

authority. The waste is collected and handled by a licensed third-party waste handler each week.  

MINIMISING PAPER WASTE 

Printing is discouraged and we advise employees to scan documents and save or send them 

electronically. This initiative benefits the environment and also increases the likelihood that documents 

will be read as they can be accessed from a device rather than in hard copy.  

 

WATER MANAGEMENT 

Water usage for our operations is considered minimal; however, we strive to minimise it whenever 

possible. Memos and notices are displayed in toilets to remind employees and visitors to save water 

and turn off taps that are not in use.  

 

EMPLOYEES AWARENESS 

 

Employee awareness campaigns are designed and delivered to promote easy habits that avoid 

unnecessary energy use. Notice and reminders are being sent to employees to practice energy 

conservation including avoiding water wastage in toilets.

EMBRACING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE 

 

We operate a transparent and inclusive work environment and understand diversity is fundamental to 

maintaining our ability to grow as a company. DFI strives to be a gender-intelligent organisation that 

recognises and values the differences that people from all backgrounds bring to the workplace. Diversity 

goes beyond race and gender to include marital status, parental status, religion, political origin, social 

status, ethnic background, disability, age, union membership or any other characteristic protected by 

local law. 

The following figures offer a glimpse of the diversity and balance in DFI.

SALARY AND BENEFITS 

 

Offering benefits to employees is important as it shows DFI is invested in their overall health and future. 

A solid employee benefits package also helps to attract and retain talent.  

Contract conditions such as base pay and employee benefits always comply at least with the statutory 

minimum. Employees are treated equally regardless of gender. The ratio between the minimum wage 

offered by DFI to its men and women is 1:1. 

In addition to salary provisions, DFI offers a range of benefits that improve employee welfare, increase 

morale and offer peace of mind and security.  

Examples of Benefits Offered 

 

 

GRIEVANCES 

 

DFI provides effective means for employees to bring work feedback and complaints to the 

management’s attention. Employees may raise grievances to their immediate superiors who hopefully 

offer a reasonable and acceptable settlement to the problem at the earliest available opportunity.  

If employees and their immediate superiors are unable to resolve the problem through informal 

discussions, the complaint is escalated to the Head of Department and subsequently Human Resources 

Department, Division Head, General Manager and Managing Director. 

Leave 

 

• Annual, sick, hospitalisation, maternity and paternity, 

marriage, compassionate and calamity leave 

 

Insurance 

• Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Social Security Scheme 

(SOCSO) and Employee Insurance Scheme (EIS) in Malaysia 

• Statutory contributions to Central Provident Fund (CPF) in 

Singapore 

• Group Personal Accident (GPA), Group hospitalisation and 

surgical insurance scheme. 

 

Monetary reward 

 

• Salary, bonuses, increments, incentives, clams and overtime.

COMMUNICATION AND ENGAGEMENT 

 

Internal communication is the main tool used to build good relationships with employees and share our 

values with them. Communication helps the business reinforce employees’ feelings of pride and 

belonging and engagement with the Group. 

As employees represent our brand and the Group, it is essential to ensure that they feel empowered 

and have a sense of ownership of all they do. Qualified and engaged employees are vital in defining 

good strategies, efficient operations, offering outstanding customer service and generally performing 

Group activities successfully. Communication needs to be clear, transparent, bi-directional and aligned.  

DFI has developed various communication and dialogue tools such as face-to-face meetings and the 

Group intranet.  

The Group takes into consideration its employees needs whenever there are operational changes. 

Minimum notice period follows all requirements stipulated under the employment law or employment 

contract, where relevant. This period can vary depending on the extent of the operational changes.  

DFI is proud of its united and engaged workforce and continues to strengthen the bond through various 

engagement activities such as festive celebrations, annual dinners, luncheons and casual outings.  

 

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 

 

DFI conducts performance evaluation to provide feedback to employees. This information is useful in 

their self-development and should eventually increase DFI’s effectiveness. Performance evaluation is 

linked to employees’ confirmation, promotion, bonus and merit pay increases. 

Employees are evaluated annually on two main areas: Key Result Areas (KRA) and personal attributes. 

The initial evaluation is performed with the immediate superior. The final rating is moderated by the 

outlet manager or Head of Department before submission to the management.  

DFI practises a two-way appraisal process using a Balanced Scorecard. Employees and their superiors 

discuss achievable goals and devise a customised career path. In FY2020, 100% of DFI employees 

have undergone the performance evaluation process.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 

Health and safety in the workplace is essential for employee welfare. DFI strives to achieve the highest 

occupational health and safety standards. Compliance with these standards is actively encouraged 

across the Group and extended to all business and supply chain partners.  

Slips, trips and falls, lifting and carrying heavy loads, and standing for long periods of time are examples 

of ways employees may be injured at work. Safety briefings and awareness sessions covering all these 

areas are delivered regularly to remind employees of safe ways of working with minimised risks of 

occupational injuries. Employees who work on the floor are reminded of the importance of wearing 

suitable footwear.  

Other safety training and workshops organised for employees during the year included a fire and safety 

workshop by the Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department (“BOMBA”). This workshop was attended by 

our employees at Penang operations.  

DFI also conducts monthly inspection on all electrical and fire emergency system including fire alarm, 

emergency lights, exit sign, automatic sprinkler, pressurised hydrant, wet and dry riser as well as hose 

reel system. DFI engages a third-party service and maintenance company to conduct monthly 

inspection on its machine room, lift and escalators to ensure that they are functioning at all times. 

ENHANCING WELLBEING AND MENTAL HEALTH 

DFI investigates and implements new ways to add further flexibility to the workplace, providing that they 

are practical solutions that bring added value to the business. For example, DFI offers a wide range of 

shift patterns to suit both the Group’s operational requirements and individual needs.  

OUR SAFETY PERFORMANCE 

The right to a safe and healthy work environment is non-negotiable. Safety underpins all that we do as 

a business. We are pleased to report that we recorded zero fatalities, serious injuries and incidents 

during this reporting period. Any unsafe behaviour and practices are not tolerated.

INVESTING IN OUR TALENT 

 

DFI is fully committed to empowering its talent at all levels and aims to offer opportunities for employees 

to grow and develop successful careers within the Group.  

DFI’s training programmes encourage internal development and know-how. Specific customised 

courses are run for employees depending on their role in addition to the basic training required by law 

such as health and safety. The training programme aims to build employee excellence that is relevant 

to all job roles across the Group. Training courses on multiple customer service and product knowledge 

programmes are delivered across all the DFI locations in order to develop and deliver a strong and 

consistent customer service proposition.

competently and effectively undertake their assigned activities and responsibilities.

EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND NON-DISCRIMINATION 

 

DFI recognises the importance of respecting human rights across all business operations. Our approach 

applies to all employees and contractors and follows the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 

core conventions of the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations Guiding Principles 

on Business and Human Rights. 

DFI is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all individuals regardless of race, 

colour, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or any other 

characteristics protected by law. It is company policy to provide equal opportunity to all employees with 

regards to hiring, pay rates, training and development, promotions and other terms of employment.  

DFI’s’ policy on discrimination and harassment is clearly stated in its Code of Business Ethics. 

Employees are reassured that they can raise legitimate concerns and make reports in good faith without 

fear of reprisal. 

We are pleased to report that there have been no reported incidents of discrimination or harassment 

during this reporting period. 

 

SOCIAL: SOCIETY 

 

As a corporate citizen, DFI recognises the importance of coexisting with the community and, thinking 

about what we can do for society as a company. DFI’s community activities aim at contributing to the 

betterment of society. As our operations involve a wide range of communities, it is important that we 

establish a long-term relationship with it, and contribute to its development. We have formulated a policy 

on social contribution activities and are carrying out a wide variety of activities across the Company. 

 

SOCIAL: PRODUCTS AND SERVICES EXCELLENCE 

 

Business excellence begins with engaging with our business and brand partners. These strong 

relationships are reflected in our delivery of the best customer service and being recognised as a 

renowned travel retail partner by our stakeholders.  

DELIVERING AN EXCLUSIVE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE 

DFI UNIQUE OUTLET LAYOUT 

DFI’s traditional duty-free concept outlets cater to every type of customer with all the main product 

categories and a wide range of brands being displayed in carefully arranged zones.  


 

Duty Free International Limited / Sustainability Report 2020 

 

33 

 

 

Engaging With Supply Partners to Create Perfect Shopping Experience 

 

Each section at our outlet is focused on a single product category. A highly-trained employee is 

stationed and ready to offer expert advice to customers.  

PEST CONTROL 

Despite not handling food, pest problems can take hold, especially as goods and people are constantly 

entering our premises. 

Multiple entry points and densely populated shopping areas make retail stores inherently vulnerable to 

pests. DFI engages a third-party pest controller to conduct regular pest control at its stores. 

 

CUSTOMER FIRST 

 

Customers always come first at DFI. Due to the nature of the travelling customer, DFI must adapt its 

retail strategy to meet customers’ needs in a limited timeframe, with the extra challenge of meeting the 

expectations of a diverse array of customers.  

Our goal is to create a unique shopping experience by understanding what and how and when they 

want it, and to offer it in exclusively designed outlets.  

REWARDING CUSTOMER LOYALTY 

The ZON Community Loyalty Programme was introduced to appreciate and reward our loyal customers 

for their continuous support and keeping them updated with the on-going promotions at our outlets. 

ZON Community Cardholders enjoy the exclusive member’s discounts and benefits.  

CUSTOMER DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY 

Protecting customers’ private data in processes that involve the handling of customers’ information is 

an important concern for the Group.  



•to get the best and most exclusive products



Engage with brand partners



•to offer the most exclusive store design



Coordinate with outlet designers



•to create a sophisticated environment for 

customers

Duty Free International Limited / Sustainability Report 2020

Our stores scan boarding passes and passports where applicable. We receive information from other 

sources such as store cameras, the DFI website and our social media account. The handling and 

storage of this information present a data protection risk. 

A number of measures have been introduced to ensure customer data is handled correctly. DFI has 

developed a robust IT security system, a data protection and CCTV policy, training for employees 

dealing with personal information and procedures that abide by the Personal Data Protection Act 

(PDPA) 2010. There have been no reported breaches of customer privacy or data during this reporting 

period. 

 

PUBLIC SAFETY 

 

All our retail outlets have dry floors, clear paths, well-stocked shelves, ample parking areas, 

unobstructed by carts and well-maintained pavements to prevent unwanted accidents befalling on 

visitors to our outlets. 

Precautions and measures taken to ensure the safety of our customers and all who come to our outlets 

include: 

• 

Placing signs around the building that serve as a reminder such as ‘watch your step’, ‘no 

smoking’, ‘caution wet floor’, ‘no admittance’ and ‘danger’; and 

• 

A round-the-clock alarm system, CCTV and security guards. 

All common areas are protected with firefighting equipment and access remains unobstructed at all 

times. DFI also has scheduled inspection and maintenance works for lifts, escalators and other 

engineering equipment.  

DFI ensures that all of its safety certificates and permits to work are up-to-date. All retail and wholesale 

premises are inspected and certified by BOMBA before receiving a certificate of safe practice.
