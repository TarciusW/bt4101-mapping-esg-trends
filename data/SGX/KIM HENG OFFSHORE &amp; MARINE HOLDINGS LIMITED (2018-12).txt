Board Statement

The Board of Directors at Kim Heng Offshore and Marine 

Holdings Limited (“Kim Heng” and together with its 

subsidiaries, the “Group”) is pleased to present the 

sustainability report of the Group for the financial year 

ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”) (the “Sustainability 

Report”).

Last year, the Board commenced the organisation’s 

sustainability reporting journey by issuing our first 

sustainability report.

Sustainability reporting has allowed us to understand the 

expectations of different stakeholders and how these 

can impact our growth. This has helped the business to 

develop a more strategic outlook which also focuses on 

long-term objectives. Through measuring and monitoring 

the Group’s levels of energy, water and waste, the Group 

has been able to enjoy cost reductions by recognizing and 

addressing any potential areas of leakages. The Group 

also believes that emphasizing on the development and 

growth of our employees will allow the Group to achieve 

continued success in the long-run. 

The first year of sustainability reporting had allowed the 

Group to make progress towards our mission and vision, 

positioning ourselves as an organisation that makes a 

positive impact towards a sustainable global economy.

With the publication of this year’s sustainability report, 

the Group will continue to work with the stakeholders to 

build a sustainable business.

About this Report

This Sustainability Report covers data and information from 1 January 2018 – 31 December 2018 for our Singapore 

operations. The Group reports on our sustainability performance on an annual basis. 

The Sustainability Report is prepared in line with the sustainability reporting requirements of Rules 711(A) and 711(B) 

of the Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) 

(the “Catalist Rules”). This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards Core Option.

We have not obtained any independent assurance of the information being reported, but may consider doing so as 

our reporting processes mature in the future.

A soft copy of this report can be found on our website at www.kimheng.com.sg. Please reach out to our sustainability 

team at Sustainability@kimheng.com.sg with any comments or questions.

At Kim Heng, we aim to be the choice provider in the oil and gas industry and to be able to serve our customers with 

the finest integrated solutions and first-class customer service. 

Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) has been an important part of the Group’s business philosophy, and is thus a key 

consideration in the Group’s daily operations. When doing business, be it launching a new service or working with 

partners, the Group always considers the socioeconomic aspect, as well as the environmental impact that any of our 

actions may have on the broader community. It is the Group’s view that a socially responsible business is a business 

that is valued by the community and all its stakeholders.

Sustainability Governance

While sustainability matters were always considered a part of our business philosophy, the requirements of sustainability 

reporting ensure that the Group places emphasis and reports on this area. 

The Board takes overall responsibility for driving the overall sustainability strategy of the Group, while the sustainability 

reporting is led by a sustainability committee which comprises of the members of senior management including the 

Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Corporate Services. 

For day-to-day implementation of sustainability initiatives, responsibilities are handed over to managers in respective 

functions such as Human Resource, Operational Safety, Health and Environment, and Procurement departments.

Materiality Assessment 

Materiality is a critical input in our corporate sustainability strategy because it ensures we provide our stakeholders 

with the sustainability information most relevant to them and our business. 

Based on our assessment process conducted for FY2017, which included interviews with internal stakeholders 

and a management workshop, we had identified 6 material topics and have strategised them across three key 

pillars; environmental, social and economic. For FY2018, the Group continues to report the following topics in our 

Sustainability Report as there has been no significant change to our business strategy and market environment.

Environmental

2018 saw the Singapore Government naming 2018 as the ‘Year of Climate Action’. As a player in the maritime 

industry, the Group recognises our environmental impact as we strive towards minimising our footprint through 

conscious resource management efforts. 

We currently operate under the Environmental Management System (EMS) of ISO 14001 and the Quality Management 

System of ISO 9001:2008 through which we exercise a precautionary approach towards environmental issues.

Resource Management

Why it is material

Our operations consume electricity and marine gas oil. Our shipyards and vessels generate waste through the 

fabrication of offshore platforms and the building and repairing of vessels. The ballast water that is discharged by our 

vessels may also impact the biodiversity of the waters.  As our operations are highly dependent on natural resources, 

we recognize our impact on the environment, and accordingly deem resource management to be a material factor 

in our sustainability strategy.

Our industry is subject to a number of environmental regulations relating to air pollution, ballast water discharge and 

waste. After we started our sustainability journey for FY2017, we no longer see these environmental regulations as 

compliance requirements, but as opportunities to minimise leakages in our business. Overtime, the Group understands 

the benefits of sustainability efforts as it will directly impact both our bottom line and our environmental footprint.

Management Approach

Our approach to resource management encompasses a number of areas.

Energy and emissions

With regards to energy conservation, our vessels follow the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP), 

introduced by the International Maritime Organisation, which aims to provide a practical approach in managing our 

operations and fleet efficiency performance using the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). As a result of 

our efforts, we have obtained the International Energy Efficiency Certificate and our vessels have also been accredited 

with the International Air Pollution Prevention (IAPP) certificate during the year. This is awarded to vessels that 

demonstrate strict control of diesel engine nitrogen oxides emissions by meeting certain survey, certification and 

compliance requirement in accordance with MARPOL Annex VI regulation1. 

In 2020, our industry will be subject to the global sulphur cap, limiting sulphur content of bunker fuel to a maximum 

of 0.5%. We are already prepared for this change and have been using fuel that has been in the range of 0.37% to 

0.5% sulphur levels.

Besides efforts dedicated to environmental regulatory requirements, we continue to instil a green culture within the 

organisation and are striving to seek Eco-Office labelling certificate at our work place in the near future. 

We also see sustainability as an opportunity to innovate. Going forward, the Group is looking into exploring business 

opportunities to serve the offshore wind energy business.

The Group has a risk management committee which comprises the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, 

Chief Financial Officer, Commercial and Operation Director and Head of Corporate Services, that monitors any risks 

of non-compliance in our operations and ensure that we adhere to environmental laws and regulations pertaining 

to our industry. In this regard, third party advisors will be considered and used where the Audit &amp; Risk Committee 

(“ARC”) deems it necessary.

KIM HENG OFFSHORE &amp; MARINE HOLDINGS LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2018

Water discharge and conservation

The Group has in place a ballast water management plan since September 2017. This plan is a requirement to help 

prevent the spread of potentially harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens in ships’ ballast water. This requires all 

ships to implement a ballast water management plan, maintaining a ballast water record book and obtaining the 

International Ballast Water Management Certificate for all ships in operation. 

All our existing ships built prior to September 2017 are in compliance with D1 standard which specifies requirements 

for ships to exchange ballast water in open seas, away from coastal areas. Our new ships built after September 2017 

are in compliance with D2 standard which requires ships to conform to the maximum amount of viable organisms 

allowed to be discharged, including specified indicator microbes harmful to human health. Our vessels are accredited 

with the International Ballast Water Management Certificate.

Besides that, our vessels are also in compliance with MARPOL Annex 1 regulation on prevention of oil pollution and 

accredited with the International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) certificate.

At our office and shipyard, the Group continues to harvest and reuse rainwater for our operations.

Waste management

Kim Heng has strict waste management procedures and guidelines that have been developed with reference to 

local and international standards. Our vessels continue to follow the MARPOL Annex V regulations for prevention of 

pollution by garbage plan.

This indicator is reported in reference of GRI Standards instead of in accordance with the GRI Standards Core Option for the following 

reasons:

• 

Information on waste type (i.e. hazardous or non-hazardous) is currently not available

• 

Information on waste disposal method is currently not available 

Water Consumption

The increase in total water consumption was due to increase in water supply to customers operating the vessels and

Energy and emissions

Commencing this year, in addition to the electricity consumption of the Group’s shipyard operations, the Group 

has reported our fuel consumption by our vessels as well as our carbon emission as tabulated below. Our electricity 

consumption records are also presented below in comparative to last year’s reported figures. The increase in electricity 

consumption was due to an increase in internal reactivation of vessels that the Group had acquired during the year.

Social

Health and Safety

Why it is material

Our ambition is to make Kim Heng yards and worksites a much safer place to work at. We recognise that the health 

and safety of our on-site workers and vessel crew can be at risk given the nature of their work and ensuring their 

safety at work is our top most priority. 

Management Approach

The Group adheres to best-in-class health &amp; safety standards to ensure that the necessary safety measures are 

implemented across the organisation. We have in place a health, safety and environment (“HSE”) policy outlining the 

key requirements for all employees. There are also designated HSE personnel to carry out and monitor HSE-related 

issues for both the shipyards and the vessels as well as the attainment of relevant certifications. 

On top of our own stringent risk mitigation measures, comprehensive risk assessments continue to be carried out by 

external bodies on a regular basis to ensure that all areas of safety are in check. 

The Group recognizes that everybody has a responsibility to ensure a safe working environment for all employees.  

Where the working procedure is wrong or where employees encounter unsafe equipment or working conditions, 

they are encouraged to highlight such incidences to the relevant HSE personnel.

Having the above procedures in place allow us to remain confident in reducing the risks of accidents, injuries or 

illnesses to our employees and the local community.

Additionally, we have achieved the following certifications: 

• 

BIZSAFE level 3 

• 

BIZSAFE STAR

• 

ISO 22:000

• 

ISPS AND ISM certified shipyard - International Ship and Port Security and International ship management safety 

code

• 

Our vessels carry medical supplies and equipment as per International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and World 

Health Organisation (WHO) conventions

During the year, we participated in two events with government agencies to enhance the Group’s emergency 

preparedness: 

• 

In March 2018, the Group provided oil spill management/expertise, skilled manpower, logistics, and oil spill 

equipment handling for the National Environment Agency (NEA) Ground Deployment Exercise – Shoreline Oil 

Spill (KHMO teamed with ST Logistics) Response deployment at East Coast Park.

• 

In April 2018, the Group hosted a regiment from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), Singapore Police Force 

- Police Coast Guard (SPF - PCG) and Clementi Police Headquarter to carry out counter-terrorism and firefighting 

exercises held at our waterfront shipyard. In the process, Kim Heng demonstrated safety drills on board a vessel, 

showcased firefighting capabilities and even exchanged information on internal safety management processes.

STAYING STEADFAST

Human Capital Development

Our employee profile

There is a significant increase in the total number of employees in FY2018 as the Group increased its recruitment 

efforts due to the manpower required for a large new project.

Why it is Material

Our employees are the greatest asset at Kim Heng and because of them we are able to continuously achieve success. 

It is crucial for us to retain our staff by caring for their development, providing competitive employee benefits and 

ensuring fair and safe working conditions.

Management Approach

Fair working conditions

We continue to provide diverse and equal opportunities to all our employees at Kim Heng. We do not judge our 

potential employee candidates based on their race, religion or nationality. Instead we assess shortlisted candidates 

based on qualification, relevant experience, skills and knowledge. Our staff are encouraged to speak to their immediate 

superior should they have any grievances. Depending on the gravity of the issue, it will be solved by the superior or 

escalated to HR or senior management wherever necessary.

Training and development 

We are aware of the importance of continuous advancement of skills in our operations. In order to continuously 

serve our customers with the finest integrated solutions and first-class service, we have provided specific training 

for specific job scopes such as Construction Safety Orientation Course (CSOC) for crane operators, Shipyard Safety 

Instruction Course (SSIC) for shipyard workers, and Basic Offshore and Emergency Induction Training (BOISIET) for 

workers involved in offshore projects.

New trainings undertaken by our staff in FY2018 included: 

• 

Shipyard Safety Instruction Course 

• 

Skill development course for our workers on skills such as welding

Employee benefits

We continue to comply with Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) mandatory requirements for employee benefits and also 

provide competitive compensation compared to internal salary equity and external sources of the industry standards.

We seek to consent with our employees’ specific requests where reasonable and in cases where positions are now 

redundant, the Company considers retaining the staff by transferring them to other departments or another entity of 

the Group. This is based on the relevance of their knowledge and skill sets.

Economic

Ethics and Anti-corruption

Why it is material

We continue to recognise that our industry is sensitive in the area of ethics and corruption. Any such issues can lead 

to significant reputational damage, legal consequences and loss of customers to our business. 

Management Approach

Kim Heng has zero tolerance for bribery and corruption in its business. We strive to achieve the highest levels of 

corporate ethics and transparency through sound corporate governance and appropriate internal controls. 

We have developed an anti-bribery and corruption (“ABC”) policy to provide guidance to all management and staff 

in the mitigation of the risk consistently with regulatory requirements and marketplace expectations. 

The Company has a whistle-blowing policy where staff of the Group may, in confidence, raise concerns on any 

suspicion of wrongdoings which covers improprieties in matters of financial reporting, fraudulent acts and other 

matters within the Group. The whistle-blowing policy is also set out in the Company’s Corporate Governance Report 

of the Annual Report for FY2018. 

Performance

Our employees are briefed and have received communication and training on Kim Heng’s ABC policy.

There have been no cases of anti-bribery and corruption reported or any whistle-blowing reports received in FY2018.  

Future Outlook

1. 

We are in the process of including in our hiring policy that all new hires will be provided with an orientation 

handbook on anti-bribery and corruption, targeted to be completed by 2019.

2. 

We are in the midst of providing all our employees with refresher courses on anti-bribery and corruption and we 

target to complete the process by end of 2019 and to continue this on an annual basis.




15

Regulatory Compliance

Why it is material

Kim Heng is governed by a number of laws and regulations in the social and economic area and any breach can result 

in significant legal fines as well as reputational damage.

Management Approach

Our employees continue to be briefed with the management’s policy of compliance with social and environmental 

laws. Our code of ethics clearly states Kim Heng adheres to all legal standards on dealing in securities, contracts and 

any other provisions and abide by all governing laws and regulations, both domestic and international.

Performance

We have not received any monetary fines, non-monetary sanctions, or have any open cases on social and economic 

non-compliance in FY2018.

Future Outlook

We aim to maintain zero cases of social and economic non-compliance in our operations.

KIM HENG OFFSHORE &amp; MARINE HOLDINGS LIMITED 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2018






Financial Stability

Why it is material

Our industry is going through a cyclical downturn and maintaining financial stability is crucial to stay in business and 

serve our stakeholders. 

Management Approach

We strive to maintain our financial performance, particularly by improving our cash flows and lowering our credit risk. 

Performance

In FY2018, the oil price recovered to a high of US$85 at one point driven by geo-political factors. This helped to lift 

demand for our services and vessel chartering that support the rig business.  With this slight recovery of our industry, 

the Group’s revenue increased by 38.7% year-on-year (“y-o-y”) to S$38.1 million in FY2018. This was a result of 

an increase in vessel trading sales, higher equipment rental &amp; sales, and greater demand for chartering of vessels. 

Despite this revenue growth, gross profit margins decreased from 20% to 14% as a consequence of decreased 

contribution from the Group’s higher margin businesses. Cost of sales also rose in-line with our revenue.

This resulted in a net loss of S$13.5 million in FY2018 compared to net loss of S$15.3 million in FY2017. The 

improvement in Kim Heng’s net loss position was due to a decrease in impairment losses from plant and equipment 

as the Group recorded a one-off non-cash impairment on plant and equipment of S$3.6 million in FY2017.

Future Outlook

After years of tough market conditions and long period of uncertainty in the Oil and Gas sector since 2014, we have 

turned to alternative sectors in search of other marine contract works for repairs and maintenance of vessels and 

rigs that support the offshore drilling and production. The Group has developed its value chain and strengthened 

its engineering capability into marine civil works in horizontal directional drilling (HDD), subsea cable installations. 

Further, the Group has plans to embark on business ventures in the defense and renewable wind energy sectors. 

Importantly, a continued recovery of drilling activity in 2019 and the return of previously sanctioned projects hopefully 

will support a return to robust growth in 2020. Recovery is thus expected in established areas like Malaysia, India, 

Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Middle East despite current uncertainty.  

Other strategic developments made in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 include the incorporation of multiple 

subsidiaries in Malaysia such as wholly-owned subsidiary, Kim Heng Marine Labuan Limited and the 49%-owned 

Ruhm Mazu Sdn. Bhd. with its three wholly-owned subsidiaries. These subsidiaries extend our offshore capabilities 

through a near market, near customer strategy, to comply with the local regulations, ensuring quick accessibility to 

the Group’s customers. 

Despite the challenging economic conditions and the uncertainty faced by the business, the Group is cognizant of 

the importance to solidify our business and to develop new capabilities in order to stay competitive. The Group will 

also endeavour to capture new opportunities in order to sustain growth in the long term. Looking towards 2019, we 

are happy to announce that we have secured various fabrication jobs valued at an aggregate of S$7 million from a 

well-established customer. The projects are scheduled to take place over 6 months, commencing in the first quarter 

of 2019.

We are confident that these developments position us better for the eventual upturn of the industry. Moving forward, 

Kim Heng will focus on the expansion of its operational capabilities to take on higher-margin and more diverse 

engineering and fabrication projects such as in the renewable wind energy sector, HDD and defense sectors. The 

Group will also remain committed to the implementation of its cost cutting initiatives to effectively control costs, and 

to prudently identify strategic investment opportunities in the industry.
