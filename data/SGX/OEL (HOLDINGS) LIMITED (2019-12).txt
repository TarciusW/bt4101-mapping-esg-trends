CORPORATE PROFILE 

 

OEL (Holdings) Limited (“OEL” or the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) 

is an investment holding company with operations mainly in the rental of a property for the 

financial year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”).   

 

OEL was established in Singapore in 1984. On 1 December 1994, OEL was listed on the Catalist 

Board of Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited.  On 16 December 2019, a significant 

change in corporate ownership took place where Dr Zhang Jian (“Dr Zhang”) had acquired 20.70% 

of the Company.  At the Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM”) held on 1 April 2020, OEL had 

obtained the shareholders’ approval for the proposed diversification of business to include new 

business in the health industry, such as Healthcare Business and Health Education Business. 

 

Between 20 January 2020 and 28 February 2020, Ms Zhao Xin (“Ms Zhao”) joined the Company as 

Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director, together with Ms Wang Jue (“Ms Wang”), the 

Executive Director and two other independent directors, Mr Lam Kwong Fai (“Mr Lam”) and Mr Yap 

Koon Loong (“Mr Yap”).  

 

On 4 May 2020, OEL appointed Dr Zhang as a Chairman and Executive Director of the Company and 

re-designated Mr Lam as our Lead Independent Director. 

 

Together they have formed a newly revamped and highly efficient board of directors (“Board”), 

leading the Company into its next phase of exciting developments.

BOARD STATEMENT   

 

At OEL, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of Environmental, Social and Governance 

practices within our organisation. This sustainability report for FY2019 (“SR2019”) is our third sustainability 

report.   

 

While we are taking subsequent steps in our sustainability journey, we will continue to drive our corporate 

sustainability.  

 

The Board, having considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, determined the 

material environmental, social and corporate governance factors (“ESG factors”) and overseen the 

management and monitoring of the material ESG factors for FY2019. During the year in review, the Board 

had assessed the materiality matrix and found that there was no requirement to include additional or to 

remove existing material factors. The materiality matrix and its importance to stakeholders would be 

reviewed in our next sustainability report for the financial year ending 31 December 2020 (“SR2020”).  

 

We believe our sustainable growth and success is only possible with the sustainable development of the 

communities we operate in, be it social, business or national communities. As such, the Group will continue 

to explore and evaluate business opportunities (including but not limited to strategic investments, 

partnerships, or mergers and acquisitions) that have the potential to generate value for the shareholders. 

 

The Group is committed to act in the best interest of all our shareholders through the continuing effort of 

being financially prudent while managing our operational and strategic risks. The Group endeavors to align 

these long-term interests with that of our stakeholders. 

 

Lastly, the Group continues to view our human capital as its long-term investment and a key to the 

sustainable success of the Group. We are committed to invest in strengthening our depth of the 

management team.

SCOPE OF REPORT 

 

During the year, we adopted a formal reporting approach by applying the international reporting 

framework, Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, in preparing for the SR2019.  For reference to 

the GRI Content Index, please refer to Pages 15 to 17. 

 

No external assurance was sought for the preparation of this SR2019. 

 

 

OUR STRATEGIC APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

 

With our vision and corporate values in mind, we aim to integrate sustainability into the businesses of OEL 

systematically and seamlessly. Where possible, we try to incorporate sustainability considerations into our 

decision-making processes. 

 

Our sustainability efforts are led by our senior management which ensures that the Company’s business 

objectives are in line with our commitments to sustainable development. Senior management is 

responsible for on-going communication to the Board. 

 

For FY2019, the Group’s senior management has determined the areas where OEL can have the most 

significant economic, environmental and social impacts, and the areas that are important to our 

stakeholders.  

 

The Group aims to seek the opinion of internal and external stakeholders either formally or informally. We 

aspire to understand the needs and expectations of our key stakeholders and strive to build mutually 

beneficial relationships. 

 

Moving forward, as the business direction of the Group has changed, the Board will review targets and the 

materiality matrix to see if they will still be relevant to the Group. 

 

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE 

 

 

 

The Board is supported by three Board committees to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities and to 

enhance the Company’s corporate governance framework. These committees include the Audit 

Committee, the Nominating Committee and the Remuneration Committee (each, a “Board Committee” 

and collectively, “Board Committees”).  The Chairman manages the business of the Board while the Chief 

Executive Officer (“CEO”) and her management team execute the Board’s decisions. The CEO has executive 

responsibilities for the Group’s businesses and is accountable to the Board.

Each Board Committee has its specific terms of reference (“TOR”) setting out their composition, scope of 

duties and responsibilities, rules and regulations, authorities delegated by the Board, and procedures 

governing how it is to operate and how decisions are to be taken. Any change to the TOR for any Board 

Committee requires the Board’s approval.  

 

For remuneration matters of senior management, it is the purview and responsibilities of the 

Remuneration Committee and no remuneration consultants were engaged when determining 

remuneration in FY2019. 

 

More information on the CEO, Board and its committees can be found in the respective sections of the 

Board Committees in the Company’s annual report for FY2019 from pages 3 to 4 and 8 to 23.

This SR2019 covers data and information from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. It discusses OEL’s 

achievements and performance towards Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues. This report

ACCOUNTABILITY TO STAKEHOLDERS 

 

We strive to be a responsible corporate citizen by working closely with our stakeholders to understand 

their concerns and feedback. The stakeholder engagement provides valuable information for our 

sustainability reporting, particularly in determining the material environmental and social issues.  

 

We will continue to engage our external stakeholders to identify areas that are material, sustainable and 

necessary for future development.

ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY 

 

We continue to operate in Singapore and manage our operations following our sustainability principles. 

We work closely with our management and staff to identify and consider any sustainability opportunities 

and risks that may arise. 

 

Sustainability trends such as climate change, resource scarcity and demographic changes shape the 

competitive environment in which companies like OEL operate. We therefore view our business 

performance beyond short term gains and financial bottom line. Our conviction is to achieve a balanced 

triple bottom line (People, Profit, Planet) for sustained growth of the organisation and the community it 

operates in. 

 

The success of our business is highly dependent on the commitment of our management and staff.  Their 

knowledge, professional expertise and their job satisfaction are crucial to our economic sustainability.  

 

More importantly, we strive to contribute positively to society through our economic presence, while 

maintaining good stewardship of the resources we manage and generating good shareholders’ value. 

 

Our business model focuses on cost-effectiveness without compromising our service level and a high 

priority on customer’s interest.  We strive to maintain our market position by ensuring we gain the trust of 

our customers, and continually build our reputation and brand name in the business community in 

Singapore.  

 

As the Group derives its income mainly from the rental in FY2019, the usage of local suppliers and service 

providers for our operation in Singapore is negligible. Nevertheless, the Group is committed to support our 

local suppliers.

In today’s highly volatile business environment, OEL has diligently embraced prudent financial 

management, capitalised on our assets and investments, and remained focused on growth strategies, to 

enhance shareholders’ value.

report for FY2019 issued via the SGX-ST website on 15 April 2020.

LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 

Corporate governance and compliance have always been one of the top priorities for the Company.  The 

decision-making process of the Company is strictly in line with legal and regulatory requirements and in 

compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 issued by Monetary Authority of Singapore and 

the Companies Act (Chapter 50) of Singapore. 

 

The Company has not received any correspondences or notifications concerning non-compliance of legal 

and regulatory requirements of any government or regulatory of agencies in FY2019.  

 

The Audit Committee received no whistle-blowing letters in FY2019. 

 

 

ETHICS &amp; INTEGRITY 

 

We promote an ethical and “act with integrity” culture throughout the Company. We seek to conduct our 

business in an ethical manner and compliance with the best practices in the industry.  

 

OEL (Holdings) Limited – Sustainability Report 2019  

Page 7 of 17 


 

 

All staff are required to comply with our principles set in the employment contract fully. The Employee 

Handbook details our expected standards of employee’s behaviour towards our business partners whom 

we have business dealings with, to the people in the society whom we serve and towards each other as 

employees of the Company. Above all, we are inculcated with strong corporate values to act with 

integrity. 

 

 

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-FRAUD 

 

With a zero-tolerance policy to bribery and corruption, we put in place monitoring and management 

control systems to detect bribery, fraud or other malpractice activities directly at the source. We have 

established a whistle-blowing mechanism for employees and any other concerned stakeholders such as 

customers and their families, suppliers, competitors and contractors.  

 

A direct whistle-blowing channel has also been implemented to enable our employees and concerned 

stakeholders to get direct access to our Audit Committee Chairman and Lead Independent Director.  

 

Our stakeholders can reach our Audit Committee Chairman and Lead Independent Director via email: 

whistleblower@ohldg.com.  

 

The Group also confirms that there was no monetary incentive or equivalent provided to any politically 

exposed person or political parties to secure any contract in FY2019. 

 

 

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

 

The Group is proactive in ensuring its compliance with all relevant laws and regulations in Singapore. Our 

management team is responsible for the review and monitoring of the Company’s policies and practices 

with respect to legal and regulatory requirements. Any non-compliance of the relevant laws and 

regulations and the proposed resolutions will be reported to the Board of Directors on a need basis. 

 

The Group has put in place policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the relevant laws and 

regulations. At the corporate level, we also ensure that we are in comply, both in substance and in spirit, 

with the Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist of the SGX-ST, the Securities and Futures Act and the 

Singapore Companies Act.  

 

Any new enactment of or changes to the relevant laws and regulations will be communicated to all staff 

via emails and small group meetings.  Such communication is necessary to ensure that all staff are aware 

of the changes and can carry out the necessary steps and actions to ensure compliance.  

 

While we seek to leverage our data to serve our customers responsibly, we adhere to and uphold the 

Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).  

 

There was no incidence of product and service misinformation and labelling or marketing 

communications reported in FY2019. 

 

 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

 

The Group recognises the importance of risk management and how business risks may adversely affect 

OEL’s business performance.  It is the responsibility of the Audit Committee as appointed by the Board of 

Directors to oversee the effectiveness of our risk management and internal controls. 

 

OEL (Holdings) Limited – Sustainability Report 2019  

Page 8 of 17 


 

 

Further information on the Group’s Risk Management can be found under the “Corporate Governance 

Report” and “Financial Statement” of the Group in its annual report for FY2019. 

 

Target: 

There was no change to the previous target set. However, as the current finance manager 

has left since early 2020, the CEO will assume the role of assisting the Audit Committee in 

coordinating the internal audit and risk management while Management actively looking 

for a replacement for the finance manager.  

 

Meantime, the Audit Committee would continue to receive updates from the internal 

auditors who is performing their internal audit review to surface any lapses or issues found 

during their internal audit cycle review. 

 

 

 

SERVICE QUALITY AND RESPONSIBILITY 

 

Our service quality and responsibility to our customers rank high for the sustainable success of the 

Company. We are committed to providing reliable and high-quality services to our customers and every 

tenant we serve.  

 

We emphasise on service excellence to every customer. Our staff serve our customers professionally and 

ethically.  We believe our business has a low impact on the environment. Nevertheless, we strive to 

embrace environmental sustainability by managing environmental conservation by adopting ‘Reduce’, 

‘Reuse’, ‘Recycle’ and energy efficient practices.  

 

As part of our initial efforts, we will align our environmental performance in our Singapore operations to 

key evaluation criterion like water and energy conservation. 

 

 

WATER AND ENERGY CONSERVATION 

 

We tap on the water supply provided by the Public Utilities Board and disposed used water into the public 

sewage system.   The energy-intensive light bulb in the security searchlights for the building were changed 

to LED lights to conserve electricity consumption. 

 

With a new tenant since January 2019, the water and electricity bills are borne by our tenant. It was agreed 

that OEL would pay a minimal of S$250 per month for water and electricity. As such, disclosure for water 

and electricity usage would no longer be meaningful. Nevertheless, as a property owner, we continue to 

make conscientious efforts to conserve water and electricity. 

 

With effect from 3 March 2020, the Company has moved its corporate office to 8 Temasek Boulevard, #23-

02 Suntec Tower Three, Singapore 038988. As such, the Company would instead report the corporate 

office’s water consumption and energy usage starting from SR2020. 

 

There was no incident of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations reported.

PAPER USAGE 

 

We have launched our Go-Green initiatives across all our operations and Corporate Office. The 

implemented initiatives aim to encourage the following 'Go-Green' initiatives in relation to our paper usage: 

 

• 

Reduce the use of papers by setting the printers to print on double-sides of each piece of paper. 

•  

Re-use single-side printed papers for non-conﬁdential and draft documents. We plan to roll out 

daily operation reports to be electronic and paperless. 

• 

We are looking into recycling all used papers, printed materials and collaterals by donating to 

authorised recycling companies. 

• 

We have an eco-friendly practice of printing only when absolutely necessary. Where possible, we 

use softcopy and read directly from the computers. 

 

For FY2019, this initiative is still ongoing.  

 

Target: 

Given the diversification of businesses, this topic and target will be reviewed. 

Nevertheless, the Company will continue to encourage our tenants to reduce their water 

and electricity consumption for FY2020. 

 

 

PEOPLE 

 

Pivotal to our success is our people performing at their best. We value the vital contribution of all 

employees towards sustaining OEL’s long term success. To underscore our care and commitment towards 

our employees, OEL drives a holistic Human Resource (“HR”) strategy focused on fair remuneration and 

equal opportunities, training and development, employee wellness and engagement, and work-life 

harmony.  

 

We plan to improve on our HR policies to go beyond compliance with labour laws in Singapore to develop 

and implement policies and staff engagement programmes that aim to help employees build long-term, 

fulfilling careers with OEL. Given the need to attract talent, senior management team would concurrently 

review these HR policies and remuneration scheme to ensure that our talent is paid to prevailing market 

rates.

DIVERSITY &amp; EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 

 

Identifying, recognising and rewarding quality employees is essential in our hiring and retention strategy. 

We advocate fair employment practices by ensuring equal opportunities for recruitment, fair 

compensation, career progression and training opportunities. We provide fair employment opportunities 

to all, regardless of age, gender, race, or nationality. 

 

There is a fair proportion of male and female employees. We ensure that fair work practices and 

remuneration are evaluated based on each employee’s work performance. Any form of discrimination is 

not tolerated within our organisation. In FY0219, there has been no incident of discrimination. 

 

 

 

OEL maintains a fair and open employment policy through providing fair employment opportunities to 

both young and older workers above 65 years old. For FY2019, OEL has 3 employees. All staff are reviewed 

under the annual staff appraisal which is based on their performance.  

 

 

 

The Company, from time to time, uses professional HR firms or external network for recruitment 

purposes. In addition, the Company also tries to develop its own internal talent pool development by 

encouraging talented employees to take on more diverse job responsibilities within the organisation.  

 

The Company also believes in having various retention approaches to its manpower needs besides 

developing talent internally, like through hiring of young talents such as interns, encourages mid-career 

switches and hiring experienced employees. In terms of employee skills profile, we have maintained a 

good proportion of management and staff to lead and drive the business growth for our Company. 

 

Our business is dependent on senior experienced staff who have been in investment and other 

businesses. Dr Zhang, Ms Zhao and Ms Wang collectively have enough professional expertise and 

maintains strong customer relationships to drive the growth of OEL.

We recruit talents, particularly younger talents and grooming them through mentorship and on-the-job 

training programmes on a need basis. Our recruitment policy is based on the pre-requisite skills and 

academic qualifications required to perform the required job scope. During recruitment, we have 

implemented a stringent shortlisting process to ensure that we recruit people with the same values as us. 

 

 

 

We aim to focus on retention of talents by providing fair and sustainable financial and non-financial 

incentives and learning and development opportunities. Our compensation and benefits policies are 

determined by guidelines proposed by our human resource team and approved by the Remuneration 

Committee of our Board. All our staff undergo annual performance review and receive periodic 

performance feedbacks from their superiors. 

 

 

EMPLOYEE WELLNESS &amp; BENEFITS 

 

The Company also contributes to the Central Provident Fund Scheme, and provides medical benefits such 

as hospitalisation and surgical plans for all our staff. We offer maternity as well as paternity leave in 

accordance to the recommendations of the Ministry of Manpower of Singapore.  

 

We also believe that staff retention and productivity can both be improved through the personal

Target: 

The Group would be reviewing the training hours of employees given the turnover of 

employees after FY2019. The intended target to increase the total and average employee 

training hours over the next 1 to 3 years would also be reviewed.  

 

 

HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 

The Group is committed to embracing high standards of Workplace, Safety and Health (“WSH”) and 

environmental practices and inculcating the best practices in OEL. We are guided by the steadfast 

commitment to our employees for a safe working environment in which one can work and excel with full 

confidence. 

 

So far, there has been no reportable health and safety compliance issues. 

 

Target: 

As the Group is diversifying outside of the rental business, the timeline to have a BizSafe 

certification to awarded by WSH within the next 1-3 years would be reviewed.  

 

 

LABOUR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS 

 

It is essential to have effective communication between management and employees so that employees 

are more engaged with the organisation and have a more positive attitude towards their work and loyalty 

to OEL. They are provided with frequent management updates and adequate notice period regarding 

operational changes.  

 

We often engage our employees in the following ways: 

 

• 

Monthly Meetings 

Monthly meetings with the management team to review the operations. 

• 

Quarterly Meetings 

Quarterly meetings for the Board of Directors to discuss business development and financial 

performance. 

• 

Informal Small Group Meetings 

Small group meetings are often held by management to listen and understand our employees’ 

concerns and grievances.
