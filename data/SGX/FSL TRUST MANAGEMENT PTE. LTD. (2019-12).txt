MESSAGE FROM 

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Global shipping is the backbone of world trade and the global supply chain, 

connecting marketplaces and creating jobs and prosperity across societies. Seaborne 

transportation is the environmentally friendliest mean of transporting large quantities 

of goods over long distances, saving millions of tons of CO2 emissions compared 

to other means of transportation. Yet, we recognise that the shipping industry is a 

significant contributor to GHG emissions and every market participant, including 

ourselves, needs to play its role in the global effort to reduce the emission of GHG 

and create a sustainable future for our children.

For us, sustainability requires continuous effort and does not stop at environmental 

considerations, but we follow a holistic approach including best labour practices 

and a commitment to sound governance practices. Hence, the sustainability of our 

operations, in all its aspects, has been a critical consideration in everything we do 

and is embedded in our corporate strategy and our fleet strategy. We believe this 

holistic approach to sustainability will also support our future economic performance 

and create long-term value for our unitholders.

In 2019, we have further improved our performance with regards to the sustainability 

of our activities. This includes the further improvement of our operational 

performance with an improvement of our port state control deficiency ratio, but 

also zero oil spills and zero lost time injuries. We have worked with our technical 

managers to prepare our vessels to comply with the IMO 2020 regulation on 

sulphur emissions and all operating vessels switched to low sulphur fuels by the 

end of the year 2019. Furthermore, we entered into agreements to sell older, less 

environmentally friendly vessels, which did not only create value for our unitholders, 

but improved our environmental footprint, in addition to the order of 2 modern, fuel 

efficient Tier III LR2 product tankers newbuildings which will be fitted with exhaust 

gas cleaning systems, in December 2018 already.

Our industry is driven and affected by external factors, a rapidly changing 

environment and strict regulations. We are committed to proactively address the 

challenges to the sustainability of our activities and work towards minimizing our 

impact on the environment.

ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

We have first started with the periodic reporting of sustainability aspects of First 

Ship Lease Trust (“FSL Trust” or the “Trust”) in the annual report for the financial 

year 2013 and introduced a dedicated annual sustainability report in 2018. The 

last report was published on 31 May 2019. This is our 3rd annual sustainability 

report and addresses the significant environmental, social and governance (ESG) 

aspects of the business of FSL Trust for the financial year 2019 (1 January 2019 

to 31 December 2019), unless otherwise indicated. The scope of this report covers 

material ESG issues and considerations of FSL Trust and its trustee manager, FSL 

Trust Management Pte. Ltd. (“FSL Trust Management” or the “Trustee-Manager”), 

which includes operational aspects, aspects of the governance followed, social 

aspects and environmental aspects. We consider the standards published by the 

internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to be a suitable and 

robust framework for the reporting of ESG issues and this report is our first report 

that has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. Through 

identifying the material issues, the application of the GRI Standards ensures the 

ESG issues discussed in this report are relevant, consistent and comparable. This 

report also addresses the reporting requirements of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) 

on sustainability reporting and has been prepared by the Trustee-Manager without 

obtaining external assurance.

ABOUT OUR APPROACH 

TO SUSTAINABILITY

The shipping industry carries a multitude of risks related to spills, health and safety, 

emissions and others. We follow a holistic approach to sustainability, which is an 

ongoing effort, to frame our corporate citizenship. To better understand the impact 

of our activities on our ecosystem of stakeholders and to identify the material issues 

relating to economic, environmental and social aspects, we have considered the 

United Nations Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable 

Development Goals and conducted a materiality assessment along the lines of the 

GRI’s core principles.

Of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, we have identified 4 goals that are of 

particular relevance to the shipping industry and where we, as a ship-owner, can 

have the highest impact:

ABOUT OUR APPROACH

TO SUSTAINABILITY

OUR STAKEHOLDERS

We recognise that we work in an ecosystem with a variety 

of different stakeholders and as we are part of the supply 

chain of our customers whilst other stakeholders are part of 

our supply chain. Hence, our stakeholders have an influence 

on the sustainability of our operations and vice versa. We 

have considered all relevant stakeholders of FSL Trust in 

determining the sustainability strategy and we have established 

an approach for the ongoing engagement with our stakeholders 

to better understand the impact and sustainability of what we 

do. The engagement with our stakeholders varies depending 

on the subject and we engage with our stakeholders on a 

frequent or infrequent, periodic or ad hoc-basis. The feedback 

we receive from our stakeholders is a valuable tool for us 

to identify potential risks and opportunities as well as to 

understand the effectiveness of our work and approach to 

sustainability in our effort to constantly improve.

regulation

• Vessel maintenance

• Pollution

• Technology and fleet strategy

• Staff – fair pay &amp; benefits 

• Employee training &amp; qualifications

• Health &amp; Safety – high quality operations 

to avoid accidents at sea

• Board of Directors and Senior 

Management

• Policies and internal controls, including

OUR TARGETS AND PROGRESS MADE

We frequently set specific targets in 

relation to aspects of sustainability 

which we work towards. Whilst many 

of the targets are a continuous effort, 

there are a few specific things we wish 

to report:

• Adoption of GRI Standards: We 

communicated that we want to 

adopt GRI Standards for future 

reporting on sustainability, to 

uplift the substance and quality 

of our sustainability reporting, but 

to also provide us a better tool to 

reflect on our efforts in relation to 

sustainability aspects. This is our 

first sustainability report that has 

been prepared in accordance with 

GRI Standards: Core option.

• In the reporting period 1 January 

2019 to 31 December 2019, 

we have disposed one older, less 

environmentally friendly vessel, 

FSL Hamburg. We have furthermore 

entered into agreements to sell 2 

more older, less environmentally 

friendly vessels, FSL Perth and 

FSL Piraeus, which were delivered 

to their buyers in January 2020. 

The disposals of the older, less 

environmental friendly tonnage, in 

addition to the order of 2 modern, 

fuel efficient Tier III LR2 product 

tanker newbuildings, which will be 

fitted with exhaust gas cleaning 

systems, in December 2018 already, 

helps us to reduce our GHG emission 

and improve our environmental 

footprint.

We want to further improve the 

sustainability of our activities. 

Specifically, we want to:

• further integrate sustainability 

aspects in our corporate strategy;

• develop clear KPIs to better measure 

and manage the sustainability of our 

activities; and

• further enhance our reporting on 

sustainability issues.

OUR BOARD COMMITTEES

In fulfilling its duties, the BoD is supported by different committees, namely the 

Audit and Risk Committee, the Nominating Committee and the Remuneration 

Committee which have been delegated with specific authority.

Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”)

The ARC is responsible for, amongst other things, a) reviewing significant financial 

reporting matters and judgements so as to ensure integrity of the financial statements 

and any announcements, and b) monitoring and evaluating the adequacy and 

effectiveness of our internal controls and appointment of the internal auditor.

Nominating Committee (“NC”)

The NC is responsible for, amongst other things, a) identifying and recommending 

to the BoD candidates for nomination for appointment as directors and/or key 

management personnel and the different committees, and b) reviewing the structure, 

size and composition of the BoD and making recommendations for any adjustments 

deemed necessary. The NC comprises 3 independent directors.

Remuneration Committee (“RC”)

The RC is responsible for, amongst other things, a) reviewing and recommending

OUR POLICIES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

We have a number of policies and practices in place to cover significant aspect of 

our operations, including risk management. These policies and practices help us to 

comply with laws and regulations, reduce the risk of incidents and improve the way 

we work.

Risk Management

Our risk management policies are designed to help us to identify, understand, 

measure and manage risks related to our operations, the markets we operate in, the 

counterparties we work with and the assets we own.

Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct covers a variety of matters including, but not limited to, conflicts 

of interest, discrimination and harassment and anti-corruption and provides our 

people with a comprehensive framework of our principles and values and the culture 

and conduct we want to follow. One of the cornerstones of our code of conduct is 

that we do not tolerate any unethical or illegal behaviour of any of our members 

of staff, the Senior Management or directors. Combined with the whistle-blowing 

policy we have in place, the code of conduct is an efficient tool for us to prevent 

conflicts of interest, fraud or any other malpractices.

ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

12


OUR POLICIES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS (CONT’D) 

Whistle-Blowing

We have a whistle-blowing policy in place that provides a framework for our people 

as well as any other persons, such as customers, business partners and other 

external parties to raise concerns regarding possible improprieties in the conduct of 

our business activities, financial reporting or other malpractices directly to the ARC. 

No such matter or any other violation of our code of conduct was raised to the ARC 

in the reporting period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019.

The policies are frequently reviewed by the senior management and updated with 

recommendations made to the ARC for approval as appropriate.

BDO LLP, an independent public accounting firm, has been appointed to carry out 

the internal audit function, reporting to the ARC. Within its mandate, BDO LLP 

conducts a comprehensive internal audit every year and submits its audit report 

to the ARC. The audit report includes observations and recommendations how to 

strengthen the internal control framework of the Trust and the Trustee-Manager.

OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING

FSL Trust publishes audited annual financial statements on a consolidated basis. 

The last audited annual financial statements were for the financial year ended 31 

December 2019 and include a list of all subsidiaries of the Trust on page 82 (note 

5 to the financial statements). The annual financial statements of FSL Trust are 

audited by Moore Stephens LLP, an independent public accounting firm.

FSL Trust also publishes unaudited interim financial statements on a quarterly 

basis.

ABOUT OUR OPERATIONS

As a ship-owner, we own a fleet of vessels that are chartered to 

international shipping companies or deployed in pools. 

OUR FLEET

As at 31 December 2019, the vessel portfolio of FSL Trust 

comprised 18 operating vessels, including containerships 

and a variety of tankers, and 2 tanker newbuildings under 

construction. The vessels are deployed in the international 

seaborne transportation and carry cargoes such as crude oil, 

refined oil products, chemical products, other liquid bulk 

cargoes as well as containerized cargoes. 

Of the 18 operating vessels, 10 vessels were chartered to 

international shipping companies on fixed-rate period 

bareboat charters, whilst 8 vessels were employed on short-

term time charters or in pools (8 vessels as at 31 December 

2019). The 2 tanker newbuildings under construction are 

expected to be delivered to FSL Trust in late 2020 and early 

2021, respectively.

The weighted average age, based on DWT, of our fleet 

including the 2 newbuildings was approximately 9 years as at 

31 December 2019.

Subsequent to the reporting period, through the disposal of 

2 product tankers and 1 crude oil tanker in the 1st quarter of 

2020, the fleet has been reduced to 15 operating vessels and 

2 newbuildings under construction with a weighted average 

age of 9 years as at the publishing date of this report.

TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT OF OUR VESSELS

Depending on the type of employment, the technical management of the vessels is 

either conducted by the charterer or technical managers we have appointed.

Of the 18 operating vessels in our fleet as at 31 December 2019, 10 vessels were 

technically managed by their charterers whilst 8 vessels were technically managed 

by technical managers appointed by us. The charter agreements for the vessels 

technically managed by their charterers require the charterers to comply with 

all applicable international laws and regulations, which includes environmental 

regulations. Similarly, the technical managers we have appointed for vessels 

follow all the international laws and regulations, have appropriate policies and 

procedures in place, including policies and procedures for health and safety as well 

as environmental protection, and hold all necessary certifications.

The technical managers have been selected based on rigid criteria and we constantly 

monitor their performance and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

Amongst other things, the technical managers are responsible to comply with all 

regulatory, class and flag state requirements for our vessels managed by them and 

the employment of the crews on board of our vessels.

We closely monitor the operational performance of our vessels, the maintenance and 

repairs carried out by the technical managers and the budget control of operating 

expenses and capital expenditures. Working with different technical managers 

furthermore allows us to benchmark the performance and cost efficiency. Where 

appropriate and in line with industry standards, we agree KPIs with the technical 

managers in relation to compliance with laws and regulations as well as operational 

aspects of the management. 

In 2019, our technical managers were:

• Columbia Shipmanagement (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. 

(www.columbia-shipmanagement.com)

• Prime Tanker Management Inc. 

(www.prime-marine.net)

• Thome Ship Management Pte. Ltd. 

(www.thome.com.sg)

• Wallem Shipmanagement Limited 

(www.wallem.com)

Our technical managers receive a remuneration for their services in accordance with 

market standards.

ABOUT OUR OPERATIONS

FIRST SHIP LEASE TRUST

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

In addition to working with our charterers and technical managers, we work with 

commercial managers which are responsible for managing the pools some of our 

vessels are part of. These commercial managers are responsible for the chartering 

of these vessels and receive a remuneration for their services in accordance with 

market standards. 

We furthermore have a variety of other suppliers and service providers for different 

aspects of our activities whereby the relevant internal policies apply.

We are dedicated to promoting sustainable practices within our supply chain with 

regards to quality, environmental and social standards and ethical behaviour.

OUR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE

Port state controls are a key indicator for compliance with international laws and 

regulations. Whilst the number of port state controls our vessels were undergoing 

increased by 26% y-o-y, the average port state control deficiency ratio improved 

from 1.55 in 2018 to 1.10 in 2019, which is significantly better than the Paris 

MoU average. None of the deficiencies had an environmental impact and none of 

our vessels was detained.

All classification societies for our vessels are highly reputable and members of the 

International Association of Classification Societies (IACS). Our vessels fly flags 

which are on the white lists of the Paris MoU and the Tokyo MoU and all these flags 

are so called flags of convenience.

In 2019, we had zero lost time injuries (LTI) and zero oil spills.
