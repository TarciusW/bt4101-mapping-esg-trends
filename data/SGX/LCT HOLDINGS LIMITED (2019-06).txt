Letter from the Chairman 

Mr Du Junqi 

Executive Chairman  

 

Dear Valued Stakeholders, 

In today’s rapidly changing business climate, sustainable 

development is a priority and a critical success factor for 

companies in ensuring long-term value creation. The Group 

recognises the importance and value of aligning strategies to 

meet stakeholders’ needs as well as having an established and 

consistent sustainability reporting framework.  

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), it is my pleasure to present the second 

Sustainability Report (the “Report”) of the Group. In this Report, we continue to discuss the 

challenges and material issues that are important to our stakeholders, the strategies that we have 

adopted in managing these challenges and issues, as well as how we positioned ourselves to 

capitalise on future opportunities. Sustainability developments are championed by our senior 

management team, with the Board providing oversight. Our senior management team continues to 

make an active effort in ensuring that our sustainability initiatives are executed in an effective and 

efficient manner in order for the Group to achieve its sustainability goals, which are in line with our 

strategic and business objectives. The Board will continue to instil the concept of sustainability 

within our business operations and remains committed in creating long term positive impact for our 

stakeholders.

and lead by example. The Group is committed to conduct our business in an ethically driven, socially

relationship in the years to come.

About Us  

LCT Holdings Limited, formerly known as Longcheer Holdings Limited, was incorporated in Bermuda 

in 2004 with our principal place of business in the People’s Republic of China (“China”). Our principal 

activities are focused on property investment and management. LCT was successfully listed on the 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Mainboard on 13 May 2005.  

 

With the paradigm shift of business models across the globe from a product-centric era to the 

current customer-centric era, LCT managed to adapt and innovate these developments into our 

business model through our exit from the electronics industry to that of property investment and 

providing consultancy and value-added services. With China being the global leader in the high tech 

industry with a thriving start-up community, we have since completed the acquisition of 80% equity 

interest in Shanghai Xiyun Information Technology Services Co., Ltd in June 2019 which would focus 

on information technology consultancy services to start-up technology companies in Shanghai, China.  

 

Our Vision and Mission 

 

LCT’s Board and management will continue to oversee the operations of the Group, and ensure that 

we uphold honour and integrity in all our business dealings. The Group will also maintain our 

commitment to seek out and capitalise on opportunities that have the potential to provide our 

shareholders long term value. 

 

Stakeholder value creation has always been our mission since incorporation, and shall continue to be 

the main driving force behind our business decisions. Our acquisition of Shanghai Xiyun Information 

Technology Services Co. Ltd. In June 2019 has expanded the Group’s services to include professional 

information technology consultancy services. LCT strives to be the market leaders for the industries 

that we are in, taking into multiple aspects including service quality, variety and market outreach. 

 

Our People – LCT’s most valued asset 

 

LCT believes that our achievements today will always be due to the hard work and passion 

contributed by our people. LCT pledges to ensure that we are able to cultivate and nurture a working 

environment that is safe to work in, while being inclusive and forward looking at the same time. LCT 

views effort in this direction as an investment in human capital, which will propel the Group to 

future heights. LCT upholds and honours fair employment practices and provide ample of 

opportunities to our employees to progress.

Supply Chain Management 

 

LCT principal activity is investment holding as such our procurement activities revolve around goods 

and services which are mainly used to assist in our day-to-day operations, including printing, rental 

of office, recruitment and other ancillary services. Nonetheless, the Group has in place a 

procurement policy which sets out a fair and transparent process for supplier selection including 

criteria and basis for selection such as cost effectiveness and operational efficiency. Where possible, 

the Group will purchase locally and domestically made products. Due diligence process is also 

conducted on our suppliers for the assessment of their track record, quality of services and 

reputation. 

 

External Initiatives 

 

In 2015, the Group helped to build the Sakya County Secondary School in Tibet. This initiative has 

effectively improved the outreach of education in the region. Since then, the school has greatly 

improved the lives of students and families in the Sakya County, which is closely in line with LCT’s 

value that efforts in building human capital will always be an investment in the future and an 

expense. Moving forward, LCT will continue to encourage our employees to participate in various 

charitable initiatives in order to make a difference to the community which we operate in.

Governance at LCT 

 

The Group believes that governance establishes the tone for the organisation, ensuring 

accountability, transparency, ethical business conduct and maximisation of long term shareholder 

value and increasing the value of the company. The Board and the management are wholly 

dedicated to uphold the highest standard of corporate governance, professional business conduct, 

integrity and commitment throughout the organisation. It is committed to upholding the highest 

standard of corporate governance. 

 

The Group adheres to the principles and guidelines of the Code of Corporate Governance 2012 (the 

“Code”) issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the “MAS”), which forms the continuing 

obligations of the listing manual of SGX-ST. The Board also ensures that the Group is updated on 

other regulations, notices, circulars, and guidelines that may be released by the MAS and the SGX-ST 

from time to time, and seek regulatory guidance where necessary. 

 

The Board oversees the governance of risk and is fully aware of the need to put in place a sound 

system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard the shareholders’ interests and the 

Group’s assets. Internal monitoring and review processes have been established to assess the 

adequacy and the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems put in place, including 

financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls and risk management 

systems. The Audit Committee (“AC”) reviews each transaction with the Group’s interested persons, 

ensuring that each transaction is executed at arm’s length basis and hence, not prejudicial to the 

interests of the Group and shareholders, before making its recommendation to the Board for 

approval. There were no interested person transactions in the year under review. 

 

LCT have a whistle-blowing policy in place which provides a safe avenue for our people and any 

other persons to raise in confidence, their concerns about possible improprieties, fraudulent 

activities and malpractices within the Group responsibly, regarding financial, operational or 

compliance aspects. LCT does not tolerate corruption in any form or manner. The Group views 

malpractices seriously and will carry out independent investigations when necessary. LCT is proud to 

announce that we have not received any reports of malpractices in all aspects of our business, and 

will strive to maintain this record through the strict upholding of honourable business practices and 

integrity-centred business decisions.

our environment.

Stakeholder Engagement 

LCT’s business operations impact multiple stakeholder groups, including those with a vested interest 

in our business operations. For FY2019, LCT continues to actively engage our stakeholders, and

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

The Group is dedicated to deliver long term economic value to our stakeholders, through sound 

financial stewardship and maintaining a suitable and sustainable business portfolio. 

 

For FY2019, LCT is delighted to announce a 5% year-on-year increase in revenue as compared to 4% 

in the previous year, despite the backdrop of a slow economic growth, interest rate pressure and a 

weakening stock market in China. The increase in revenue is attributable to the Xi’an investment 

property, which was leased to our business partners in the science and education industries, thereby 

achieving higher average rental rate upon lease renewals.   

 

As we move along in this uncertain economy, which brings about pressure to the local rental market, 

the management is committed in exploring various leasing methods and new forms of operation, in 

order to sustain the development of our Group’s operations. Our upcoming targets are to pursue the 

stability of existing business and provide the rate of return as far as possible. On top of these, we 

have also try to seek new business directions and opportunities. 

 

The Board and the management will continue to exercise prudence and efficient management of 

LCT’s business operations. We seek to leverage on China’s economic transformation which brings 

about business opportunities that are in line with our long-term business vision, to embark on future 

projects and sustain our economic growth in the coming years. Moving forward, we hope that the 

Group will be able to maintain, if not increase our revenue and profit attributable to shareholders.

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

 

At LCT, we continue to emphasise our zero tolerance for 

corruption, fraud and unethical actions. The Code of Conduct 

encompasses imperative corporate principles and behavioural 

rules. It is further supplemented by guidelines for dealing with 

potential conflicts of interest. These guidelines are the drivers of 

our preventive measures against corruption, fraud and unethical 

actions. 

 

LCT has put in place a whistle blowing policy duly endorsed by the Audit Committee (“AC”) and 

approved by the Board. The policy, which has been communicated to all employees through regular 

staff meetings and trainings on business ethics and reinforcement of the potential violations 

procedures, allowing employees of the Group, in good faith and in confidence, raise concerns about 

actual or possible corporate improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters. The AC 

members will be informed directly for any matters arising from the aforementioned. The AC 

members may, in consultation with the Managing Director and/or management, direct the 

complaint to the division or department best placed to address it, or lead the investigation to ensure 

prompt and appropriate investigation and resolution. This policy also serves as a reassurance to 

whistle blowers that they are shielded from reprisals for whistleblowing in good faith. The details of 

the whistle-blowing policy and procedure have been made available to all employees.  

 

A conflict of interest policy is in place which allows directors, management and employees to 

identify situations that present potential conflicts of interest, as well as setting out procedures to 

appropriately manage conflicts in accordance with LCT’s business objectives of transparency and 

accountability. 

 

At LCT, we strictly instil our values to our employees and ensure that our stand on corruption is clear. 

In addition to the Code of Conduct, we also uphold and adhere the Code of Ethics which accentuates 

the professional business conduct and behaviour that all employees should possess. All employees 

are expected to abide by the code and perform work in a responsible and professional manner. 

Internal audits are also performed annually, thereby identifying any short comings in our controls 

that may lead to inter-alias fraud, and report adverse findings. The Group is pleased to announce 

that there was no whistle-blowing case received in FY2019.  

 

Moving forward, LCT targets to maintain our zero corruption and wrongdoings record in all aspects 

of our business as we continue to nurture an environment that upholds integrity to its highest level.

ENERGY 

 

LCT is aware of the threat posed by climate change such as the effects of greenhouse gas on the 

environment, and acknowledges that businesses need to play an active role in combating this 

environmental issue. 

 

The Group understands that proper management and regulation of our energy consumption can 

have a long lasting impact on our carbon footprint. Although the Group currently uses only energy 

from non-renewable sources, the Group is conscious of our impact and has adopted green practices 

such as inter-alias switching off the lights at our workshops and offices during lunch time, using LED 

lights, using energy efficient equipment and setting our computers to energy-saving mode. The 

increase in energy usage in FY2019 is due to the uptake of rented units which were vacant in FY2018. 

The below graph depicts our energy consumption for FY2019 and FY2018. 

 

 

 

Moving forward, the Group hopes to progressively improve our energy efficiency and consumption 

level through implementation of energy-saving policies.

for our continued success, and they are our 

most 

valuable 

assets.

value 

our 

employees and uphold ourselves through fair 

and competitive remuneration packages and

policy and management principles which 

includes primary areas such as employee

and 

cessation 

of 

employment. An employee handbook which 

contains the established policy is provided to 

all employees, and will be regularly reviewed

endeavour in aligning our business objectives 

and interests with our employee’s interests, 

we continuously seek feedback from our 

employees and ensure that their needs and 

expectations are taken into consideration for

to 

the

employees are eligible for annual appraisals 

and have subsequently undertaken this 

exercise. The Group provides our employees 

with the local government benefits, including 

healthcare benefits, maternity leave and

maternity or paternity leave taken. The Group 

is in the opinion that we have a proportionate 

mix of gender in our Group. There were no 

new hires in FY2019. The Group takes pride 

that no employees resigned during FY2019, 

and would like to thank all employees for 

their continued service and loyalty. The Group 

will continue to emphasise constant care for 

our employees through active engagement 

with them, in order to create a more well-

balanced and healthy workplace.
