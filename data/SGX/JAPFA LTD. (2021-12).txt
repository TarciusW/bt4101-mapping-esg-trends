Foreword from



 



Our CEO



“We remain confident in our long-term outlook 

as we have set a solid foundation for future 

growth being one of the most efficient and low-

cost producers, to provide safe, affordable staple 

protein foods to millions of people.”

Tan Yong Nang

Chief Executive Officer

profitability. Our sustainability philosophy has 

created a resilient approach to business that has 

carried Japfa through several agri-food cycles over 

the past fifty years. 

Reinforcing Sustainability 

We now look to sharpen our focus and further 

deepen our commitment to sustainability within 

our business, people and in our operations. We 

believe that focusing on environmental, social and 

governance will enable us to overcome challenges 

and secure our fundamental existence.  

We will reinforce sustainability through Embracing 

Technology and People Development initiatives.

Embracing Technology

We adopt modern technology to improve our 

operational efficiency, so that we can utilise our 

resources more efficiently, lower cost of our 

operations and reduce the environmental footprint. 

Embracing technology and digitalisation should 

ultimately boost productivity. More recently, our 

digital assets have increased the connectivity of 

our people, so that they can work and collaborate 

effectively amid Covid-19 lockdowns and 

movement restrictions. We will keep exploring 

opportunities to use technology and latest 

developments in our business. 

People Development

One of the initiatives is to boost sustainability 

awareness through training and to instil 

sustainability in day-to-day activities.  By 

enhancing the capacity of our people and using 

the experience over the past fifty years, we 

want to ensure that we can progress forward 

while ultimately remain grounded in Feeding 

Emerging Asia. For the past few years, we have 

set direction in the right course and built the 

foundation. We continuously facilitate our 

people with various training and development 

programmes to expand their capacity. This 

way, we could always have good people with 

the common goal to rise up to the occasion 

and lead Japfa, ready to face any challenges and 

take opportunities in the future. 

Future Outlook

With our strong fundamentals in sustainability, 

underpinned by our three key sustainability 

pillars – Efficient Production System, People 

Development and Improving Nutrition, I 

believe we are well-positioned to tackle future 

challenges. 

Japfa operates in emerging Asia, which is home 

to more than 4 billion people, or 40% of the 

total world population, where malnutrition 

is still an issue. We remain confident in our 

long-term outlook as we have set a solid 

foundation for future growth being one of 

the most efficient and low-cost producers, to 

provide safe, affordable staple protein foods 

to millions of people. 

As we move forward, we believe our approach 

to “produce locally for local consumption” 

enables us to take advantage of this 

opportunity and continue to provide affordable 

nutritious proteins. In addressing the world’s 

growing population, we believe there is always 

room for us to position our products as we 

race towards domestic self-sufficiency.

Finally, I would like to thank all our 

stakeholders in supporting Japfa over the last 

50 years. We will continue to work closely with 

our stakeholders to ride through headwinds, 

emerge stronger and together build a strong 

and sustainable future.

Dear Stakeholders, 

2021 was a special year for the Japfa Group 

as we celebrated our 50th anniversary. This 

milestone encourages us to reflect on the 

challenges and the achievements which 

have made us one of the leading animal 

protein producers in emerging Asia.

Continuing to deliver in 2021

The year had been challenging especially in the 

face of the persisting global pandemic, rising 

geopolitical tensions and climate change issues. 

Despite the challenges, Japfa delivered a solid 

performance as we surpassed the US$4 billion 

milestone in revenue. Despite high feed raw 

material costs impacting margins, EBITDA stood 

solid at above the US$500 million mark. This 

demonstrates the resilience of our business model 

in being agile in adapting to difficult situations. I 

take this opportunity to thank all of our people 

across our vertically integrated operations and 

across countries for their unwavering dedication 

and contribution in this tough year. 

Sustainability ingrained in our heritage

When Mr Ferry Santosa, our founder, established 

Japfa 50 years ago, he subtly brought in a 

sustainability philosophy, which was subsequently 

embodied in the vision of Growing Towards Mutual 

Prosperity. 

The agri-food business is inevitably subject 

to cyclicality which can affect revenue and

Dear Stakeholders, 

Looking at our sustainability journey, we 

are proud with what we have achieved in 

the last 50 years. Building on this solid 

foundation, we are moving forward 

to deepen our efforts in contributing 

towards improving nutrition and Feeding 

Emerging Asia in a sustainable manner.

With Japfa’s approach to doing business which 

emphasizes mutual prosperity to all stakeholders, 

we trust that we have made a positive impact on 

many lives. 

Providing affordable protein food to 

millions 

As a leading industrialised producer of protein 

staples, we have provided nutritious and affordable 

food to millions of people in emerging Asia.

Our  

Sustainability  

Committee



“Our social impact has been life changing; we 

just didn’t realise it.”

Kevin Monteiro

Sustainability Committee

Making Japfa a great place to work for 

almost 40,000 diverse employees 

Currently Japfa has employees spread across 

different geographies, who are the key contributors 

of our business success. With our employees we aim 

to create workplaces that respect each individual 

fairly and bring out the best in everyone. Our 

corporate culture influenced by the Company’s 

motto of Growing Towards Mutual Prosperity is 

reflected by a relatively low employee turnover rate 

(12% in 2021). 

Improving the livelihood of around 

11,000 contract farmers

In 2021, we completed a Social Life Cycle 

Assessment (LCA) where we participated as 

a road tester for a UNEP Social LCA exercise, 

which has provided us with feedback on our 

contract farmers. The exercise provided proof 

that being a contract farmer with Japfa did 

improve the farmer’s skill set, productivity, 

yields and ultimately economic livelihood. 

The majority of Japfa’s broiler chickens are 

produced by our contract farmers.  In our 

Indonesian poultry operations, we currently 

have approximately 10,000 contract farmers 

under a contract farming arrangement with 

Japfa. These contract farmers, which are 

located throughout the country, run their 

own commercial broiler farms.  Following the 

success in Indonesia, we have replicated this 

contract farming arrangement to Vietnam, 

India and Myanmar. 

Health and nutrition awareness to 

thousands of children in our flagship 

initiative Japfa for Kids

Our Japfa for Kids programme strives to 

educate young school children below 12 on 

the importance of a balanced diet for proper 

nutrition, so they can grow up healthily. 

The programme has benefited more than 

11,000 children directly in 2021. We also 

conduct other key community initiatives 

including scholarship programmes on higher 

agricultural education, nature conservation 

and community empowerment. 

 

Environmental focus areas 

Our 

Life 

Cycle 

Assessment 

identified 

environmental 

focus 

areas, 

including 

wastewater and water management. In 2021, 

our subsidiary PT Japfa Tbk issued the first 

US$-denominated Sustainability-Linked Bond 

(SLB) in Southeast Asia, which was also the 

first of its kind in the world for the agri-food 

industry. The targets set by the SLB were aimed 

at improving water circularity through the 

recycling of wastewater, to help reduce water 

withdrawal and conserve clean water that is 

essential to a healthy life.  

We are pleased with our progress and 

accomplishments in the past year. On 

behalf of the Sustainability Committee and 

Sustainability 

Sub-Committees, 

we 

take 

this opportunity to thank our Sustainability 

Champions for their relentless efforts in 

making a difference. 

Japfa has come a long way on its sustainability 

journey and we look forward to shaping a more 

resilient and sustainable future.

Our Business Model

Vertically Integrated 



Business Model



We drive expansion by replicating our 

integrated industrialised business 

model. This covers the value chain 

of protein production from animal 

feed and breeding to fattening and 

consumer products. We leverage 

our strength in feed, which is the 

backbone of our business, as well 

as our core competencies in large 

scale 

operations, 

technology, 

animal health, standardisation and 

replication. We build solid breeding 

pyramids 

through 

a 

scientific 

approach and leverage our strong 

farming mentality, strict biosecurity 

protocols and operational expertise 

to consistently produce high-quality 

proteins.

Diversification Across 



 



Five Proteins, Five Countries 



In line with our purpose of Feeding Emerging Asia, 

Japfa’s growth strategy is to diversify and expand across 

multiple protein segments in multiple emerging markets 

in Asia, building a portfolio of uncorrelated revenue 

and profit streams. We focus on staple animal proteins: 

poultry, swine, beef, aquaculture and dairy. Our strategy is 

based on capturing the high growth potential for protein 

consumption in five key markets namely Indonesia, 

Vietnam, Myanmar, India and China. Together, these 

markets account for more than 40% of the world’s total 

population.

HA

Today, we are the second largest poultry company 

in Indonesia and have replicated our integrated 

industrialised 

business 

model 

for 

poultry 

operations in India, Vietnam and Myanmar and 

for swine operations in Vietnam. We leverage on 

the high quality of our raw materials to produce 

premium and mass-market consumer branded food 

products under leading brands such as So Good in 

Indonesia. We are one of the leading producers of 

premium raw milk in China, with one of the highest 

milk yields and nutritional standards in the market. 

We grew our protein swine, which was launched in 

2012, into a robust industrialised swine value chain, 

a three-tiered pyramid starting from the Great-

Grand Parent (pure breeding) level.

Given the growing affluence of our target middle- 

and lower-income consumer groups, we expect 

protein food consumption to rise. As one of the 

most competitive and efficient producers, we are 

focused on tapping the growing animal protein 

consumption in the five emerging economies that 

we operate in, which together account for more 

than 40% of the world’s total population. We plan 

to forge ahead with our strategy of expanding 

across multiple protein segments in these high 

growth emerging Asian markets by replicating 

our integrated industrialised business model. 

Our purpose is to find new efficient ways to feed 

emerging Asia in a sustainable way.

Feed production is the core activity of our 

aquaculture business. Our aquafeed mills 

produce a wide range of feed products for 

both marine and freshwater aquaculture 

species. We also operate cold storage and 

processing plants, fish farms, shrimp farms, as 

well as shrimp and freshwater fish hatcheries 

to support our aquaculture customers. 

As part of our industrialised farming model, 

we are looking to improve our shrimp 

breeding capabilities.  In 2021, we commenced 

the operation of our Shrimp Broodstock 

Multiplication Centre, a joint venture company 

with Hendrix Genetics Aquaculture B.V.

The beef business unit is run by the Company’s 

subsidiary, PT Santosa Agrindo (Santori) which 

is involved in integrated cattle farming from 

beef cattle breeding, fattening and abattoir to 

value-added meat production. 

In 2021, Santori refocused its operations by 

prioritising the integrated premium meat 

business under the Tokusen Wagyu Beef brand 

and other value-added meat products.









Aquaculture

Beef

To support our vision to become a total 

solutions company in the aquaculture industry, 

we established the Aquaculture Technology

• Average daily milk yield of 40.0 kg 

per head

We own 10 world-class dairy farms that are 

designed and equipped to meet and surpass both 

local and international standards in productivity 

and biosecurity. These include two new state-of-

the-art dairy farms in Shandong China, which we 

had acquired in July 2021, with a total capacity 

of approximately 16,000 heads of cattle. This 

acquisition also included two additional sites of 

land in Shandong that can potentially be further 

developed.

We produce premium raw milk mainly for sale to 

leading dairy companies in China. Our premium 

raw milk consistently tops the market in terms 

of quality, nutrition and safety and our Holstein 

cattle produce one of the highest milk yields in 

the market. 

We work closely with U.S. animal welfare auditors 

to promote the well-being of our cattle as we 

believe that happy cows are healthier cows. We 

focus on cow comfort by managing both heat 

and cold stress and paying careful attention to 

genetic improvements.

In 2021, we forged new partnerships with three 

Chinese strategic investors through the sale of a 

total 12.5% equity stake in AustAsia, which runs 

our China dairy operations, to Genki Forest (5%), 

New Hope Dairy (5%) and Honest Dairy Group 

(2.5%). Previously in 2020, we forged a strategic 

partnership with Meiji, which acquired a 25.0% 

stake in AustAsia. With these agreements Japfa 

added strategic milk processors as shareholders 

of AustAsia and further strengthened its 

position into the largest independent raw milk 

producer in China. Today, Japfa remains the 

single largest shareholder of Dairy-China with 

a 62.5% shareholding and continues to control 

and manage its farming operations in China. 

China



Beef

• 2 fattening farms

Under this segment, we operate dairy and beef businesses in China. These two businesses are 

complementary to each other and synergistic in nature.



Dairy

Beef









With our downstream products, under the brand 

澳亚牧场 (AustAsia), we have entered various 

foodservice channels including coffee, milk tea 

and bakeries by riding on the rising demand for 

traceable, premium dairy products in China.

We run our beef farming operations out of two 

fattening farms in China. It is a synergistic business 

with our dairy operations in many ways such as the 

use of the dairy herd as breeder for cattle stock, 

which enables us to leverage our dairy genetic 

expertise to improve productivity. We also enjoy 

cost efficiencies through economies of scale and 

optimisation of resources such as land. 

As consumer affluence and preference for animal 

protein are increasing, there is huge potential for 

us to become a reliable and consistent supplier of 

premium beef, including F1 Wagyu and Angus.

GRI 201-1, GRI 419-1

Economic Performance

Embedding sustainability efforts in our business 

strategy boosts our confidence to maintain healthy 

economic growth in the long run. The 3P (People, 

Planet and Profit) approach helps us to ensure 

balance in our operations whereby we minimise 

any harm to people and the planet whilst creating 

optimum value for all stakeholders.

In FY 2021, Japfa posted an upturn in revenue to 

US$4.6 billion, a 19.9% year-on-year (“y-o-y”) 

growth from US$3.9 billion in the previous 

financial year (“FY2020”), driven mainly by 

recovery of sales after a wave of the Covid-19 

pandemic across the Group.

Risk Management 



GRI 102-11, GRI 102-15

The Board is responsible for the governance of risk 

and ensures that Management maintains a sound 

system of risk management and internal controls, 

to safeguard the interests of the company and 

its shareholders. This includes climate-related 

risks which can hamper Japfa’s operations. The 

risks identified and assessed along with the 

recommended risk mitigation actions are recorded 

and reviewed periodically.

Prices and Availability of Raw Materials

The risk of raw material price fluctuation is 

mitigated by the ability to pass on any price changes 

to our feed selling prices. We also encourage local 

farmers to grow the raw material crops used in our 

operations.

Environment

Climate change poses an inevitable risk to our 

operations. We mitigate these climate uncertainties 

by creating innovative sustainable solutions.

Animal Disease

The company applies rigorous biosecurity protocols 

to mitigate the risk of major outbreaks of diseases, 

including having an in-house animal vaccine 

research and production facility.

Pandemic

The pandemic has affected many facets of Japfa’s 

operations globally. Japfa ensures that all business 

operations follow local government regulations 

regarding health and safety protocols to protect 

our people and our animals, placing their safety at 

the forefront and to be able to continue providing 

safe, nutritious staple food for the masses.

Competition

Japfa prioritises product quality and product 

efficiency 

throughout 

its value 

chain 

from 

upstream breeding to midstream fattening and 

downstream food processing as well as building 

good relationships with its customers. This anchors 

Japfa’s sustainable position as a key player in the 

countries where we operate in.

Foreign Currency Fluctuations

Japfa engages in hedging transactions whenever 

feasible to mitigate the impact from foreign 

currency fluctuation.

Japfa conducts a risk 

assessment process and 

internal audits to identify 

potential risks within the 

organisation and take 

pre-emptive measures 

accordingly.

1. Mr Renaldo Santosa was appointed as an alternate Director to Mr Handojo Santosa on 15 April 2021.

2. Mr Hendrick Kolonas is considered a non-executive in FY2021, having only held a position with an indirect subsidiary and was 

not involved in day-to-day management of the Group.

3. Mr Hendarto retired during 2021.

Internal Audit and Control 

Japfa has an Internal Audit (IA) function to 

review and monitor operations to ensure 

the adequacy and effectiveness of internal 

controls, adhering to the Company’s policies 

and procedures and complying with laws and 

regulations.

The head of IA reports directly to Japfa’s 

Chief Executive Officer and to the Audit and 

Risk Committee (ARC). A quarterly report is 

prepared and presented to the ARC by the 

head of IA. Audits are selected and prioritised 

based on IA’s risk assessment process 

which continually assesses and calibrates 

operational risks within the company. The IA 

Plan for the year and changes to the plan are 

approved by the ARC. 

Despite the pandemic and travel restrictions 

in 2021, we have conducted internal audits 

of 34 business units covering all the business 

segments in Indonesia, which constitute 10% 

of the entire operations. [GRI 205-1]

An external audit by Ernst &amp; Young was also 

conducted to strengthen our governance and 

provide better support to mitigate risks.





GRI 102-13

We want to continuously promote and improve with the best and sustainable practices in our industry. 

We collaborate with national and international institutions to support these common goals.

Understanding Our Stakeholders





















Stakeholder

Engagement

The Covid-19 pandemic in 2020/2021 limited physical 

interactions with our stakeholders. However, Japfa 

stays committed to continuing communication with 

stakeholders to maintain the relationships and trust. 

Japfa conducts all communications with stakeholders 

within the law and regulations regarding health protocols 

set by each government department during the Covid-19 

pandemic. 

Farmers

• The company guides our farmers to help them achieve 

optimal productivity and yields. We conduct regular 

visits and make phone calls to our farmers to help their 

poultry management and discuss their performance.

Customers

• Constant communication allows Japfa 

to understand our customers’ needs and 

maintain their trust. Communication 

can be customer surveys, customer 

service hotlines and other online means. 

Product information is disseminated 

through our frontline staff and also 

available on our websites.

Local Community Organisations

• Japfa conducts various Corporate Social Responsibility 

(CSR) 

activities 

in

local 

organisations through social mapping results. Japfa 

keeps in touch with local organisations semi-annually 

or whenever needed to conduct various CSR activities 

and environmental conservation. 

Associations

• Building relationships with association members in the 

industry allows us to discuss, align and then provide 

inputs to the government. We meet during quarterly 

meetings or when needed to network and attend joint 

events such as community development.

Employees

• At Japfa, the Company and 

our people grow together as 

one. 

Open 

communication 

with employees allows Japfa

calls, annual general meetings as well as ad hoc 

meetings  when needed to update our business 

performance.

Suppliers

of our products through ongoing engagement 

with our distributors. We engage them regularly

There are ten materiality topics to focus on in 2021, chosen from 

the result of the stakeholder survey. The materiality topics were 

then linked with GRI Standards. Each topic was designated within 

our supply chain and its boundaries. The topic boundaries describe 

the location of impact for a material topic and Japfa’s involvement. 

Japfa could be directly involved through its activities or indirectly 

through its business relations with other entities. The impact 

was then classified into: caused by, contributed by and linked to 

activities through a business relationship. These topic boundaries 

provided insights for risk assessment and implementing a 

precautionary approach for the business. In 2021, there were no 

significant changes from the previous reporting periods on the 

material topics and topic boundaries. [GRI 102-49]

high-quality information on the impacts of 

climate change for the public and is widely used 

internationally. 

The agricultural sector is 

often considered to pose a 

high risk to climate change. 

However, not every operation 

within the agricultural sector 

has the same magnitude of 

impact. 

In Japfa, our vertically 

integrated poultry operations 

account for over 70% of 

revenue1. 

Poultry, compared to other 

animal proteins, contributes

Sustainable Supply of 



Nutritious Proteins



A balanced diet is essential for the overall well-being and good health of mankind. 

A healthy diet provides the necessary nutrition, such as carbohydrate, protein, fibre 

and vitamins, in appropriate quantities and proportions. In the emerging countries 

that Japfa operates in, the predominant staples in the people’s diet are rice, other 

grains and cereals, which contain low amounts of usable protein. Protein is especially 

important for growth and body repair cells, yet in emerging Asia there are still 

many people who do not get enough protein intake due to food insecurity causing 

malnutrition and other health issues.

Since 1971, we have dedicated ourselves to Feeding 

Emerging Asia by providing staple essential animal 

proteins that are safe, nutritious, affordable

Embracing Our Suppliers



In 2021, we rolled out our first supplier sustainability survey with our major suppliers. 

We plan to gradually extend this survey to other suppliers across our various operations.





“

Addressing Potential Deforestation Risk 

in Our Supply Chain 

None of our operations are located on deforested 

land, yet we are conscious of potential deforestation 

risk in our supply chain. In particular, from the supply 

of the soybean meal that is used as raw materials 

for our animal feed production. Soybean meal itself 

is a by-product from soybean oil extraction that is 

repurposed as animal feed. In our survey conducted 

with soybean meal suppliers, we raised the topic 

of origin of soybeans to create awareness about 

deforestation.

For some of our aquafeed 

products, we enhance 

traceability by sourcing 

soybean meal certified 

by ProTerra or The 

Roundtable of Responsible 

Soy (RTRS).

Preserving Ocean Sustainability through 

Fishmeal-Free Feed and Sustainable 

Fisheries Certified Raw Material Supplies 

As part of our contribution to protect the marine 

and freshwater ecosystem, we focus on optimising 

the use of fishmeal and fish oil in our aquafeed.

 

Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) 

and International Fishmeal and Fish Oil 

Organisation (IFFO) certified fish oil and 

fishmeal supplies 

This ensures that the supplies uphold the principles 

for sustainable fisheries resources. 

 

Fishmeal-free in most of our freshwater 

fish feed with only 1% of fish oil 

We successfully reduced the use of fish oil in this 

feed by 0.2% in 2021.

 

Fishmeal optimisation in shrimp feed  

Through our in-house research, we also strive to 

optimise the use of the fishmeal supplies in our 

superior shrimp feed.



Initiated a Supplier Sustainability Survey 



In our efforts to enhance our supplier enggagement, 

we initiated a Supplier Sustainability Survey in 2021, 

which is in addition to our existing stringent supplier 

requirements that focused more on quality and 

economics. Through this survey, we aim to further 

engage our suppliers, especially those in industries 

which may potentially bear higher risk and impact 

to the environment and social aspects. We believe 

this is fundamental to reinforce the traceability and 

sustainability of our supply chain. 

We are constantly reforming 

how we engage our suppliers by 

instilling good production practices 

throughout our supply chain.

Boosting Local Sourcing



In the second year of the Covid-19 pandemic, 

disruptions to the global supply chain continued 

with movement restrictions across the globe. This 

accentuates the importance of local procurement 

within the countries where we operate in. 





Promoting Vietnamese Colour Chickens

Vietnam 

enjoys 

rich 

natural 

resources 

and favourable conditions for agricultural 

development including poultry production. It 

is essential to conserve native breeds such as 

the coloured chickens, which is a part of the 

country’s culture as it is often used for local 

festivals and religious activities. Coloured 

chicken is also one of the prominent sources 

of protein and provides income for locals in 

the rural areas. In line with the Vietnamese 

government 

conservation 

efforts, 

our 

subsidiary Japfa Vietnam actively promotes 

the breeding of coloured chickens to prevent 

them from becoming endangered. We provide 

local farmers with coloured chicken Day-Old-

Chicks (“DOC”) to grow locally. 

In 2021, approximately 3.5 

million DOC of colored chicken 

were raised monthly. 

The native breed has its natural adaptation to 

the local environment, which is the basis of its 

sustainable existence. We develop specialised 

feed formulation to ensure the nutrition 

meets the specific needs of these local breed 

of chickens.

In 2021, our focus was on improving efficiency 

and developing good farming practices for 

breeding of the local coloured chickens. We 

shared our knowledge and provided technical 

support to local farmers as part of our 

efforts to preserve the culture and lineage of 

Vietnamese coloured chickens.

Animal Welfare

As one of the leading animal protein producers, we 

are committed to provide the best possible care 

for the animals we raise. Not only is the welfare 

of our animals a critical success factor, but we 

also believe happy and healthy livestock will be 

more productive. There are various measures we 

adopt to provide appropriate care for our animals 

to grow healthy, which in turn contributes to better 

food safety and  security maintain food safety and 

security while reducing harm to the environment. 



Health Protection and Proper Nutrition



Stringent Biosecurity Protocols

Stringent biosecurity is key to protect our livestock 

from infectious diseases. Our operations adopt 

three components of biosecurity, namely isolation, 

traffic control, and sanitation, which enable us to 

optimally lower the risks from the threat of diseases 

and pests infecting our livestock. At sensitive units, 

such as breeding farms, we implement a more 

rigorous three-zone biosecurity standard. 

In Indonesia, we have been improving our 

biosecurity by applying a three-zone biosecurity 

standard at most of company-owned commercial 

farms. Whereas in South Vietnam, this standard 

has already been implemented in all company-

owned and contract poultry commercial farms.

We are constantly exploring how to enhance 

biosecurity 

to 

provide 

the 

most 

conducive 

environment for animal health in our operations. 

• In 2021, we progressively increased the adoption 

of the closed-house system for commercial farms 

in Indonesia and India. The closed-house system 

is effective in preventing the transmission of 

diseases from the external environment with the 

use of air filtration systems and protection walls. 

• In Vietnam, we installed an auto nest system in 

our hatchery in the North area to reduce direct 

handling, which is prone to disease transmission. 

• In addition to physical measures, we also 

focus attention on our control and monitoring 

management; for example, we conduct a regular 

quality assurance in shrimp hatchery operations 

in Indonesia to monitor and ensure biosecurity 

practices are observed in the units.

Other biosecurity measures at our facilities include 

the following:

• Freshwater is further purified before use as 

drinking water for the animals or habitat for 

aquaculture animals 

• Regular cleaning of farms and ponds, including 

manure handling

• Isolation of sick animals

• Separation of feed and drinking water at poultry 

farms to avoid risk of cross-contamination

• Regular Salmonella sample testing at poultry 

breeding farms and slaughterhouses

Our biosecurity system is 

in line with good farming 

practises and Hazard 

Analysis Critical Control 

Point (HACCP) principles. 

During the Covid-19 pandemic, our already 

stringent biosecurity practices were further 

tightened to prevent and reduce the transmission 

of the novel coronavirus in our premises. In 

addition to the screening process which included 

body temperature checks and hand washing 

of workers and visitors, the number of people 

entering our operation was also restricted. For 

example, in our hatchery in Myanmar, we only 

allowed a designated driver to pick up the day-

old-chicks. 



As a preventive measure, we vaccinate our animals 

mainly to protect them from highly contagious 

diseases such as Newcastle Disease, Infectious 

Bronchitis, Avian Influenza and Marek’s Disease, 

which infects poultry. Vaccination will help reduce 

the pain and fatality risk when the animals are 

infected as the vaccine boosts their immune 

systems. A better immune system also minimises 

heat stress risk on our birds, which is essential to 

mitigate the impact from rising temperatures. 

These efforts not only keep our birds healthy, 

but also helps to reduce veterinary and medicine 

costs, making our products more competitive and 

affordable. 

Animal Vaccination Programme



Our animals are vaccinated regularly under the 

supervision of a veterinarian. We endeavour to 

minimise direct handling when administering 

the vaccines to the animals. In North Vietnam, 

we implemented an in-ovo vaccination method 

in 2021. This technique increases the freedom 

from distress by reducing contact with day-old 

chicks after hatching. We also enforce a one-time 

vaccination programme in India whenever possible. 

The vaccination programme is adjusted for each 

operating unit’s unique challenges. Certain areas 

may have a higher risk of contagion. For example, 

in India, we need to increase the dosage of Marek 

vaccine and administer Salmonella vaccine. 

Our In-House Vaccine Production

• For poultry, we use in-house vaccines that are produced in Indonesia by Vaksindo, 

our subsidiary under PT Japfa Tbk, with almost 40 years of experience in developing 

poultry vaccines. 

• Our poultry vaccine is a result of intensive research in a high-technology diagnostic 

laboratory

• The production facilities in Indonesia are equipped with cutting-edge technology 

and are certified with Biosafety Level 3 certification, ISO 9001:2015, as Good 

Manufacturing Practice

• In 2021, we established a vaccine production unit in India, encouraging local 

production and reducing the environmental impacts of Indonesia’s exports

• In Myanmar, Vaksindo works with our local experts to 

develop and produce vaccines by utilising our hi-tech 

laboratory locally

• Through the collaboration between our Aquaculture 

Division and Vaksindo, since 2020, we have been 

developing a vaccine to enhance the survival rate of tilapia 

fish in Sumatra, Indonesia. We are currently in the on-site 

trial stage and targeting to finish our research by 2022

Where trust, quality, competence of laboratories in India 

are concerned, our quality control laboratories for feed in 

the country is certiﬁed by NABL that assures the balance 

of nutrient composition in our animal feed is accurately 

checked before being fed to animals

Balanced nutrition for livestock is the product 

of harmony between the finest balanced diet 

formulations and precise feeding programmes. 

We continuously conduct research to provide 

a balanced composition that fulfils animal 

nutritional needs and is in accordance with 

its digestive abilities. By embracing advanced 

technology in our research centres and feed mills, 

such as Near Infrared Reflectance (NIR) technology, 

we can efficiently produce high-quality feed that 

minimises wasted nutrients and materials. 

For example, we feed our chickens a low-protein 

diet. Low protein diets are good for the animals 

and environmentally friendly as this diet reduces 

excessive material consumption and also nitrogen 

and phosphorus content in the animal’s manure 

that potentially harms the environment. Similarly, 

we also optimise the phosphorus content in our 

aquafeed to prevent algal blooming.  

Essential Nutrients 



for Optimal Health



Our animal feed is free from 

antibiotic growth promoters 

and contains alternative 

substances such as enzymes, 

prebiotics, medium or 

short chain fatty acids, and 

essential oils that optimise 

growth.

Feeding programmes on farms are also crucial to 

ensure our livestock receives proper nutrition in the 

right amount and time. For our poultry operations, 

we take the following steps to ensure that our 

livestock is free from hunger and thirst:

• 

Provide food and drinking water for our day-

old-chicks during transportation

• 

Feeder and drinking water pots or lines are 

provided in sufficient quantities and evenly 

distributed inside the barns

• 

A grading system to avoid unfair competition 

between large and small birds

“

Antibiotics are only used 

when there is a health risk 

to animals as prescribed 

by veterinarians. We do 

not administer preventive 

antibiotics to healthy 

chickens.

As our operations are geographically located in 

areas with a high risk of disease, antibiotics remain 

one of the most effective ways to treat infected 

livestock. Across our operations, antibiotics are 

only used when there is health risk to animals as 

prescribed by veterinarians, and we ensure the 

appropriate dosage is given for each sick animal. 

We do not administer preventive antibiotics to 

healthy chickens. To boost immunity in animals, we 

use probiotics in our nutrition for the chickens. As 

part of good farming practice, we provide a clean 

environment and better nutrients to our animals, 

which keep them in optimum health.

Antibiotics that are administered to sick animals in 

our operations also conform to the local regulations 

in the countries we operate. In Vietnam, the Ministry 

of Agriculture follows OIE (World Organisation 

for Animal Health) standards. Our aquaculture 

animals are antibiotic-free as we only use natural 

ingredients and harmless chemical substances for 

medication.

The changing climates in the different markets 

where we operate pose a challenge. Extreme heat, 

rain, floods, typhoon occurrences affect the animals 

that we care for and may cause unnecessary distress. 

Our closed-house system demonstrates our ability 

to address farming challenges in Asia —the climatic 

variation, high disease risk, and predator threats 

that endanger animal welfare. The environmental 

control system in the closed-house system provides 

sufficient comfort for chickens to grow naturally 

and actively with  lower mortality. 

In 2021, our operations in Vietnam and India were 

affected by the changes in the local climate. In 

Vietnam, we reduced the density inside the barn 

by 8% per m2 for breeder and colour chickens, and 

35% per m2 for broiler chickens to maintain their 

comfort level and allow them to roam and express 

their natural behaviour more freely. 

Comfortable Housing





Poultry Houses

The basic components in our farms that ensure 

a favourable living environment for poultry that 

fulfil all five freedoms of animal welfare include the 

following:

Freedom from hunger and thirst

• Sufficient quantities and uniform distribution of 

feeder and drinking water pots or lines

• Automatic pan feeders

Freedom from discomfort

• Appropriate density setting

• Adequate lighting intensity

• Environmental control system (with closed-

house automation technologies)

• System includes exhaust fans, heater, cooling 

system, controller, sensor to detect wind speed, 

CO2 and NH3 level, as well as humidity

Freedom from pain, injury and disease

• Feet friendly and hygienic slatted flooring

• Nipple drinking system, which prevents wet 

manure

• Adequate density that prevents disease 

vulnerability and cannibalism

Freedom to express normal behaviour

• Bath dusting area

• Nest box in breeding and layer farms

• Comfortable stock density that allows chickens 

to roam

Freedom from fear and distress

• Shields surround poultry houses for protection 

against external environmental threats, 

including bad weather and predators

Due to extreme rain and flooding, we have relocated 

our farms in India that used to reside near rivers. 

High humidity and climatic changes with seasons 

also led us to accelerate the implementation of our 

closed-house system in company-owned farms. 

We have hasten the pace of the implementation of 

closed-housed farming across regions in preparation 

for future climate challenges, which will directly 

impact the comfort and health of our livestock. 

The shelter is carefully designed with advanced 

technology and other appropriate tools to provide 

the chickens with the best comfort. The comfort 

and cleanliness of the living environment are key 

aspects that allow our livestock to thrive. We are 

committed to continuously improve our animal 

housing systems, considering the characteristics of 

each animal, the operating environment, and pre-

empting future environmental challenges. 

Our farms ensure 

a favourable living 

environment for our 

chickens that fulfil the five 

freedoms of animal welfare.

The water quality in our aquaculture farms is 

always monitored as it is tremendously important 

for our aquaculture animals to thrive. The steps we 

take to provide stable water quality are as follows:

• Water treatment and testing before use in 

shrimp ponds

• Low-phosphorus feed to avoid algae growth 

disrupting  the water ecosystem 

• Facilities and work equipment maintenance 

and cleanliness

• Using tilapia floating cage nets in the water 

depth of &gt;= 100 m allowing fish faeces and food 

residue to decompose naturally

• Real-time monitoring with in-house mobile 

applications QC Sharp and STT Mobile

Aquaculture Farms

We also control the population in our ponds to 

avoid overcrowding and allow sufficient space for 

our aquaculture to swim freely. This methodology 

ensures that the pond condition is comfortable 

and suits the comfort needs of our fish and shrimp 

population, resulting in low stress levels and better 

growth.

Supporting Our Farmers

In the poultry commercial farm business units, apart 

from operating our company-owned commercial 

farms, we also work with contract farmers under 

a profit-sharing programme. Living the vision of 

Growing Towards Mutual Prosperity, we support 

each other through collaboration in raising our 

livestock. Fair partnership, knowledge sharing and 

technical assistance on good farming practices are 

part of our approach to help the farmers produce 

a sustainable supply of nutritious proteins while 

improving their livelihood. 

We supply day-old-chicks, feed, medicines, vaccines, 

chemicals, technical assistance, veterinary, and 

after sales service, while contract farmers provide 

hen houses, farming equipment and tools, and 

workers. The specific terms and arrangements of 

each country may differ. We may include additional 

assistance for contract farmers with capital 

limitations, such as farm equipment credits and 

recommendations to financial institutions. We 

provide incentives to farmers who perform well so 

as to appreciate and motivate them and their peers 

to achieve better results.

Living the vision of Growing 

Towards Mutual Prosperity, 

we support each other 

through collaboration in 

raising our livestock.





Over the years, we have 

successfully replicated our 

poultry contract farming 

scheme across regions where 

we operate.

Poultry Contract Farming Programme 



In 2021, even though the world was gradually 

recovering from the disruption of Covid-19, certain 

regions were still suffering from its adverse impact. 

For example, in Vietnam, farmers and workers 

from leading local commodities, such as paper 

and coffee, had to halt their production due to 

export cancellation as a result of strict movement 

restrictions. Hence, they faced income insecurity. 

With our “produce locally, consume locally” 

approach, our poultry contract farming programme 

offers an arrangement that allows these farmers 

to have a more stable source of income while 

contributing to local food security.

KAVAS for Small 

Shrimp Farmers

Kawasan Vannamei STP or STP Vannamei 

Area (“KAVAS”) is our dedicated partnership 

programme 

for 

small-scale 

traditional 

shrimp farmers in Indonesia. We supply 

shrimp fries, feed and technical advice in 

good aquaculture practices and technology 

applications, while the farmers provide the 

ponds and workers. By the end of 2021, the 

programme had engaged with 400 shrimp 

farmers from various locations in the 

country.

Complete Farmer Assistance 



Knowledge Management 



We are always looking for ways to assist farmers in 

resolving their farming challenges, even amid the 

Covid-19 pandemic. Our additional initiatives in 

2021 include:

• Proposed national standards of minimalist 

WWTP design for shrimp ponds to the 

Indonesian Ministry of Maritime Affairs and 

Fisheries, together with the Indonesian Shrimp 

Forum

• Developed observation technology for 

aquaculture farmers using global satellite 

together with Japfa Feeds the Future challenge 

2021 winner — Sea Warden

• Added mobile lab units to reach out more 

shrimp farmers

• Intensified teleguidance implementation during 

the Covid-19 lockdown period

• Improved one-on-one interaction between 

farmers and our internal experts

To achieve extensive sustainable farming practices, 

we believe knowledge sharing is essential so that 

the information and knowhow is made accessible 

to every one of our contract farmers. We conduct 

various activities to help farmers sharpen their 

competence in good farming practices, whether 

taught by internal experts or information exchange 

with fellow farmers. The topics addressed in our 

knowledge-sharing programmes include but not 

limited to the following: 

• Seasonal management

• Feeding programme

• Animal welfare (biosecurity, density, air control 

and lighting)

Scan the QR Code below to visit PT Japfa Tbk’s 

website and see the complete list of farmer 

assistance, from farm or pond management, 

feeding programme, harvest data analysis, and 

many more.

As part of our total farming 

solution, we provide 

contract and independent 

farmers assistance from 

our professional technical 

service teams to help them 

improve their farming skills.

• Antibiotic use

• Occupational health and safety

• Environmental management (manure, dust, and 

wastewater treatment)

The implementation in each region may differ 

according to farmer characteristics. We focus on 

the most effective way to reach out to them. For 

example, in North Vietnam, training for farmers is 

concentrated in one province, while in the South, we 

need to penetrate into small districts. At PT Japfa 

Tbk, we also offer a joint operation programme 

where we provide opportunities for new contract 

farmers to learn and be directly involved at our 

company-owned commercial farms.

Our Japfa Neeti programme aims to share farming 

strategies to assist farmers to resolve local 

challenges in India, such as seasonal farming 

management (density, ventilation and lighting 

setting) and disease control.

Social Life Cycle Assessment on 



Our Farmer Partnership Programme 



GRI 102-12

Our subsidiary PT Japfa 

Tbk has collaborated 

with around 10,000 

local poultry farmers in 

Indonesia to produce 

commercial live birds 

through a partnership 

programme that 

provides a substantial 

socioeconomic 

contribution to the 

farmers. 

To identify the potential social impact of the 

farmer partnership programme, Japfa participated 

as one of the road testers for the revised UNEP 

guidelines of Social Life Cycle Assessment. We are 

the only company globally that represented the 

food and agricultural sector and Southeast Asia.

The assessment covered 19 impact subcategories 

and 70 inventory indicators. Results showed that 

the social performance towards farmer partners, 

Japfa’s workers, local community, society and 

consumers was relatively in compliance with 

applicable regulations and/or relevant standard 

operating procedures for the poultry industry. In 

addition, the results also indicated progress beyond 

compliance for the same stakeholder categories. 

The assessment has identified focus areas  where 

we can take action to improve or enhance the 

social performance of our contract partnerships. 

Based on the hotspots identified for example, weak 

policy on OHS and working hours implemented by 

contract farmers, we can widen our farmer training 

programmes to include social responsibility 

awareness, in addition to technical support. The 

results of the assessment were presented at the 

10th Life Cycle Management Conference, which 

was held on 5-8 September 2021 in Stuttgart, 

Germany.

We also shared our experience in implementing the 

New UNEP 2020 S-LCA Guidelines in a hybrid event 

held in Brussels on December 2021, organised by 

the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Life Cycle 

Initiative and Social LC Alliance, hosted by Belgium 

Ministry of Climate, Environment, Sustainable 

Development and Green Deal of Belgium and 

Québec Ministry of the Environment and the Fight 

Against Climate Change. Mr Kevin Monteiro, Japfa’s 

Chief Financial Officer and also Sustainability 

Committee represented Japfa in that event.

Information regarding the publication of detailed 

study results will be updated on the website.

Our Approach



The effect of climate change is impacting people worldwide with extreme weather, 

water scarcity and many more, posing risks to the agricultural sector and global food 

security. We acknowledge that accelerated action to combat climate change and its 

impact is everyone’s responsibility. At Japfa, our action begins with environmental 

stewardship by producing efficiently to reduce our environmental footprint. We have 

always strived to be responsible by optimising the use of resources and minimising 

waste and emissions, which we believe helps significantly in tackling the climate 

change challenge.

We adopt the life cycle thinking and utilise Life Cycle 

Assessment (LCA) to identify our environmental 

focus areas quantitatively using a science-based 

approach. The key focus areas identified by the 

LCA on our largest operation, poultry, are water 

and waste issues. We will prioritise our efforts on 

these issues while also continuously improving our 

overall operations. We aim to minimise the negative 

environmental impact from our production system 

and instead make more positive environmental 

impact.

Improving Water 



Quality



 

For aquaculture, the quality of water 

is critical to fish health as water is 

their habitat. Each aquatic species 

requires specific water qualities 

to grow, thrive and reproduce. We 

continuously monitor the physical 

and chemical conditions of our 

aquatic ecosystems to ensure that 

it is an optimal environment for 

animal health. 

Rainwater Harvesting



 

We are increasing our focus on water 

efficiency as water scarcity is a global issue 

affecting emerging Asia, including some 

of the areas where we operate. We can 

mitigate this issue by reducing our reliance 

on groundwater and freshwater resources 

through the implementation of rainwater 

harvesting solutions in our units. By 2021, 

we installed rainwater harvesting system 

in our units:

Water Consumption 



Efficiency



 

We continuously explore ways to 

minimise water consumption and 

especially to avoid water wastage in 

our production process. The following 

are some of our initiatives that helped 

us improve the efficiency of our water 

consumption.

Conserving Water 

Water Recycling



 



to Mitigate Water Scarcity



Water is an indispensable part of everyone’s life, 

and it is the key to a healthy life. While it is a 

fundamental human need, today, many people 

struggle to access clean water because of climate 

change that has affected water availability. 

In our operations, water is a vital resource for 

healthy animal growth and produce food safely. As 

a business that consumes water, we are responsible 

for ensuring water security for our operations and 

communities. We are committed to managing our 

consumption through various initiatives.

As water is essential for life, 

we protect water resources by 

using water responsibly in our 

operations.  

The First of Its Kind Sustainability-Linked 

Bond to Improve Water Circularity

Following the hotspots results of our LCA on our 

main poultry operations in Indonesia, our subsidiary 

PT Japfa  Tbk, launched an SLB that focuses on water 

sustainability in March 2021. 

 

Our SLB prioritises an environmental KPI that 

is linked to the achievement of a  water-related 

Sustainability Performance Target (“SPT”). The 

SPT is to minimise the impact related to water 

pollution from untreated wastewater by reducing 

eutrophication potential through the management, 

As a part of water conservation efforts, we are 

committed to recycle water so that we can reduce 

freshwater 

or 

groundwater 

withdrawal 

and 

minimise pollution from our wastewater. In 2021, 

through our recently released SLB, we commenced 

a project to add water recycling facilities in our 

operations. 

In respect to our SPT, we 

are pleased to report that we 

have substantially completed 

the construction of 2 water 

recycling facilities.1

posted on the PT Japfa Tbk website.

treatment and/or recycling and utilisation of 

wastewater to ultimately, improve water circularity 

and reduce water withdrawal. The SPTs were 

assessed as “Robust” by independent opinion from 

Vigeo Eiris, which is part of Moody’s ESG Solutions.

The SPT is that, over the next 3 years and 9 months 

from the date of the SLB issuance, PT Japfa Tbk 

will construct 8 water recycling facilities (out of 15 

slaughterhouses) under its poultry operations; and 

1 water recycling facility at a hatchery within the 

poultry breeding unit.

Feedmills:

• Cikande and Buduran (Sidoarjo), Indonesia

• Jagdishpur and Bihar Feedmills, India

Breeding farms:

• Breeding farms in Parungkuda, Cipunagara, Garut, 

Kronjo, and Wanayasa, Indonesia 

Broiler farms:

• 2 commercial farms in South Vietnam

Aquaculture:

• Tilapia processing plant Simalungun, Indonesia

• Seafood Value Added in Cirebon, Indonesia

Our iniatives:

• Expanded the utilisation of ozones and Poly Aluminium 

Chloride (PAC) for water purification in shrimp unit of 

aquaculture division in Indonesia 

• Applied reverse osmosis technology in:

- Feedmill operation in Mandalay, Myanmar

- Commercial farms in Yangon, Myanmar

- Broiler farms in India

- Poultry feedmill in Indonesia

- Tilapia farms in Indonesia

• Reduced wasted aquafeed through the implementation 

of aquafeed broadcaster system at Tilapia operation in 

Indonesia. The system reduced water pollution.

• Good housekeeping and routine maintenance to prevent 

leakage

• Reusing boiler condensate as boiler feed water in all feed 

mills

• Utilising automatic blowdown for boilers in feed mills in

GRI 303-2, GRI 303-4

Most wastewater from our production is  treated 

in our own treatment facilities. The treated 

wastewater is discharged into the nearest water 

body only when the quality meets the regulatory 

standards. This means it will not harm the 

environment, for example causing eutrophication, 

where excess nutrients impair freshwater and 

coastal marine ecosystems.



Utilising Wastewater  

to Grow Vegetables

Aquaponics is a project initiated by 

our aquaculture division in Indonesia. 

In this project, we utilise wastewater 

directly from the aquaculture farm 

to grow vegetables. The wastewater 

from the aquaculture farm  is rich in 

useful nutrients to cultivate plants 

organically without additional inorganic 

fertilisers. This is an environmentally 

friendly, natural food-growing method 

that harnesses the best attributes of 

aquaculture and hydroponic systems, 

and promotes a circular economy. 

In 2021, we focused on building the greenhouse 

for our pilot, improving the transportation of 

wastewater from fish farm to greenhouse and 

experimenting for the development of best 

cultivation method. After the pilot, we intend to 

promote this wastewater utilisation method to 

local aquaculture farmers, so they can achieve more 

from their farming activities.  





Results of our aquaponics trials



“

Having wastewater 

management as one of 

our key areas to improve 

environmental performance, 

we are motivated to manage 

our wastewater even better.

Climate Action

Improving our energy efficiency is directly correlated 

to the reduction of our carbon footprint. We closely 

monitor energy consumption within our operations 

and continuously aim to lower it. 

In 2021, we continued to focus on energy 

management, inluding the use of renewable energy, 

energy effciency and cleaner production.  

Utilisation of Renewable Energy



Carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels is one of the main contributors to climate change. To 

mitigate the issue, we are pursuing net-zero carbon emission by adopting a carbon neutral approach. We 

mainly focus on the use of renewable and cleaner energy in our operations.

Biomass

In Indonesia, we optimise energy consumption by 

using biomass that is abundant in the region. The 

biomass we use is sourced from agriculture waste 

such as candle nut shells, palm kernel shells and 

palm fibres. We use it at operations that are energy 

intensive such as feedmill, corn dryer units and 

aquaculture cold storage. During the reporting 

period, we increased the utilisation of this renewal 

energy source in our feedmill units. With our recent 

biogas project we aim to utilise the methane gas 

from chicken manure as an energy source for the 

operation.  

Solar Photovoltaic Systems

Located in Southeast Asia, our operations are 

blessed with natural sunlight, which is an abundant 

resource of clean energy. We are working to harness 

more solar energy for our operations. The ongoing 

Covid-19 pandemic had delayed our plans but we 

target to install one solar panel unit throughout our 

operations in Indonesia, India and Myanmar in the 

near future.

Based on our experience in our commercial poultry 

farm in Myanmar, the installation of a solar panel 

system without battery replaced the grid electricity 

consumption during the day and saved ±30% of 

electricity cost in 2021. The solar panels enabled 

us to achieve more CO2 reductions and to be more 

economically efficient. 



In Vietnam, we continued to help the owners of our 

rented commercial poultry farms to install solar 

panels on the farms. Installation was completed 

in two rental farms in 2021. The solar panels in 

each farm has 1.2 MW capacity. We believe this is 

a meaningful project, as the electricity generated is 

sold to the local power grid, contributing to cleaner 

energy sources in the country.

Improving Energy Efficiency 





“

Implementing process 

automation in our operations 

helps us to improve energy 

efficiency, productivity, product 

hygiene and cleanliness, as well 

as reduce materials wastage.

Automated Processes Across Our Operations

Cleaner Production Approach to Reduce Energy Consumption 



Change from conventional 

dryer to closed system and 

direct burner in aquafeed 

mills

In 2021, four of our aquafeed 

mills in Indonesia changed their 

conventional dryers to better 

systems. In the Purwakarta 

aquafeed mill, this resulted 

in ±22% reduction of gas 

consumption. 

Equipment modification 

to optimise the use of 

retained heat in return 

condensate  

In all of our aquafeed mills in 

Indonesia, we started to focus 

on maximising the retained heat 

in the condensate.  This enabled 

us to use less energy to heat our 

boilers.

Utilising transparent 

galvalume roofs to 

allow natural lights and 

minimise use of lamps

This modification helped our 

animal feedmill in Sragen, 

Indonesia reduce their 

electricity consumption for 

lightings during the day time. 



Digitalisation

In an effort to minimise energy consumption, we 

also aim to optimise process efficiency. One way 

to achieve this is the implementation of industrial 

internet of things (IIOT) in our feedmills in Indonesia. 

IIOT is a digital approach that combines smart 

sensors and actuators to enhance manufacturing 

and industrial processes. IIOT enhances important 

processes including making automatic maintenance 

and reporting, data collection, analytics, and smart 

grid optimisation easier, allowing us to monitor 

production efficiency at all times. The system, 

which has been adopted in the feedmill unit in 

Sragen, Indonesia, enables us to efficiently control 

the use of resources such as electricity, water, and 

materials.

In 2021, our breeding farms in Indonesia, focused 

on the distribution process. Distribution has been 

one of the significant contributors to global carbon 

footprint. We have used a distribution optimisation 

system called J-VOS (Japfa Vehicle Optimization 

System) that is GPS based. This system enables us to 

monitor our distribution process comprehensively, 

including:

• Routes and delivery times

• Chick van movement

• Chick van fuel consumption

In optimising our distribution process, we also have 

always been aiming to make our vertically integrated 

operations as close as possible to each other, and to 

the markets. In 2021, for example, we moved some 

of our farms in India to be closer to the feedmill 

and our customers in Mumbai area. This initiative 

enabled us not only to increase access to nutritious 

food, but also to reduce the carbon footprint with 

the more efficient distribution routes.





• Reducing carbon footprint

• Less paper used

• Load capacity optimisation

• Increasing delivery rates

• Faster delivery of below 6 hours for

  guaranteed quality

• Better report evaluation

Numerous Advantages Have 

Resulted From J-VOS

Process Automation

Automatic systems enable us to better monitor and 

more accurately control our energy consumption. 

For example, air speed sensors in our closed-house 

poultry farms help to adjust fan speed automatically, 

so that the fans do not need to continuously run 

at high speed and will change according to the air 

condition in the farms. 

The use of automatic systems improve productivity 

and we can produce more with the same amount 

of energy or even less. In 2021, we adopted process 

automation to boost energy efficiency in our 

operations.

Monitoring Emissions

During the reporting period, we continued 

improving our emissions control, aiming for GHG 

and air pollution reduction. As previously discussed, 

the Group focused on utilising renewable and 

cleaner energy and improving energy efficiency. 

With the acceleration of digitalisation in our 

Company, we were also able to reduce travel 

as we adapted to working remotely by utilising 

cloud-based infrastructure, which contributes to 

reducing transport emissions from the employee 

commuting.

We recognise that operational processes such as 

feed manufacturing and boiler fuel incineration 

release emissions into the air, such as dust particles 









“

In 2021, we extended the scope of our monitoring to include 

Other Indirect (Scope 3) greenhouse gases emissions. We are 

continuing to study the various parameters that affect Scope 3 

to further refine the data.

or fly ashes. To mitigate this problem, all our 

feedmill units in Indonesia, India, Myanmar and 

Vietnam are installed with a dust collection system 

to reduce the amount of dust emitted into the 

air. We monitor the system on a continuous basis 

to ensure that the emissions comply with the 

prevailing quality standards.

In the Vietnam and Myanmar feedmills, we 

equipped our incineration machinery with a water 

spray system to help keep the dust from flying in 

the air. We also renewed our dust collector machine 

with a cyclone system. Not only does it enable us 

to absorb the dust generated by the boiler, this 

system also filters and reduces the amount of 

water required for the boiler.





About Our Data

• Emission calculation is using SimaPro LCA software and the emission factors based on IPCC 100a method.

• Scope 1: Based on the energy consumption (exclude electricity) within the organisation for poultry and aquaculture operations.

• Scope 2: Based on the purchased electricity consumed within the organisation for poultry and aquaculture operations.

• Scope 3: Estimated for the poultry operations in Indonesia, based on collected data from our LCA project. The data included in 

the estimation is the production and transportation of purchased raw materials, supporting materials and energy (excluded 

energy indirect - Scope 2). The calculation did not include waste utilisation, consumer products, business travel and employee 

commuting and downstream emissions. Business travel and employee commuting are excluded due to the movement 

restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic.

• Emission intensity has not been calculated at the point of publishing this report. We are evaluating the most appropriate 

methodology  to represent our products, ranging from feed to consumer products [GRI 305-4].

Practices Across the Group



Empowering Women in Vietnam and 

Myanmar

Traditionally, the agricultural sector is male 

dominated due to the nature of the work and 

cultural bias. In Japfa, women are given the same 

opportunity and platform to perform. In Vietnam 

and Myanmar, the majority of the workers in our 

farms are women. Within our Group, 15.4% of our 

Sustainability Champions, 18.8% of our middle 

management and above are women, and 14.3% are 

in the Directors/Executives.

Respecting Women’s Rights in India

To ensure a safe environment for our people, any 

kind of discrimination or inappropriate behaviour 

is not tolerated. In India, we facilitate education 

and communication initiatives, as well as an 

advisory group as mandated by the government 

to provide a safe working environment for our 

female employees. These initiatives are also 

applicable for everyone in our Group and our 

business partners.    

Supporting Workers with Disability in 

Indonesia

We hire employees based on their capabilities and 

do not discriminate against their disabilities. To 

provide a proper work environment for employees 

with disabilities, we incorporate the local regulations 

and laws into our Company policy and offer support  

Our employment process 

focuses on the competencies, 

skills and values of the 

candidates, regardless 

of gender, age, race and 

sociocultural background. 

These principles are covered 

in our Japfa Diversity Policy. 

for our colleagues with disabilities, for example, by 

providing prosthesis for employees with hand or leg 

amputation to improve their mobility.  

At the moment, we employ 32 employees with 

disabilities in Indonesia. They are assigned to 

suitable job functions based on their competencies. 

DOLPHIN values are our anchor in human capital 

development to achieve our vision of Growing Towards 

Mutual Prosperity.

Prioritising Health and Safety

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) is a top 

priority. We have an OHS management system 

across our activities to ensure safe workplace 

conditions for all of our employees. Our OHS 

management system was developed by identifying 

the potential workplace risks and taking preventive 

measures throughout our operations.  

We 

systematically 

identify 

work 

risks 

in 

our operations by following certain hazard 

identification and assessment methodologies 

which are different in each country yet aimed 

at achieving the same goal of employee safety. 

For example, in Indonesia, we follow the Hazard 

Identification, Risk Assessment and Determining 

Control (HIRADC) methodology, while in Vietnam 

we adhere to the Hazard and Operability Study 

(HAZOP) in our risk management. The outcome 

is then used as the basis of our strategy in 

eliminating factors leading to serious injuries. In 

our operations in India, the results are used to 

develop our LIFEGEAR (LIFE - Life Altering Injury

Avoid Risk) strategy, where we have determined 

required safety behaviours for high risk activities 

that will prevent serious injuries or fatalities.

While we make every effort to provide a safe 

working environment for our employees, 

accidents may still occur. In the event of 

an accident, we offer necessary medical 

treatment to our employees and will conduct 

investigations to determine the cause of the 

accident. We also take further measures to 

prevent similar incidents from happening 

again by re-examining our processes and 

action plans.

We deeply regret that in 2021 there were 

two fatalities in Indonesia arising from 

motorvehicle accidents. Additional safety 

measures have since been implemented to 

minimise the risk of recurrence.

The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance 

of health and safety standards in protecting our 

employee’s well-being. In 2021, our health and safety 

protocols were complemented by additional initiatives 

to minimise the impact from the ongoing pandemic. 

We were able to contain the Covid-19 cases across our 

operations in every country through:

• 

Monitoring and tracking the number of quarantined 

and confirmed cases. In 2021, only 10% cases of our 

workforce were confirmed Covid-19 positive and 

the Company took swift action once cases were 

reported   

• 

Encouraging, 

tracking 

and 

monitoring 

the 

vaccination status of our employees 

• 

Regular reminders to employees on Covid-19 safety 

measures 

• 

Ensuring that employees follow the health 

protocols

Caring for Our Employees 



during Covid-19 Pandemic



Stay Healthy Together



Covid-19 Vaccination

In 

2021, 

we 

actively 

encouraged 

Covid-19 

vaccination among our employees. To help speed up 

vaccine rollout in our markets including Indonesia, 

Myanmar and Vietnam we bought our own supplies 

of vaccines. We monitored each of our employee’s 

vaccination status by requiring them to upload 

their vaccination certificate to the Company’s 

portal. As of 31 December 2021, 99.2% of our 

employees across the Group have been vaccinated.



Health Promotion 

In addition to the awareness on occupational 

health and safety, we believe it is also important 

to increase the awareness of general healthcare to 

our employees. At Japfa, we have numerous health 

promotion programmes to support and teach our 

employees to take a better care of themselves both 

physically and mentally. In 2021, our programmes 

included:

• Health and wellness seminars led by healthcare 

professionals

• Regular general medical check-ups

• Sports activities1: meditation, zumba, virtual 

marathon, basketball, badminton, gym exercise

• Cooking competitions

• Regular emails to staff introducing on virtual 

games and wellness messages

Japfa Care

During the Covid-19 pandemic, Japfa took great 

care of our employees and their families, especially 

during the peak of the second wave in Indonesia 

in July 2021. We provided support, in particular to 

our employees and their family members who were 

impacted with Covid-19. 































































































































































































• Incorporating Covid-19 protocols

•  Regular Covid-19 testing for workers and drivers in areas with high risk of 

infections

•  Improving sanitation

• Providing personal protection equipment (e.g. masks, face masks)

•  Implementing physical distancing

• Monitoring employees’ health records, in particular those who are in 

self-isolation, in recovery and have recovered

• Built canteen in a feedmill that follows the Covid-19 protocols and 

sanitation

•  Providing on-site employees with extra nutritious foods and vitamins to 

boost their immune systems

•  Providing quarantine accommodation for our employees and their families. 

In Myanmar, we have a Japfa Quarantine Centre in both upper and lower 

Myanmar with 60 beds in total

•  Opened fever clinic in Myanmar for screening and testing patients with 

Covid-19 symptoms

People Development

Aside from caring for the health and safety of our 

employees, we continued to ensure our employee’s 

professional development. All employees were 

provided with equal opportunities to learn new 

skills that would benefit them throughout their 

career with us until retirement. Across the Group, 

we provide corporate development programmes 

that include orientation, development and pre-

pension training programme.

Due to prevailing Covid-19 restrictions, most of the 

trainings were conducted virtually. We continued to 

develop our talents while maintaining safety protocols 

which led us to embrace digitalisation and adopt new 

online technology. We applied two online training 

methods: 

• 

Live Facilitator-Led trainings via Online platforms

• 

Blended Learning: Self Learning and Facilitator-led 

Live Online training 

Orientation 

Programmes:

• Induction Programme 

for all New Employees 

was conducted

• With our new and 

improved definition 

of People Values 

– DOLPHIN, an 

awareness training was 

conducted online for 

our employees across 

Japfa

Corporate Development Programmes

Development Programmes:

• Foundation Programme (FP) —  This programme aims to equip our 

employees with principles in management, leadership, cross-functional 

knowledge and a “transformative” mindset. 

 

In 2021, we successfully conducted the online live training in India for 23 

participants across various locations. 

 

 

• Middle Management Programme (MMP) — Now known as e-MMP and 

available online via a self-learning section and a facilitator-led section for 

each course. This programme aims to broaden participants’ knowledge 

and strengthen their ability to take on responsibilities at the middle 

managerial level. 

 

In 2020, a total of 80 participants from India, China, Bangladesh and 

Vietnam had registered for it. In 2021, 140 participants from Indonesia 

registered. Participants had the flexibility to attend the courses online and 

then subscribe to the facilitator-led training. 

• Senior Management Programme (SMP) — This training aims to improve 

our senior managers’ capabilities in strategic thinking, analysing the 

competitive business environment and market position strengthening. 

This training has been postponed since the pandemic began in 2020.

In keeping with safety protocols during the Covid-19 

pandemic, most of the trainings were conducted 

online, except for three that were conducted face-

to-face. 

In addition to Group-wide training programmes, 

each country has their own programmes tailored to 

local requirements. The programmes are developed 

based on local conditions.  

Tailored Local Training Activities

Indonesia

50 hazardous waste management staff from 

the production sites enrolled in external 

professional certificate training programmes. 

We also had two employees who participated 

in external training that focused on 

understanding the sustainability reporting 

requirements of the Indonesia Financial 

Services Authority regulations.  





Vietnam

We developed new trainings on code of 

conduct and the Company’s regulations and 

policies. These trainings are important to 

ensure all of our employees understand the 

Company’s expectation of them. 





Myanmar

The training we hosted varied from ISO 

9001:2015 awareness, soft-skills to problem 

analysis &amp; decision choice (PADC) training. 

However, due to the internet cut-off during 

the political crisis, we were unable to conduct 

the training for almost four months. During 

this time, we encouraged our employees 

to build high morale and continue to stay 

productive.





India

We have at least six training programmes 

every month. The programmes include 

financial and mental health training, and 

public speaking to improve their business 

communication. 





Digital Recruitment Process in India

All recruitment processes were conducted online using digital platforms. In 2021, we also required our new 

recruits to be fully vaccinated and to show proof of vaccination. If there is a medical condition that prevents 

them from being vaccinated, they must submit supporting documents.

Employee Benefits



Benefits Provided to Our Employees

In deciding on fair remuneration, for both permanent 

and non-permanent employees, we consider the 

level of job position, years of service, and individual 

performance evaluation results without gender bias. 

Our employee benefit initiatives may vary to meet 

different needs in each of the countries we operate 

in. For example in India, we showed our appreciation 

for farm workers who exceeded expectations 

through an award and recognition programme 

called Japfa Heroes. This programme is one of the 

initiatives to keep morale high during the pandemic. 

Special incentives were also announced for the feed 

and farm teams working through the pandemic. 

In additon, we increased the insurance coverage 

for our employees and their family members to 

With almost 40,000 employees in six countries, 

a robust human capital management system 

is vital for us to effectively manage our teams 

wherever they are. We use the SAP Human Capital 

Management (HCM) system as our master data 

platform for our employee-related information 

such as personnel administration, payrolls and 

performance indicators.

The data provided by the SAP HCM system is also 

used to support Japfa Sustainability Reporting 

System, which facilitates the collection of critical 

sustainability data related to unit operations and 

people, such as work-related injuries, and our 

environmental performance data.  

SAP HCM has been implemented across our 

operations except in India due to a complex licensing 

procedure in the country. As an alternative, we work 

with a local trusted employee management service 

provider in India.    

Moving forward, we aim to have a more digitised 

working environment to improve our productivity 

and efficiency. In 2021, we commenced an electronic 

system for pay slip, overtime, and travel requests in 

our biggest operation area - Indonesia. It is our main 

target to optimise the integration of our operations 

into the SAP HCM by leveraging digitalisation.   







We are committed to provide 

fair remuneration and 

allowance to all our employees.

Japfa Performance System







Japfa Sustainability Reporting System













BIHCM is a digital dashboard based on human capital 

employed to optimise costs, boost employee 

productivity, and create a positive working 

environment. This is accomplished by providing 

thorough analytical data that leads to targeted 

corrective actions, improvements, and decisions.

The Japfa Performance System is an online system that 

is convenient and eﬀective in setting employee KPIs as 

well as mid-year and year-end performance reviews. 

This system also supports employee performance 

ratings more quickly and precisely.

We created the Japfa Sustainability Reporting System 

(JSRS) to enable us to collect data on OHS, 

environmental performance, and employment from 

all divisions and operational units in order to make 

necessary improvements and generate a 

sustainability report that meets GRI requirements. In 

2021, we added an environmental costs module to 

collect speciﬁc data on our spending to improve our 

environmental performance. In 2021, we developed a 

sustainability data analytics system on our JSRS.

Our Approach



In alignment with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger, 

our efforts have always been to provide affordable nutritious staple protein food. In 

the countries we operate in, adequate nutrition is vital in addressing health issues 

such as micro and macro malnutrition. That is why our community development 

programmes mainly focus on building a healthy society by advocating healthy living. 

Aside from that, we also have activities to help local communities maximise their 

potential, so they can improve their economic and social conditions.

Japfa maintains a good relationship with our local 

communities by interacting with them regularly to 

find out what they need so that we can provide the 

most suitable support for them to thrive. Our method 

for community development centres on education. 

We believe it will provide a long-term impact of our 

programmes for the community.  We also believe 

in cultivating the next generation of farmers who 

can carry on our mission to make affordable staple 

proteins accessible to the people sustainably.

Other Social 

Outreach

























In 2021, our focus areas were health education 

programmes for elementary school students, and 

farming education for university students and 

farmers; environmental conservation; Japfa chess 

club; entrepreneurship programmes; and disaster 

in response programmes that included Covid-19 

assistance.

Education

Not only does Japfa aim to be a reliable provider of 

safe and affordable staple proteins to millions in 

emerging Asia, we also recognise we can contribute 

to the local communities.

Our flagship CSR programme, Japfa for Kids, is a 

long-term social programme that seeks to improve 

knowledge and make a positive impact on children’s 

well-being. Our Japfa for Kids programmes are 

carried out in Indonesia and India whereby projects 

are tailored to suit the needs within each country.

Indonesia

Undeterred by the Covid-19 pandemic, Japfa 

remains committed to its Clean and Healthy 

Behaviour (PHBS) programme and to promote the 

consumption of nutritious food for Indonesian 

children especially those living in rural areas. We 

also reformulated the Anak Indonesia Bersih dan 

Sehat programme (Clean and Healthy Indonesian 

Children) to ensure continuous rollout of the 

activities amid Covid-19 restrictions.

We teach school children about nutrition and 

balanced diets, and good hygiene in everyday life 

with a clear purpose to promote lasting social 

change in their lifestyles. To promote PHBS, we 

conducted campaigns and assistance for both 

students and teachers in nine-month mentoring 

programme. Our strategy to cultivate clean and 

healthy living habits was to work with schools to 

promote clean behaviors, nutritious balanced diets, 

and the application of 5S — a system for organizing 

spaces so activities can be performed efficiently, 

effectively, and safely. Previously, teachers were 

assisted by external field facilitators in adapting 

to the new conditions and to be more creative 

and interactive in delivering their lessons. In 2021, 

we had our employees from the social investment 

department engage directly with the teachers. 

Japfa for Kids



These employees have the knowledge and skills to 

guide the teachers and by adopting this approach 

the efficiency of the programme is further enhanced 

through the direct interaction.

Due to Covid-19 movement restrictions, the 

monitoring, checks and some training programmes 

were performed remotely.

India

In India, we focus on providing proper learning 

facilities, 

including 

infrastructure 

and 

study 

materials. More schools have been constructed and 

renovated near the farms. This year, we donated 

learning equipment and assistive devices to children 

with disabilities.







Under the Japfa for Kids, we also continued our 

Pos Pelayanan Terpadu Sehat (Health Centres) 

dan Berdaya programme. In 2021, we focused to 

combat stunting issues through the “Kelompok Ibu 

Cerdas Cegah Stunting”. This programme focus on 

improving the living quality of mothers and children 

by educating the mothers about healthy living 

behaviours and balance diets that are important to 

prevent stunting on their children. We conducted 

the programme in collaboration with local health 

centres. This programme aligns with the Indonesian 

government’s mission to reduce stunting in the 

country.

(Farming for the Nation)

























To support agriculture education, we cooperated 

with three Indonesian universities, namely Gajah 

Mada University, Brawijaya University and Syiah 

Kuala University (Unsyiah) to construct Teaching 

Farms which can be used as laboratories for students 

to research on chicken farming and processing. 

Adaptations were made to activities conducted 

in the teaching farm so as to adhere to Covid-19 

protocols for the safety and heath of teachers and 

students.

We provide opportunities for university students 

to gain work experience at our operations and 

enhance their knowledge on aquaculture through 

our Synergized Aquaculture Innovative Learning 

(SAIL) programme that is established by PT Suri Tani 

Pemuka, Japfa’s aquaculture division.

In 2021, we partnered with Ministry of Education, 

Culture, Research and Technology (MoECRT) to 

offer our SAIL as part of the minitry’s Kampus 

Merdeka programme. There were 70 students 

from 14 universities joined our 6-months SAIL 

programme. This year’s focus was to facilitate 

students learning both in class and on aquaculture 

farms to enhance their skills to become a skilled 

Shrimp Farm Technician.

Innovative Learning







To better reflect our objective to develop the 

community, 

by 

raising 

the 

knowledge 

and 

competencies of local farmers and to attract 

more young people to join the profession, we 

formally changed the name of Japfa Foundation to 

Edufarmers Foundation.

The 

Edufarmers 

Foundation 

aims 

to 

forge 

advancements in Indonesia’s agricultural industry 

by promoting youth participation. We believe that 

the future of the industry lies in the hands and skills 

of young farmers. In order to attract and retain 

such individuals, the Japfa Foundation is working 

on establishing a framework that seeks to raise the 

professionalism of the industry through education 

and professional improvements.

Edufarmers Foundation





The Bertani Untuk Negeri programme is set up with the 

objective to play a role in addressing the global concern for 

succession in the agriculture industry. We aim to encourage 

more young people to join the agriculture industry by helping 

them to see a future in the profession. The programme seeks to 

equip them with the skills and capabilities to adapt to modern 

farming methods and to pave the way for them to potentially 

become entrepreneurs with their own agri-businesses. 

Bertani Untuk Negeri has conducted two programmes for the 

best alumni from animal husbandry and veterinary degree 

programmes in Indonesia.

Through Bertani Untuk Negeri, we hope to mobilise 

the next generation of young Indonesians to work 

together with farmers to transfer knowledge and 

technology to our contract farmers, especially those 

with small capacity, in increasing the productivity 

of their farms. Throughout the programme, our 

contract farmers can learn, innovate, and adopt 

more optimal and efficient farming management 

practices.Better performance helps smaller contract 

farmers gain easier access to capital which can in 

turn be deployed to further improve their farms.  

In 2021, our focus areas were West Java, Banten 

and East Java of Indonesia. We also participated 

in MoECRT’s Kampus Merdeka Programme and 

partnered with 27 universities. 

To measure the effectiveness of our programme, we 

always perform activity impact measurements by 

assessing participants’ skills from baseline, midline, 

and endline. This helps us to understand our impact 

and continuously improve our programme.

In Purwakarta, we took the initiative to build a 

biofloc pond with the help of the local community. 

The local communities were also taught how to 

farm aquaculture animals using biofloc technology.

Biofloc systems, which were originally designed 

as a natural way to filter water, are becoming 

increasingly popular as a low-cost approach to 

clean the wastewater of fish and shrimp farms, 

conserve feed inputs, utilise the wastewater during 

production and let beneficial bacterial colonies 

proliferate in culture water. Biofloc principles 

require no initial investment, merely sunlight, a 

carbohydrate source, and aeration.

As the biofloc system promotes more efficient 

water usage, we target to double the number of 

biofloc ponds by the next reporting period.

With the help of parents and teachers, our 

Japfa Green School programme aims to raise 

environmental awareness among the teachers at 

students at schools. Through this initiative, we 

hope to encourage them to create healthy school 

by implementing Japfa Green School Management 

Model. For example, by planting plants and 

vegetables and good waste management practice. 

In 2021, we conducted an online training for 

64 students from 10 schools. Various activities 

were taught in this session, including gardening 

techniques, waste 

management, 

and 

energy 

conservation. The materials were created carefully 

and environmental facilitators were present to 

assist its implementation. During the programme, 

students were also given log books for recording

the activity since students can share the results of 

their gardens with them.

Plants and vegetables from the garden are 

eventually harvested and the students can cook 

their own meal using produced vegetables to create 

a balanced meal following the “Isi Piringku” - a 

balanced diet plate guide by the Indonesian Ministry 

of Health. The guide illustrates the recommended

This year commemorates Japfa’s 50th anniversary. 

Japfa India celebrated by organising a Sustainability 

Walk across its units in October and launched 

a green campaign to increase awareness in the 

Company’s sustainability initiatives and the efforts 

taken. Part of the green campaign also included tree 

planting in the new feedmill.

In Myanmar, we also worked with the government 

on a tree-planting project, contributing over 500 

trees. Hardwood trees and sunflowers were among 

the flora that will be planted.

In recognition of a healthy biodiversity, Japfa 

initiated several efforts such as mangrove planting 

and coral restoration.

We have also initiated mangrove planting activities 

with local government in Anyer. During the event, 

we also to cleaned up the beach from waste. In 

Banyuwangi, we also planted corals with the local 

fisherman group as an attempt to restore the 

marine area. 

We look forward to the day that this area will 

develop and can function optimally to maintain 

the sustainability, harmony, and balance of the 

ecosystem.

Sports

Japfa Chess Club was formed in 2000. The 

Club was set up to offer consistent and 

steady support for Indonesians to hone 

their skills for chess and prepare young 

athletes to continue the footsteps of 

Indonesia’s leading Grandmaster in the 

international arena. We trained students 

at 10 schools which comprise of:

• Six Japfa for Kids schools

• 4 locations of target schools: 2 schools in 

Yogyakarta &amp; 2 schools in Padang

Japfa Chess Club



Our 2021 Focus



• Built a system where the curriculum was 

laid out to be more structured

• Implemented teaching management so 

that we can deliver lessons effectively

• Provided tutorial materials and 

assignments for the club members and 

trained students

• Recruited more young chess players, 

especially in Japfa for Kids programme 

areas

• Encouraged 

our employees 

who are chess 

masters to 

train young 

chess players

We realised that each individual had a different 

starting chess ability so a tiered curriculum was 

created. The levels are:

• Basic

• Intermediate

• Advance

The tiered curriculum was initially implemented 

for employees and replicated for the school 

programmes too.

• In the first six months, participants should 

know basic chess theory and opening theories

• In the 7 - 12 months, participants are taught to 

make strategies in playing chess

Tournament

Since 2000, we have been working with the 

Indonesia Chess Federation (PB Percasi). Various 

championships have been held and Indonesian chess 

accomplishments have been achieved. In 2021, four 

Indonesian chess players were selected to compete 

in the 2021 Chess World Cup in Sochi, Russia. For 

the first time in history, Indonesia had four male 

and female chess players to qualify for the Chess 

World Cup at the same time. The FIDE World Cup 

featured GM Susanto Megaranto and IM Mohamad 

Ervan, while the FIDE Women’s World Cup included 

WGM Irene Kharisma Sukandar and WGM Medina 

Warda Aulia.

We host annual Japfa Chess Tournament as a form 

of leisure activity for our employees, at the same 

time, to discover new chess professionals and even 

Grand Masters amongst us. Various employees 

of the Japfa Group participated in this internal 

tournament which was conducted in stages starting 

at the regional to the international level. Since 

2020, this tournament was held virtually due to the 

Covid-19 pandemic.





The Japfa Peduli Programme is an initiative by PT 

Japfa Tbk to help the community in disaster recovery. 

Japfa Peduli is established in 2017, as a continuation 

of the Japfa’s disaster response programme to 

better coordinate necessary emergency assistance 

to reach the affected communities quickly.

In July 2021, flash floods hit six sub-districts in 

Madapangga District, Bima, Indonesia, with dozens 

of educational, health, worship places, and other 

public facilities affected. Japfa Peduli acted swiftly 

to distribute food packages to 400 families in seven 

villages.

In early December 2021, the Mount Semeru 

volcano in Indonesia had its largest eruption in 

recent history, causing an avalanche of hot clouds 

and heavy ashfall. Tens of thousands of people in 

East Java’s Lumajang and Malang regencies were 

affected. Residents in the Semeru mountain area 

were forced to flee from their homes. Japfa Peduli 

responded swiftly to supply community necessities, 

including medicine, tents, eggs, frozen chicken, 

emergency tents, and medical assistance, for the 

affected residents.

In order to accelerate the Lake Toba development 

as a Super Priority Tourism Destination (DPSP), a 

strong synergy is needed between the government, 

entrepreneurs, and the community working hand 

in hand. The Toba Tilapia Micro, Small Medium 

Enterprise (MSME) Development Programme is 

initiated by our Indonesia subsidiary PT Suri Tani 

Pemuka in support of the tourism development in 

the Lake Toba area.

Various efforts were made to strengthen the 

community and to facilitate tourism activities. This 

social responsibility programme involves a series 

of activities, from training on hygiene practices, to 

improvement on shop cleanliness and quality of the 

food and drinks served. 

Toba Tilapia MSME Development Programme



Currently, STP has started to implement the 

programme around the company’s operational area, 

which is Simalungun and starting from the Tigaras 

Port area with three shop pilot projects, namely 

the Kedai Kopi Bintang Rizki, Kedai Makan Sabila, 

and Kedai Makan Sangga Boi. STP will monitor and 

evaluate this programme to continuously develop 

and refine for the next stage of implementation.

We strive to provide the widest possible benefits 

to the surrounding community. Through the Toba 

Tilapia MSME Development Programme, we help 

and assist local communities to make Lake Toba as 

a world class tourist destination.



On April 23, Japfa Vietnam’s “Care &amp; Share” event 

focusing on Employee Social Responsibility, was 

officially launched in Binh Xuyen district with more 

than 30 participants from Vinh Phuc Feed Mill. 

Coordinating with representatives of Binh Xuyen 

People’s Committee and Red Cross Organisation, the 

Company gifted 40 care packages, 10 wheelchairs, 

and over 130 meals for people in need. Planning 

ahead, Japfa Vietnam aims to carry out more 

nationwide activities to support and contribute to 

the local communities and environment. 

In early 2021, Japfa donated 80,000 day-old-chicks 

to households in Quang Binh province, Vietnam 

to support the recovery and development of 

areas affected by natural disasters and floods. 

Japfa Vietnam also donated more than VND 800 

million to build school infrastructure and provide 

necessities to students in Quang Ngai and Tra Bong 

areas to give them a better environment to learn.

“

The 2021 political crisis 

in Myanmar disrupted 

the Covid-19 pandemic 

countermeasures in the 

country. Japfa Myanmar 

provided assistance and 

delivered humanitarian 

aid from the Indonesian 

government. 

Our operations flourish with the community and 

it has become one of the Company’s focus areas 

to assist and support the community, especially 

during the Covid-19 pandemic. As Japfa’s ongoing 

commitment to its stakeholders in disaster 

situations, we have implemented disaster response 

efforts quickly and properly in mitigating Covid-19 

through various activities, among others. We 

encourage the provision of assistance by utilising 

what we have, namely, from internal resources. This 

year, we covered wider areas with more activities, 

although the number of beneficiaries decreased.

In addition, we also provide a disaster response 

implemented through community empowerment 

programme, such as:

1. Kampung Tangguh Programme in eight sub- 

districts

2. Animal protein food assistance to communities 

in East Java and Central Java

3. Vaccination Programme in Purwokerto

We are working closely with the community where 

we communicate our CSR initiatives through 

regular dialogue. As a form of support, eggs and 

groceries were donated for people underprivileged 

and to an orphanage around the farm. Located 

near our area, there is a Covid-19 Centre where 

our workers who are tested positive for the virus 

are also quarantined there. We donated personal 

protection equipment, such as maskers, hand 

sanitiser and groceries to the Centre.

We provided the local community with 

essentials including masks, face shield, and 

oxygen that was high in demand during the 

second wave in 2021. We also provided the 

surrounding community with rice, eggs, 

as well as donated MMK3.5 million to the 

country to help Covid-19 prevention and 

treatment. On September 2021, alongside the 

Indonesian Diplomat in Yangon, the Managing 

Director of Japfa Myanmar delivered first hand 

humanitarian aid worth US$200,000 from the 

Indonesian government to the Myanmar Red 

Cross Society. 

We continue to support the community in the fight 

against Covid-19. In addition to giving out food 

supplies, in June, Japfa Vietnam handed over US$1 

million (VND 23 billion) to the Central Committee 

of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, contributing to 

the Covid-19 vaccine fund. Through this donation, 

Japfa Vietnam hopes to join hands with the national 

government to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination 

program, create a premise for economic recovery 

and  development.
