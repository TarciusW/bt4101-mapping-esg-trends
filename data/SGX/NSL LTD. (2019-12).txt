This Report






Board 

Statement

NSL Ltd is pleased to issue its third sustainability report in 

line with the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) requirements 

on Sustainability Reporting. 

Singapore designated 2019 as the year towards zero waste 

and we are proud to play our part in this national effort. 

Waste treatment is integral to our business and this year 

has been important for NSL Ltd as we began operations 

at our new Industrial Wastewater Treatment Complex in 

Singapore. The plant treats hazardous industrial wastewater 

to meet Public Utilities Board (“PUB”) Sewer Discharge 

standards using a series of physical, chemical and biological 

processes. The methane generated from the biological 

process can be used as an energy source; thereby reducing 

reliance on electricity supply from the grid. 

Emerging technologies brought about requirements 

for new skill sets. Hence, we continued to focus on the 

training and development of our human capital. This 

included sponsoring one staff to pursue Master’s degree 

in artificial intelligence and data science. 

Migrant workers are an important part of our workforce 

and their well-being is our responsibility. We provided 

new housing for our workers in Singapore and we are in 

the process of arranging similar accommodation for our 

workers in Malaysia. 

We also continued to reduce the health, safety and 

security risks pertaining to our business. Last year, the 

upgrading 

of our security 

standards and 

parameters  

saw Raffles Marina relaunching 

its Custom Immigration Quarantine Procedures in 

November 2019. Boaters can now arrive or leave the marina 

without having to commute to the Western Quarantine 

and Immigration Anchorage off Sisters’ Islands for 

immigration clearance. We are also on course to obtain 

the ISO 45001 certification across different business units.

“Sustainability considerations 

continue to play a strategic role 

in our decision-making and the 

Board continues to oversee the 

management and governance 

of sustainability at NSL Ltd.”



The Board would like to thank the management and 

employees for their support in developing and upholding 

our sustainable products and practices, and for their help 

in the preparation of this report.

Green Products 

and Services

Sustainability is at the heart of our main business 

offerings, from the processing and safe disposal 

of hazardous waste to the development and 

distribution of green concrete. We place great value 

on producing green products and services. 

Progress in Our Green Products and 

Service Portfolio

New Industrial Wastewater 

Treatment Complex 

Our new Industrial Wastewater 

Treatment Complex in Tuas, Singapore, 

was officially opened in July 2019. The treatment 

complex is designed to treat a wide spectrum of 

industrial wastewater with high total dissolved solids 

and high chemical oxygen demand (“COD”) from 

pharmaceutical, petrochemicals, chemical and 

automotive industries. 

As part of our effort to promote sustainability 

in Singapore, the treatment complex relies 

on a combination of physical, chemical and 

biological processes to treat hazardous 

wastewater into effluent that can be safely 

discharged into the public sewers. Our 

multi-stage treatment processes result in 

lower energy and emissions as compared 

to incineration of wastewater. In addition, 

our anaerobic degradation (a biological 

process) of wastewater, generates methane, 

which can be converted into electricity, thus 

reducing consumption of electricity from the 

grid and improving overall energy efficiency.



Our Performance

32% 

of total projects volume produced are made 

from green concrete mix 

(increased by 2% as compared to 2018)

Green Concrete

We continue to offer 35 varieties of green concrete 

to support sustainable construction in Singapore 

and Malaysia. Green concrete contributes 32% of our 

project volume, which reflects the demand for greener 

materials in construction. A large number of real estate 

developers aim to secure green building certifications, 

such as the Building Construction Authority’s (“BCA”) 

Green Mark certification, signalling a positive shift 

for the future. NSL Ltd is pleased to support this 

sustainable transition.

Energy

Energy is a pivotal resource in the operation of our 

business industrial processes. Therefore, from a 

business perspective, NSL Group is committed to 

improving its energy management.

According to Singapore’s Energy Conservation 

Act (Chapter 92c), any industrial facility that 

attains the energy use threshold (54 terajoules 

of energy used per calendar year) in at least two 

of three preceding calendar years is required to 

register with NEA. Once registered, companies 

will appoint an energy manager and begin 

monitoring and reporting their energy use and 

greenhouse gas emissions each year. These will be 

supplemented and managed in accordance with 

an annual energy efficiency improvement plan. 

How We Manage and Reduce Our  

Energy Use

One of NSL OilChem Waste Management (“NOWM”) 

facilities exceeded NEA’s energy threshold for two out 

of three previous years. Hence, the facility at 23 Tanjong 

Kling was registered with NEA. In addition, two energy 

managers have been appointed, and will be trained 

and certified as Singapore Certified Energy Managers 

in 2020. The instatement of energy managers 

encourages us to closely monitor our energy use and 

identify opportunities to simultaneously improve our 

energy efficiency and cut energy costs. We aim to roll 

out an energy improvement plan by 2020. 

An example of our energy management initiatives 

is the use of by-product biogas, methane, from our 

wastewater treatment process to generate electricity 

for consumption within the plant. This initiative 

reduces the need for fossil fuel-derived energy and 

improves the energy efficiency of our treatment 

complex. We aim to implement this in 2020. 

Our Performance

A summary of energy consumption figures by NOWM 

facility for this year is tabulated. Energy consumption 

include electricity, diesel and incineration of industrial 

waste.

Waste 

Management

As a leading provider of waste treatment and 

disposal services, we believe waste management 

is core to our business. While we assist our 

customers in managing their waste, we also seek 

to responsibly manage and reduce the waste 

produced by our own operations.

How We Manage and Reduce Our 

Waste

In our Precast and PBU operations in Malaysia, as part 

of a regulatory requirement for waste containment, 

we have set up a new scheduled waste shelter for 

storage of oily or hazardous waste. 

At NOWM, we continue to follow international 

standards for safe wastewater discharge and disposal 

of incineration ashes. At Raffles Marina, we aim to 

reduce waste by reducing or eliminating the use 

of single-use plastic where possible and raising 

awareness on food waste reduction. 

Our Performance

For NOWM’s operations, waste generated can 

be separated into hazardous and non-hazardous 

waste. 0.2% (by weight) of total waste generated 

comprise non-hazardous waste while 99.8% 

(by weight) of total waste generated comprise 

hazardous waste. 

The following data presents the hazardous waste 

generated by Eastern Pretech Malaysia’s (“EPM”) and 

NOWM’s operations in 2019 by disposal method.1 

We have provided hazardous waste in percentage, 

as the total number is commercially sensitive.

Air Quality, Noise 

and Dust Pollution

At the start of 2019, Singapore Government enacted 

the Carbon Pricing Act 2018 which states that any 

industrial facility with greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 

emissions equal to or above 2,000 tCO2e annually must 

register as a reportable facility. Any facility with GHG 

emissions equal to or above 25,000 tCO2e is required 

to be registered as a taxable facility and to submit a 

Monitoring Plan and an Emission Report annually. 

This is a positive step by the Singapore government 

to make industrial organisations more aware of the 

environmental externalities associated with their 

production processes. NSL co-operates with the 

Singapore government to monitor and manage its 

GHG emissions.

How We Manage Air Quality, Noise 

and Dust Pollution

Our operations can have a negative impact on air 

quality with the emission of greenhouse gases and 

the creation of dust and noise pollution. This year, 

we commenced a GHG quantification exercise to 

determine our total scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 

across different business units in Singapore, which 

has been tabulated.

 

In 2018, the GHG Emissions for NOWM’s 23 Tanjong 

Kling Facility was above 2,000 tCO2e but less 

than 25,000 tCO2e. As such, this facility has been 

registered with NEA as a reportable facility this year 

and we will begin submitting annual Emissions 

Report to NEA in 2020. 

We will continue to conduct boundary noise 

measurements and noise mapping of our 

facilities to manage the noise generated from our 

operations. At NOWM’s 23 Tanjong Kling facility, air 

particles, dust exposure and chemical effluents are 

closely monitored and mitigated through newly 

implemented scrubbing technology.

Industrial facilities and processes are highly regulated 

due to risks associated with them. NSL Ltd is committed 

to reducing risk and abiding by regulations to ensure 

compliance with stringent quality and safety standards. 

We seek to improve our risk assessment processes, 

emergency preparedness and monitoring, as guided by 

international best practices and standards. 

How We Manage Environmental 

Compliance

We work closely with Statutory Boards such as the 

NEA, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) and 

PUB on compliance issues. We aim to minimise the 

risk of incidents arising from non-compliance in focal 

areas such as water and effluent discharge, and in the 

handling of hazardous materials and fire. For example, 

NOWM completed the construction of a new shelter for 

flammable and non-flammable material storage in 2019. 

Our Performance

NSL considers environmental compliance to be of 

utmost importance. However, we have had some 

minor incidents of non-compliance at NOWM facilities. 

NOWM was issued a composite fine for discharging 

wastewater that exceeded COD discharge standards, 

and another composite fine for discharging non-

compliant trade effluent into public sewer. We have 

since taken measures to prevent recurrence.

Caring for  

Our People

Our people are at the heart of what we do. We 

are focused on talent acquisition, development 

and retention, and strive to ensure employee 

health, safety and well-being.

Labour Practices, Employee 

Training and Welfare

NSL Group places great value on our employees 

with strong emphasis on their development, welfare 

and well-being. We treat them as an extended 

family through initiatives that facilitate cooperation, 

team bonding and camaraderie. Ultimately, we 

aspire to create a thriving workspace where 

employees are motivated and aligned to the vision 

and mission of the Group. 

How We Manage Our Talent

Our human capital management approach is 

based on five key pillars: fair labour practices, talent 

attraction, training and development, employee 

engagement, welfare and well-being.

Fair Labour Practices

We are committed to extend fair 

labour practices to every staff across 

our businesses, regardless of function. 23% of our 

employees in Singapore and Malaysia operations 

are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In 

2019, we completed a review of our job grade and 

compensation structure for our staff. We are also 

particularly conscious of our migrant workers, both 

in Singapore and in Malaysia. We are heavily reliant 

on them for our operations. 

At NOWM, in lieu of housing allowance, we provide 

comfortable dormitories in close proximity to our 

23 Tanjong Kling work site. In addition to basic 

amenities such as washing machines and Wi-Fi, 

our dormitories include a sports area and a gym,

Talent Attraction

In 2019, we sought new avenues to 

attract talent. 

At our Environmental Services division, we 

continued our participation in the Earn and Learn 

Programme for Institute of Technical Education 

(“ITE”) students to develop local talent in Singapore. 

Students undergo a 12-month attachment at our 

laboratory with the aim of joining us full-time post-

graduation. 

In addition to the Earn and Learn Programme, 

Eastern Pretech Singapore supports young talent 

through the iBuildSG Undergraduate Scholarship, a 

joint scholarship with BCA to encourage students to 

enter the Built Environment sector. Post-graduation, 

students will have the opportunity to work full-time 

with Eastern Pretech.

Training and Development

With changes in market trends, 

stakeholder needs and technology, the 

ongoing training and development 

of our employees’ skills and knowledge is pivotal 

to the success of our business. In 2019, more than 

95% of our employees receive performance and 

career development reviews. We have allocated 2% 

of our salary budget for training cost. We believe 

employees are a positive long-term investment, and 

that the development of employee skills not only 

improves business outcomes but increases employee 

satisfaction in the long run. 

In 2019, NSL Ltd sponsored one employee for Master’s 

degrees in artificial intelligence and data science. Some 

of our design staff from Eastern Pretech Singapore also 

spent time in Malaysia to share best practices with the 

newly expanded teams. 

NOWM also sponsored an engineer to attend a short 

course on engineering processes at the Singapore 

Polytechnic. 

We have previously reported our intention to carry 

out more soft-skills training programmes. This 

year, we sent some of our mid-level employees to 

Kaplan, an external trainer, for soft-skills training in 

areas such as communication. During the year, our 

Human Resource staff worked closely with migrant 

workers struggling with English to help bridge the 

communication gap. 

At Raffles Marina, we brought in external trainers from 

the Singapore Hotel and Tourism Education Centre to 

work with our heads of department and outlet 

managers in reviewing current policies and 

practices and coming up with tangible 

new initiatives to improve work flow 

and employee efficiency. 

 

Employee Engagement

We believe it is important to engage 

our staff, maintaining a pulse on their 

needs and concerns, so that we can 

improve their everyday work experiences. We also 

believe in promoting collaboration and interaction 

between employees from different business units and 

rewarding staff for their hard work. 

At NOWM, staff from the 23 Tanjong Kling facility were 

invited for a walkthrough with its Chief Executive 

Officer of the new industrial wastewater treatment 

complex in Tuas. The staff were given a tour of the 

complex, and an explanation of the processes and 

business outlook of the new complex. The staff had 

an opportunity to engage with their CEO and gain a 

better understanding of services.

EPM organised a company trip to Colmar Tropicale 

in Pahang, Malaysia. 105 staff came together to 

participate in a mix of engagement activities and 

games. Employees were split into teams and tasked 

with various objectives to encourage collaborative 

problem-solving.

Welfare and Well-being

At NSL Ltd, we are proud to be a 

community. We believe in caring for 

our staff through annual healthcare 

screenings and engaging them in various activities 

that keep them healthy, happy and active. This year, 

we organised sports activities, creative workshops, a 

Desaru family trip, festive celebrations, and our annual 

Dinner and Dance. 

In Singapore, our NSL Sports &amp; Recreation Club 

(“SRC”) Committee organised recreational activities 

to promote healthy lifestyles and strong employee 

bonds across different business units in Singapore. 

This year, we had four main “Active Day” activities. 

These activities enabled our employees to unwind.

NSL Group, in which staff designed 

their own air plant terrariums and 

learnt the basics of caring for air plants. 

NSL SRC also organised a brush lettering 

workshop, which allowed staff to express 

their creativity and test their penmanship and 

drawing skills. Creative workshops such as these are 

excellent for helping our staff destress and relax.

NSL SRC also organised an exciting end-of-year 

trip to Desaru, where NSL Group employees in 

Singapore could bring along family members at 

a subsidised rate. The Desaru trip featured many 

family friendly activities including a visit to fruit 

farms and firefly watching. 

In January, NSL Group held its annual Dinner &amp; 

Dance 2019 at RM’s ballroom with the theme,  

“Life’s a Beach!”. 

In March, EPM held its annual dinner at Le Meridien 

Putrajaya with 277 staff in attendance. With 

the theme, “Magical Blue Night”, the event 

showcased fantastic performances with

appreciation to staff who have been 

with the company for 10, 15 and 20 

years by presenting them with long 

service awards.

Over and above the organised 

recreational activities, NSL Ltd 

promotes staff well-being by featuring 

health and well-being related articles in 

our quarterly NSLink newsletters. These 

articles bring attention to a mix of issues 

including sleep, dementia, healthy eating and 

workplace health and safety. We also distribute 

fresh fruits to our employees to remind them the 

importance of good nutrition and healthy snacking.

Workplace Health 

and Safety

Workplace health and safety is crucial in our industry 

and it underpins how we operate, from planning to 

execution. 

Safety &amp; Health Committees at each subsidiary assess 

operational requirements and schedule staff for 

compulsory safety courses, such as Occupational 

First Aid Course with Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 

and Automated External Defibrillator, chemical 

safety awareness, safe lifting operations and forklift 

operations. Our environmental services business in 

Sinagpore as well as our precast operations in Malaysia 

are preparing to convert to ISO 45001. We have 

nominated employees at each site to undergo training 

and aim to complete the conversion by end 2020.

To ensure we are always ready during an emergency, 

staff continue to be trained or refreshed in mandatory 

safety trainings required for Company Emergency 

Response Team (“CERT”). For example, at Raffles 

Marina, our team underwent a kitchen fire simulation 

at the Marina Bistro restaurant. At NOWM, SCDF 

conducted a CERT audit to validate the competency 

and effectiveness of the team. SCDF awarded the 

company a pass with commendation for the audit.

At NOWM’s 23 Tanjong Kling site, we adopted 

several changes to address safety hazards, over 

and above legal requirements. We recently 

purchased a 50kg mobile fire extinguisher 

and placed fire extinguishers balls in 

switch rooms where the use of water 

sprinklers could damage sensitive electrical 

equipment. We have also changed the 

route of our company shuttle bus to 

drop off and pick up employees outside 

company premises, thereby eliminating the 

need for our employees to cross the road. 

We have also conducted manual handling 

briefings to our staff.

To address these hazards 

and prevent similar 

accidents from occurring 

in the future, we 

implemented necessary 

preventive measures. In 

particular at NOWM’s 23 

Tanjong Kling’s facility, to 

protect our workers from 

exposure to fumes, we have 

installed a scrubber system to 

capture fumes emitted from our 

waste treatment process.

In addition, we have introduced a voluntary reporting 

system to encourage people to identify and record 

near misses. 

As a demonstration of our strong health and safety 

practices, NOWM’s Quality Control Manager and 

Workplace Safety &amp; Health Officer were invited by 

Waste Management &amp; Recycling Association of 

Singapore to give a talk to industry professionals on 

laboratory, workplace and fire safety in toxic industrial 

waste companies at the Singapore Polytechnic. The 

talk aimed to support the development of chemical 

management occupational health and safety 

capabilities in Singapore. Similarly, NOWM supports its 

clients by providing in-house diesel spillage training.

In 2019, Raffles Marina relaunched its Custom 

Immigration Quarantine Procedures. Apart from 

intensifying its security with more barricades and 

secure access gates, RM also increased CCTV camera 

monitoring, erected glass panel barricade and 

engaged auxiliary police armed guards.

Our Performance

There were 38 loss time injuries cases among our 

employees and contract workers in Singapore and 

Malaysia in 2019.

reminded of the need to avoid conflicts of interest 

and corruption, as well as upholding our no gift 

policy during festive periods. We also enforce a 

strict whistleblowing policy. 

Our Performance

In 2019, we had no incident of corruption nor 

complaint on anti-competitive behaviour, anti-trust, 

or monopoly practices. 

Targets

•	 Maintain	zero	corruption

•	 Maintain	zero	anti-

competitive behaviour

•	 Ensure	100%	of	staff

Product Quality and 

Customer Satisfaction

NSL Group strives to be a market leader and works 

hard to maintain the high quality of its products and 

services. We solicit informal and formal feedback from 

our customers through customer surveys to assess 

our quality of service. We also endeavour to innovate 

to stay ahead of the curve and create relevant 

products that will serve our customers needs. 

Digital Innovation 

We embraced challenges and opportunities to 

improve efficiency by introducing digital innovation 

such as automation and analytical capabilities across 

our businesses. We continue to seek innovative 

solutions for new products and services and 

enhance productivity and competitiveness. The 

Group’s Corporate Research and Development 

(“CRD”) and IT Departments work hand in hand 

with various subsidiaries to harness opportunities in 

digitalisation to automate processes and streamline 

workflows.

We took a step towards the digitalisation of 

procurement processes through the adoption of an 

eProcurement Software-as-a-Service solution. With 

this software, all communication with suppliers, 

including information dissemination and tender 

proposal compilation are centrally stored and 

managed with a log for audit purpose. This helps 

to reduce time, cost and paperwork during the 

procurement process and ensures that all tenders 

are carried out with absolute transparency.

At NOWM, we introduced the Maintenance 

Management System (“MMS”) as an online platform 

to keep a digital record of all maintenance activities 

and track the status of each maintenance job 

request. The analytics feature of the MMS also 

provides statistics on the mean time between 

Target

We aim to roll out our customer satisfaction 

survey and release the results in 2020













failures and the mean time for repair, providing 

equipment performance insight. The MMS also aids 

planning, as maintenance jobs can be scheduled in 

advance and routed to relevant maintenance staff 

for follow up. All in all, the MMS helps to increase 

the operational efficiency of our equipment and 

minimise downtime, supporting our continuous 

operations.

Our Performance

Eastern Pretech conducted a customer satisfaction 

survey in 2019. Ratings received from the survey 

ranged from average to good. We will take the 

feedback from the survey to further improve our 

service. 

The IT Department also has been collaborating with 

NOWM to optimise the scheduling and routing of 

NOWM’s land-based logistic fleet. This solution aims 

to optimise the job schedule for our vehicles so as to 

maximise fleet utilisation and provide route guidance 

to drivers, enabling their navigation from job to job in 

an efficient manner. In addition, this solution reduces 

the complexity and hassle of manual operations 

planning, so that staff can direct their time toward 

value adding tasks such as customer relationship 

management. This project, which started in 2019, is 

being executed in several phases, and the full benefit 

of the solution is likely to be realised in 2020.

Community 

Initiatives

NSL Group gives back to the community through 

employee volunteering and fundraising initiatives. 

We believe in supporting communities where our 

employees and customers come from. We enjoy 

engaging in various causes and doing our part to be 

good corporate citizens.

• In conjunction with Children’s Day, 19 NOWM staff 

volunteered in Yangzheng Primary School’s Project 

SeedLinks, which encourages preschoolers and 

primary school children to explore science.

• Emily See, Senior Chemist from NOWM Quality 

Control department, shared her experience in the 

environmental services industry at the Yangzheng 

Primary School’s Career Day. Primary 6 students 

were given a sneak peek into what it was like to 

work in a laboratory and how they can apply 

Chemistry theories in practice.

Awareness 

Month event

• NSL SRC spearheaded the NSL Love Movement 

2019 to raise funds for Melrose Home Children’s 

Aid Society. This event encouraged staff to give 

back to society. The total donation raised from 

the Company and staff came up to $16,388. These 

funds went towards the provision of daily meals for 

60 children at Children’s Aid Society Melrose Home.

• EPM collaborated with Aisha Kidz Planet and 

Zensori Solutions, a school for differently-abled 

children, to commemorate Autism Awareness 

Month in April. Through the use of 3D glasses, latex 

gloves, writing pad and tools, event participants got 

to experience the reality of a person with autism. 

The event also shared the effects of autism on 

children and their families as well as methods for 

interacting with children with autism.
