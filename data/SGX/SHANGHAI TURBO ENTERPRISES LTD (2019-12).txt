1. BOARD STATEMENT 

 

We are pleased to present our third Sustainability Report of Shanghai Turbo Enterprises Limited (“STE” or 

“Group”) which covers the Group’s performance from 1st January to 31st December 2019 (Reporting period). 

This report covers all relevant materiality of sustainable issues, performance and ESG factors of our group 

and it is prepared accordance to the Core Option of GRI Standards. 

 

The BOD appoints a 3-member Steering Committee consist of the AC Chairman, the CEO (Zhang Rong 

resigned on 10 May 2019, Long Wei appointed on 10 May 2019 and Tan Juay Kiat appointed GM on 13 May 

2020) and the lead supervisor to work with the Working Committee since May 2019. In the process the team 

brought out many issues and subjects for discussion and had provided pragmatic solutions. 

 

In 2019, we continue to deal with the energy saving by 24% and re-organize work forces to address them at 

all levels. The new board of directors worked hand in hand with the management focusing more on the 

production areas like enhancing machine programming, waste management etc. 

 

In this crisis Covid-19 situation, we have already felt the near-term business-model disruptions and broader 

transition risks. The pandemic presents an unforeseen challenge to industrial operators as they face the 

immediate impact of plummeting demand for many products, as well as pressing needs to ensure the safety 

of employees. In the current transition to the “next normal,” we may have a window of opportunity to adapt 

the operations to help reduce the disruption that climate change will ultimately bring.  But more 

importantly, 2020 would be a challenging year in realigning policies as well as the need for innovating our 

processes, be it for resilient, sustainability or the most urgently needed - survival. 

 

The 4 non-executive independent directors, Mr. Wee Liang Hiam (Lead Non-executive and Independent 

Director, RC Chairman, AC Member &amp; NC Member), Mr. Philip Leng Yew Chee (Non-executive and 

Independent Director, AC Chairman, RC Member &amp; NC Member), Mr. Nick Ong Sing Huat (Non-executive and 

Independent Director, NC Chairman, AC Member &amp; RC Member) and Mr. Roland Seet Chong Tong 

(Non-executive and Independent Director) were appointed on 1st October 2018 and all stepped down on 

30th April 2019 at the AGM. A new board comprising 4 Non-executive and Independent Directors and 1 

Non-independent director, Mr. Huang Wooi Teik (Non-Executive Chairman and Lead Independent Director, 

NC Chairman, AC Member &amp; RC Member), Mr. Loh Kai Keong (Non-executive and Independent Director, AC 

Chairman, NC Member &amp; RC Member), Mr. Koh Wee Kiang (Non-executive and Independent Director, RC 

Chairman, AC Member &amp; NC Member), Mr. Lee Kiang Piaw (Non-executive and Independent Director, AC 

Member, NC Member &amp; RC Member) and Dr. Wong Kee Hau (Non-Independent and Non-Executive Director 

&amp; NC Member) were appointed on 30th April 2019. Together with the existing Non-Independent and 

Non-Executive Director &amp; NC Member, Dr. Daniel Liu Danjun, the new board has 6 members. The new board 

will continue to monitor and maintain oversight over the process of the reporting on a quarterly basis. 

 

The Board wishes to thank all who had participated in this SR exercise and aim at forging together for the  

challenging years ahead.

2.3 Our Capabilities 

We are China’s leading High-Technology Industrial Vane Manufacturer. To meet the high degree of 

dimensional accuracy required in our manufacturing process, we continually invest in cutting-edge 

technology. Our digital controlled precision machinery includes Japanese-made Mori Seiki Machines, 

Swiss-made Starragheckert 5 -axis manufacturing equipment, Korean-made Daewo vertical manufacturing 

machines and latest 10 units of Italy-made C.B. Ferrari precision cutting equipment 

 

2019 is full of challenges! With market uncertainty and decreasing sales, we have been devoting resources 

to regaining our key clients’ confidence in our technical capability. The entire sales and production 

processors have been enhanced with the ultimate intention to increase customer satisfaction in all angles. As 

such, we have been reinforcing our pool of skilled workers from sourcing new talents to engaging 

consultants.

2.4 Regaining The Old Ground And New Business Growth Initiatives 

Diversification, Downstream and Upstream business expansion 

The current year is a difficult one that we strive to rebuild old customers’ confidence in us. This will take time 

and we have continued to do so in 2020. The Covid-19 in 2020 is casting an unknown and dark cloud not 

only in this industry but all over the world. On the other hand, we continue to venture into other areas of 

product lines beside turbo engine vanes though profit margin could be lower but it helps to cover some 

overhead cost. 

 

In the next 3 years, we will maintain our core business of vane production while transforming and 

diversifying to becoming a qualified supplier of aviation blades and military products OEM. Our target is to 

reduce reliance on traditional source of income from a 100% single vane processing structure to 50% or less.

3. SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT AND APPROACH   

 

We are aware of the responsibility of an organization towards its community and country in relation to 

sustainable ESG factors before the Singapore Stock Exchange’s (“SGX”) mandated for all listed entities to 

report their sustainability performance as most of our senior staff had attended ESG related talks and 

implemented policies according to the local compliance which could be found in this report. 

 

In recent years, the change in the procurement method of turbine manufacturers has put OEM, like us, in a 

disadvantage, as our profit margins are being squeezed due to fierce competition. By the upward expansion 

of our business, we could reduce both material wastage and processing time drastically. This, in turn, will 

increase our profit margin significantly in the long run. 

 

During 2019, STE has adopted a sustainability framework based on the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) 

Standards guidelines (Core Option) in the preparation of this report. This report is part of our annual report 

which is also available at STE’s website at www.Shanghaiturbo.com 

 

3.1 Participation of Key Management in formation of our sustainability strategy 

A Steering Committee (3 members including AC Chairman, GM and the lead supervisor) and a Working 

Committee (5 members including deputy GM, group FC, subsidiary FM, HR manager and the lead supervisor) 

were formed to lead the Company’s sustainability efforts and are responsible for periodical meetings with 

the Board in determining sustainability issues in its business decisions. Sustainability and risk management 

are emphasized in the evaluation of any new orders or investment opportunities. The process has identified 

several material ESG factors for STE and are reflected in our materiality matrix under material considerations.

3.2 Materiality Identification Process 

 

During our materiality assessment process, we have prioritized the following steps: 

 

1. Identify and Define important issues which might impact our business strategy 

2. Sorting out critical factors that might affect our stakeholders 

3. Prioritize selected factors and validate their severity within each business unit 

4. Embed solutions in the system and monitor regularly 

5. Adopt them to become our SOP or corporate culture when tested reliable  

 

The Committees identified the specific ESG factors which are material to the Group based on their collective 

and respective knowledge, the industrial perspective and their implications to our operations. Besides the 

regular in-house meetings on operational and financial progress, the committee members also engaged in 

regular dialogue sessions with the stakeholders for feedback and suggestions. For easy understanding of our 

stakeholders’ concern, (Stakeholders include our customers, employees, investors, suppliers, community and 

regulators), we chart the following materiality matrix to reflect their degree of importance towards the 

topics during the year 2019.

3.6 Engaging the Stakeholders 

 

The Company’s sustainability objectives must always be the interest and concern of our stakeholders. 

We had listed out here the 6 key groups in this report. 

 

We firmly believe that truthful and regular communication is the key to healthy stakeholder relationship.  

Over the years, we have engaged them via AGM, annual dinner, incentive tours, in-house training 

programs, yearly industry convention, business talks and seminars, product exhibition and international  

trade fairs. Each of our business unit has always kept our stakeholders in mind in search of achieving  

our business excellence.

5.2 Current Human Capital Market in Changzhou 

During the period, 29 employees left the company representing 14% of staff members in year 2019 due to 

personal reasons. The company faces more difficulty in attracting younger workers to join our traditional 

factory and work regime, particularly the polishing department where the air particle density is much higher. 

The ratio of annual total compensation of highest- paid individual to the median of total compensation for all 

employees is around 10 times this reporting year. 

5.3 HR Policy     

During the year, the HR department had implemented several policies to enhance the benefits for the 

workers and staff which include contributing to their social security in 5 categories, transport allowances, 

seasonal greeting &amp; gifts, annual paid leaves &amp; free vocation, medical check-up expenses and paid medical 

leaves etc. For married female workers, they are eligible to apply for paid leave when they have a new born 

baby. For recruitment effort, there were more than 10 recruitment activities during the year. Trainees are 

given in- house training and coaching by the seniors, internship programs are extended to schools which 

collaborate with us. Company maintains a relatively stable employee union since incorporation. Headed by 

the manager of General Affairs Department, its role is to facilitate an effective communication channel with 

the management and organizing activities in cohesive building and enhancing corporate cultures. 

 

Costs austerity measures have been implemented to ensure the manpower are streamlined without 

compromising productivity and innovation in our product lines. More R&amp;D and higher technical staff will be 

recruited to strengthen the core technology department in order to cope with the new orders of product 

other than vanes.

7. MEASURES AND TARGETS for 2020 

In the coming years we will be focusing in resolving the following concerns. 

Sustainability Concerns 

Policies &amp; Measures 

Targets &amp; Impacted  

SDG Goals  

Diversification 

for 

Growth 

and 

Sustainability  

Our machines and skilled workers allow us 

to venture into other areas of product lines 

beside turbo engine vanes. Profit margin 

could be lower but it helps to cover some 

overhead cost. Also we are now working on 

several potential downstream businesses 

for acquisition and to expand our business 

upstream to be in a better bargaining 

position. 

 

 

 

In the next 3 years, we will 

maintain our core business 

of vane production while 

transforming &amp; diversifying 

to becoming a qualified 

supplier of aviation blades 

and military products OEM. 

Our target is to transform 

from a 100% single vane 

processing 

structure 

to 

50% or less.  

 

 

 

Environmental  

Compliance  

(There are five targets 

set for the coming 

year)  

1. Work Place Air and Environment  

We have set up a maintainance unit to 

constantly monitor the air condition and 

discharge level on a weekly basis. Workers 

are also sent for medical check-up regularly 

for 

certain 

production 

lines. 

HR 

department will report to the weekly 

management meetings. 

 

2. Waste Management 

We 

review 

the 

qualification 

and 

performance of our contractors regularly 

and assign supervisor to monitor their 

disposal procedures randomly.  

 

3. Production Safety Standardization 

We are to conduct in-house training and 

awareness seminars with all level of 

workers quarterly to ensure all safety 

standardization requirement SOPs are fully 

complied. 

 

4. Supply Chain/Responsible Procurement 

To ensure raw material supply (about 80% 

 

To renovate the Polishing 

department 

and 

to 

improve 

the 

exhaust 

system by second quarter

purchased locally in 2019) is reliable and 

flexible within our purchasing and supply 

level, we are constantly sourcing for new 

suppliers and reviewing their supply code 

of conduct.  

Also, we are implementing responsible 

procurement policies in the selection of 

construction vendors, material suppliers 

and project partners and monitor their 

ongoing performance.  

 

5. Energy Saving Plans  

In 2016 our power consumption was nearly 

RMB 5 million, this has reduced our profit 

and wasted energy due to poor power 

management and old compressors. 

We had replaced an old generator in 2017 

and put in place an energy saving plan of 

controlling the switches in a reasonable 

level. During this reporting year the power 

consumption had dropped to RMB2.35 

million, but nevertheless partially due to 

reduction in production. 

production 

departments 

will review the suppliers 

during the 3rd quarter of 

2019 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We will continue to ensure 

energy saving policy is 

consistent. The production 

unit concerned has set to 

reduce the energy saving 

up to 24% in year 2019 by 

implementing &amp; enforcing 

SOPs which were in already 

in place.  

 

Recruitment and  

Upgrading of  

skilled workers 

We are working closely with the local 

technical and vocational schools for fresh 

graduates to join the company to ensure a 

continual supply of younger workers with 

better 

technical 

know-how. 

Better 

incentives are provided for workers who 

are 

willing 

to 

learn 

and 

upgrade 

themselves. Also, by constantly reviewing 

their piece rates vs the complication of the 

work itself to ensure workers’ pay are fair 

and sustainable. 

 

To reduce the attrition 

rates by 5% in the next 

reporting 

year 

through 

revived incentives scheme 

and loyalty bonus. We also 

set targets for every worker 

at all levels to improve 

his/her skill by at least one 

grade 

in 

2019. 

 

Corporate  

Social  

Responsibility (CSR)    

We have plans to promote healthy life style 

among the industrial zone with annual walk 

&amp; jog campaign where charity contribution 

is a built-in element. Also we are proposing 

to set up a Scholarship scheme for both 

our staff children and for some selected 

schools in the long run. 

 

We aim to kick start the 

above plan by second half 

of the year 2019.
