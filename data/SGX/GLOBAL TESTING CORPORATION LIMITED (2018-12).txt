STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND CLIENT SATISFACTION 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT  

Stakeholders are key to fuelling a company’s long term growth. Being a responsible business and 

developing our ESG factors in order to maintain our long term growth and satisfy our diverse range of 

stakeholders is highly important to us.  

It is crucial to identify stakeholders who are both instrumental to the success of the business and 

influential in sustainability performance. These stakeholders form a highly diversified group which 

reflects the breadth of our reach in the market. 

Open and transparent stakeholder engagements are carried out throughout the financial year not only 

allows us to gather and better understand the stakeholder feedback and concerns but also further 

improve ourselves through the sustainability journey. Currently, workshops, surveys and external audits 

are carried out to better assess the daily operations and ensure that it is entirely compliant with the 

rules and regulations in place. We believe that this approach will help us to align our stakeholders 

concerns into operational, reporting objectives and organisation's objectives. 

Based on the stakeholders concerns gathered, Table 1 below shows the list of ESG indicators for GTCL 

that will be highlighted in this report. 

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

Following last year’s inaugural sustainability report, GTCL had conducted its second materiality 

assessment to identify the ESG topics material to the Group and its stakeholders in 2018. Similar to the 

previous year, the materiality assessment was conducted with the help of an external consultant, and 

GTCL will continue to involve them in the coming year.

CLIENT SATISFACTION  

An annual customer satisfaction survey is sent out to our main customer lines which comprise of probing 

and final testing. The annual survey conducted is aligned with the ISO program ISO9001 and IATF16949 

standard of the Customer Satisfaction Survey Handling Procedure.  

In 2018, our clients rated us with our overall rating of “Good” which met with their project outcomes 

and value added to their organisation throughout the reporting year. Thus, we have fulfilled customer 

requirements and provided them with a quality experience. 

In future, GTCL aims on receiving an overall rating of “Excellent” where more enhanced quality is 

delivered which thoroughly satisfies the customers.

WORKPLACE  

OUR APPROACH  

GTCL strongly believes that its employees are its pillars for growth, and its long term success is 

dependent on them. Hence, constant efforts are put in to ensure that GTCL provides a safe working 

environment to enhance staff productivity and morale.  

All new joiners go through a compulsory occupational health and safety (OHS) training program to 

familiarize themselves with the various measures in place. Employees need to go through a set of tests 

to confirm that they have completed the tests. Fire safety programs such as fire evacuation drills and 

response plans are carried out to better familiarize employees with emergency procedures on a regular 

basis. The last session was conducted on 4 December 2018 where attendance was made compulsory 

for all employees.  

To ensure that our OHS policies are implemented efficiently, a Management Safety and Health 

Committee is established. Reviews are conducted on a yearly basis and the policies are constantly 

refreshed with the necessary amendments. Our Audit Safety and Health Committee carries out internal 

audit on a quarterly basis to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and 

governance of OHS processes.  

The effectiveness of our OHS measures is assessed based on the number of warnings and penalties 

issued by the government. Based on our track records in 2018, no warnings and penalties were issued 

thus, we are certain that our OHS standards within the organisation is of excellent standards. 

At GTCL, we have an in-house nurse that serves as a first responder to any medical emergencies. By 

having an in-house nurse, she is able to serve as an emergency medical respondent and liaison with 

clinics and hospitals to coordinate health check-ups and monthly health consultations for our employees. 

The in-house nurse thus ensures that our employees are always fit for duty to carry out their daily 

operations.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

In 2018, there were zero occupational diseases contracted and throughout the year, only 3 work-related 

injuries were reported.   

The overall injury rate is reported to be 607 per 100,000 employees and affected employees have all 

returned to work as per normal after their medical leave. The figures below show the full breakdown of 

GTCL’s occupational health and safety performance statistics for the assessment year.

GTCL strives to continuously monitor and improve the performance and safety standards of the 

workplace environment.

EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT  

OUR APPROACH 

At GTCL, the employees form the foundation of our business and we constantly seek to improve their 

workplace competencies through training and education. Through such training and education, 

employees who are our greatest assets, are able to carry out operations safely and effectively.  

To facilitate proper training for our employees, we adhere to the ISO QP18-01 Employee Training 

Procedure which allows us to develop a comprehensive training framework to accommodate to different 

spectrums of employees.  

Our comprehensive training framework includes internal trainings which are carried out periodically to 

improve the skills of our employees. These trainings are only deemed completed when employees pass 

the necessary tests which are carried out during or after the training session. This is to ensure our 

employees have attained the necessary competencies to carry out their daily operations effectively. An 

extended portion of our training framework includes sending employees to attend technical trainings 

conducted by external professionals. 

These technical trainings are more intensive with regards to content and relate to the areas of 

engineering, tax and management where upon completion of the training, certification is required to 

recognise the employee as competent in their relevant area of expertise.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION  

Improving diversity is of key importance to GTC, and hence a lot of emphasis is placed on ensuring easy 

access to training for all employees irrespective of gender or job profile. In 2018, GTCL maintained a 

balanced profile of employees across both genders where male employees numbered at 249 whilst 

female employees at 245.  

We recognise that our employees contribute largely to the success of the business. As such, we believe 

in developing their performance capabilities. In 2018, all employees attended trainings as part of their 

overall learning and development to improve their performance capabilities. Thus, a total of 23,635 

hours were dedicated to training for all employees. We achieved our target for FY2018 with each 

employee clocking in an average of 47.8 training hours. Furthermore, each of our females clocking in 

an average of 48 hours and males and average of 47.6 hours in FY2018. Moreover, individuals on a 

managerial level clocked in an average of 11.6 hours, executives an average of 19.4 hours and non-

executives an average of 61.4 hours.

We aim to maintain the average training hours in the future so as to continue to work towards equipping 

its employees with the necessary knowledge and skills as well as elevate their competencies 

The management is the key driver who is responsible for overseeing the company, ensuring that the 

company is moving in the right direction and also managing the employees. Hence, it is essential for 

the managers to be updated with the latest developments and also constantly improve their skill sets 

with regular appraisal. In FY2018, the management team comprised of 42 people, out of which 36 were 

males and 6 were females. 100% of the total management received regular performance appraisal which 

further helps the company to achieve their strategic goals and objectives and also gives the entire 

workforce a sense of direction.  

In the following year, GTCL aims to maintain 100% of the management to receive regular performance 

and career development reviews.
