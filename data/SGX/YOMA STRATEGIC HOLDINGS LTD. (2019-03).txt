Prior	to	the	telecom	towers	using	solar	power,	they	were	running	on	diesel	generators.	The	CO2 avoidance	is	calculated	based	on	an	assumption	of	3kW	load	per	

telecom	tower	operating	23	hours	per	day.	1L	of	diesel	is	required	per	3kWh,	therefore	each	telecom	tower	uses	23L	of	diesel	per	day.	In	1	year	(365	days),	each	

telecom	tower	uses	23L	X	365	days	=	8,395L	of	diesel.	Based	on	EF	Diesel	=	267kg	CO2/L, the CO2 emissions	avoided	per	tower	is	8,395L	x	2.67	kg	CO2/L = 22,414 

kg	CO2.	Since	there	are	29	telecom	towers,	the	total	CO2	emissions	avoided	=	22,414	x	29	=	650,	006	kg	CO2	(or	650	tonnes).

Board Statement



The	 Board	 of	 Directors	 (the	 “Board”)	

of	Yoma	Strategic	Holdings	Ltd.	(“Yoma	

Strategic”	

or	

collectively	

with	

its	

subsidiaries, the “Group”) considers 

sustainability	 a	 key	 element	 of	 its	

mission	to	“Build	a	Better	Myanmar	for	

its	 People”.	 The	 Board	 has	 considered	

the material environmental, social and 

governance	(“ESG”)	topics	as	part	of	its	

strategic	formulation	and	determined	the	

material	ESG	factors,	as	well	as	overseen	

the	management	and	monitoring	of	the	

identified	 material	 ESG	 factors.	 This	

report has been reviewed and approved 

by the Board, the Management and the 

Sustainability	Committee.

The Group’s mission and targets are 

closely aligned to its Sustainability 

&amp; 

Responsibility 

(“S&amp;R”) 

strategy, 

enabling us to create greater value 

for	 our	 stakeholders.	 Our	 focus	 on	

the	 highest	 standards	 of	 governance,	

ethics, sustainability and responsibility 

also	reflects	our	commitment	as	one	of	

Myanmar’s	pillars	in	the	industry.

Yoma	 Strategic’s	 sustainability	 efforts	

are structured around the Sustainable 

Development	Goals	(“SDGs”)	of	the	UN	

Global	 Compact	 (“UNGC”)	 framework	

and	 our	 sustainability	 objectives	 are	

organised around People, Planet and 

Profit.	 In	 our	 FY2019	 Sustainability	

Report,	we	have	identified	topics	where	

there	 is	 a	 correlation	 between	 our	

initiatives	and	the	Myanmar	Sustainable	

Development Plan* (“MSDP”), which 

was	released	by	the	Ministry	of	Planning	

and	 Finance	 of	 the	 Government	 of	 the	

Republic	 of	 the	 Union	 of	 Myanmar	

(“Myanmar”)	in	August	2018.	The	MSDP	

is	the	expression	of	Myanmar’s	national	

development vision and provides an 

overall	framework	for	coordination	and	

cooperation	across	all	ministries,	states	

and	 regions,	 with	 the	 aim	 of	 forging	 a	

common	path	towards	the	emergence	of	

a	 prosperous,	 peaceful	 and	 democratic	

Myanmar.

The	Group	is	committed	to:

• being a responsible employer and 

improving	the	living	standards	of	the	

communities	in	which	we	operate;

•	 fostering	 environmental	 stewardship	

in	 the	 communities	 in	 which	 we	

operate;

• building our businesses responsibly 

by	 harnessing	 the	 potential	 of	 a	

Shared Value Approach to generate 

economic	value.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Yoma Strategic is driving a responsible 

growth	

strategy	

of	

its	

four	

core	

businesses,	supporting	the	principles	of	

the UN Global Compact and Sustainable 

Development	

Goals	

of	

the	

2030	

Agenda	 creating	 value	 that	 is	 shared	

with	 all	 stakeholders.	 Embodied	 in	 our	

Investors, Customers, Employees (“ICE”) 

vision,	 we	 are	 creating	 a	 sustainable	

business environment, leading with the 

development	of	our	ESG	best	practices.

Our	core	values	-	Innovation,	Teamwork,	

Integrity	 and	 Respect	 -	 form	 the	

foundation	 of	 our	 culture,	 corporate	

strategy	 and	 sustainability	 strategy.	

These	values	drive	our	relationships	with	

our customers, employees, investors and 

all	other	stakeholders.	Our	sustainability	

priorities	 built	 on	 these	 core	 values	

guide our investment decisions towards 

solutions	 that	 address	 key	 needs	 in	

our	 local	 market	 and	which	 are	 tied	 to	

the	 fast-growing	 Myanmar	 economy.	

This	 would,	 of	 course,	 not	 be	 possible	

without	the	partnership	and	cooperation	

of	local	stakeholders	who	also	share	the	

same	vision	and	mission	as	us	to	–	“Build	

a	Better	Myanmar	for	its	People”.	

In	FY2019,	we	continued	to	build	on	our	

involvement	 in	 some	 of	 the	 important	

areas	 of	 Myanmar’s	 future	 such	 as	

financial	 inclusion,	 providing	 electricity	

to	off-grid	and	rural	communities	using	

solar-based micro power plants and 

mini-grids,	as	well	as	the	mechanisation	

of	farming.

Technological, contractual and social 

innovation	 is	 essential	 to	 meet	 these	

needs.	 The	 digital	 transformation	 of	

Yoma	 Strategic	 is	 accelerating.	 Today,	

Wave Money with more than nine million 

unique	 customers	 facilitates	 secure	

real-time	 transactions	 and	 caters	 to	

Myanmar’s	largely	unbanked	population	

through the 45,000 Wave agents located 

in	 289	 out	 of	 the	 total	 townships	 in	

Myanmar.1 

The	 need	 for	 environmental	 services	

is	 growing	 fast	 in	 the	 context	 of	

macroeconomic,	climatic	and	geopolitical	

uncertainty.	 These	

changes	

require	

businesses	 to	 be	 agile	 and	 responsive.	

Yoma Micro Power constructed 29 

solar micro-power plants sites and 

four	 mini-grids	 in	 Sagaing	 in	 FY2019,	

which supply clean and reliable power 

to	 telecommunications	 customers	 and	

individual customers in the surrounding 

rural	 communities.	 Yoma	 Micro	 Power	

will	continue	to	expand	to	another	250	

micro plants and 25 mini-grids by the 

end	 of	 2019	 and	 plans	 to	 scale	 up	 to	

more than 2,000 micro power plants by 

2023.	

In	 addition,	 Yoma	 Land	 is	 promoting	

home ownership by expanding into the 

mass	 market	 property	 sector	 with	 the	

launch	 of	 City	 Loft,	 a	 new	 division	 of	

modern	 affordable	 housing.	 City	 Loft	

combines	an	affordable	price	point	with	

favourable	 mortgage	 repayment	 terms	

of	up	to	25	years.	We	believe	this	means	

that	 for	 the	 first	 time	 it	 is	 possible	 for	

someone earning less than US$500 per 

month	to	become	a	homeowner.	

In our rapidly changing world where 

finite	natural	resources,	climate	change	

and threats to our ecosystems are 

changing	 business	 expectations,	 our	

stakeholders	expect	businesses	not	only	

to be economically viable, but also to 

be	environmentally	mindful	and	socially	

responsible.	

Yoma	Strategic	makes	a	point	to	consider	

opportunities	 where	 we	 can	 make	 the	

biggest	contribution	towards	sustainable	

business while endeavouring to “Build a 

Better	Myanmar	for	its	People”.

 

In FY2019, we 

continued to build 

on our involvement 

in some of the 

important areas of 

Myanmar’s future 

such as financial 

inclusion, providing 

electricity to  

off-grid and rural 

communities using 

solar-based micro 

power plants 

and mini-grids, 

as well as the 

mechanisation 

of farming.

YOMA STRATEGIC’S CONTRIBUTION

The	Group’s	businesses	provide	a	total	of	approximately	4,000	jobs	to	locals	in	Myanmar.	All	of	its	employees	are	

paid	at	least	the	local	minimum	wage.

Meanwhile,	Wave	Money,	which	is	34%	owned	by	the	Group,	is	a	mobile	based	financial	services	provider	that	

facilitates	secure,	real-time	transactions,	with	the	aim	of	improving	financial	inclusion	in	Myanmar.	Wave	Money	

caters	 to	 Myanmar’s	 migrant	 worker	 population	 who	 have	 migrated	 to	 urban	 centres	 for	 work	 yet	 support	

their	families	in	the	villages	by	sending	part	of	their	wages	home	periodically.	Wave	Money	addresses	financial	

exclusion	and	weak	economic	integration	of	millions	of	Myanmar	citizens	where	traditional	financial	institutions	

are	out	of	reach.

The Group’s Yoma Heavy Equipment business operates 14 branches throughout the country and is supported by 

a	dedicated	maintenance	team.	New	Holland	aims	to	help	farmers	improve	their	farming	efficiency	and	address	

labour	shortages	through	the	use	of	machinery.	Tractors	help	farmers	increase	crop	productivity	by	saving	time	

and	energy,	as	well	as	improving	the	quality	and	quantity	of	their	crops.

Approximately	41%	of	Yoma	Strategic’s	workforce	is	female.	The	Group	also	has	a	14%	female	representation	on	

its	Board	of	Directors.	Females	are	represented	at	the	executive	as	well	as	the	senior	management	levels.

In	FY2019,	more	than	50%	of	managers	have	been	trained	on	the	subject	of	anti-harassment.

Yoma Micro Power constructed 29 solar micro-power plants sites in Sagaing Region during FY2019, supplying 

clean	 and	 reliable	 power	 to	 telecommunications	 towers	 and	 individual	 customers	 in	 the	 surrounding	 rural	

communities.	Yoma	Micro	Power	will	roll	out	another	250	micro	plants	by	end	of	2019	and	has	plans	to	scale	up	

to	more	than	2,000	micro	power	plants	by	2023.	When	completed,	approximately	25	villages	and	up	to	30,000	

people	in	off-grid	areas	will	have	access	to	electricity	in	FY2020.	The	investment	will	create	jobs	and	support	

additional	income	for	these	households.

Yoma	Land	is	developing	City	Loft,	a	new	division	of	affordable	housing	for	the	mass	market	at	StarCity.	The	

residential	development	will	be	built	on	a	0.5	million	square	feet	master-planned	site	with	additional	space	set	

aside	for	commercial,	communal	and	recreational	areas.	This	development	is	designed	to	facilitate	modern	living	

standards	and	allow	an	inclusive	community	to	thrive.	City	Loft	is	aligned	with	Yoma	Land’s	wider	mission	to	Build	

Better	Communities	for	the	Future	of	Myanmar.

The	Group	strongly	opposes	bribery	and	all	other	kinds	of	corruption.	This	extends	to	its	business	dealings	with	

third	party	service	providers	and	vendors.	To	reinforce	the	Code	of	Conduct,	the	Group	conducts	training	for	

new	employees	covering	its	policies	on	Anti-Bribery,	Anti-Corruption,	Code	of	Conduct,	Conflicts	of	Interest	

and	 Whistle	 Blowing.	The	 Group	 prohibits	 any	 form	 of	 discrimination	 including	 any	 distinction,	 exclusion	 or

Yoma	Strategic’s	sustainability	efforts	are	structured	around	the	Sustainable	Development	Goals	(“SDGs”)	of	the	2030	Agenda	for	

Sustainable	Development,	and	the	Ten	Principles	of	the	UN	Global	Compact.	In	FY2018,	Yoma	Strategic	published	its	inaugural	

Sustainability	Report	and	identified	its	nine	key	material	topics	through	an	extensive	shareholder	survey	and	workshop.	In	FY2019,	

we	have	continued	to	engage	our	stakeholders	through	our	respective	business	units,	in	particular,	the	local	communities	where	

they	operate.

Yoma	Strategic	is	committed	to	nurturing	its	employees	and	values	the	partnerships	with	its	customers,	local	communities,	business	

partners,	investors	and	other	stakeholder	groups.	The	Group	has	in	place	various	channels	and	platforms	to	help	it	communicate

Our Approach to Sustainability

MATERIAL TOPICS AND TARGETS 

GRI 102-44

In	2018,	the	Group	conducted	a	materiality	assessment	and	an	extensive	stakeholder	engagement	survey	for	all	key	stakeholders	

to	 gather	 input	 on	 the	 significant	 impact	 of	 its	 business.	 An	 independent	 sustainability	 consultant	 facilitated	 the	 materiality	

assessment	process,	which	was	aligned	with	GRI	Standards	and	AA1000.	The	survey	was	sent	to	more	than	90	internal	and	external	

stakeholders,	including	regulators,	community	leaders,	business	partners,	suppliers,	customers,	employees	and	representatives	

from	Yoma	Strategic’s	Board	of	Directors.	The	stakeholder	response	rate	was	a	strong	56%	and	the	valuable	feedback	from	this	

survey	was	considered	in	the	final	determination	of	the	Group’s	key	material	issues.

The	Group	also	hosted	an	internal	materiality	assessment	workshop	to	agree	the	material	issues	facing	the	Group.	A	wide	range	

of	economic,	environmental,	social	and	governance	topics	were	identified	with	the	support	of	an	independent	consultant	through	

a	gap	analysis,	peer	benchmarking	and	a	review	of	material	topics	from	two	international	frameworks,	the	GRI	Standards	and	

Sustainability	Accounting	Standards	Board	(“SASB”).

In	2019,	we	have	expanded	the	boundary	of	the	Sustainability	Report	and	we	are	continuing	to	enlarge	the	database	with	the	data	

collection	for	the	material	topics	selected	in	2018.	The	Group	continued	to	include	more	of	our	business	entities	that	have	an	

impact	on	our	material	topics.	Through	engagement	with	each	of	the	business	entities	to	define	their	data	collection	methodologies,	

we have reported the environmental data based on each business segment which also provides greater transparency on the year-

to-year	performance.	In	order	to	embody	the	S&amp;R	strategy,	the	Sustainability	Team	has	also	continued	to	raise	awareness	through	

employee	training.

The	material	topics	were	presented	to	the	Board	and	approved	in	December	2018.	An	internal	review	of	our	material	topics	was	

carried	out	in	FY2019	by	the	Sustainability	Committee	to	ensure	that	they	are	still	relevant	to	our	business	and	our	stakeholders.

Our Business Philosophy and Vision

GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The	 Group	 continuously	 advocates	 a	 strong	

corporate governance culture among its employees 

to ensure that they operate in an ethical and 

responsible	manner.	The	Group	is	known	to	be	one	

of	 the	 front-runners	 for	 corporate	 governance	 in	

Myanmar	and	is	the	partner	of	several	multinational	

companies	and	development	banks	including	ADB	

and	IFC.

The	 Group’s	 Enterprise	 Risk	 Management	 (“ERM”)	

system is designed to achieve a prudent and 

reasonable	 balance	 between	 risk	 and	 return,	

while	 providing	 the	 framework	 for	 managing	 risk	

and	 future	 events	 effectively	 to	 both	 protect	 and	

enhance	 the	 business	 in	 meeting	 its	 strategic	

objectives.	It	sets	out	the	governance	structure	for	

the	Group’s	risk	philosophy,	risk	appetite,	tolerance	

levels	and	approach	to	managing	risks.	For	details	on	

the	Group’s	Risk	Management,	please	refer	to	Pages	

58	to	62	in	the	Yoma	Strategic	Annual	Report	2019.

Yoma Strategic has a strong commitment to 

the	 independence	 of	 its	 Board	 of	 Directors	 (the	

“Board”	 or	 “Directors”).	 The	 Board	 also	 provides	

an	 appropriate	 balance	 and	 diversity	 of	 skills,	

experience,	 gender,	 knowledge	 of	 the	 Group’s	

businesses and the necessary core competencies 

to	meet	the	needs	of	Yoma	Strategic	and	to	allow	

for	diverse	and	objective	discussions	on	its	strategic	

direction	and	growth.

YOMA STRATEGIC HOLDINGS LTD.

ETHICAL BUSINESS 

The	Group	is	strongly	opposed	to	bribery	and	all	other	kinds	of	corruption.	This	also	extends	to	its	business	dealings	with	third-party	

service	providers	and	vendors.	Its	steadfast	adherence	to	prudent	business	principles	has	seen	Yoma	Strategic	become	a	trusted	

partner	to	some	of	the	world’s	leading	brands	as	they	look	to	expand	into	Myanmar.	The	Group	also	has	the	continued	active	

support	of	IFC	and	ADB	who	are	working	in	partnership	to	help	the	Group	fulfil	its	Mission	according	to	these	same	principles.



Anti-Corruption, Anti-Bribery &amp; Political Contributions 

GRI 205-2, GRI 415-1

Our Approach

Yoma	 Strategic	 manages	 its	 exposure	 to	 corruption	 risks	 by	

applying and emphasising good corporate governance, business 

ethics	 and	 transparency.	 Its	 reputation	 is	 one	 of	 its	 greatest	

assets.	Corruption	represents	a	risk	to	an	organisation’s	business	

and	 reputation.	 The	 Group	 is	 committed	 to	 a	 high	 standard	

of	 corporate	 governance	 for	 the	 long-term	 sustainability	 of	

the	 Group’s	 business.	 It	 has	 a	 zero-tolerance	 approach	 to	

corruption,	bribery	and	fraud	and	has	developed	a	number	of	

key	policies	and	procedures	such	as	Anti-Bribery	Policy,	Anti-

Corruption	 Procedure,	 Code	 of	 Conduct,	 Conflict	 of	 Interest	

Policy and Whistle Blowing Policy which are disseminated and 

available to all employees, contractors, suppliers and business 

partners and are also publicly available on Yoma Strategic’s 

website	 at	 http://www.yomastrategic.com.	 Direct	 or	 indirect	

contributions	to	political	causes	may	also	represent	a	corruption	

risk	because	they	can	be	used	to	exert	undue	influence	on	the	

political	process.	Yoma	Strategic	is	not	making	–	and	has	never	

made	–	any	financial	or	in-kind	political	contributions,	directly	

or	indirectly.

Our Performance 

Our	 employees	 are	 required	 to	 undergo	 training	 on	 the	 key	

policies	and	procedures.	In	FY2019,	319	(or	approximately	13%)	

of	 the	 new	 employees	 have	 received	 training	 on	 Corporate	

Governance,	Operational	Compliance	and	Code	of	Conduct.

Our Target (FY2020)

20%	of	new	hires	to	be	trained	in	Corporate	Governance	and	

Code	of	Conduct.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

ETHICAL	BUSINESS	(CONTINUED)	

Our Business

Compliance 

GRI 419-1, GRI 307-1

Our Approach

The	 Group	 continuously	 advocates	 a	 strong	 corporate	

governance culture among its employees to ensure that they 

operate	 in	 an	 ethical	 and	 responsible	 manner.	 The	 Group	

strives	to	maintain	full	compliance	with	the	relevant	national	

environmental	policies,	laws	and	regulations	as	well	as	the	IFC’s	

performance	 standards	 and	 the	ADB’s	 Safeguard	 policy,	 and	

the	 Dutch	 Development	 Bank’s	 (“FMO”)	 Sustainability	 Policy	

Framework.	

The	 Group’s	 Enterprise	 Risk	 Management	 (“ERM”)	 system	 is	

designed to achieve a prudent and reasonable balance between 

risk	and	return,	while	providing	the	framework	for	managing	

risk	and	future	events	effectively	to	both	protect	and	enhance	

the	 business	 in	 meeting	 its	 strategic	 objectives.	 It	 sets	 out	

the	governance	structure	for	the	Group’s	risk	philosophy,	risk	

appetite,	tolerance	levels	and	approach	to	managing	risks.	For	

details	on	the	Group’s	Risk	Management,	please	refer	to	pages	

58	to	62	in	the	Yoma	Strategic	FY2019	Annual	Report.

Our Performance 

The	Environmental	Compliance	Certificate	(“ECC”)	was	awarded	

to	the	Yoma	Central	project	in	recognition	that	it	follows	the	

relevant	national	environmental	policies,	laws	and	regulations.	

Yoma	 Central	 is	 considered	 one	 of	 the	 largest	 foreign	 direct	

investments	in	Myanmar’s	real	estate	sector.	The	ECC	was	a	

significant	milestone	as	Yoma	Central	was	the	first	project	in	

Myanmar’s	infrastructure	sector	to	have	its	Environmental	and	

Social Impact Assessment report and ECC approved by the 

Environmental	Conservation	Department	in	May	2019.

In November 2018, FMO closed a US$25 million loan with Yoma 

Strategic	for	the	expansion	of	its	agri-equipment	business	in	

Myanmar (via its subsidiary, Convenience Prosperity Company 

Limited).	 The	 investment	 includes	 an	 US$8	 million	 tranche	

from	the	Infrastructure	Development	Fund	(“IDF”),	which	FMO	

manages	on	behalf	of	the	Dutch	government.	This	funding	will	

help	to	finance	the	import	of	tractors	and	implements	for	the	

expansion	of	Yoma	Strategic’s	agri-equipment	business	under	

the	“Automotive	&amp;	Heavy	Equipment”	business	unit.

In	 FY2019,	 there	 were	 no	 significant	 fines	 or	 non-monetary	

sanctions	 for	 non-compliance	 with	 environmental	 laws	 or

Our Approach

To	raise	awareness	and	highlight	the	importance	of	integrating	

sustainability	into	our	day	to	day	operations,	training	is	provided	

to	all	new	employees	about	our	sustainability	initiatives,	which	

include	topics	such	as:

•		 Ways	 to	 reduce	 electricity	 use	 –	 by	 keeping	 the	 air	

conditioning	set	at	24-25°C	at	all	of	our	offices	

•		 Ways	to	reduce	waste	–	by	offering	a	discount	for	customers	

who	 bring	 their	 own	 cups	 to	 The	 Campus’s	 cafe;	 plastic	

straws have been replaced with paper straws at Pun Hlaing 

Estate’s	F&amp;B	restaurants;	water	is	sold	in	a	glass	jar	from	a	20	

litres	dispenser	to	reduce	single	use	plastic	bottles;	straws	

are only provided at KFC at the customer’s request

•		 Monitoring	the	quality	of	the	outdoor	air	–	there	are	two	air	

monitoring units, one located in Pun Hlaing Dulwich College 

and	another	in	StarCity	Dulwich	College.	Updates	on	the	air	

quality are provided to all residences

•		 No	idling	of	vehicles	in	the	Pun	Hlaing	and	StarCity	Estates

•		 Providing	 sustainable	 transport	 options	 for	 employee	 –	

company	 buses	 are	 provided	 for	 employees	 at	 designated	

pick	up	points	to	encourage	employees	to	take	buses	instead	

of	driving	to	ease	traffic	congestion	in	central	Yangon	and	

also	to	reduce	the	greenhouse	gas	emissions	from	vehicles	

driven by employees

Other	 Initiatives	 that	 the	 Group	 has	 undertaken	 to	 raise	

employee’s awareness on environmental stewardship include 

World	Clean	Up	Day,	Earth	Hour	and	Earth	Day	activities.

•		 World	 Clean	 Up	 Day:	 250	 staff	volunteered	 in	 picking	 up	

rubbish in downtown Yangon, helping to create public 

awareness	on	the	importance	of	proper	waste	management	

which will also help achieve a cleaner Yangon

•		 Earth	Hour:	The	Campus,	Pun	Hlaing	Estate,	StarCity,	Yoma	

F&amp;B,	Yoma	 Heavy	 Equipment,	Volkswagen	 and	 Mitsubishi	

switched	off	the	lights	in	the	offices	for	one	hour,	initiated	a	

tree	planting	program	in	Hlaing	Thar	Yar	Township,	Yangon,	

and a clean up program in Hlaing Thar Yar Township, Yangon 

and	Mandalay	where	rubbish	was	collected	to	be	disposed	of	

by	the	municipality.	Educational	talks	on	causes	and	effects	

of	air	pollution	were	also	held	at	The	Campus	and	StarCity	

for	employees	and	the	general	public

The	 management	 of	 climate-related	 risks	 and	 opportunities	

is	 an	 integral	 part	 of	Yoma	 Strategic.	The	 Group	 has	 started	

collecting	 data	 across	 its	 subsidiaries	 to	 account	 for	 their	

emissions.	A	set	of	performance	targets	will	help	to	reduce	the	

Group’s	carbon	emissions,	energy	and	water	consumption	and	

waste.	Data	collected	during	FY2018,	FY2019	and	FY2020	will	

be	used	as	a	baseline	to	set	performance	targets.	The	Group	

aims	to	set	quantitative	targets	in	FY2021.	Meanwhile,	it	also	

aims	 to	 reduce	 single-use	 plastic	 and	 minimise	 harm	 to	 the	

environment.

Our Performance

In	FY2019,	the	Group	consumed	a	total	of	361,662,416	MJ	of	

energy	across	our	various	businesses.	The	pick	up	in	building	

activity	at	Yoma	Central	and	StarCity’s	Zone	C	resulted	in	an	

increase	in	fuel	and	electricity	consumption.	

During	FY2019,	there	was	also	an	increase	in	the	number	of	

Yoma	F&amp;B	outlets,	with	KFC’s	store	count	increasing	from	22	to	

33	by	the	end	of	March	2019.	This	contributed	to	an	increase	in	

fuel	and	electricity	consumption.

The	Group	has	included	in	its	calculations	fuel	and	electricity	

data	for	both	buildings	and	non-buildings	which	are	owned	and	

operated	by	Yoma	Strategic	and	reported	our	energy	intensities	

based	on	the	most	relevant	metrics	for	the	business	segment,	

as	shown	in	the	tables	below.	We	will	continue	to	monitor	and	

evaluate	 the	 relevance	 of	 the	 metrics	 used	 as	 our	 business	

continues	to	evolve.	

A	 total	 of	 1,022,481	 MJ	 of	 renewable	 solar	 energy	 was	

generated	from	Yoma	Land	and	Yoma	Micro	Power.	

The renewable energy generated by Yoma Land has allowed us 

to	avoid	approximately	48	tonnes	of	CO2.

Yoma	Micro	Power	generated	633,197	MJ	of	solar	power	which	

was	sold	to	telecom	towers	and	communities	in	FY2019.	This	is	

equivalent	to	approximately	78	tonnes	of	CO2 that was avoided 

through	the	use	of	renewable	energy.

We	 recognise	 that	 we	 still	 have	 certain	 challenges	 relating	

to	the	reporting	of	our	climate	impact.	We	are	working	with	

dedicated	 sustainability	 staff	 from	 each	 business	 unit	 to	

improve	the	collection	of	the	information	and	to	define	new	

methods,	process	and	records	for	identifying	the	accurate	data.	

We	 have	 now	 obtained	 partial	 data	 across	 the	 Group	 since	

the	 process	 of	 data	 collection	 started	 in	 2018.	 The	 process	

has	been	improving	gradually	while	the	Committee	has	been	

delivering	training	to	staff	from	each	Business	Unit.

We	 acknowledge	 our	 responsibility	 to	 preserve	 the	 quality	

of	 our	 land,	 water	 and	 air	 and	 actively	 work	 to	 protect	 and	

conserve	the	land	we	own	and	operate	on.	Most	of	the	Group’s

segments	use	groundwater.	The	water	data	includes	14	Yoma	

Heavy	Equipment	branches,	Ducati,	Volkswagen	and	Mitsubishi	

showrooms, Pun Hlaing Estate’s buildings, The Campus, 

StarCity’s buildings, KFC restaurants, Pun Hlaing Estate and 

StarCity	 golf	 courses	 and	 the	 coffee	 plantation.	 Some	 of	

the	 Group’s	 companies	 are	 in	 the	 process	 of	 improving	 the	

methodologies	for	collection	of	data	relating	to	water	usage.	As	

Myanmar’s	infrastructure	improves,	the	Group	will	be	including

A	total	of	2,216,354m³	was	used	in	FY2019.	This	decline	was	

due	 to	 Real	 Estate	 projects	 being	 at	 a	 stage	 of	 construction	

which	 was	 less	 water	 intensive	 compare	 to	 FY2018.	 The	

reduction	was	partially	offset	by	an	increase	in	the	number	of	

F&amp;B	 outlets	 and	 motor	 showrooms.	 Similarly,	 the	 volume	 of	

water used at Yoma Motors also increased due to an increase 

in	 the	 number	 of	 showrooms	 being	 opened	 in	 FY2019.	 As	

we	continue	to	implement	water	saving	measures	across	our	

various	 business	 sectors,	 we	 will	 also	 continue	 to	 monitor

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Waste &amp; Effluent

GRI 306-2

Our Approach

Yoma	Strategic	is	raising	awareness	on	reducing	use	of	single	

use	plastics	and	the	importance	of	recycling	to	reduce	items	

being	 sent	 to	 landfill.	 The	 Group	 is	 part	 of	 the	 “Refill	 Not	

Landfill”	 campaign.	 This	 initiative	 aims	 to	 cut	 down	 on	 the	

millions	of	plastic	water	bottles	discarded	each	year	by	offering	

an	alternative:	reusable	aluminium	bottles.	These	bottles	can	be	

refilled	free	of	charge	at	various		venues,	including	The	Campus,	

Yoma	Heavy	Equipment	branches,	Yoma	Bank	branches,	Pun	

Hlaing	 Estate	 and	 StarCity	 Country	 Clubs	 and	 Golf	 Courses,	

shops,	hotels	and	restaurants.

Our Performance

Yoma	Strategic	is	implementing	guidelines	in	its	procurement	

practices	to	substantially	reduce	waste	generation	through	pre-

vention,	reduction,	recycling	and	reuse.	Instead	of	using	plastic	

bottles	at	its	head	office,	Yoma	Strategic	uses	glass	jars	to	refill	

from	20	litres	water	dispensers.	This	has	reduced	the	number	

of	 plastic	 bottles	 ending	 up	 in	 landfills	 by	 more	 than	 13,200	

bottles	per	year.	Through	the	Refill	Not	Landfill	campaign,	the	

Group had distributed approximately 9,954 reusable aluminium 

bottles	in	its	operations	since	the	launch	of	the	program	in	May	

2018.

Yoma	 Central	 reused	 319,946	 tonnes	 of	 waste	 and	 recycled	

776	tonnes	of	waste	resulting	in	a	reduction	to	694	tonnes	of	

waste	being	sent	of	landfill	in	FY2019.	These	methods	show	

the	high	performance	and	caring	for	reducing	the	pollution	and	

climate	change	of	the	city	during	the	construction	phase	of	the	

biggest	real	estate	development.

To	help	reduce	the	amount	of	waste	going	to	landfill,	Pun	Hlaing	

Estate has also started to compost organic waste which is later 

used	for	landscaping	and	residential	projects.	In	FY2019,	a	total	

of	468.1	tonnes	of	waste	was	composted.

the	best	international	business	has	to	offer.	We	invest	in	our	people	to	build	careers	around	a	shared	culture	

of	fairness,	diversity,	empowerment	and	recognition.

Workforce Movement

GRI 401-1

Our Approach

The Group invests in its people to build careers around a shared 

culture	 of	 fairness,	 diversity,	 empowerment	 and	 recognition.	

Successful	employee	engagement	is	a	necessary	requirement	

for	the	Group’s	ambitious	growth	plans	and	progress	towards	

achieving	 its	 Mission.	 Yoma	 Strategic’s	 Human	 Resources	

department	has	a	firm	focus	on	local	communities.	Wherever	

possible,	Yoma	Strategic	hires	locally.

Our Performance 

As	 of	 31	 March	 2019,	 Yoma	 Strategic	 employed	 a	 total	 of	

4,026	employees.	With	the	exception	of	one	female	part-time	

employee,	the	rest	of	the	employees	in	the	Group	are	full-time	

employees.	The	Group	is	made	up	of	36	corporate	entities,	the	

vast	majority	of	which	are	based	in	Myanmar.

The	 Group	 has	 been	 building	 up	 its	 Automotive	 &amp;	 Heavy	

Equipment	and	F&amp;B	businesses.	The	61%	hiring	rate	was	mainly	

driven by Yoma Motors and Yoma F&amp;B, which included the 

opening	of	Volkswagen	showrooms	in	Yangon	and	Mandalay,	

the	increase	in	the	number	of	KFC	stores	and	the	opening	of	

Little	 Sheep	 and	 Auntie	 Anne’sTM	 stores.	 The	 58%	 employee	

turnover rate in FY2019 was mainly driven by Yoma Land as 

it	 streamlined	 some	 of	 its	 operations	 and	 Yoma	 F&amp;B	 where	

the	sector	generally	sees	a	higher	turnover	rate.	For	example,	

globally,	 Quick	 Service	 Restaurants	 can	 see	 turnover	 of	 up	

to	 300%	 per	 year,	 however	 KFC	 Myanmar	 has	 only	 a	 60%	

turnover1.

Training &amp; Development, Talent Retention

GRI 401-1

Our Approach

The Group invests in its people to build careers around a shared 

culture	of	fairness,	diversity,	empowerment	and	recognition.	As	

such,	the	training,	development	and	retention	of	talent	in	the	

organisation	is	very	important	to	the	Group.

Developing	the	Group	workforce	means	providing	continuous	

learning	opportunities	for	employees.	Training	and	development	

programs	cover	a	wide	variety	of	topics	to	equip	its	employees	

with	the	relevant	knowledge	and	skill	sets	to	achieve	goals	such	

as	higher	productivity,	efficiency,	and	workplace	harmony	and	

also	health	and	safety,	human	rights	and	sustainability-related	

topics.

Succession Planning

Senior	 management	 currently	 comprises	 a	 large	 number	 of	

expatriates	 who	 provides	 skills	 and	 expertise	 that	 would	

otherwise	not	be	readily	available	in	Myanmar.	A	key	KPI	of	these	

managers	 is	 to	 appoint	 a	 local	 replacement	 to	 their	 position	

within	five	years.	Meeting	this	KPI	involves	the	planned	and	

coordinated	transfer	of	knowledge	to	local	staff,	which	provides	

unique	opportunities	to	the	Group’s	local	employees	based	on	

their	individual	performance,	and	regardless	of	gender,	religion,	

or	cultural	identity.	To	support	these	activities,	the	Group	has	

also	established	partnerships	with	private	institutions	such	as	

the	Global	Institute	For	Tomorrow	(“GIFT”)	and	the	Singapore	

Institute	of	Management	(“SIM”)	to	develop	high	impact	training	

courses	for	the	development	of	its	future	leaders.

Our Performance 

In	FY2019,	a	total	of	16,000	training	hours	had	been	achieved	

by	 the	 Group’s	 employees,	 which	 is	 on	 track	 to	 reach	 the	

Group’s	FY2020	target	of	40,650	hours.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Diversity &amp; Equal Opportunity

GRI 405-1, GRI 406-1

Our Approach

The	Group	recognises	that	employees	are	the	foundation	of	its	

businesses	and	believes	that	a	strong	workforce	will	provide	a	

better	foundation	to	capitalise	on	the	emerging	opportunities	

in	Myanmar.	By	nurturing	their	individual	talents	and	providing	

them	 with	 opportunities	 for	 personal	 growth	 and	 career	

development, Yoma Strategic is helping its employees realise 

their	full	potential.	As	an	organisation,	the	Group	sees	itself	as	a	

catalyst	to	empowering	its	people	to	perform	at	their	best.	Yoma	

Strategic	is	committed	to	a	working	environment	that	is	free	

of	discrimination	of	any	kind.	As	a	committed	nation-builder,	

the Group believes that it has to lead by example and ensure 

that	 internationally	 recognised	 best	 practices	 are	 established	

early	in	Myanmar’s	rapid	development	process.	The	Group	is	a	

founding	member	of	the	Business	Coalition	for	Gender	Equality	

(“BCGE”) and strives to be a role model to other companies in 

this	regard.

Board	Diversity	Pledge

The	 Board	 welcomes	 the	 push	 for	 greater	 diversity	 in	 the	

boardroom which can provide a more diverse approach to 

business	decision	making.	The	Company	had,	on	28	August	2015,	

supported	 the	 Board	 Diversity	 Pledge	 initiated	 by	 Singapore	

Institute	of	Directors	and	SGX-ST	where	the	Company	pledged	

its	commitment	to	promoting	diversity	as	a	key	attribute	of	a	

well-functioning	and	effective	Board	and	believes	that	a	diverse	

Board	will	enhance	decision	making	by	harnessing	the	variety	of	

skills,	industry	and	business	experiences,	gender,	age,	ethnicity	

and	culture,	geographical	background	and	nationalities,	tenure	

of	service,	and	other	distinguishing	qualities	of	the	members	of	

the	Board.

Merit-Based	Employment

Merit-based employment means that all Group employees are 

given	 the	 same	 level	 of	 opportunities	 to	 succeed,	 regardless	

of	 their	 background.	The	 Group	 understands	 the	 importance	

of	 giving	 its	 people	 autonomy	 and	 room	 to	 grow,	 both	 as	

individuals	and	as	valued	employees.	As	such,	fulfilling	careers	

are	 planned	 for	 and	 built	 upon	 the	 numerous	 opportunities	

constantly	being	generated	within	the	Group.

Our Performance 

Currently,	 Yoma	 Strategic’s	 workforce	 consists	 of	 more	 than	

33	 nationalities	 as	 well	 as	 a	 large	 and	 growing	 number	 of	

returnees.	Our	female	and	male	representation	in	the	Group	is	

approximately	49%	and	51%,	respectively.	We	have	achieved	

our	FY2019	target	for	50%	of	the	managers	in	the	Group	to	be	

trained	on	anti-harassment.	The	larger	Yoma	Group*	through	

First Myanmar Investment Public Company Limited (“FMI”) 

was	awarded	with	an	Economic	Dividends	for	Gender	Equality	

EDGE	Certification**	in	May	2019.	

No	 incidents	 of	 discrimination	 were	 recorded	 during	 the	

reporting	period.

The Yoma Group’s 10-member Group Diversity and Inclusion 

Council,	 which	 is	 chaired	 by	 the	 Head	 of	 Human	 Resources	

and	 includes	 nine	 members	 of	 the	 Yoma	 Group	 Executive	

Committee,	focuses	on	four	initiatives:

• Building Leaders - The Leading the Yoma Way Programme was 

developed	in	order	to	build	future	leadership	capability.	20	

women	were	nominated	for	and	completed	the	programme	

out	of	29	delegates.		The	programme	will	continue	with	the	

next	tranche	in	September	2019.

• Unconscious Bias Training - The Exco underwent Unconscious 

Bias	 training	 in	 September	 2018.	 It	 is	 also	 included	 as	 a	

module	on	the	Leading	the	Yoma	Way	programme.

•	 Policies	 -	 The	 Group	 used	 the	 Economic	 Dividend	 for	

Gender	Equality	(“EDGE”)	certification	to	assess	the	Support	

Services	 Group	 and	 PHSH	 Gender	 policies	 and	 practices.	

Both	Groups	have	passed	the	certification	and	have	action	

plans	in	place	to	further	address	gaps	identified.

•	 Training	&amp;	Awareness	-	The	Respectful	Workplace	e-training	

was	 developed	 and	 the	 target	 set	 that	 50%	 of	 managers	

complete	 the	 training.	 This	 milestone	 was	 reached	 on	 31	

March	 2019.	 We	 continue	 to	 monitor	 completion	 of	 this	

training.	 The	 training	 covered:	 	 Respectful	 Behavior	 and	

the	Yoma	Group’s	Approach	to	Discrimination,	Harassment,	

Bullying	and	Victimization.

Our Target (FY2020)

80%

OF MANAGERS TO COMPLETE RESPECTFUL 

WORKPLACE TRAINING

Human Rights &amp; Labour Management

GRI 407-1, GRI 408-1

Our Approach

Labour	 management	 includes	 basic	 labour	 practices	 such	 as	

those	 described	 by	 the	 International	 Labour	 Organisation	

(“ILO”)	 that	 includes	 not	 hiring	 child	 labour	 or	 forced	 labour.	

This	material	issue	also	covers	collective	bargaining,	freedom	

of	association,	and	sub-issues	as	a	minimum	number	of	weeks’	

notice	provided	to	employees	prior	to	significant	operational	

changes.

The	Group	cares	for	its	people	and	their	welfare.	As	people	will	

always	be	a	vital	resource	in	the	organisation,	employees	are	

treated	fairly	and	with	respect.	The	Group	believes	in	supporting	

the	development	of	an	organisational	structure	and	culture	that	

promotes	motivation,	performance,	mutual	respect,	trust	and	

transparency.	This	organisational	structure	is	at	the	forefront	of	

ethical	behaviour	in	Myanmar.

Yoma	 Strategic	 is	 aware	 of	 the	 human	 rights	 risks	 in	 its	

operations	and	supply	chain,	including	risks	of	child	or	forced	

labour,	 and	 operations	 and	 suppliers	 in	 which	 the	 right	 to	

freedom	 of	 association	 and	 collective	 bargaining	 may	 be	 at	

risk.	It	has	rolled	out	training	programs	on	human	rights	for	its	

employees, and new employees receive training in HR policies 

and	procedures	during	their	first	month	of	employment.	Yoma	

Strategic	also	intends	to	conduct	training	on	human	rights	for	

new	employees	and	is	looking	to	introduce	additional	training	

on	human	rights	for	its	existing	employees	in	the	next	reporting	

period.

Trade Unions were legalised in Myanmar in 2012 and in 2015 

the	 Confederation	 of	 Trade	 Unions	 of	 Myanmar	 (“CTUM”)	

was	officially	recognised.	It	is	an	Umbrella	body	with	various	

federations.

Our Performance

Currently,	 none	 of	 the	Yoma	 Group	 businesses	 have	 unions.	

As signatories to the UN Global Compact, Yoma Strategic 

recognises employees’ right to belong to unions, and it also 

follows	Myanmar	labour	law	in	this	regard.	Yoma	Strategic	does	

not	ask	or	require	employees	to	disclose	if	they	are	members	of	

CTUM	or	any	other	Union.	

Yoma Strategic’s Human Rights Policy sets out the Group’s 

clear	stance	on	Human	Rights.	This	policy	is	publicly	available	

on	Yoma	Strategic’s	website	at	http://www.yomastrategic.com.

No	 cases	 of	 human	 rights	 breaches,	violations	 or	 complaints	

were	identified	nor	reported	during	this	reporting	period.

Health &amp; Safety

GRI 403-2

Our Approach

Providing	a	healthy	and	safe	work	environment	for	employees,	

customers,	 business	 partners	 and	 visitors	 is	 one	 of	 Yoma	

Strategic’s	 top	 priorities.	 Every	 employee	 has	 a	 personal	

responsibility	 to	 support	 this	 commitment.	 Employees	 are	

obliged	to	carry	out	their	work	in	a	safe	manner,	without	causing	

harm	 to	 themselves	 or	 others	 and	 to	 report	 any	 potentially	

unsafe	or	unhealthy	situations	immediately.	They	must	observe	

and	follow	all	safety	and	environmental	regulations	laid	down	in	

the	operations	instructions,	including	putting	on	the	necessary	

safety	equipment,	where	applicable.

Our Performance

We	have	achieved	a	total	of	27,162	hours	of	health	and	safety	

training	in	FY2019	across	the	business	segments	of	Yoma	Land,	

Yoma Motors# and Investments, which is almost twice as many 

training	hours	as	in	FY2018.	Despite	our	efforts	to	ensure	a	

safe	working	environment	for	our	employees,	our	injury	rate	for	

these	business	segments	is	an	average	of	1.263^,	while	our	lost	

day	rate	is	8.28@	for	FY2019.

Our Target (FY2020)

OUR COMMUNITY

Yoma	Strategic	gives	back	to	the	community	through	its	financial	

contributions	and	voluntary	work.	In	FY2019,	Group	employees	

collectively	 achieved	 more	 than	 15,000	 hours	 of	 volunteer	

work.	 Yoma	 Strategic	 contributed	 approximately	 US$79,000	

for	social	causes	such	as	provision	and	maintenance	of	a	refuse	

facility	 for	 a	 local	 community	 in	Yangon,	 thus	 improving	 the	

hygiene	 and	 living	 conditions	 for	 local	 residents.	 Numerous	

corporate	social	responsibility	initiatives	were	also	undertaken	

by	 our	 various	 subsidiaries	 in	 FY2019.	 Some	 examples	 are	

highlighted	below.

The	Fight	Against	Malaria

Various subsidiaries under Yoma Strategic have partnered 

with	 M2030	 to	 raise	 awareness	 and	 funds	 for	 the	 fight	

against	 malaria.	Yoma	 Strategic	 is	 M2030’s	 founding	 partner	

in	 Myanmar.	 All	 funds	 raised	 through	 this	 M2030	 campaign	

support	 malaria	 elimination	 programs	 are	 implemented	 by	

Population	Services	International	Myanmar,	one	of	the	leading	

non-profit	organisations	fighting	malaria	in	the	country.

Fund	Raising	from	the	annual	Yoma	Yangon	International	Marathon

The	 annual	 Yoma	 Yangon	 International	 Marathon	 (“YYIM”),	

which is co-organised by Yoma Strategic, FMI and the Yangon 

City	Development	Committee,	saw	more	than	8,000	local	and	

international	runners	taking	part	in	its	7th	edition	in	January	

2019.	 The	 funds	 raised	 from	 this	 marathon	 contributed	 to	

five	key	projects	to	improve	the	welfare	and	education	of	the	

children	in	Myanmar.

The	 five	 projects	 are	 (i)	 YCDC	 Non-Profit	 Child	 Day	 Care	

Center	for	Low	Income	Citizens,	(ii)	Zeyar	Shwe	Taung	Youth	

Development Center (Hlegu, Yangon Division), (iii) Myanmar 

Red Cross Society, (iv) Su Htoo Pan Youth Development Center 

(Than Lyin, Yangon Division), and (v) Happy Haven Humanitarian 

Project	(Tapin	Shwe	Htee	Road,	East	Dagon,	Ward	11).

Step-In Step-Up program

The	 Group	 funded	 two	 programs	 run	 by	 Step-In	 Step-Up,	

a	 charitable	 organisation	 which	 runs	 programs	 to	 empower	

&amp;	 educate	 underprivileged	 young	 adults.	 The	 two	 programs	

funded	 are	 the	 Vocational	 Training	 Academy	 and	 GAP	 Kids.	

Over	 100	 participants	 have	 attended	 the	Vocational	Training	

Academy	 since	 the	 program	 started	 in	 June	 2018.	 The	 GAP	

Kids	program	caters	to	children	of	ages	12	to	18	and	is	held	in	

collaboration	with	Dulwich	College	Yangon	to	create	a	social,	

learning	 and	 entertaining	 environment	 for	 37	 children	 every	

Saturday	 for	 a	 full	 term	 either	 from	 September	 –	 December	

or	from	January	–	June.	The	program	has	seen	two	cohorts	of	

children	since	it	started	its	first	intake	in	September	2018.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019



About This Report

Yoma Strategic is pleased to present its second Sustainability 

Report,	which	covers	the	reporting	period	1	April	2018	to	31	

March	2019.	Yoma	Strategic	publishes	a	Sustainability	Report	

on	an	annual	basis.	This	report	has	been	prepared	in	accordance	

with	 the	 Global	 Reporting	 Initiative	 (“GRI”)	 Standards:	 Core	

option.	 The	 report	 is	 aligned	 with	 the	 Singapore	 Exchange	

(“SGX-ST”)	Sustainability	Reporting	Guidelines	(set	out	in	listing	

rules	711A	and	711B).

The	 scope	 of	 this	 report	 covers	 approximately	 80%	 of	 the	

Group’s	 revenues	 and	 more	 than	 80%	 of	 the	 Group’s	 total	

assets	in	Singapore	and	Myanmar.	Operations	in	China	as	well	

as companies and joint ventures where Yoma Strategic holds 

a	share	of	less	than	50%	are	excluded	from	the	scope	of	this	

report	with	the	exception	of	Yoma	Central	(48%),	Yoma	Micro	

Power	 (35%)	 and	 Wave	 Money	 (34%).	 A	 complete	 overview	

of	the	Group’s	entities	can	be	found	on	pages	30	-	50	of	its	

FY2019 Annual Report on Yoma Strategic’s website at http://

www.yomastrategic.com.	This	report	has	not	been	assured	by	a	

third	party,	but	the	Group	is	planning	to	seek	external	assurance	

for	 future	 reports,	 once	 Yoma	 Strategic	 has	 completed	 the	

intended	deep	integration	of	sustainability	into	its	operations	

and	verified	that	all	management	systems	are	reliably	producing	

the	required	metrics.

This	report	demonstrates	our	commitment	to	keep	stakeholders	

abreast	 of	 our	 sustainability	 performance.	 We	 welcome	 all	

feedback.
