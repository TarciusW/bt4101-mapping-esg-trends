SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

This is the third sustainability report 

(“Report”) for GKE Corporation 

Limited (“GKE” or “Company” 

and together with its subsidiaries, 

“Group”) and relevant topics 

covered in this Report for the 

financial year ended 31 May 2020 

(“FY2020”) are based on the 

results of the FY2020’s materiality 

process. Taking into account 

business developments as well 

as our stakeholders’ interests, we 

have continued to report on similar 

subjects in this year’s report. The 

Board of Directors of the Company 

(“Board”) believes this report is a 

reasonable and clear presentation 

of the Company’s plans and of 

its environmental, social and 

governance performance. The Board 

has emphasised that management 

will continue to be evaluated 

by its success in executing the 

Company’s strategic plan to meet 

its stakeholders’ and the Board’s 

expectations, 

including 

being 

agile in responding to changing 

circumstances while respecting the 

commitments in this Report. 

OUR STRATEGY

In times of climate change, growing 

competitive pressure in a globalised 

society, 

and 

competition 

to 

attract the best and most capable 

talents, sustainability has a special 

significance. At GKE, sustainability 

is 

approached 

holistically 

to 

create and continuously improve a 

sustainable company delivering long 

term value for all our stakeholders: 

customers, employees, suppliers, 

investors and the communities in 

which we operate. We believe that 

sustainability is everyone’s job and 

that a sound corporate sustainability 

governance framework promotes 

strong leadership by all our 

management.

Maintaining cost competitiveness, 

productivity, service excellence and 

quality are some of the challenges 

that we face in our industry. Hence, 

we are constantly exploring new 

opportunities to grow our business 

and enter new markets. To maintain 

our strong and consistent focus, 

we are building on our existing 

framework and using new insights to 

deepen our approach. We also need 

to deliver our products and services 

in an innovative and sustainable 

way, which means listening to and 

collaborating with our stakeholders, 

and becoming more agile in 

innovating new solutions.

GKE CORPORATION LIMITED

GKE’S SUSTAINABILITY

APPROACH

The sustainability focus for GKE is delivering long-term 

value for all our stakeholders: customers, employees, 

investors and the communities in which we operate. 

Within this sustainability approach, we take the 

broader economic, governance and social aspects, 

such as labour practices, human rights, and societal 

responsibilities into account. This approach guarantees 

that our services and solutions are provided to our 

customers in a manner that is respectful to people and 

the environment and is economically smart.

Our services are often a critical part of the supply 

chains of other businesses. We help people receive 

the materials they need to create products and then 

help deliver those products to their customers. When 

we operate more efficiently, we in turn help reduce the 

emissions intensity of supply chains worldwide.

This commitment to sustainability involves ensuring that 

strong ESG criteria are integrated in our Company’s 

strategy and business model and in its internal policies 

and processes. We are committed to deliver effective 

solutions and services to our customers and create 

greater value for our shareholders through our core 

values.

In structure and topic range, our Report for FY2020 takes reference from the previous financial year’s Report. A 

thorough analysis conducted in FY2018 identified what topics and areas of activity we consider relevant for GKE’s 

Report. We identified not only GRI topics, but also key areas of GKE sustainability management as important potential 

reporting content. Through ongoing consultation with related departments, the most recent one conducted in January 

2020 with key representatives from the various business units, we have reviewed our material topics internally and 

taken into account new businesses and the relevance of our material topics. There have been no changes to our 

material topics for FY2020.

GKE CORPORATION LIMITED

ECONOMIC ENHANCEMENT &amp; 

COMPLIANCE



In FY2020, GKE had distributed 

around 36.2% of our revenues 

to key stakeholders – 29.6% to 

employees, 3.4% to government in 

countries where we operate, namely 

Singapore and China, and 3.2% 

to capital providers. Compared to 

FY2019, GKE has improved on our 

economic value retained this FY2020 

with an overall value of $S4.8 million. 

The increase was mainly attributed 

to higher revenue contribution from 

higher utilisation of warehouse space, 

increase in trucking volume, and 

higher revenue from our ready-mix 

concrete plant. More details of our 

economic performance can be found 

in our Annual Report for FY2020.

SOCIOECONOMIC COMPLIANCE

(GRI 419-1)

Regulatory compliance is critically 

important to GKE, serving to protect 

our integrity and reputation and 

foster trust among stakeholders. 

Observance 

of 

all 

regulatory 

requirements forms the basis of 

good corporate governance within 

the Group. We also ensure our 

compliance to all relevant local and 

international laws and regulations, 

including the principles and guidelines 

set out in the Singapore Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018. More 

details can be found in our Annual 

Report for FY2020.

In FY2020, GKE had one case of 

socioeconomic 

non-compliance. 

GKE Express Logistics Pte. Ltd. 

was fined S$5,000 by Ministry of 

Manpower (MOM) for failing to ensure 

adequate safety measures were 

implemented resulting in an injury 

of an employee during unloading of 

goods from the shipping container. 

We recognise the safety and well-

being of our employees is of utmost 

priority to us and are committed to 

ensure adequate safety practices 

continue to be strictly monitored and 

enforced. We strive to have zero non-

compliance cases in the financial year 

ending 31 May 2021.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

ECONOMIC ENHANCEMENT &amp; 

COMPLIANCE

OUR RESPONSE TO COVID-19

Business continuity

Before the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker 

(“CB”) was implemented in Singapore 

in March 2020, GKE already had 

in place a Business Continuity Plan 

(“BCP”) for recovery from a disaster. 

However, due to the unpredictable 

nature 

of 

COVID-19, 

our 

management appointed a Business 

Continuity Manager to form a BCP 

committee to provide guidance and 

lead the employees in dealing with 

a pandemic after the first imported 

case of COVID-19 was declared 

in Singapore. This allowed us to 

continue our business with minimal 

disruptions during the CB period. 

Respective department representatives 

were tasked to establish procedures 

to ensure social distancing of at 

least 1 metre between persons at all 

times. Safe Management Measures 

were integrated into our BCP and 

various types of work arrangement 

including work from home, split team, 

team rotation, staggered working 

hours and breaks etc. Since the CB, 

employees have been encouraged 

to conduct online meetings so as 

to reduce physical contact and to 

minimise physical visits from external 

parties. 

Our customers and vendors

For our customers, in addition to 

passing on rebates from the property 

tax relief, GKE has worked together 

with 

our 

customers 

in 

various 

cost saving exercises, while still 

delivering our services with quality 

and satisfactory standards, meeting 

customers’ 

expectations 

without 

compromise. 

For 

our 

vendors, 

as far as possible, we have been 

using contactless payments and 

postponing non-essential on site job 

to avoid commingling of personnel.

Our employees

For our employees, in particular the 

Malaysians, who were affected by the 

Movement Control Order (“MCO”) 

and the CB, GKE has assisted 

them by helping to subsidise their 

accommodation in Singapore so 

that they are able to work and live in 

Singapore with minimum disruption.

At the same time, GKE has taken 

the necessary procedures in line with 

the local government policies and 

procedures to enable employees to 

work from home. All office-based 

staff are required to work from home 

by default unless they needed access 

to specialised systems / equipment 

at company premises which could 

not be accessed from home, or 

they had to be present in office 

to fulfil certain legal requirements. 

For job roles or functions where 

employees were unable to work from 

home, staggered working times and 

break times were imposed so as to 

reduce congregation of employees 

at common spaces, and also to 

avoid commingling of staff working in 

different teams.

In addition to ensuring an adequate 

supply 

of 

appropriate 

Personal 

Protection 

Equipment 

(“PPE”), 

surgical masks and hand sanitisers 

in our offices, all our employees have 

also been trained and briefed on the 

correct use of the PPE.  

During the COVID-19 circuit breaker 

period in Singapore, the Company 

encouraged staff to attend online 

courses which were relevant to 

their work. The objective was to 

equip employees at all levels with 

the knowledge, skills, attitudes and 

safety related information related to 

their operations, work processes 

and maintenance of facilities and 

equipment to enable them to carry 

their jobs safely and efficiently. For 

example, trailer truck drivers working 

inside the port were required to 

take the “Perform Safe Prime Mover 

Driving and Haulage Operation in the 

Port Course” before starting work in 

the port. 

With the Singapore Government’s 

implementation 

of 

SafeEntry 

in 

April 2020, GKE has put in place 

SafeEntry QR code at the entry 

of our guardhouse. The security 

guards ensure that all visitors and 

contractors have a SafeEntry Pass 

prior to entering and performing work 

at our premises. Contractors are 

also required to declare their health 

history by filling up our in-house 

Health Screening Form. Twice daily 

temperature checks are imposed 

on all contractors and those with 

unacceptable temperature ranges 

would not be allowed to work at our 

premises. We have also appointed 

a Safe Management Officer to 

conduct Safe Management Measures 

inspection and checks to ensure 

compliance at all times.

GKE CORPORATION LIMITED

ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITY

We are sensitive to the environmental 

impact 

across 

our 

business 

operations, and are committed to 

taking steps to reduce our impact, 

especially the waste generated and 

GHG emissions. Fuel and energy 

consumption 

is 

managed 

and 

monitored by the various business 

units.

GKE is committed to reducing our 

environmental footprint through two 

(2) key approaches:

WASTE MANAGEMENT (GRI 306-2)

We have identified three (3) main 

waste streams in our businesses. 

Where possible, we send our waste 

for recycling and reduce the amount 

of waste produced by re-using other 

items, such as wooden pallets. 

The general waste is incinerated in 

Singapore, after which the incinerated 

ash is sent to landfill. We are 

exploring ways to improve our waste 

segregation to improve on the volume 

of recyclables. Since 2018, iPads 

have been used for Board meetings 

to reduce the amount of paper used 

for printing minutes of meetings, 

agendas and other attachments. 

For other meetings, projectors are 

used to present meeting materials. 

As far as possible, we are moving 

towards a paperless environment 

in all our business units. We aim to 

recycle as much as possible of our 

used carton boxes and shrink wrap. 

In FY2020, 17,860kg of carton 

boxes and 18,245kg of plastic 

shrink wrap generated mostly from 

our warehousing operations was 

recycled. We have also incinerated 

189,940kg of general waste this 

FY2020. No hazardous waste was 

disposed this reporting year.

REDUCING OUR GHG EMISSIONS

(GRI 305-1, 305-2)

As one of the leaders in providing 

warehousing and logistics solutions, 

we have a dedicated and modern fleet 

for our operational needs. We operate 

our own fleet of vehicles, including 

prime movers and trailers, and have 

replaced our older trucks with Euro 6 

model in our logistics business, which 

are in compliance with Singapore 

National 

Environmental 

Agency 

regulations, and which will also help 

to reduce nitrogen oxides pollutants 

and fine particulate matter.  

In 

FY2020, 

we 

embarked 

on 

a 

digitalisation 

project 

in 

our 

warehousing operations to move 

away from traditional paper-based 

operations for job order handling. 

With digitalisation, the need for 

printing of hard copy documents is 

eliminated as job order instructions 

can now be sent directly from the 

customer service team to operations 

team. With more efficient storing and 

sharing of information, administrative 

tasks are reduced, hence increasing 

productivity.

The 

Group 

is 

also 

embracing 

technology to improve its overall 

processes - an Enterprise Resource 

Planning (“ERP”) system is currently 

being implemented in one of our 

subsidiaries which helps to cut down 

the printing of purchase orders and 

invoices. With a connected digital 

network and data stored in the Cloud, 

it has allowed us to move away from 

disparate 

systems, 

enabling 

us 

to better streamline our business 

processes.

Our overall energy consumption 

in 

FY2020 

for 

Singapore 

and 

China operations was 52,322,592 

MJ, which is approximately a 9% 

increase from FY2019. This increase 

in energy consumption was mostly 

due to an increase in the energy 

consumption from the readymix 

business, which is in tandem with 

the increase in revenue. 

One of our new business initiatives 

currently 

underway 

is 

the 

construction of a new recycling 

plant – Cenxi Haoyi Recycling, to 

recycle material waste arising from 

mining, construction, manufacturing 

and 

other 

related 

processes 

into 

reusable 

construction 

raw 

materials. 

Every 

year, 

a 

large 

part of recyclable materials is 

disposed of in landfills or arbitrarily 

discharged to the environment. To 

ensure the sustainability of building 

construction materials, it is essential 

to utilise production waste. By 

recycling waste products arising 

from mining, manufacturing and 

construction activities into reusable 

raw materials for manufacturing of 

ready-mix concrete, it can help to 

reduce the environmental impact 

associated with the transport of 

materials and manufacture of new 

materials. This recycling plant is 

being built in Longmu village, Cenxi 

city in the People’s Republic of 

China.

GKE CORPORATION LIMITED

OUR

CUSTOMERS

As the world becomes increasingly digital, our 

opportunities continue to expand. But with these 

opportunities come ever-more complex challenges – 

such as how to keep personal data private and secure, 

even when it moves across borders. We recognise 

the risks and negative impacts that our business and 

stakeholders may encounter if information such as 

confidential/sensitive corporate data, personal data 

of customers, employees and stakeholders, is not 

adequately protected. As we harness technology in 

our business and operations, the risks have also further 

increased. Data security and privacy is a top priority for 

us.

DATA PRIVACY (GRI 418-1)

Personal data in Singapore is protected under the 

Personal Data Protection Act 2012. We aim for complete 

transparency in the way we process and manage the 

data that our clients entrust to us. Employees of GKE 

are required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement for the 

work that they conduct at GKE. The company’s networks, 

database and websites are also secured to prevent loss 

of data. CCTV cameras are installed at strategic locations 

in our facilities for physical security, certain offices are 

also biometric controlled for greater control and access. 

Training and ongoing engagement are the primary ways 

we build awareness among our employees. 

In FY2020, there were no substantiated complaints 

concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of 

customer data across the various GKE subsidiaries. We 

shall strive to continue to maintain zero case of breaches 

of customer privacy or loss of customer data in FY2021.

GLOBAL TRADE

GKE’s end-to-end logistics services covers warehousing, 

freight, 

transportation, 

marine 

logistics 

and 

port 

management. By working with our agents / partners in 

different countries, we add value to our client’s supply chain 

through integration of land, sea and air transportation from 

country of origin to point of sale, avoiding the hassle of

GOOD LABOUR RELATIONS (GRI 401-1)

At GKE, we operate on the basis of continuous improvement 

– constantly looking for ways that we can be more efficient, 

more responsive, less wasteful, more profitable and safer. 

GKE aims to foster an excellence culture. Our employees 

are passionate, committed, and excel in what they do. In 

return, we recognise their efforts and encourage a culture 

of collaboration. The talent and motivation of our 896 

employees in FY2020 across our various business units are 

the foundations for our success. Implementing a strong, 

common culture and purpose across the Group remains 

the main priority of our management team. As part of our 

restructuring exercise that began in FY2018, we started 

to integrate similar functions across the different business 

units in FY2019 with the aim of having common corporate 

functions, such as human resource, sales and marketing. 

By having common corporate functions, we plan to create 

closer links and drive synergy when implementing new 

initiatives across the various business units. 

In FY2020, we had a turnover rate of 11.6% and a hiring 

rate of 9.3%. The decline in overall headcount was due 

primarily to GKE Services Pte Ltd which had to streamline 

its workforce due to reduced business. GKE Services Pte 

Ltd provides services to the aviation industry which has been 

impacted severely by COVID-19.

Wuzhou XingJian, which is based in Guangxi, hires 

employees from the surrounding community near the factory. 

As part of the employees’ benefits, the company provides 

free dormitory accommodation and daily meals at the staff 

canteen for all employees.

EMPLOYEE HEALTH, SAFETY 

AND WELLNESS

Our people are our most important 

asset. Neglecting their health and 

safety would not only be irresponsible 

and 

unethical 

but 

would 

also 

endanger our business performance. 

GKE strives to work in a healthy 

and safe manner that complies with 

all applicable occupational safety 

and health laws and standards, 

and are committed to providing 

our employees with a healthy and 

safe 

working 

environment. 

Our 

employees are encouraged to take 

ownership when it comes to health 

and safety. Our health and safety 

approach applies at all levels of the 

organisation, from a trip hazard in a 

corridor at head office, to a partially 

closed truck door, or pallets stacked 

too high in a warehouse – all GKE 

employees should see a potential 

danger and take immediate action to 

resolve. 

Our health and safety representatives 

from the various business units help 

to integrate health and safety into 

the daily strategic and operational 

planning 

for 

the 

organisation. 

GKE Corporation Ltd. will provide 

guidance and lead our other entities, 

GKE Express Logistics Pte Ltd, GKE 

Warehousing &amp; Logistics Pte Ltd 

and GKE Pte Ltd, in achieving ISO 

45001:2018 

Occupational 

Health 

and Safety Management System, 

together 

with 

ISO 

14001:2015 

Environmental Management System 

and Workplace Safety and Health 

(WSH) bizSAFE Star certification in 

year 2021. 

GKE Express Logistics Pte. Ltd. 

and GKE Warehousing &amp; Logistics 

Pte. Ltd. have both achieved ISO 

9001:2015 

Quality 

Management 

System 

certification 

and 

WSH 

bizSAFE Level 3 since 2017. GKE 

has in place a health, safety and 

environment system with defined safe 

work procedures, risk assessments 

and other relevant work instructions 

for our staff and contractors. 

In FY2020, we had four cases of 

reportable accidents which resulted 

in a total of 214 man days lost. By 

identifying, recording, investigating 

and analysing the incidents, we have 

informed and formally addressed 

safety accidents in our monthly 

Safety Committee meetings and 

implemented 

corrective 

actions 

to prevent recurrence.  We have 

also made improvements to our 

equipment and work procedures 

to address the root cause of these 

accidents, and communicated these 

to our employees to raise their 

awareness on lessons that can be 

learnt, with an aim to minimise the 

number of lost days in FY2021. 

GKE Express Logistics Pte. Ltd. rolled 

out the internal training program, HSE-

02-07 Traffic Safety Management for 

all our drivers, which imparts best 

practices on transportation safety 

and reinforces the importance of the 

role of each individual. Each morning, 

every team leader reminds the 

drivers to pay attention to important 

issues such as the condition of the 

vehicle and the health of the drivers. 

Alternative vehicles will be used in the 

event any is found to have issues, 

and replacement drivers are also 

on standby if any drivers are unwell. 

Our prime mover drivers operating 

within the PSA Container Terminal 

also attend a haulier’s defensive 

driving course to attain knowledge 

on defensive driving techniques to 

enable them to avoid accidents while 

operating a haulier prime mover 

within PSA Container Terminal.

At Wuzhou XingJian, we regularly 

engage environmental, health and 

safety consultancy firms to monitor 

our EHS performance and to ensure 

that our working environment meets 

the requirements of the local laws 

and regulations. Standard operating 

procedures have also been developed 

for the various activities carried out 

on site and training provided to all 

employees before they start their work 

as well as on-the-job. In accordance 

with China’s Workplace Safety Law, 

the Group also ensures all employees 

are provided with personal protective 

equipment 

and 

undergo 

regular 

health checks. 

There were no work-related injuries 

or fatalities attributable to non-

employees or contractors working at 

our premises in Singapore and China 

in FY2020.
