Conservation, Product Excellence and Corporate Social Responsibility

The Group has always held a high standard for environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues. In addition 

to complying with relevant laws and regulations on environmental protection matters, the Group is always mindful 

of conserving resources. For example, the design of the Group’s factory for the manufacturing of electronics and 

acoustic products conserves electricity consumption by allowing more sunlight to enter into the building. On a daily 

basis, employees are always reminded to minimise paper consumption by recycling used paper whenever possible.

The Group strives to develop innovative products that are both eco-friendly and cost-efficient in order to enrich 

the daily experience and improve the living standard of its customers as a whole. This is well demonstrated by the 

Group’s KEF R11 floorstanding speaker, KEF LS50 Wireless, KEF R3 stand mount and KEF LSX wireless music 

system which were well received by the market and scooped a number of awards from prestigious music and 

gadget magazines.

GP Batteries has dedicated significant amount of resources and efforts to its research and development centre for 

the development of new products and introduction of advanced equipment. In order to meet the increasing market 

demand, GP Batteries has equipped itself with cost-effective automated systems that enhance productivity and 

quality control. GP Batteries’ quality management system and manufacturing process is data-driven and follows 

the Six Sigma philosophy for continuous improvement. Factors / parameters that could affect product quality are 

hence prevented by data automation. GP Batteries also possess inspection equipment exclusive to the battery 

industry such as AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy), UV - VIS (UV - Visible Spectrometry) and EDXRF (Energy 

Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence).

The Group cares about the community by organizing and participating in various social caring events. Driven by this 

fundamental value, the Group continues to provide resources in protecting environment, promote health and safety 

in the workplace, take an active role in shouldering corporate social responsibility and stay committed to providing 

the best products and services for its customers and the community.

Considering Stakeholders’ Interest amid the COVID-19 Pandemic

The Group recognises the importance for all of its stakeholders to weather the COVID-19  pandemic together. The 

following are some of the efforts of the Group in taking the interests of its stakeholders into consideration while 

achieving the Group’s business objectives during this challenging period.  

Employees

During the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to full compliance with the relevant regulations and legislations 

imposed by various governments and jurisdictions regarding workplace safe management and movement 

controls, the Group has taken the following precautionary measures to safeguard our workplace in its entirety. 

A designated task force was formed to enhance implementation of hygienic measures. Temperature screening 

procedure was conducted on every person entering the workplaces. Commonly touched areas in workplaces 

were disinfected regularly. Adequate face masks and disinfectant were provided in workplaces. Employees were 

recommended to maintain good personal hygiene such as wearing face masks in their workplaces and washing 

hands frequently. Employees were also required to declare personal health condition and recent travel history 

before resumption of work.

In Hong Kong, where no lockdown was imposed, special transportation arrangements, flexible working hours and 

provision of in-house meals were arranged for employees to reduce exposures in crowded places and thus risk of 

infection. Shift duties and work from home arrangements were implemented to reduce contacts among employees 

while maintaining smooth business operation. Employees who displayed symptoms of fever or other respiratory 

symptoms were advised to seek immediate medical advice and take sick leave. The Group provided special leave 

arrangement for employees who were subjected to compulsory quarantine ordered by the governments during the 

pandemic.

All business travels have been reduced to minimal. The Group encouraged the use of telecommuting wherever 

possible in order to minimise guest visits to office premises and reduce physical meetings, both internally and with 

external parties.

Customers

Physical lockdowns in a number of countries affected demands as well as physical movement of stocks. As a result, 

some of our customers requested to cancel their purchase orders or delay shipment of their purchases. Our sales 

teams have been working closely with operations and logistics teams to offer best flexibility to accommodate all 

these requests, and render our support to these key customers in this difficult period. After carefully considering 

the requests of some of the customers, the Group allowed some orders to be cancelled or re-scheduled for a later 

shipment date without enforcing its contractual rights on the customers. In addition, the Group also extended the 

credit terms for certain customers, after rigorously assessing their creditworthiness.

The Group’s Sustainability Story


10  ︱  GP Industries Limited Sustainability Report 2019-2020

Suppliers

Physical lockdowns also impacted our supply chain, as certain suppliers suspended operations due to movement 

controls while supply lead time increased. Nevertheless, active engagement with suppliers by the batteries business 

helped to reduce the impact.  Since last year, the batteries business have implemented the “Quarterly Suppliers 

Questionnaire” to communicate with its “Level 1” suppliers (which are on its “Approved Vendor List”) for updates 

on the supplier’s production situations. Such regular and systematic engagement has been particularly helpful 

during this period. The battery business and its suppliers were able to align on priority requirements to minimize 

any impacts on the Group’s productions and supply chain. In addition, the Group’s policy of maintaining alternative 

suppliers for critical materials also diversified the risk of over reliance on a single supplier.  

Local Communities

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group could not continue with some of its community services due to the 

various safe management measures implemented. However, the Group attended to some of the needs of the 

community arising from the pandemic. Such efforts are discussed in paragraph 12.5.  

Other Stakeholders

The Group also recognises the importance of updating the Group’s capital providers with its latest development. 

Such capital providers include shareholders who provide equity, and lenders which provide loan capital. 

On 2 June 2020, the Group provided its shareholders with a business update on the impact of the COVID-19 

outbreak via an announcement to SGX-ST, which sets out how COVID-19 affected the revenue and financial 

performance of the Group for the financial quarter ended 31 March 2020, as well as the cost control measures 

implemented by the Group in mitigating the adverse financial impact arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Group also engages the lenders more regularly, in order to facilitate the lenders to understand how COVID-19 

has impacted the Group’s businesses and what are the Group’s strategies and measures adopted in meeting the 

challenges.

The Group’s Sustainability Story


GP Industries Limited Sustainability Report 2019-2020  ︱  11

Business Ethics and Integrity

The Group subscribes to the principles of fair business practices and refrain from unfair trade practices, such 

as bribery and corruption, and strives to achieve business growth through fair market competition. The Group is 

committed to ensuring that its affairs are conducted with the highest standard of probity and in compliance with the 

law and strives to uphold the highest levels of business conduct and integrity in all transactions and interactions. 

Directors of the Company (the “Directors”) have a responsibility to lead by example. The Board has adopted a Code 

of Business Conduct and Ethics for the Directors (the “Ethics Code”). The Ethics Code serves to guide the Directors 

on the following areas of ethical risk and sets a framework where integrity and accountability are paramount:

(i)  

avoid conflict of interest in (a) corporate opportunities; and (b) other board appointments;

(ii)  

maintain confidentiality of confidential or proprietary information that a Director may learn of when discharging 

his duties as a Director;

(iii)  

compliance with laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to the dealing in the Company’s securities; 

and

(iv)  

fair dealing with customers, suppliers, competitors and employees.

The Ethics Code requires Directors to practice and promote ethical behaviour. Through the adoption of the Ethics 

Code, the Board affirms it shall take steps to ensure the Company encourages its employees (i) to seek guidance 

from supervisors, managers and appropriate personnel when in doubt about the best course of action in any 

particular situation; and (ii) to report any violations of laws and Company policy.

The Ethics Code also sets out the channel of communication for the Directors to report matters concerning improper 

business conducts and unethical practices.

Whistleblowing Policy

The Group has established a whistleblowing policy that allows anyone to report in good faith any misconduct or 

malpractice, without fear of reprisal, through a confidential channel. If investigation is to take place, the head of 

internal audit will carry out the investigative work, and then seek administrative support from the Audit and Risk 

Committee (the “ARC”). The ARC may also consider the appointment of an external party to assist the head of 

internal audit in performing the investigative work. The Board, the ARC and the head of internal audit will keep strict 

confidentiality on the informer’s identity throughout the course of the investigation. Any form of disadvantage or 

reprisal against the informer by the Company’s management or staff is expressly prohibited.

Anti-Corruption

The Group is committed to preventing corruption, bribery, extortion, fraud and money laundering, as well as 

complying with applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations. It prohibits its employees from offering, making 

or receiving any bribes or kickbacks for the purpose of securing improper business advantages, or otherwise 

engaging in corrupt activities or practices.

The Group’s whistleblowing policy also enables suspected corruptive practices within the Group to be reported in 

strictest confidence. 

4. Ethics and Integrity

relating to bribery, extortion, fraud and money laundering. No legal case regarding corrupt practices was brought 

against the Group or its employees.

out the procedures for review and approval of the Group’s IPTs. Please refer to the section on Interested Person 

Transactions in the Group’s Annual Report for FY2020 (“FY2020 AR”) for our disclosure in accordance with Rule 

907 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual in respect of IPTs for FY2020.

Dealing in Securities

The Group has adopted a Code of Best Practices on Securities Transactions with respect to dealings in securities 

by Directors and officers of the Group. 

Directors and officers of the Group are prohibited from dealing in the Company’s securities during the period 

commencing two weeks before the announcement of the Company’s results for each of the first three quarters 

of its financial year, and one month before the announcement of the Company’s full year results (if the Company 

announces its quarterly financial statements, whether required by SGX-ST or otherwise), or one month before 

the announcement of its half-yearly results (if the Company does not announce quarterly financial statements), 

and one month before the announcement of the Company’s full year results, ending on the date of the relevant 

announcement of the results. 

On 14 February 2020, the Company announced that it would cease quarterly reporting with immediate effect, 

as allowed by the amended Rules of the SGX-ST effective 7 February 2020. Accordingly, the Company would 

only announce its half-yearly and full year results with effect from 14 February 2020. Directors and officers are 

also prohibited from dealing in the Company’s securities when they are in possession of potentially price sensitive 

information.

a short-term nature.

The Company has complied with its Code of Best Practices on Securities Transactions.

The lockdown and social distancing measures imposed by the Chinese government in response to the COVID-19 

outbreak in Mainland China shut down most of the Group’s factories and offices in Mainland China starting 

February to mid-March 2020. Combined with subsequent manpower and logistics problems caused by interrupted 

transportation and some supply chains, production output and operating efficiency for some of the Group’s factories 

were significantly affected. In the second half of March 2020, the Group’s factories in Malaysia and Vietnam were 

locked down by the respective governments to prevent the spread of the pandemic. As a result, revenue of the 

Group for the financial quarter ended 31 March 2020 declined by 15.1%. The Group’s revenue for FY2020 declined 

by 9.0%.

For the past two years the Group’s battery factories have been striving for the “Zero Waste to Landfill” validations. 

During FY2020, three factories of the Group in China and Malaysia received UL (Underwriters Laboratories) Zero 

Waste to Landfill Silver Validation by UL-CCIC Company Limited to acknowledge their achievements in minimizing 

production waste, diverting the waste from the landfill for reuse, recycling and incineration with energy recovery, 

as well as its commitment to sustainable development. The Group intends to gradually have all its manufacturing 

plants accredited with such validation.

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on environmental topics

As discussed in paragraph 10.1, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Group’s factories in China and Malaysia 

to temporary suspended their operations for two to four weeks in February and March 2020 and contributed to 

the decrease in the Group’s revenue for FY2020. During such period of factory closure, the Group consumed 

less resources and generated less waste. However, due mainly to a decrease in the Group’s revenue, intensity, 

expressed as resources consumed or waste generated per million dollar of revenue, of certain environmental topics 

discussed below increased.
