LETTER TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS

Dear Stakeholders,

Del Monte Pacific Ltd. (DMPL) 

provides for people’s basic need 

for nourishment. Our products, 

employees and the Group have 

proven resilient amid the global 

pandemic as we continue to operate 

as an essential industry to produce 

healthy food and beverage. From 

our consumers to communities 

to our colleagues and company, 

resilience is part of sustainability. 

As a leading global food company, 

sustainability is core to our Group’s 

vision, “Nourishing Families. 

Enriching Lives. Every Day.”  

Sustainability is one of our 

strategic pillars supporting 

this vision, while commitment 

to society and environment 

is one of our core values.

We have been nourishing people 

for generations. Throughout the 

long heritage of the Del Monte 

4

Del Monte Pacific Limited




brand and the long history of our 

farms, our Group has strived to 

operate a business that produces 

nutritious food, sustains our 

plantations, and generates livelihood, 

contributing to the economic, 

environmental and social well-being 

of the communities we serve. 

“Sustaining our Future” is our 

commitment to grow healthier 

produce, healthier people and a 

healthier planet through a business 

that promotes a balance among 

diverse stakeholders, including 

our consumers, employees, 

communities and shareholders. 

Our FY2021 Sustainability Report 

highlights our six sustainability pillars: 

• 

Nourishing Consumers with 

healthy food and beverage. 

Our 136 years of brand 

heritage, led by Del Monte, 

is a testimony to consumers’ 

trust in our product quality. 

• 

Nurturing Employees with 

a culture of engagement, 

development and work-life 

integration. The well-being and 

safety of our 5,800 employees 

and 18,300 labor service 

providers are important to us. 

• 

Developing Communities 

through the impact of our 

business and corporate social 

responsibility. We provide 

local employment, livelihood 

programs, community health 

and wellness, and education. 

Our long-term partnerships 

are a testament to our care 

for our communities. 

• 

Preserving Nature with 

sustainable agricultural and 

manufacturing practices. 

Our more than 100 years of 

operations is a testimony to 

how we conserve the lands 

we cultivate or source from. 

Our responsible stewardship of 

nature sustains our business.

• 

Strengthening Governance 

grounded on transparency, 

integrity and accountability. 

DMPL has been listed on the 

Singapore Exchange since 

1999 and the Philippine Stock 

Exchange since 2013. The Board 

of Directors and management 

are accountable to stakeholders. 

• 

Sustaining Growth in a way 

that will sustain our financial 

performance, the lifeline of our 

business that lays the foundation 

upon which we build value for 

our shareholders through the 

Triple Bottom Line - people, 

planet and performance. 

Sustainability sets us on a path 

towards a more holistic and 

balanced approach that addresses 

the environmental, social and 

governance (ESG) priorities of our 

internal and external stakeholders. 

Our Sustainability Report 

highlights our priorities, goals and 

performance in pages 6–15 of 

the report. We also report on our 

contribution to the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals 

which are more important than 

ever during this global pandemic.

DMPL was honored as a finalist for 

“Asia’s Best Community Reporting” 

at the 2020 Asia Sustainability 

Reporting Awards (ASRA) last May 

2021. ASRA, which is based in 

Singapore, is the highest recognition 

for sustainability reporting in Asia, 

assessing Sustainability Reports 

from around 15 countries in the 

region. This is the second time 

ASRA has recognized DMPL.

Sustainability is an integral part of 

Del Monte Pacific Group. Our Board 

of Directors and management 

team will continue to invest in the 

present to sustain our future. We 

thank you, our stakeholders, for 

your partnership in this journey.

HEALTH AND NUTRITION 



Marketing and Customer and Channel Development teams with Philip G. Macahilig,  

Group Head of Philippine Market Commercial Operations



Del Monte is a well-trusted brand 

committed to health and nutrition. 

We aspire to preserve this trust 

among consumers.

A leader in meeting consumer 

preferences, we understand 

that consumers are becoming 

increasingly mindful of the 

ingredients in their food and are 

often looking for positive health 

properties such as low-fat or low-

sugar. This emphasis on health 

benefits has ongoing implications for 

product design and sourcing.

1. In the U.S., Del Monte was the 

first major food producer to 

voluntarily adopt nutritional 

labeling on all food products.

 

2. The vast majority of our products 

contain positive nutrients and are 

considered healthy.







3. We aim to provide at least half 

a cup of fruits or vegetables per 

serving for most of our products 

in the U.S., and meet healthy 

nutrient levels as recommended 

by the FDA. The majority of our 

produce are picked and packed 

on the same day, ensuring 97% 

preservative-free produce. 

4. Majority of our products in the 

U.S. are low in fat. We carry 

several specialized product 

lines: organic, no sugar added, 

low-salt, reduced-salt, and low 

in calories for those seeking 

additional health benefits or 

following specific dietary regimes.

NOURISHING CONSUMERS

5. Within its existing categories, DMFI 

has a significant set of No-Sugar-

Added fruit products, and No-

Salt-Added and Reduced-Sodium 

vegetable products relative to other 

branded players.

6. All added ingredients in Del Monte 

vegetables, single-serve fruit snacks, 

corn and most tomato products 

have been non-genetically modified 

organisms (non-GMO), representing 

a majority of the Company’s product 

line.  Del Monte was the first 

manufacturer to work with the USDA 

for non-GMO verification for corn 

products for consumer assurance on 

sweet corn products.

7. In the U.S., we verify non-GMO 

ingredients from suppliers and source 

replacement non-GMO ingredients 

where necessary. All non-GMO 

products meet current industry 

requirements for non-GMO claim.

8. In Asia, we anchor our nutrition 

platforms on immunity, heart and 

bone health, which give support to 

the immune system and promote 

healthy digestion.

9. The Company’s products are mostly 

plant-based. Pineapples are rich in 

vitamins and minerals that boost 

immunity, while tomato products 

have lycopene, an antioxidant that 

helps prevent certain diseases.

PRODUCT PACKAGING  

Our Group understands the need 

to have a sustainable packaging to 

preserve the environment. 

We target to innovate our packaging 

towards responsible stewardship of 

the environment while maintaining 

the quality and safety of our 

products. This motivates us to 

rework our product packaging in a 

more environment-friendly manner.

1.  The R&amp;D teams at DMFI worked 

with our packaging suppliers 

to test compostable bioplastics 

in a laboratory setting. We are 

also working on developing a 

plastic fruit cup that incorporates 

post-consumer recycled content 

within the interior layers.

2. Polyester material is the 

alternative lining material for 

our vegetable and fruit products 

while vinyl is the alternative 

used for our tomato cans. The 

linings meet the requirements 

of California’s Prop. 65, ensuring 

they do not contain phthalates or 

BPA and comply with all FDA  

and European Food Safety 

Authority standards.  

The coating components are also 

compliant with the United States 

Environmental Protection Agency 

and Regulation for Registration, 

Evaluation, Authorization, and 

Restriction of Chemicals. 

3. We have converted 100% of our 

branded tomato products and 

nearly 100% of our branded fruit 

and vegetable products to non-

BPA lining in the U.S.

4. In the Philippines, all packaging 

materials in the cannery and 

toll packers are 100% BPA-Non 

Intent.     

5. We also innovated our packaging 

to make it more convenient for 

consumers.  Our juices come in 

resealable one-liter cartons.

TRACEABILITY

To ensure that our products are 

safe, we have a robust traceability 

program allowing us to protect 

our consumers’ health during 

unwarranted events by identifying 

the origin of the product from its

equips us to efficiently handle 

consumer inquiries. Having a reliable 

traceability program enables the 

Group to have an effective process 

to identify a defective product or 

component and to execute the recall 

process if warranted.

1. The Group conducts periodic 

quality audits with our co-

manufacturers to ensure 

compliance with our standards.

Del Monte Foundation leads as local convenor of ZEP2030



Zero Extreme Poverty 2030 (ZEP2030)

A convergence of civil society 

organizations and Non-

Governmental Organizations 

(NGOs) in Bukidnon was 

organized to accelerate the 

implementation of ZEP2030 in 

Bukidnon. Del Monte Foundation 

was requested to lead the 

convergence and assume the 

role of local convenor for the 

province given its experience and 

successful implementation of 

ZEP, as well as DMPI’s presence in 

several Bukidnon municipalities. 

Peace and Equity Foundation 

(PEF) and the Foundation for 

the Philippine Environment 

(FPE), both national NGOs and 

funding entities, support the 

convergence to uplift more 

families from extreme poverty.  

The Foundation participated in 

the roll-out of the COVID Pulse 

PH Survey organized by the 

United Nations Development 

Program (UNDP). This was a 

rapid response online survey 

to assess the condition of poor 

households amidst the pandemic 

in the six poorest provinces of 

the country, including Bukidnon. 

Results of the survey will serve 

as instruments to aid ZEP 

multi-stakeholder efforts in 

poverty reduction in the new 

normal. As UNDP partner, Del 

Monte Foundation capitalized 

on its relationship with the 

Department of Social Welfare 

and Development (DSWD) and 

tapped the agency’s organic 4Ps 

structure in implementing the 

survey across six identified towns 

within two weeks. Results of the 

survey will be shared with the 

Bukidnon LGU’s and stakeholders 

within the first quarter of FY22. 

ZEP2030 was introduced 

to an Indigenous People 

(IP) community in Barangay 

Dagundalahon, where DMPI has 

its largest plantation in Talakag. 

With approval from the LGU, 

the Foundation conducted a 

profiling survey and discovered 

that 25% of the families are 

in extreme poverty. The 

Foundation conducted a Family 

&amp; Community Visioning and 

Barangay Development Planning 

workshop together with the 

Barangay Local Government 

Unit and stakeholders. This 

served as the community’s 

roadmap to poverty alleviation 

and development. 

Family profiling was also 

conducted in three expansion 

areas in Sugbongcogon 

and Kinoguitan, Misamis 

Oriental. These coastal towns 

are more progressive and 

have better access to basic 

services. Very few are in a 

state of extreme poverty.

LIVELIHOOD PROGRAMS  

The Foundation conducted 

community-based skills training for 

employment or self-employment 

to provide technical education 

access to out-of-school youth and 

unemployed family heads.

Bread-making training

1. The Foundation partnered 

with the Department of Labor 

and Employment (DOLE) and 

Technical Education and Skills 

Development Authority (TESDA) 

to facilitate employment 

program activities such as 

job fairs and career coaching, 

giving training graduates greater 

employment opportunities.

employed and were given 

start-up assistance by the 

DSWD LGU.

4. There were 81 graduates from 

two TESDA-certified training 

disciplines, with 65 already 

employed in FY21.

5. Additional livelihood projects 

were organized in poor 

communities in new areas. Over 

1,000 families benefited from 

livelihood and food security 

projects in Bukidnon. 

6. In partnership with the LGU, the 

Foundation conducted training to 

support the Indigenous Peoples 

(IP) organization. About 50 IP 

families and women in three 

different communities benefited 

from livelihood projects on bead-

making and mat-weaving. 

7. The IPs were provided start-up 

capital for the production of their 

craft. The Foundation liaised 

between these associations and 

an establishment in Malaybalay 

City to sell and market their crafts. 

8. The “Utanan sa Kabalayan” 

(Vegetable Garden in Homes) has 

a two-pronged goal. The project 

provided additional income in 

communities through sale or 

barter of excess vegetables. This 

program was facilitated by the 

LGU of Sumilao during the weekly 

DEVELOPING COMMUNITIES

market day in the community. 

Beneficiaries were encouraged 

to save the seeds of mature 

vegetables to continue growing 

them in their gardens. 

9. “Pugad Baboy” (Backyard 

Swine Raising) project was 

made possible through another 

partnership with the Department 

of Agriculture (DA).  The DA 

awarded 12 native pigs to the 

Foundation to establish backyard 

multiplier farms. The pigs are 

bred and grown by caretakers 

appointed by the Foundation.

SOIL MANAGEMENT      

Tomato transplanting in the U.S.

As efficient soil management directly 

impacts our long-term productivity, we 

focused on regenerating topsoil and 

improving biodiversity on and below  

the ground.

1. To facilitate soil management,  

DMFI asked growers to:

a. Conduct consistent soil sampling 

to manage soil fertility and health

b. Apply our model pesticide 

control program

c. Use pest-resistant varieties where 

available

d. Rotate crops to minimize the 

effect of soil insects and diseases

2. We encourage our farmers to 

work with qualified agronomists 

to innovate farm practices and 

technologies to boost crop yields, 

control pests and weeds, and protect 

the environment. Understanding 

the agronomics of a new variety 

in a growing area is important 

for environmental adaptation.

3. DMFI increased its cover crop 

acreage by 18% from FY20 

through 50 of its 96 growers.

4. In the Philippines, DMPI is 

working on a soil conservation 

project to maintain land 

productivity, mitigate topsoil loss, 

prevent soil erosion and reduce 

loss of soil nutrients. 

5. For better soil and drainage 

management, the Crop Growing 

Units dredged ditches, installed 

auxiliary canals and silting basins 

designed for each field, and 

planted along river easement 

near pineapple fields to prevent 

soil erosion.  

6. DMPI implemented a block layout 

system depending on topography 

and utilized drone images for 

topography maps and hydrology 

analysis for a more precise 

design. The Company built 

catchment basins in strategic 

locations around the field.

7. The Company does soil ripping 

in lieu of plowing to retain more 

organic matter on the top layer 

of the soil profile and incorporate 

pineapple plant residues in the 

field to maintain soil organic 

matter at desirable levels.

8. DMPI implemented the Big 

Planting Materials program, 

through which the Company 

expects to phase out the use of 

extra small seeds, and plant big 

and regular planting materials.

9. The Company planted cover 

crops as ground covers along 

main road shoulders before the 

boundary canal. DMPI maintained 

the grass levels on side slopes of 

permanent waterways to prevent 

erosion after heavy rains.  

10. Perimeter canals were also 

created to serve also as 

Pineapple planting operation in Bukidnon

Fixed-wing drones ready for flight

catchment area of soil deposits 

which are later excavated back to 

the field.

11. Other soil conservation initiatives 

include:

a. Installed check dam in all 

secondary canals at 1.5 - 3.0 

meters depending on the slope

b. Built mini silting basin at the 

end portion of all secondary 

canals following the last three 

tertiary canals

c. Established easement area of 

20 meters from creeks and 

rivers

d. Planted shrubs and trees along 

the 20 meters easement areas 

along creeks and rivers to 

prevent erosion

e. Minimized the number of 

excavated main canals based 

on the computation set for a 

certain field topography

f. Reduced each secondary 

and tertiary canal to certain 

dimensions

12. The Company has a soil map 

used by our Agricultural Research 

Laboratory to regularly analyze 

soil nutrients except nitrogen and 

organic matter.

13. DMPI uses a soil and water 

assessment tool program to 

monitor the health status of our 

resources.

14. DMPI’s Drone Program 

monitored the pineapple field in 

Bukidnon and Misamis Oriental.  

These drone images displayed 

the land topography and assisted 

in land preparation – planning of 

roads, canals, and ditches.  The 

use of drone sensors produced a 

complete image of a field when 

planting is completed; seeds take 

root and show growth within 2-3 

months after planting.

PRESERVING NATURE

Plant Breeding Program



Our agricultural Seed Operations 

Research Team's plant breeding 

program in DMFI selects the best 

plant qualities to produce new 

generations. Our expert plant 

breeders and research farm staff 

join our growers in introducing 

new crop varieties with improved 

yields. Our Blue Lake® green 

bean breeding program and 

modern growing practices have 

increased yields by nearly 200%.

The volume selection of pilot 

plots is based on yield, pest and 

disease resistance, and quality. 

The strongest lines are advanced 

the next year into yield, machine 

harvestability, and quality plots in 

the nursery.   

The lines are named into a 

variety code and prepared for 

testing in small, short row plots 

in a grower’s field to check if 

the attributes remain the same 

in normal growing conditions. 

Selections from these field plots 

are then advanced into strip plots 

of 1 to 10 acres to be evaluated on 

a larger scale for usable product 

for the factory. The variety is 

tested for harvest cleanliness, 

yield, disease resistance, nutrient 

management, and factory 

performance.  

The best varieties are moved from 

test status to trial status over the 

next two years to continue to 

understand their character. These 

fields are usually 40 to 160 acres 

in size. If the variety performs 

consistently and has a niche, it is 

added to the Del Monte Approved 

Variety List where it becomes 

a standard variety used by Del 

Monte locations to provide the 

quality needed to produce Del 

Monte vegetables. 

We tested over 1,300 breeding 

lines of new green bean varieties 

within a year.  The Company 

conducted 600 pilot plots of 

green beans, 9 pilot plots of sweet 

corn, and about 5 pilot plots of 

peas. 100% of our Del Monte 

growers use Del Monte seeds.  

Close to 12,100 hectares of green 

beans, 4,040 hectares of corn, 

and 1,200 hectares of peas are the 

total growing area for Del Monte 

seeds for the year.  

Our seed breeding efforts focused 

on shorter maturing varieties 

of peas, sweet corn, and green 

beans. By requiring less days to 

mature, we reduced the amount 

of water and fertilizer the plant 

needs over its growth cycle. 

Our research farm in Wisconsin 

allowed our agronomists to work 

with our growers and determine 

the optimal amount of fertilizer 

needed for our crops.

We consider the viewpoints of 

our customers and growers as 

we identify key characteristics of 

our plants. Their insights guide 

the next generation of our seeds 

and products. Ultimately, we test 

for taste, harvest cleanliness, 

yield, disease resistance, nutrient 

management, and factory 

performance.

WATER MANAGEMENT  

We implemented the least water-

intensive cultivation methods available 

and encouraged the use of more 

water-efficient irrigation systems.

1. In the U.S., our growers use 

various irrigation systems to 

supplement natural rainfall and 

ensure a steady and reliable 

water supply for their crops. 

2. DMFI evaluated water risk based 

on local availability and quality in 

areas where our plants operate 

and at the farm level where we 

contract with growers. 

3. We demonstrated our concern for 

water scarcity through stronger 

regulations and necessitating 

water use monitoring and 

management. DMFI reduced its 

water usage by 26% in FY2021.  

4. Nearly all Del Monte tomato 

growers utilize drip irrigation, a 

less water-intensive cultivation 

method, for targeted application 

of water and fertilizer.

5. We recycled the cooling water 

from our cans to run our cooling 

towers and reduce fresh water 

and energy usage.

6. The relevant managers in charge 

of operations are responsible for 

water use.

7. To conserve freshwater usage 

and avoid water treatment 

costs, DMPI used water from 

steam and pineapple juice of our 

evaporators and from mill juice 

from our Reverse Osmosis (RO) 

system for Ultrafiltration System 

Clean-in-place (CIP) and Ion 

Exchange Plants regeneration. 

8. Our cannery and bottling plant 

operations in the Philippines 

monitor the Water Use Ratio 



(WUR), i.e. liters of water used per 

common case. Our combined 

WUR in the two facilities is 

9.6 liters/case in FY2021, 3% 

lower than prior year. Both 

manufacturing facilities’ target 

is to reduce WUR by 10% by 

FY2026.

9. Some of the initiatives of the 

bottling plant that improved 

water management are:

• 

Backwashing activity was 

reduced from eight times a 

month to twice a month

• 

Optimization of rinsing time 

during CIP

• 

Installation of soft water line 

control timer for shutdown 

operation

• 

Training for awareness on 

water treatment from third-

party suppliers

10. Our toll manufacturers’ 

water conservation programs 

eliminated waste and 

reduced water consumption. 

Wastewater discharges of all toll 

manufacturing lines are within 

regulatory standards. WUR 

in beverage and culinary toll 

manufacturers are monitored and 

reduced each year.

PRESERVING NATURE

FERTILIZER AND PESTICIDE USE   

We help growers apply the principles 

of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 

to minimize pesticides. 

Del Monte Foods, Inc. (DMFI) 

connects our growers and consumers 

through partnership with the 

Stewardship Index of Specialty Crops 

organization and CropTrak™ for 

their crop data management system, 

providing detailed information on 

how vegetables are grown.

1. In the U.S., CropTrak™ monitors 

cover crops, which help increase 

organic matter, reduce wind and 

soil erosion, sequester carbon, 

filter water, control weeds, and 

manage nutrients.   

2. DMFI field staff and growers 

closely monitor crop conditions 

through field scouting, 

pheromone traps and cultural 

tools, while soliciting feedback 

on how to best grow these plants 

and implementing pest control 

and crop disease mitigation 

strategies to avoid pest outbreaks. 

3. By limiting pesticide use, we 

reduce the probability of 

contaminated runoff from 

fields, protect the health of 

farm workers, prevent the 

destruction of beneficial insects 

and other field organisms, 

and ultimately decrease 

the likelihood of pesticide 

residue on the crop when it 

is harvested and processed.

4. We have participated in a number 

of IPM-related partnerships and 

initiatives to share knowledge 

and best practice, such as 

understanding pest life cycles and 

how to monitor their movement. 

Pests in our crops are anything 

undesirable including diseases, 

insects, rodents, and weeds.

5. Our researchers investigate 

crop density to increase yield 

per hectare while cutting 

pesticide and fertilizer use 

and exploring the possibility 

of rolling out high-density 

techniques to other crops.

6. DMFI provides our growers 

with plants that are naturally 

resistant to diseases and 

insects, reducing fertilizer 

and chemical use in farms.

7. Due to these improvements, we 

have reduced our spraying from 

an average of 7 applications 

to 1.5 applications, and 

from about 2 kilos of active 

pesticide ingredient to about 

7.6 grams of active ingredient.  

8. By concentrating on IPM strategy, 

we have reduced our pesticide 

use in green beans by 96% 

on active ingredient bases.

9. We actively complete pesticide 

residue tests for over 1,000 

products each year. Pesticides 

found are removed from our 

products and the fields they

Program.  DMPI has begun 

replacing and discontinuing 

certain hazardous chemicals. 

To date, the Company has 

replaced six chemicals. 

11. The Company also completed 

an orientation with Rainforest 

Alliance in February 2021 to 

go through an overview of the 

Rainforest Alliance standard 

version 2020 that took effect 

in June 2021 and is preparing 

to achieve Rainforest Alliance 

certification by FY2023.

WASTE MANAGEMENT     

We aim to reduce the overall 

consumption of raw materials 

in our operation, encourage 

the reuse of materials, and 

promote responsible disposal. 

1. In the U.S., we benchmarked our 

waste management practices 

and compared landfilling to 

recycling rates to ensure efficient 

management of waste streams. 

2. We instituted a “Ner0 (Near Zero) 

Landfill” policy that diverts up 

to 98% of waste from reaching 

the landfill based on EPA’s Waste 

Reduction Hierarchy.

3. Our Walnut Creek Research 

Center (WCRC) in California 

received a “RecycleSmart” Award 

from the Contra Costa Solid 

Waste Authority for our food 

waste recovery efforts.

4. WCRC is certified as a Bay Area 

Green Business for its efforts 

to conserve water, energy and 

waste, implement eco-friendly 

materials, and engage employees 

in best conservation practices. 

Our Headquarters are Leadership 

in Energy and Environmental 

Design (LEED) certified. 

5. We are actively involved in 

the Food Waste Reduction 

Alliance, a collaborative effort 

between the Consumer Brands 

Association (formerly Grocery 

Manufacturers Association), 

Food Marketing Institute, and 

National Restaurant Association.

6. DMFI joined the Sustainable 

Packaging Coalition to partner 

with leading packaging suppliers 

and consumer packaged goods 

companies for sustainable 

packaging solutions that deliver 

delicious shelf-stable food.

7. We treated wastewater 

discharged from our agro-

industrial facilities with 

effluent treatment plants.

8. In the last ten years, DMPI 

reduced 3,077 MT of packaging 

materials and generated savings 

of about US$ 2.7 million. Of this, 

we reduced our plastic usage and 

flexible packaging by 800 MT, 

equivalent to a reduced usage 

by 21% and 16.5%, respectively, 

through downgauging.

9. Del Monte pursues packaging 

sustainability goals and 

reduces packaging carbon 

footprint. We implement 

ongoing plastic packaging 

reduction initiatives and have 

set a goal to use biodegradable 

PET bottles by FY2026.

10. Plantation-based families 

segregated domestic solid 

waste in their homes, and 

recyclable materials were sold 

to fund community projects.

CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION 

AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY       

We have undertaken initiatives 

to reduce process residues, 

strengthen energy conservation 

in worksites, and explore more 

efficient energy sources.



1. DMFI mitigated greenhouse gas 

(GHG) emissions and adjusted 

operations and supply chain 

to the potential impact of 

climate change. We minimized 

carbon footprint by locating 

processing plants close to the 

fields where crops are grown.

2. Since 2009, DMFI has installed 

6,400 solar panels covering 

over 37 square kilometers and 

producing 1.2 MW, more than 8% 

of total electricity requirements 

during non-pack season at our 

primary tomato production 

facility in Hanford, California. 

DMFI is a member of the 

Environmental Protection Agency 

(EPA) Green Power Program.

3. Del Monte’s Modesto plant

in personal computers. Technical 

support was also made available 

to the employees for other 

network concerns.

implemented and launched 

policies that are deployed and 

enforced in Data Loss Prevention.

implementations on network 

access control, network 

segmentation, advanced persistent 

threat protection, and encryption.

8. To sustain the program, DMPI

The Del Monte Pacific Ltd. (DMPL) 

Group continued operating as an 

essential industry even during the 

COVID-19 pandemic to address the 

demand for food while ensuring 

the safety of its employees and 

workforce and providing them 

with employment. The impact 

of DMPL extends beyond our 

5,800 plus regular employees and 

includes about 18,300 service 

providers who work in different 

areas of our operations.

In the United States, Del Monte 

Foods, Inc. (DMFI) is one of the 

largest producers, distributors, 

and marketers of premium quality, 

branded fruits, vegetables, and 

tomatoes for the U.S. retail market. 

DMFI contracts with close to 650 

farmers across the U.S. and Mexico, 

which supply about 950,000 tons of 

produce. In aggregate, 100% of the 

tomatoes, 99+% of the vegetables, 

and about 70% of the fruits we 

produce are grown in the U.S., 

while the balance are supplied from

5. Through its due diligence 

process, DMPI ensures that 

the lands it is engaging for 

growership or leases have no 

ownership, environmental, 

human rights, zoning, or taxation 

concerns.  This is done through 

inquiry with the community 

and verification in various 

government offices dealing 

with lands (which include the 

Registry of Deeds, Department 

of Environment and Natural 

Resources, local assessors’ 

offices, Department of Agrarian 

Reform, local zoning officers,

program for all material suppliers 

and toll manufacturers.

7. The objective of the program 

is to align DMPI’s quality 

parameters with suppliers, 

provide performance scorecards, 

classify suppliers into certified, 

preferred, approved, and 

conditional suppliers, and align 

them with DMPI’s goals that will 

support growth in the next five 

years. The program determines 

the allocation of the Company’s 

requirements to suppliers.

Supplier Accreditation During the Pandemic

Customarily, our co-packer’s approval requires on-site visits 

with two-day audits. Gap assessments are done for international 

co-packers’ farm practices, with full QA presence during 

commissioning. Samples are then sent to Walnut Creek R&amp;D and QA 

for approval. 

Due to COVID-19, DMFI initiated a remote document review for 

Brazil, Thailand, and Indonesia. Multiple meetings ensued with co-

packers, R&amp;D, procurement, and other QA resources to meet Del 

Monte’s expectations. Commissioning was held remotely to support 

Del Monte production at the co-manufacturing site.

To alleviate resource constraints in qualifying factories due to 

increases in co-manufacturing activities, DMFI found a subject 

matter expert in Food Safety and Quality in Chile and China to 

conduct audits on behalf of Del Monte. 

Some co-packers insisted on on-site reviewing of Thermal Process 

(TP) Records for Low Acid Canned Food by Del Monte. We found a 

TP expert to audit the process on behalf of Del Monte Foods, and 

gaps that could have compromised Food Safety and our ability to 

meet customer demands were identified. The facility also welcomed 

our input to further improve their process, making it a win-win for 

both parties. We reduced our travel footprint while maintaining our 

supply to our customer and consumer base.

SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK

REPORTING STANDARDS

The Group uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting standards.  

Our Quality Policy, Code of Conduct, Code of Business Ethics and Sustainability, and Environmental Policies help  

us comply with the standards set by the GRI. These are closely monitored and reported, as illustrated throughout  

this report.        



SCOPE AND INCLUSIVE PERIOD

The corporate sustainability 

team leads efforts to increase 

sustainability advocacy among 

stakeholders. Key leaders have also 

been updated on sustainability. 

Each business unit has identified 

its material sustainability issues by 

location which may differ, given 

the business model employed by 

the business units. For example, 

our Philippine company directly 

cultivates its fruits, while our US 

subsidiary uses contract growers to 

source its produce.     

 

This Sustainability Report covers 

our financial year FY2021, from 

May 2020 to April 2021. We have 

excluded our Indian joint venture 

business from this report since its 

contribution to the total business is 

not material.
