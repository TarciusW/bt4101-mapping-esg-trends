SUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW 

AND GOVERNANCE

As one of the leading 

consumer groups in SEA,  

the Board of Fraser and 

Neave, Limited (“F&amp;N” or  

the “Group”) recognises  

the great responsibility the 

Group has in protecting the 

interest of future generations. 

The Board believes that acting 

responsibly is the only way to 

achieve a balance between 

profitable long-term growth 

and protecting our planet  

and people. 

For many years, the Board  

has anchored sustainability 

in its strategy. This is in 

recognition that the Group’s 

success is measured not only 

on its economic achievements, 

but just as important,  

its environmental and social 

successes. Guided by 

sustainable business practices, 

we conduct our business 

with an aim to minimise risks 

for society, environment and 

to ensure longevity of our 

Company. Similarly, we identify 

business opportunities to 

ensure we are sustainable  

for the long-term.

 

At F&amp;N, the Board continues 

to take the lead in F&amp;N’s 

sustainability direction. It has 

tasked the newly reconstituted 

Sustainability and Risk 

Management Committee 

(“SRMC”) with responsibility 

for steering our company- 

wide sustainability 

strategy. The Sustainability 

Development Committee 

(“SDC”), which is made 

up of business CEOs and 

representatives from senior 

management across the F&amp;N 

Group, supports the SRMC, 

and monitors the progress of 

our sustainability reporting 

initiatives. During the year,  

the Board maintained 

oversight over the SRMC and 

SDC, managing sustainability 

risks and opportunities,  

while ensuring all environment, 

social and governance (“ESG”) 

matters significant to our 

business are aligned with  

our Vision 2020.

This is the second year we 

are reporting our sustainability 

performance in accordance 

with the Global Reporting 

Initiative (“GRI”) framework 

and in compliance with 

the Singapore Exchange’s 

(“SGX”) listing rules. We have 

transitioned from the GRI-G4 

guidelines, used in our previous 

sustainability report for FY2017, 

to the GRI Standards. In our 

FY2017 inaugural report,  

we described F&amp;N’s legacy of 

ESG stewardship, set targets 

and provided a report card  

on our sustainability efforts. 

This year, we focus on the 

progress we have made during 

the past year.

Following the materiality review 

conducted last year, we have 

delegated responsibility to 

the SRMC to consider and 

re-validate the ESG factors that 

are of concern to stakeholders 

and significant to F&amp;N’s 

business. During the year, 

further improvements have 

been achieved on several 

targets including our water  

and solid waste intensities.

As we continue to embark  

on the sustainability journey,  

we remain committed to 

building a responsible business 

that delivers sustainable value 

to our stakeholders over the 

long-term.

BOARD STATEMENT


BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

03

This is F&amp;N’s second 

sustainability report, and I 

am delighted to be able to 

introduce the progress we have 

made on our sustainability 

journey over the past year. 

F&amp;N’s vision is to be a stable 

and sustainable Food &amp; 

Beverage leader in the ASEAN 

region, and this report sets out 

many of the ways in which we 

deliver value and care for our 

shared planet.

This report has been prepared 

in accordance with the Global 

Reporting Initiative Standards 

(Core), which represent global 

best practice in sustainability 

reporting. F&amp;N is proud 

to have made a positive 

contribution for the past 135 

years, and fully appreciates 

how financial and non-financial 

success are complementary: 

we take our responsibility to 

make a positive impact in the 

future very seriously.

As you will see on page 15, 

Consumer Health &amp; Safety 

is F&amp;N’s most important 

sustainability topic. We 

understand that the role our 

products play in people’s daily 

lives and activities have been 

evolving. People are now more 

health conscious and pay more 

attention to the health benefits 

and nutrition, ingredients 

and sugar content in their 

food and beverages. We have 

listened to our consumers and 

deliberated on how we can 

better adjust our products to 

accommodate their specific 

needs and requirements. 

The sugar content in our 

products continues to fall, 

and I am proud that we now 

offer healthier choice options 

in 14 out of our 15 product 

categories.

One of the highlights of the 

year for me is seeing the 

bottom-up and innovative 

ways in which F&amp;N employees 

are finding solutions to 

environmental issues, such as 

water use and waste reduction. 

Our “Green Carnivals” and 

“Waste to Wealth Campaign” 

have raised awareness of 

environmental stewardship 

and led to direct performance 

improvements. 2018 has 

been designated as the “Year 

of Climate Change” by the 

Singapore government and we 

are determined to play our  

part in global efforts to reduce 

GHG emissions. For instance, 

we are on track to purchase 

RSPO credits for 100% of our 

palm oil usage by the year 

2020.

F&amp;N places great emphasis 

on being a key part of 

prosperous communities 

in which we operate. This 

includes hiring locally and 

empowering our talent, and 

also sharing happiness and 

helping vulnerable members 

of our communities, wherever 

we can, to make a difference. 

It is reassuring to witness 

the enthusiasm for F&amp;N’s 

sustainability journey  

from employees at all levels. 

F&amp;N’s success is built from 

our own financial performance 

and long-term profitability is 

only possible when we protect 

it through our actions on the 

environment and society. 

F&amp;N is working to collect 

consistent sustainability 

reporting indicators, which will 

allow stakeholders to analyse 

changes in our performance 

over time and facilitate 

comparison with peers.  

The use of the Global 

Reporting Initiative Standards 

is essential for this, and 

we are also taking steps to 

progressively integrate the 

United Nation’s Sustainable 

Development Goals (“SDGs”) 

into our reporting and strategy. 

We are grateful for your 

continued support, and hope 

that this report gives you an 

insight into F&amp;N’s efforts to 

be a sustainability leader in 

ASEAN and beyond.

Fraser and Neave, Limited (“F&amp;N” or the “Group”) originated more than a century 

ago from the spirited decisions of two enterprising young men, John Fraser and 

David Neave, who diversified from their printing business to pioneer the aerated 

water business in Southeast Asia (“SEA”) in 1883. 

The entrepreneurial spirt, embodied by our founders, remains in today’s F&amp;N. 

As a soft drink company, F&amp;N seized the growth opportunities and ventured 

into beer brewing business in 1931 in partnership with The Heineken Company 

and built a very successful beer empire in Asia Pacific – through its joint venture 

company, Asia Pacific Breweries Limited (“APB”). In 1959, it entered the Dairies 

business by forming a canned milk joint venture with Beatrice Foods of Chicago, 

and in 2007, it acquired Nestle’s liquid canned milk business in Thailand, 

Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, and accelerated its growth in the dairy business. 

Today, F&amp;N is the largest canned milk producer in SEA. In 1985, the Group 

diversified into the Properties business. Starting with the redevelopment of its 

soft drinks and brewery sites in Singapore, F&amp;N soon grew its property arm – 

Frasers Centrepoint Limited (“FCL”, now known as Frasers Property Limited) to 

become one of the leading property companies in Singapore with multi-national 

businesses in residential, hospitality, retail, commercial and industrial properties. 

In 2012, F&amp;N divested its equity stake in APB to realise a substantial value for 

shareholders. In 2014, the Group re-listed FCL on the Singapore Stock Exchange, 

thereby realising its latent value. 

Today, F&amp;N is a leading Asia Pacific Consumer Group with expertise and 

prominent standing in the Food &amp; Beverage and Publishing &amp; Printing industries. 

Leveraging its strengths in marketing and distribution, research and development, 

brands and financial management, as well as years of acquisition experience, 

the Group provides key resources and sets strategic directions for its subsidiary 

companies across both industries. 

Listed on the Singapore stock exchange, F&amp;N ranks as one of the most 

established and successful companies in the region with an impressive array  

of renowned brands that enjoy strong market leadership. F&amp;N is present in  

11 countries spanning Asia Pacific, Europe and the USA, and employs over  

7,700 people worldwide.

KEY STAKEHOLDERS’ ENGAGEMENT

F&amp;N strives to build and maintain strong relationships based on trust and respect with our eight key stakeholder groups, namely 

employees, suppliers, customers, investment community, consumers, regulators, non-governmental organisations (“NGOs”) and  

local communities. 

It utilises various platforms for appropriate stakeholder engagement across these eight categories, to ensure that our stakeholders are 

given the opportunity to voice their demands, opinions, concerns and suggestions, as shown in the table below. 

Information received via these channels feeds into our planning and strategy for sustainable value creation.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH


BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

15

Step 1:

IDENTIFICATION

Preliminary issues were identified 

based on a comparative analysis 

conducted of peer companies 

and industry best practices in 

sustainability. These issues were 

discussed with the SDC to distil 

those that were relevant to F&amp;N. 

Subsequently, employees were 

surveyed to obtain their views 

on material issues. From these 

sessions and survey, we crafted 

a list of key issues, opportunities 

and challenges facing F&amp;N.

Step 2: 

PRIORITISATION

To provide weightage to the 

material issues identified in 

Step 1, they were reviewed by 

our CEOs, heads of department 

and directors. This allowed us 

to prioritise the issues according 

to how likely they are to impact 

our business and the extent to 

which they are likely to impact 

our sustainability. Their level of 

importance was thus plotted – 

from moderate to high. 

Step 3: 

VALIDATION

Based on outcome of the 

workshop, we were able to plot 

a preliminary materiality matrix, 

which was then validated by the 

SDC and the Board. The next 

step in this process involves 

obtaining feedback on this report 

from stakeholders. This feedback 

will be used to develop next 

year’s sustainability report.

OUR MATERIAL ISSUES

We undertook our first materiality assessment in January 2017 to identify, prioritise, validate and review relevant sustainability issues. 

Facilitated by an independent sustainability consultant, the exercise involved key internal stakeholders, including the SDC, to identify, 

prioritise and validate ESG factors that are material to F&amp;N’s business operations and of significant interest to our stakeholders.  

This year, the SDC reviewed and revalidated the material ESG factors.

F&amp;N’s SDC revisited the 15 material issues identified last year and confirmed that these topics remain important. The major change 

this year is the increased importance of Talent Management to the business.

The following matrix depicts 15 issues that are seen to be of importance to both F&amp;N and our stakeholders. We have focused on these 

material issues in this report.

TARGET: 

To invest in product and 

process innovation to 

expand our offering of 

nutritious products and 

improve efficiency and 

productivity

Innovation is central to our business, and central to maintaining 

sustainable value creation. This is as true now as at any point 

in our 135-year history. We are continuously leveraging on 

innovation to deliver value through new and unique product 

offerings to meet consumers’ evolving needs toward healthier 

beverage choices, convenience and affordability. Through 

innovation we also improve the operational efficiency of our 

manufacturing processes and better manage our impacts on 

the environment. 

Our Approach 

Our R&amp;D unit, based in 

Singapore with teams in 

Malaysia and Thailand, 

drives the creation of great 

new products that our 

consumers love. The unit also 

leads efforts for continuous 

improvements to our 

manufacturing and logistical 

processes. In this section, 

we share our approach 

and FY2018 highlights of 

delivering consumer-based 

innovation, enhancing process 

innovation and encouraging 

employee-driven innovation.

• Innovation &amp; creation of products and 

packaging based on sensory science 

(a scientific method of measuring and 

interpreting consumers’ response to 

prototypes/products based on the 

senses of taste, smell and touch).

• Scientific advances for application  

in our processes and products.

• Technical developments that support 

quality improvement and cost 

optimisation. 

• Regulatory compliance of our local  

and export business.

• Quality products that meet food safety 

standards.

Process Innovation 

Our R&amp;D teams continuously seek out the most up-to-date technical and scientific advances to 

improve the efficiency of our operations while minimising environmental impacts. Such examples 

over the past year included the implementation of innovative technologies to reduce post-

consumption waste, digitising processes to enhance efficiency and improving fleet efficiency  

and safety. 

Reducing Packaging Material

The new Polyethylene Terephthalate (“PET”) line at the Shah Alam plant has been producing 

100PLUS ACTIVE one litre pack, F&amp;N SEASONS tea range, and OYOSHI since March 2018. 

Employing the latest technology, the new line allows the use of thinner, lightweight containers, 

thereby reducing the use of PET resin packaging material by 40%. The line is also able to maintain 

a sterile environment within the aseptic chambers for 156 consecutive hours, equating to less 

production downtime and eliminating microbial contamination.

The state-of-the-art line also provides for longer product shelf life with less flavour loss and flexibility 

in bottle design due to the ambient filling. The commissioning of the new line will further accelerate 

F&amp;NHB’s expansion into new offerings in the near future. 

Digital Efficiency 

We are continuously seeking opportunities to enhance the efficiency of our processes through the 

use of the latest digital technologies. In July 2018, we implemented electronic proof of delivery 

(“ePOD”) in Malaysia which eliminated the need for our drivers to submit hardcopies of invoices. 

With ePOD, drivers use their smartphones to send signed invoices upon the delivery of goods.  

Our SAP system is updated real-time once our customers receive their product, thereby improving 

the efficiency of our revenue recognition process. 

Improving Fleet Efficiency and Safety 

During the past year, we have made great strides in enhancing the efficiency and safety of our fleet 

management process through improved dispatching. Our Vehicle Management System (“VMS”) 

maximises the usage of warehouse loading bays at our F&amp;NBM factory and assigns each truck with 

its own designated waiting area, thereby increasing safety at the bays as truck traffic is reduced. 

The VMS generates various reports which are used for monitoring purposes, including total trucks 

in the bay per day, total trucks loaded by checker and the duration of loading of trucks by  

bay/checker.

Future-Ready Investments 

We have invested approximately S$70 million in capital expenditures to elevate our product 

innovations and cost competitiveness. Process innovation projects implemented included: 

- 600bpm water line, Shah Alam

- Sweetened condensed milk pouch &amp; tube filling line, Rojana

- Combi blow, mould &amp; filling machine, Shah Alam

- Cold aseptic PET line &amp; warehouse, Shah Alam

WAO is an annual convention in Thailand to promote continuous improvement in 

productivity, quality, cost, delivery, safety, ethics and environment and create innovative 

cost-savings initiatives.

Held on 6th July 2018, this convention has successfully identified solutions which will 

result in a cost savings of THB14 million (approximately S$600,000) per year. 

Themed “Step into World Class Manufacturing”, F&amp;N Dairies Thailand is determined to 

maintain an excellence performance and continual development towards being the best in 

Innovation in the Food and Beverages industry.

This year’s convention involved more than 200 people and served as a conducive platform 

for employees to share their best practices with their colleagues from F&amp;NHB Malaysia and 

Thai Beverage.

The winning team this year devised a systematic approach to reduce machine breakdown 

at KLIKLOK Line 2. They analysed breakdown by using QC technique to find out root 

causes and set action plan to reduce breakdown of KLIKLOK machine. Through the project, 

machine efficiency has increased from 90% to 92%.



Employee-driven Innovation 

At F&amp;NHB, employees are encouraged to improve their current work practices through process 

and product innovation. At the “Winning as One” convention (running for the past eleven years in 

Thailand) and the “Excel as One” convention (running for the past four years in Malaysia), various 

teams present their ideas on enhancing productivity, cost savings and/or product quality. This year,  

the teams presented innovations that would improve productivity and deliver cost savings totaling 

approximately S$3 million per annum.

The annual EAO convention in Malaysia took place on 5th September 2018. Our theme 

this year was “Transformation of Manufacturing Innovation Excellence Towards World 

Class Quality &amp; Lowest Cost”. The theme is a continuation of last year’s: “Manufacturing 

Excellence towards Lean and Innovation”. Ahead of the convention, participants presented 

initiatives that would enhance quality and reduce resource consumption, resulting in lower 

costs and increased competitiveness. 

There were 225 participants from our F&amp;N Dairies Manufacturing in Pulau Indah and F&amp;N 

Beverages Manufacturing located in Shah Alam, Bentong &amp; East Malaysia. The teams 

generated innovative ideas and lean practices that can be incorporated into our daily 

activities. Such as managing water consumption through the installation of automatic  

water-level control valves in the feed tank. 

The total cost savings of the initiatives identified by the teams that participated at the 2018  

EAO convention is about S$3 million per annum.

The winning team of Innovative Creative Circle this year successfully reduced the downtime 

of flanging section at Pulau Indah plant from four hours to one hour, saving about S$73,000. 

Their innovation will also help to reduce the rejection of materials during production.

F&amp;N’s human resources policies go beyond labour regulations and statutory requirements in our countries of operation.  

Management engages actively with union leaders for balanced collective agreements.

 

It is important for us to be the local employer of choice, and wherever possible to hire local staff from within the communities in 

which we operate. We are proud that 100%, 97% and 100% of our senior management in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand 

respectively are hired from the local community.

3. Recognition-based performance management

 

Employees collaborate with their supervisors to set SMART goals and KPIs for the year. F&amp;N facilitate clear and honest 

communication; goals and indicators are set initially at Group level and then cascaded down to teams and individual employees.  

A Performance Assessment Review takes place twice a year, to appraise outcomes and identify development opportunities.

 

Our policy is to support the provision of ‘Limitless Opportunities’ to employees from the moment they join the company, and our 

Beverest platform supports Individual Development Plans (“IDP”). 

4. Holistic high performer retention and development

 

We give every employee the opportunity to grow with the company and contribute to a high-performing, sustainable organisation.  

It is part of the culture at F&amp;N that each employee is supported to implement their IDP using the 70/20/10 Learning Model:

We have found the 70/20/10 Learning Model to be the most effective style of learning for our employees.

Our courses offered can be grouped into four categories: 

• Leadership Competency Development – for all employees in accordance with the 5 levels of leadership namely:

- Responsibility

- Relationships

- Result

- Regeneration

- Respect

• Core Competency Development – development of necessary management skills with the aim of improving the capacity of 

employees in core areas such as communication, collaboration and creation.

• General Skills Development – improving the skills of employees at all levels and fields, such as computer skills and English 

language skills.

• Functional Competency Development – for employees in each business and units to learn specifically in relation to their own 

agency and business.

5. Proactive succession and workforce planning

 

Through our annual Talent Review and Succession Planning process, we identify employees who can be future leaders at F&amp;N. 

Working alongside the Talent Management team, these employees chart individual career development pathways to ensure they 

are in the best position to succeed at a high level. 

 

Talent management is closely linked with succession planning, and in combination provide us with a steady pipeline of future 

leaders who are able to support our business needs. Our ‘Future-Ready Manager Program’ (described below) is our executive 

workforce planning approach and it includes a combination of external recruitment and nurture of existing talent.

6. Engaging corporate culture

 

F&amp;N promotes a culture of engagement and inclusion. At the heart of this are our Global Values, which epitomise that the best 

outcomes happen when we work together.

Senior management regularly engage with all employees through various channels such as: town hall meetings and briefings;  

CEO “teh-tarik” sessions; quarterly CEO messages; intranet updates; and employee newsletters. 

F&amp;N organises a wide range of activities to promote engagement and support healthy lifestyles. Employees are encouraged  

to partake in sports and other physical activities through membership of internal sports clubs. We also organise badminton,  

golf tournaments and yoga classes for our employees.







Since 2003, F&amp;NHB has been presenting a Chairman’s Award to deserving children of employees. The award is an employee 

appreciation initiative and provides motivation for their children to strive for excellence. A total of about S$94,000 in cash was 

awarded to 139 recipients this financial year. To date, F&amp;NHB has disbursed nearly S$1.3 million to over 2,100 children under  

the programme.

7. Strategic talent acquisition and onboarding

 

Our preference at F&amp;N is to promote from within and develop the excellent talent already available to us. Where this is not 

possible, our Human Capital team ensures that we are able to recruit external applicants with abilities and experience that match 

the company’s needs. 

 

Our ‘Future-Ready Manager Program’ describes the way that we replenish and grow our pool of future executives. We use a  

variety of assessment tools as part of a rigorous process to recruit the very best candidates. As soon as they join the company,  

the successful candidates begin a formal two-year program to get a wide variety of experience.

Market Presence 

F&amp;N hiring practices are aligned with the 

interests of the local community, and we 

are determined to become the employer  

of choice in markets we operate. 

Our compensation packages are regularly reviewed and 

updated to be competitive with market benchmarks. 

Remuneration packages have been standardised across 

the Group to ensure that the highest expectations are 

being embodied across our operations. These standards 

are strictly maintained, but are also reviewed frequently 

enough to allow for necessary adaptations with particular 

local circumstances. 

We make sure that our business stimulates the local 

economy through prioritising local employment where 

possible. Currently, 100% of our senior management 

in Singapore and Thailand and 97% of our senior 

management in Malaysia are local.

At F&amp;N, we strive to enhance social well-being 

through our community outreach programmes 

as well as by developing products and

and nutrition. In the next section, we detailed 

our commitment and initiatives to protect and

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

OUR APPROACH 

We communicate regularly with our neighbours to understand local communities’ needs. To that 

end, we have developed four main thematic areas where we focus our community endeavours:

TARGET: 

We will continue to provide 

outreach and engagement 

programmes across 

Singapore, Malaysia and 

Thailand by exploring and 

implementing appropriate 

outreach programmes in 

accordance with community 

needs.

At F&amp;N, we believe that sustainable business growth occurs 

when our communities grow alongside us. This means that we 

aim to make positive impacts on our communities and that we 

strategise our endeavours to create value where the needs of 

our business intersect with the needs of society. 

F&amp;N works 

towards a more 

equal society.

We have taken 

the task of 

promoting 

environmental 

consciousness in 

our communities.

1)  Protecting and Helping Vulnerable Groups

 

Inequality of opportunity has emerged as a major 

global challenge in recent years. Our consumers 

and employees come from all segments of society 

and inequality undermines the development and 

potential of both our business and our communities. 

To take leadership in tackling this issue, we have 

chosen to focus on helping vulnerable groups such as 

underprivileged children and the disabled around our 

operational areas. Through investing in educational 

programs – including both technical skills and soft skills 

– and donating vital movement tools for the disabled, 

F&amp;N works towards a more equal society where the 

growth of business and society together flourish.

2) Promoting Environmental Consciousness

 

 While companies have a critical role to play in 

minimising our environmental footprints and mitigating 

climate change impacts, sustainable development 

cannot be achieved by companies alone without 

behavioural changes at the individual level.  

Besides maintaining eco-efficiency in our operations 

(see pg. 52-77), we have taken the task of promoting 

environmental consciousness in our communities 

as another priority to address in order to maintain 

sustainability.

We aim to 

make positive 

impacts on our 

communities.

We aim to

We also see sports 

and physical 

activity as key 

to maintaining a 

healthy lifestyle.

3) Sponsoring Festive Celebrations

 

In addition to basic needs and environmental sustainability, our community 

development programme includes a priority that is signature to our brand. As the 

promise of our brand is to deliver “Pure Enjoyment, Pure Goodness” to all, we have 

developed initiatives to sponsor festive celebrations in our communities. Here, we 

aim to promote diversity and celebrate various cultures through ensuring that our 

sponsorships reach a variety of vulnerable groups.

 As one of the F&amp;B leading players in this region, F&amp;N’s products have direct impacts 

on the health of our consumers. It is our duty to encourage responsible consumption. 

This is mostly accomplished through a production process that is centered on 

consumer health, well-being, and safety (see pg. 78-81). However, we also see sports 

and physical activity as key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. We thus prioritise 

community investments that support sports and active lifestyles to better care for our 

consumers while also creating value for communities.

1) Protecting and Helping Vulnerable Groups

SINGAPORE

With a rapidly ageing population, we appreciate the importance 

of looking out for the elderly population in Singapore. During the 

past year, our employees continued to volunteer their time to 

bring joy to elders in our communities.

ASSISI Fun Day

A total of 40 volunteers consisting of F&amp;N staff from 

Singapore, family members and friends spent the 24th June 

morning with 30 seniors from Lions Befrienders at the Assisi 

Fun Carnival to raise funds for Assisi Hospice. 

The volunteers accompanied the seniors from Lions 

Befrienders’ branch at Mei Ling Senior Activity Centre. 

Each senior was given vouchers worth $100 to buy food, 

drinks, apparels, handicrafts, shoes, books and many other 

interesting items from stalls at the Carnival.





Terrarium Workshop with Seniors

F&amp;N staff from Singapore engaged with seniors from the 

Lions Befrienders Services Association in the morning of 

29th September through an engaging and fun filled terrarium 

making workshop.

A terrarium, also known as a glass garden, is a collection of 

small plants growing in a transparent sealed container. It is 

a closed environment and can be used to illustrate how an 

ecosystem works.

About 30 seniors participated in this workshop learning to 

make their own terrarium. They were able to take home their 

terrarium to remind them of this day.

GoGuru and Times Book Donation Drive

To promote reading in school-aged children, TIMES collaborated 

with World Vision Singapore and GoGuru to organise a book donation 

drive for Big Heart Student Care Centre, a non-profit organisation 

and beneficiary of TIMES Publishing Group that provides affordable, 

quality-after school care for students from all walks of life.

Together with contributions from book-loving communities, 

TIMES Publishing Group collected approximately 1,150 children’s 

books to help furnish the libraries of Big Heart Student Care 

Centres across Singapore. 

MALAYSIA

KidsLIFE Program

From March through November 2018, employees of F&amp;N 

Creameries Malaysia (“F&amp;NCM”) volunteered their time to 

facilitate activities for KidsLIFE, which provides children from 

urban and low-income families with financial literacy skills and 

life skills enhancement programs.

F&amp;NCM sponsored ice cream, as well as rewards and gifts for  

the children, including schooling materials, home appliances  

and vouchers to be shared with the family.

Approximately 1,150 

children’s books were 

collected to help furnish 

the libraries of Big Heart 

Student Care Centres 

across Singapore. 



During the past year F&amp;NHB continued its annual programmes 

with the International Computer Driving Licence (“ICDL”), 

Kassim Chin Humanity Foundation (“KCHF”) and Rumah Ilham. 

International Computer Driving Licence (“ICDL”) Programme

While information technology (“IT”) skills are increasingly in 

demand, only a limited number of schools can afford to provide 

computer literacy programmes. F&amp;NHB sees this as a major 

gap in community development and has initiated partnership 

with ICDL, the world’s leading computer skills certification, to 

provide these necessary twenty-first century skills to Malaysia’s 

underprivileged youth. To date, more than 389 at Montfort Town 

have gained the certification through the ICDL Programme.

Over the past year, the Montfort ICDL programme accepted  

46 students in Shah Alam and 33 students in Melaka. This was 

an increase in the number of registered students from last year 

in both locations. 20 students received certification in Graphic 

Design and Multimedia, while 15 students graduated in the field 

of Computer Maintenance. Additionally, the past year also saw 

the Contact Center Association of Malaysia (“CCAM”) expressed 

interest in the program. CCAM has since joined the partnership 

through providing support with arranging job placements within 

the contact center industry. Out of 27 students interviewed, 

seven have successfully received job offers.

Kassim Chin Humanitarian Foundation (“KCHF”) Programme

In partnership with the KCHF, we have continued to support 

vulnerable young people through the Empowering Lives 

Through Education (“E.L.I.T.E.”) programme for the seventh 

year. Through this programme, free kindergarten and tuition 

classes are given to underprivileged children in Pangsapuri 

Enggang, Puchong. 

To date, a total of 442 children have benefitted from the 

F&amp;NHB E.L.I.T.E. programme (223 between five to six years 

old and 219 between seven to seventeen years old). 

This year, F&amp;NHB also provided financial support of about 

S$6,700 to refurbish the classrooms, to repair the cabling and  

air-conditioners and give the wall fresh coat of painting.

Rumah Ilham Programme

While F&amp;NHB has been partnering with the social enterprise 

Leaderonomics since 2015 to sponsor leadership programs 

for children from the Rumah Ilham home, 2018 saw new 

developments in this partnership. This year, 42 children 

participated in a two-day, one-night leadership camp. Acting 

as trainers, these children applied their knowledge and skills 

acquired from the camp into organising leadership development 

programme for children from KAFA Integrasi Hidayatul Islamiah 

Kampung Baru Hicom, aged between nine and twelve years old.

F&amp;NHB has so far invested about S$74,500 in the program 

benefitting over 170 children who are now more confident and 

better prepared to contribute in a meaningful way to society.





WHEN NATURAL DISASTER STRIKES…

November 2017 Kelantan Floods 

In November 2017, the floods in Kelantan displaced 

over 14,000 Malaysians. While we do not currently 

have natural disasters as a strategic priority for our 

community investments, we consider it our duty to respond 

appropriately when the well-being of our communities has 

been compromised. F&amp;NHB supported the flood relieve 

efforts by giving away products to seven relief centres in 

Kelantan, communities within Pasir Tumpat and Kuala Krai 

in Kelantan.

Reaching out to:

- Seven relief centres in Ketereh, Gual Periok, Rantou 

Panjang, Alor Pasir and Bunut Susu

- About 2,000 families (about 5,500 people)

- Donated over 1,000 cartons of products of about S$6,500

2) Promoting Environmental Consciousness 

SINGAPORE 

Recycle and be Rewarded 

F&amp;N, FairPrice, Malls of Frasers Property and InconGreen 

embarked on a joint effort to encourage Singaporeans to adopt an 

eco-conscious lifestyle by offering them the convenience of recycling 

used cans and bottles with the help of ‘reverse vending machines’.

Consumers and shoppers joined in the programme to recycle 

used cans and bottles at their convenience at the reverse 

vending machines located in the Waterway Point shopping mall. 

To encourage consumers and shoppers to form the habit of 

recycling, the machine is designed to reward them when they 

recycle every five used containers. The programme has since 

been extended to include two other locations.

With the launch of this initiative, F&amp;N reinforced its commitment 

to play a part in protecting the environment by ensuring that its 

packaging is environmentally friendly and by encouraging and 

rewarding consumers who recycle cans and bottles.

Tzu Chi Foundation’s Recycling Mission

As part of F&amp;N’s recycling outreach programme in 

Singapore, the company supports the Tzu Chi Foundation’s 

community recycling mission. Tzu Chi Singapore established 

its first recycling point in Jurong East in 1999. Today, there 

are 39 community recycling points island-wide and an  

Eco-Awareness Centre, where volunteers young and old 

work together tirelessly to protect the environment. F&amp;N also 

supported the foundation’s annual Eco Charity Fair which 

was held on 27th and 28th January 2018.





MALAYSIA 

School Recycling Programs 

F&amp;NHB has been partnering with schools across Malaysia, 

since 2007, to educate the next generation on the importance 

of recycling and promote the preservation of the planet. F&amp;NHB 

sponsors a recycling competition between schools nationwide,  

with prizes ranging from S$70 – S$400. Over the past year, 

F&amp;NHB has expanded this programme to schools in Subang 

Jaya, Melaka Tengah, Perlis, Ampang Jaya, and Petaling Jaya.

ENHANCING SOCIAL WELL-BEING

Recycling with Schools 

F&amp;N works with environmental clubs at local schools to educate 

and raise awareness of the importance of recycling. Students 

learn first-hand how simple and easy it is to recycle with the 

help of the recycling can and PET bottle crusher from F&amp;N. 

The initiative began in November 2017, with the first round of 

activation at polytechnics and the local universities. To date, 

F&amp;N has collaborated with students from Temasek Polytechnic, 

Nanyang Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Republic 

Polytechnic, Singapore University of Technology and Design 

(“SUTD”) and Nanyang Technological University (“NTU”). 



Save Our Seas (“SOS”) – Malaysia 

To raise environmental awareness within F&amp;NHB, marine 

conservation initiatives that engage employees are organised. 

Since 2011, F&amp;NHB has been conducting reef rehabilitation 

initiatives in Redang Island through collecting coral fragments 

from donor sites, planting them in nursery sites, then 

transplanting them in natural permanent sites. 

The company also engages the local community, resort 

operators, tourists, and schools to promote awareness about 

human impacts on marine ecosystems.

THAILAND

Save Our Seas (“SOS”) – Thailand 

At F&amp;NDT, we raise environmental awareness through our  

employees and their families. In the past year, 30 employees and  

family members participated in a trip on marine conservation at 

Samae-San Sattahip District in Chonburi Province.



“Employees and family members learned about the 

importance of marine conservation and were trained on 

making Staghorn coral frames with PVC pipes through a 

session with Professor Prasarn Sangpaiboon, an expert on 

Artificial Coral Reef Restoration.”

Community Chest Fu Dai 2018

Chinese New Year is the season to celebrate and share good 

fortune and happiness with family, friends and those in need of a 

good cheer. This Chinese New Year, F&amp;N and 20 staff volunteers 

helped spread joy to lonely seniors and the less fortunate at 

Mei Ling Senior Activity Centre in Singapore. This was done in 

partnership with and in support of Community Chest. 

Staff volunteers from F&amp;N brought smiles to seniors who live alone. 

Volunteers delivered over 200 fortune bags across five blocks 

in Mei Ling street to the less fortunate in the spirit of caring and 

sharing. Each bag was filled with Chinese New Year goodies and 

essential items such as rice, biscuits and condiments.

Income Eco Run 2018

Income Eco Run 2018 was Southeast Asia’s premier eco-run 

which championed environmental conservation and aimed to 

encourage everyone to play their part in supporting the cause. 

The run took place on Sunday, 29th April 2018, at the F1 Pit 

Building, and included categories in 21.1km, 10km, 5km, 1.2km 

and 800m. Organisers encouraged runners to sign up as a ‘Zero 

Waste Runner’ and to pledge to be eco-friendly. 



HSBC Rugby Sevens

The world’s best rugby sevens teams came to Singapore for the 

third edition of the HSBC Singapore Rugby Sevens, which took 

place on 28-29 April at the Singapore National Stadium. 100PLUS 

has been a sponsor of the HSBC Rugby Sevens since 2016.



100PLUS activated a 360 VR experiential booth where fans could 

experience training with rugby legends and were encouraged to 

“Outdo Yourself” by surpassing their own high score. After the VR 

experience, participants were given a cup of 100PLUS to rehydrate 

and replenish their energy and electrolytes for their efforts. 

Race entitlements as a ‘Zero Waste Runner’ differed from other 

participants. For example, the 21.1km half marathon runners 

did not receive a finisher tee or medal in order to reduce the 

production waste.

100PLUS has been a sponsor of the Income Eco Run (previously 

known as Run 350) since 2015.

MALAYSIA

In 2018, F&amp;NHB continued its annual sponsorships of golf, 

badminton, and football athletes and sports events across Malaysia.

Sponsoring Local Athletes

We believe that the presence of successful Malaysian athletes 

can serve to inspire others towards pursuing healthy and active 

lifestyles. Our support for the skill development and success of 

local athletes have continued over the past year. 

Since 2003, 100PLUS is the official partner for all Badminton 

Association Malaysia (“BAM”) events and activities, including the 

Malaysian Open and Malaysian Masters.

Sponsoring Active Lifestyle Events

We regularly sponsor active lifestyle events across Malaysia. In 

2018, F&amp;NHB sponsored sports competitions and tournaments 

such as the 100PLUS National Junior Grand Prix Finals and 

Badminton Association Malaysia events, as well as events open 

to the public such as the 19th Sukan Malaysia (“SUKMA”) sports 

events and the 100PLUS Day. 

The 19th SUKMA events included a total of 427 events across 

12 districts and garnered the participation of 8,000 athletes and 

4,000 officials and volunteers. 



Meanwhile, the 100PLUS Day had a total of 10,000 participants 

participating in activities ranging from a Zumba session to a 5km 

Inflatable Obstacle Fun Run.









To support women’s sports, F&amp;NHB also sponsored the 2018 

Asian Football Confederation Women’s Football Day. 

While the annual event has been organised since 2014, this year 

included an initiative to showcase women in football across Asia 

called the “It’s My Game” campaign.

F&amp;N is committed to developing products 

and undertaking initiatives that promote 

food safety, nutrition and health. The F&amp;N 

Nutrition Charter guides us in product 

development, marketing communications and 

initiatives to advocate healthy lifestyles. 

Towards Healthier Options

Our commitment towards developing healthy and nutritious 

products is evidenced by our focus on R&amp;D efforts to innovate 

healthier options for our consumers (see pg. 24-30). In FY2018, 

we have continued to reduce sugar content in our products.

Bear Brand collaborated with Thai Red Cross Society during 

blood donation drives from January through February 2018.  

The objective of this initiative was to spread awareness 

about the nutritional importance of folate, especially on 

women’s health. Folate is not only important for pregnancy,  

it also helps in red blood cell formation. During this exercise, 

a total of 55,000 servings of Bear Brand Sterilised Milk Hi 

Folate were handed out.

Promoting an Active Lifestyle

We believe that living an active lifestyle is important to staying 

healthy. Our approach focuses on supporting professional 

athletes in their skill development and competition as well as 

organising and supporting sports events for the general public.  

We have shared some highlights in the ‘Creating Value for 

Society’ section of this report (pg. 48-49). 

During the year, we have introduced non-carbonated 100PLUS 

ACTIVE sachets. This allows travellers to stay hydrated by 

providing the same 100PLUS goodness on-the-go. Malaysian 

national athletes used the sachets when they competed in the 

2018 Commonwealth Games.



Spreading Nutritional Awareness

All F&amp;N products are labelled and advertised responsibly (see 

pg. 82-83) to promote healthy choices. We also have conducted 

initiatives to spread nutritional awareness in addition to our 

regular marketing and communication.

Stepping up Hydration with 

100PLUS

Following the success of 

National Steps Challenge™ 

(“NSC”) Season 2, Singapore’s 

HPB launched the NSC Season 

3, which ran from 28th October 

2017 to 30th April 2018. 

The NSC was a nationwide 

movement aimed at getting 

Singaporeans to be physically 

active by walking 10,000 steps 

every day. By tracking the 

number of steps using mobile 

apps or HPB-issued steps 

tracker, participants were able 

to earn points for shopping and 

grocery vouchers.

As HPB’s main partner of this 

event and a strong advocate 

for active lifestyles, 100PLUS 

rolled out a series of marketing 

events to remind Singaporeans 

to be physically active every 

day, anytime and anywhere. 

Across 200 locations, 100PLUS 

promoted its message by 

placing posters at bus shelters 







to encourage bus commuters  

to walk instead of taking the 

bus. Commuters were also 

reminded to keep their bodies 

hydrated with 100PLUS.  

In addition, 100PLUS launched 

the ‘100PLUS Longest Steps 

Movement Campaign’ to 

motivate Singaporeans to 

adopt a more active lifestyle; 

participants were encouraged 

to take a 5-second video 

of their steps and upload it 

to social medial using the 

hashtags #100PLUSsg and 

#100PLUSStepsChallenge.

In conjunction with the NSC, 

The New Paper Big Walk 

2017 returned to the National 

Stadium for a fun-filled 

morning on 26th November 

2017. Participants walked 

the 8.5km or approximately 

10,000 steps long route that 

stretched from the Singapore 

Sports Hub to the iconic 

Singapore Flyer and back. 

Multiple 100PLUS hydration 

points were made available 

along the way to help the 

participants during the walk. 

We also set up an interactive 

station called the ‘100PLUS 

Steps Challenge Machine’ 

at the race village, which 

challenged walkers to clock in 

100 steps within 30 seconds to 

win a chance to redeem a free 

100PLUS goodie bag.

MANAGING IMPACTS AND 

CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN  

A RESPONSIBLE MANNER

We described many of the ways in which we deliver economic 

and social value in the earlier sections of this report. This section 

of the report sets out the main ways in which F&amp;N ensure 

sustainable value creation by minimising environmental costs 

associated with our operations. We talk about our responsible 

supply chain and the safety &amp; wellbeing of our employees and 

consumers, but we begin with eco-efficiency. (Eco) efficiency 

refers to the act of maximising benefits and minimising 

(ecological) costs. As part of our materiality assessment, we have 

identified four main issues in relation to our eco-efficiency efforts:

1. Water Stewardship

2. Effluents and Waste

3. Packaging

4. Energy and Climate Change

We implement environmentally sustainable business practices 

in alignment with F&amp;N’s core values, and all employees are at all 

times guided by our Environmental Policy.

Our Approach

Within the guidance of our Environmental Policy, we are 

committed to responsible water stewardship. Our integrated 

approach includes: efficiency measures; the safe return of 

wastewater from our operations; and mitigating risk in partnership 

with local communities. It also includes responsible sourcing of 

raw materials, which is described in a later chapter.

Water is a fundamental element of our products, and our 

business is dependent on a reliable water supply. A lack of 

effective water management can therefore have serious financial 

implications, especially in areas with high water stress. We have  

TARGET: 

To reduce the  

water intensity ratio  

by 5% from 2017  

by 2020.

Many countries face water stress in recent years, and the 

effects of climate change are likely to exacerbate such problems 

in the future. All life is dependent on safe and accessible  

water to survive and F&amp;N has a duty to manage our water  

use responsibly. 

a range of water assessment and action policies that are 

applied across our facilities. This includes: daily monitoring of 

consumption; the recovery of effluent water using ultrafiltration; 

and the collection and use of rainwater. 

A localised approach to water management is essential.  

We look beyond our own operations and act collectively with 

other stakeholders in each of the regions in which we operate. 

We seize every opportunity and carry out various initiatives to 

reduce water consumption so as to meet our 2020 water  

intensity target. 

F&amp;NHB has identified that water consumption can be reduced 

during the can warmer procedure in the production phase and 

this can be achieved through recovering water usage from the 

can rinser and twister phase. Previously, water from the can 

rinser and can twister phase are drained out after it has been 

used in this process. A water recovery system has since been 

installed and implemented to reuse water from the can rinser and 

twister phase so that it can be reused in the can warming phase, 

hence reducing water consumption and costs significantly.

Steam loss during the production phase is an area where we can 

reduce water consumption, most notably in the pasteurisation 

phase through steam trap replacement and appropriate piping 

system. Steam header automatic valves have also been installed 

at various points to reduce steam loss. This initiative has 

contributed significantly to water consumption reduction targets 

and cost savings.

F&amp;NHB has just started 

on this initiative. Results 

will be shared in the next 

Sustainability Report.

Rain Harvesting System

F&amp;NHB will soon be implementing a rainwater harvesting system

FY2018 Performance Highlights

Over the past year, our water intensity ratio xx due to our capital investments at F&amp;NDT (one-off water use for new machine 

installations) and in Malaysia (including a new cold aseptic line). In Thailand, we have also been experimenting with a new cleaning-

in-place process for our TEAPOT Squeeze tube, which has temporarily increased water intensity. Nevertheless, we are still committed 

to achieve our 2020 water consumption reduction targets.

TARGET: 

To reduce solid waste 

intensity ratio by 5% 

from 2017 by 2020

The Food &amp; Beverage manufacturing process involves the 

generation of liquid wastes (effluents) and solid waste,  

but there are also numerous ways to avoid and recycle waste.  

We continuously strive to reduce solid waste and wastewater  

from operations, and this means complying with and going 

beyond relevant regulations. 

Our Approach

Under the guidance of our Environment Policy and the 5Rs 

philosophy, we are committed to reduce, reuse, recycle, rethink 

and reinvent. The concept of a ‘circular economy’ is certainly 

a reinvention of the traditional economic system, and F&amp;N is 

exploring opportunities to regenerate materials and energy as 

part of a closed loop system.

We are committed to meeting our waste reduction targets by 

2020 and the company has been implementing best practice  

at all of our operating sites. This includes: 

• improving production processes to reduce waste production;  

• separating recyclable waste to add value such as packaging;

• separating recyclable waste to general waste before being sent 

to landfills; and

• providing general environmental awareness through 

communication platforms to raise awareness of employees. 

Indeed, information and advice about these practices are 

cascaded to all employees who are encouraged to contribute to 

waste reduction targets. Nevertheless, our packaging recycling 

commitments do not compromise the safety of our products as 

Consumer Health and Safety is our top priority. 

Our operations at F&amp;NDT and Malaysia are leading the way and 

are committed to achieving zero effluents and solid waste. One 

way we do this is by converting sludge from production into 

organic fertiliser, which is then distributed to  

local farmers.

Okara waste from soy extraction at our 

beverages production are converted into  

animal feed.

Wastewater from our industrial effluent 

treatment plant in Malaysia is treated and 

reused (for cleaning, toilet flushing, utilities 

and other functional purposes). 

Rejected water from our Thai water treatment 

plant and boiler is transferred to a pond for 

watering of grass and plants.

We continuously strive to reduce solid 

waste and wastewater from operations.

F&amp;NHB Go Green++

F&amp;NHB launched Green Carnivals in July 2018 and toured a number of our plants in Malaysia during July and August. The activities 

for the carnival were designed to be a fun way to improve behaviour, including a workshop about upcycling (creative reuse) of waste 

items. It also included display booths about: 

• Recycling carton boxes (run by Tetra Pak Malaysia); 

• Recycling industrial waste into useful materials, for example turning sludge into fertiliser;

• Reusing waste fabrics to make clothing such as towels and scarfs; and

• The company’s sustainability commitments and initiatives.

More than 75,000 kilograms of recyclables were collected (an average of 39 kilograms per employee) throughout the 6-month 

program. We have also seen a significant increase in employees’ knowledge on 5R philosophy and proper recycling.





The Green Carnival is part of the F&amp;NHB Go Green++ Program that aims to generate greater awareness of applying the 5Rs 

philosophy (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rethink and Reinvent).

PERCENTAGE OF SOLID WASTE RECYCLED AT PULAU INDAH PLANT

Waste to Wealth Campaign

The F&amp;NDT Pulau Indah Sustainability Team has launched the ‘Waste to Wealth Campaign 2018’ which focuses on the importance of 

recycling waste at the workplace. This campaign emphasises that contributions from all employees can play a vital role in the overall 

waste reduction for F&amp;N and help to meet the 2020 targets.

This campaign was initiated with a mini exhibition set up to display how waste generated from the production phase can be recycled 

and generated into new products. The display included organic fertilisers (dairy sludge), carton boxes that were recycled and 

reused for packaging purposes, and metal plates made from recycled F&amp;N metal cans. These innovative solutions were available for 

employees to observe and build understanding.

All operating sites have ensured that recycling bins, compost bins and general waste bins have been distributed and are accessible to 

all employees, including clear illustrations on how to categorise and segregate each waste type. As a result of this campaign, our plant 

in Pulau Indah have achieved 100% recycling rate of its solid waste this year, effectively become the first manufacturing facility within 

F&amp;N Group to achieve zero waste (non-hazardous waste).

3 

COD is the measure of the amount of oxygen required to oxidise soluble and 

particulate organic matter in water. It provides an index to assess the effect 

discharged water would have on the receiving environment. Higher COD levels 

mean a greater amount of oxidisable organic matter which will reduce dissolved 

oxygen (“DO”) levels. Low DO levels are harmful to higher aquatic life forms. 

4 

BOD is the amount of DO bacteria will consume to break down organic material 

present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time 

period. As with the COD, the higher the BOD, the less able the water body is to 

support healthy aquatic life. 

5 

Total Suspended Solids (“TSS”) is the dry-weight of particles trapped by a filter. 

It is a water quality parameter used to assess the quality of wastewater after 

treatment in a wastewater treatment plant.

PACKAGING 

As a major food &amp; beverage manufacturer, 

we recognise our responsibility to reduce 

the environmental impact of packaging.

Our Approach

We adopt a two-pronged approach to reduce the 

environmental impacts of our packaging:

Use more recycled 

materials as an  

input for our 

packaging

Ensure that more of our 

packaging is reusable 

and recyclable for our 

own customers

1

2

In the ‘Innovation’ section of this report, we outlined 

that one of our priorities for innovation is to improve the 

environmental performance of our packaging.

Our packaging materials are sourced based on the 

ability to support our product specifications. We regularly 

evaluate the potential for new packaging materials and 

processes. For example, the new aseptic cold-fill line at 

Shah Alam in Malaysia reduces the PET resin packaging 

material for our products (including 100PLUS ACTIVE 

and OYOSHI). Because containers are thinner and  

lighter, PET resin use has been reduced by up to 40%.  

In addition, the products have a longer shelf life, leading  

to less waste.

We regularly 

evaluate the 

potential for 

new packaging 

materials and 

processes.

FY2018 Performance Highlights

The emergence of plastic waste as a significant environmental 

issue means that we are reassessing our approach.

Other initiatives in Malaysia include reducing the weight of 

aluminium cans and PET bottles for our beverages. Our beverage 

plants in Malaysia have reduced the weight of PET bottles 

(500ml, 600ml and 1.5L) and water cap, and this has helped  

to save material usage by about 70 MT this year. 

In Singapore, there is the initiative to replace the packing of  

F&amp;N MAGNOLIA 250ml bottles from corrugated cardboard 

tray to corrugated plastic tray. Currently, the yearly usage for 

corrugated cardboard trays on 250ml F&amp;N MAGNOLIA bottles 

are estimated to be about 7,300 pieces (equal to around 1,800kg 

or 1.8 tons of cardboard). This is an equivalent of more than  

30 trees being sacrificed every year. Switching to corrugated 

plastic tray helps F&amp;N to play our part in contributing towards 

saving the forest and preserving our nature for future generations. 

Corrugated plastic trays are also recyclable and reusable so as  

to minimise wastage.

TARGET:

To reduce energy 

intensity ratio by 5% 

from 2017 by 2020

TARGET: 

To reduce greenhouse 

gas intensity ratio by 

5% from 2017 by 2020

Climate change is one of the global challenges of the 

21st century. We are committed to reducing our energy 

consumption and GHG emissions intensity, as one of the main 

priorities for our 2020 Vision. We also have a responsibility 

to help minimise carbon footprints across our value chain, 

ranging from manufacturing, packaging, storage and logistics, 

to end use and disposal.

Our Approach

Singapore has pledged to reduce the Emissions Intensity 

(“EI”) by 36%, from 2005 levels by 2030, and to reach 

peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Malaysia’s 

government has targeted a 45% reduction in GHG 

intensity by 2030 from a 2005 baseline and Thailand has 

a reduction target of 30% by 2036 from a 2010 baseline. 

F&amp;N takes its role in these efforts very seriously, and we 

have an initial target: between 2017 and 2020, we aim to 

reduce energy and GHG intensity by 5%. Based on the 

science and peers’ best practices, F&amp;N will reassess and 

set longer-term targets, beyond 2020, in due course.

Our Energy and Climate Change related activities can be 

broken down into four priority areas. The first three relate 

to minimising our own impacts, and the final relates to 

how we are adapting to climate change risks:

1. Energy efficiency in 

our operations

2. Renewable energy 

sourcing and generation

3. Reducing carbon in 

our value chain

4. Operations’ exposure 

to climate change risk

We aim to reduce 

energy and GHG 

intensity ratio by 

5%, from 2017  

to 2020.

1. Energy efficiency in our operations

 

Improving energy efficiency in our operations makes business sense just as much as it helps to reduce our environmental impacts. 

We have a range of initiatives including: technical solutions for our buildings and equipment (for example timers, LED lighting); 

process solutions to eradicate wasted energy (for example heat recovery from boilers); and behavioural solutions to reinforce a  

culture of good practice throughout our workforce (for example daily monitoring of energy consumption):

This project aims to reduce both energy (natural gas) and water 

consumption. We installed a condensate tank connected to 

tubular heat exchanger tanks in which water would ordinarily be 

drained after usage. However, with the condensate tank installed, 

used water is redirected towards the boiler water tank for other 

purposes, reducing natural gas and water usage.

Cooling Tower pipes, pumps and motors have been completely 

replaced with more energy efficient technology (e.g. IE3 motors 

and new main header pipes) to reduce energy usage and long-

term maintenance costs.

We have made major adjustments towards the efficiency and 

energy cost reduction for air compressor system operations at 

our TP site by installing modern air compressor systems that  

are more energy efficient.

2. Renewable energy sourcing and generation

 

Energy efficiency can make a significant contribution, but we recognise that in order to decouple our activities from GHG emissions,  

we must transition from hydrocarbon-based energy to renewable energy. To support this, we are looking into the viability of the notion of 

sourcing a portion of our electricity from renewable sources. Furthermore, we are also exploring options to generate our own renewable 

energy at our sites. For example, we are in the planning phase to install solar panels, where applicable, on our plants’ rooftops.

We propose to install a solar PV system at our Pulau Indah site 

which will provide an alternative source of energy for our oper-

ations. The site’s roof area of 25,000m2 will be used to provide 

a capacity of 3,000kWh generating system which will enable 

F&amp;NHB to significantly reduce energy consumption from the  

grid and utilise renewable energy for its operations. 

In parallel with the development of solar PV system installation in 

Pulau Indah site, TP Singapore is also currently looking to install 

solar PV on the rooftop of the sheetfed production area, which 

has the potential to reduce heat load on the sheetfed production 

floor and reduce electricity consumption.

3. Reducing carbon in our value chain

 

As we make improvements to our own operations through energy efficiency and renewable energy use, the natural next step is 

to share best practice and encourage improvement along our full value chain. We are still at the beginning of these efforts but 

understand that it is essential to support our business partners to reduce their own GHG emission impacts. Further details of our 

approach to reducing emissions related to transportation are detailed in a later chapter.

4. Operations’ exposure to climate change risk

 

F&amp;N’s operations and supply chain face increasing impacts from climate change. This includes impacts from rising sea levels, 

extreme temperatures, farming shortages and water availability. We must be resilient to climate change risks. We therefore heed 

the calls of the respective authorities and adhere to the regulations to reduce our environmental footprint in order to actively 

work towards reducing climate change and thus also mitigating our risk. At F&amp;NHB, climate change risks are also monitored and 

managed as part of their Enterprise Risk Management process. Robust incident escalation procedures and response plans are  

part of their BCM.

M12 Route Planning (Transportation)

F&amp;N works with our business partners 

to deliver mutually sustainable solutions 

that create lasting value. We also lead by 

encouraging others to improve in order 

to achieve best environmental and social 

practices throughout our supply chain.



The following chapter outlines some of the ways we work with 

and influence other companies. We are committed to Sustainable 

Sourcing, and the next chapter explains our process for this  

while also providing additional insight into our Route Planning 

efforts, which we examine as one of the several ways in which  

we minimise negative environmental impacts.

Our Approach

Great care and collaboration is required to source the highest-

quality ingredients, as well as other goods and services used 

during our manufacturing processes. Our procurement policies in 

Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand guide us in selecting the best 

quality goods and services that do not compromise sustainability 

principles. These policies also help us establish and maintain 

trust with our suppliers by ensuring fair play.

TARGET: 

To purchase 100% 

of RSPO credits for 

palm oil usage by 

2020

Raw materials are needed to produce products that our 

customers enjoy. We rely on farmers to supply sugar and dairy, 

suppliers to supply packaging materials, as well as dozens of 

other ingredients for our products.

Our Procurement Policy covers standard principles of ethical 

business practice. While we have a business imperative to 

obtain goods and services at the best price in a timely manner, 

this is done only through means that adhere with guidelines 

and principles of fair play and transparency.

Raw Material 

Sourcing:  

Only high-quality 

raw materials 

and ingredients 

are used.

Suppliers: 

Suppliers are 

audited via 

a Supplier 

Performance 

Tracking Initiative 

(pre-qualification 

and approval) 

to ensure 

compliance 

with food safety 

regulations and 

standards.

Transportation: 

Raw materials 

and ingredients 

are stored and 

transported 

in appropriate 

containers 

at the right 

temperatures.

Production: 

All personnel 

handling the 

product in the 

production line 

are trained in food 

management and 

hygiene.

Packaging:  

The most 

appropriate 

packaging is used 

for safety and 

convenience.

Distribution:  

A strict cold chain 

management 

system ensures 

proper handling 

throughout the 

distribution 

process.

Commercial Risk Management in Sourcing

Heightened costs and decreased availability of raw materials 

pose commercial risks. We undertake risk assessments on our 

suppliers’ pricing and capacity to deliver goods and services. 

For key risks, we have established Business Continuity Plans to 

proactively ensure product supply.

We conduct annual supplier audits to ensure compliance with 

food safety regulations and standards. This includes auditing 

of suppliers’ compliance to our stringent food safety criteria, 

required certifications, specifications and ingredient standards, 

as part of F&amp;N’s Procurement Policy. Non-compliant or 

underperforming suppliers must demonstrate they are committed 

to taking the necessary corrective actions within a predefined 

period, or risk having their contracts terminated. 

We assess a range of quality assurance and food security criteria 

to safeguard the health of consumers and the safety of workers in 

our supply chain. Such criteria include the implementation and 

monitoring of good manufacturing processes, use of protective 

clothing, food safety management system, and chemical 

management.

Enhancing Supplier Productivity 

We recognise that the various business partnerships we engage 

with are all opportunities to enhance our sustainability impacts. 

Our approach to leverage our influence in these partnerships is 

twofold. 

1. First, we ensure that suppliers who have had incidents of 

non-compliance are encouraged to take corrective actions and 

are appropriately communicated to about possible avenues to 

improve their sustainability performance; and

2. Second, we take initiatives to further enhance supplier 

productivity for those who have already reached minimum 

standards. 

As dairy purchases make up a significant portion of our 

procurement spending, we have prioritised our dairy suppliers for 

our supplier productivity enhancement program. We have been 

building capacity for local milk farmers in Dan-Khun-Thot Milk 

Cooperative in Thailand and are in the process of expanding this 

program to Malaysia.

With the success of this collaboration in Thailand, we have  

now initiated plans to develop a similar program in Malaysia.  

In July 2018, F&amp;NHB signed a Memorandum of Understanding 

with Koperasi Pegawai-Pegawai MARDI Berhad to apply F&amp;N’s 

business expertise and strength in manufacturing technology 

with KoMARDI’s production potential to together produce 

sustainable milk. F&amp;NHB will exclusively purchase KoMARDI’s 

total supply of fresh milk produced.



For three successive years, 

F&amp;N Dairies Thailand’s 

Agricultural and Manufacturing 

team has been helping farmers 

in the Dan-Khun-Thot Milk 

Cooperative to plant Napier 

grass, which improves the 

quality of milk by enhancing its 

fat, solids, and protein content. 

We have supported the farms 

through donating technologies 

in 2015 and providing training 

in 2016-17. Through this 

partnership, farmers have been 

able to increase the selling price 

of their milk.

FY2018 Performance Highlights 

Eco-credentials 

We source raw materials that are certified with eco-credentials 

by, for example, the Forest Stewardship Council and Roundtable 

on Sustainable Palm Oil (“RSPO”), to ensure that they that are 

produced in an environmentally, economically, and sociably 

responsible manner. All paper products used in the tetra 

packaging of our chilled beverages carry the certification. 

As one of Southeast Asia’s leading fast-moving consumer 

packaged goods companies and one of the largest users of palm 

oil in the region, we understand that our actions and business 

practices pertaining to the sourcing of sustainable palm oil play a 

significant part in safeguarding a sustainable environment for the 

well-being of society. 

We therefore wish to reiterate our commitment to support the 

use of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (“CSPO”) in products and 

have embarked on this journey by becoming an ordinary member 

of the RSPO on 14th August 2017. We aim to purchase RSPO 

credits for 100% of our palm oil usage by 2020. This year we 

have reached our interim target and purchased a total of 8,600 

credits, representing 30% of our palm oil usage. 

Palm oil cultivation is a major cause of deforestation in some 

regions. There have also been instances of malpractice 

ranging from forcible displacement of people from their land, 

to violation of safety and human rights for people working on 

palm oil plantations. F&amp;N is working with partners to help 

ensure sustainable environmental and social practices in 

relation to our palm oil products.

Each RSPO credit represents that one tonne of CSPO, produced 

by a RSPO-certified company or independent producer, has 

entered the global palm oil supply chain. F&amp;N purchases RSPO 

Credits to support the production of CSPO.

We have also implemented a 

Vehicle Management System 

in Malaysia to improve the 

efficiency and safety of our 

fleet management. This allows 

for monitoring of the daily 

truck usage which will help us 

calculate the GHG emissions 

reduction in the future.

F&amp;NHB has made more 

than S$160 million of capital 

investments, since 2014, on 

new lines and warehouses, 

which mean that our 

manufacturing and warehouse 

operations are closer together, 

resulting in shorter routes to 

market.

Optimal route planning can help us reduce costs and is also more environmentally friendly,  

a classic ‘win-win’ scenario. We have therefore made major efforts to streamline our 

distribution networks over the past few years.

Our Approach

We have made significant 

progress this year by switching 

from single-deck to double-

decker trucks. During the year, 

our Malaysian operations also 

made a switch to increase the 

product load per truck deck, 

from 22 pallets to 26 pallets. 

We are now able to move more 

goods per trip and reduce the 

number of trips while at the 

same time achieve savings  

in logistics costs and improve 

stock movement efficiency. T 

o date, the cost savings 

achieved were about 

S$140,000 and total loads 

reduction of 700 loads.

Our Approach

We cultivate a proactive 

‘safety first’ culture for 

employees, so they are aware 

of their responsibilities for 

both themselves and their 

colleagues. This includes a 

positive approach, and we 

encourage a healthy lifestyle 

for our employees through 

a nutritious diet, physical 

activity and stress reduction 

measures.

TARGET: 

To reduce the ‘Lost Time 

Injury Frequency Rate’ 

to zero by 2020

From sourcing to production to delivery, we do everything we can 

to try to ensure that our business has no negative impacts on 

the health and safety of our employees and contractors. Beyond 

compliance with national regulations, we advance our health 

and safety performance throughout the value chain by aligning 

ourselves with international standards and best practices.

Safety Culture

F&amp;N has established safety, health, and environment (“SHE”) systems and monitoring processes across our operations. The safety  

practices in all of our major plants (F&amp;NCM is working towards getting the ISO 45001 certification) have been certified with 

international standards including ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001, meaning employees are provided with the basic necessities  

to conduct their work without risking their safety. All employees receive adequate training, information and instruction, as well as  

proper safety gear wherever appropriate. 

On the ground, we have Company Emergency Response Teams, who are trained to mobilise and ensure the safety of our employees. 

Safety Committees overlook our safety systems and programs to ensure their effectiveness. Each Business Unit has their own Safety 

Committee to monitor and ensure safety protocols are adhered to. These Safety Committees meet every month to discuss accidents 

and near-misses, and determine appropriate actions to reduce risks. They are also conduct audits on the SHE systems, develop 

annual safety plans, and initiate programmes to awareness of health and safety issues among employees.

Singapore 

Each year, we conduct a safety 

roadshow to foster awareness 

amongst our employees on 

safety topics. Topics presented 

during FY2018 include 

SGSecure, driving safety, traffic 

management, occupational 

health, healthy eating and fire 

safety. 

During the past year, we have 

incorporated SGSecure into 

our OHS management system 

to align with the Singapore 

government’s initiative to 

sensitise, train and mobilise our 

employees to prevent and deal 

with a terror attack. This entails 

registering an SGSecure Rep 

with the Ministry of Manpower, 

reviewing our Standard 

Operating Procedures and 

conducting risk assessments 

to identify terror risks. We 

provided SGSecure training 

to our employees to increase 

awareness on how to manage 

our safety and security risks.

Additionally, in order to provide 

the employees with easy 

access to information on rules 

and regulations pertaining to 

security, safety, environment 

and health within FNFS,  

there was a compilation and 

printing of a guidebook on 

rules, regulations and good 

practices pertaining to security, 

safety, environment and 

health. All FNFS employees 

were issued a copy.

Here, we focus on ensuring an environment conducive to employee wellbeing and incentivise healthy habits. Our work environment  

is enhanced with ergonomic facilities to prevent office-related injuries and includes shower facilities to help employees integrate 

physical activity into their daily work life. Employees have free access to company-organised events such as badminton tournaments 

and yoga classes.

Air quality, brightness, temperature and noise levels are monitored in all of our facilities, and we offer tests for employees. For instance, 

in April 2018, we provided audiometric tests for all at-risk workers, with follow-up doctor consultations where impairments were 

identified. We also provide an annual health screening for all employees.

Safety training conducted 

covers a range of topics 

including:

Fire Prevention 

and Safety

Chemical and 

Gas Handling 

Management

Our Approach

Safety

Consumer Health and Safety  

is our main priority. Our 135  

years of success are based 

on mutual trust with our 

customers and we are 

committed to enhancing their 

future wellbeing. This requires 

a holistic approach to safety 

across the life cycle of our 

products. In previous chapters, 

we have already described 

how Consumer Health &amp; Safety 

is a key component of our 

R&amp;D innovations. We have also 

described how our food safety 

assurance cycle requires 

suppliers’ pre-qualification  

and approval.

TARGET: 

We will offer at least  

one healthier choice  

option in all our product 

categories by 2020.

Product safety and quality are of paramount importance  

to F&amp;N and we live by our brand promise: “Pure Enjoyment,  

Pure Goodness”. It is our duty to produce, market and sell 

our brands responsibly and enable consumers to make 

informed purchasing choices. We consistently maintain the 

highest standards so that customers have full confidence 

when purchasing our products. 

We are committed to product quality and food safety and have 

obtained local and international certifications such as:

1. FNFS

 

a. ISO 22000:2005 - Food Safety Management System

 

b. License to operate food establishment

 

c. Halal Certification

2. F&amp;NHB (F&amp;NBM, F&amp;NDM and F&amp;NDT)

Halal Assurance

All our products are halal 

certified by the Department of 

Islamic Development Malaysia, 

and other relevant authorised 

certification bodies. A Halal 

Committee has been set up 

in each of our manufacturing 

plants and is responsible  

for halal compliance in our 

supply chain, from materials 

selection and purchasing,  

to the storage, warehousing,  

and transportation of our 

products. Key responsible 

employees have also attended 

a series of professional training 

sessions related to halal 

internal audit and assurance. 

We also prohibit non-halal 

food and drinks within factory 

premises including the office 

and canteen in Malaysia.

Our adherence to the highest 

health &amp; safety standards 

extends beyond manufacturing 

and production. In the next 

chapter we will outline our 

responsible approach to 

product labelling.

Nutrition

F&amp;N has a Nutrition Charter 

which outlines our principles 

and commitment to health 

and nutrition. We rely on the 

charter to guide all aspects 

of our product development, 

marketing and initiatives to 

advocate healthy lifestyles.  

We live by our “Pure Enjoyment. 

Pure Goodness” philosophy, 

and this means that we  

provide a wide choice of 

nutritious products in an 

assortment of delicious 

flavours. Our philosophy 

means innovating constantly 

to satisfy changing consumer 

preferences. For example, 

none of our products sold 

in Thailand contain Partially 

Hydrogenated Oils (‘trans  

fatty acids’).

We put much emphasis 

on developing healthier 

products, such as by adding 

vitamins and minerals to boost 

products’ nutritional value.  

As detailed in the next chapter, 

many of our products in 

Singapore and Malaysia and 

Thailand carry the ‘Healthier 

Choice’ Symbol and Logo 

respectively.

F&amp;N supports the Singaporean 

Government’s Sugar Reduction 

Commitment which aims to reduce 

sugar content in food and drinks, 

particularly sugar-sweetened beverages.

F&amp;N is contributing to the Sugar Reduction Commitment by:

• Ensuring that all F&amp;N drinks sold in Singapore do not exceed 12%  

sugar content

• Continuing to lower sugar contents across all other products and to 

promote and innovate low sugar contents drinks for consumers 




BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

Our unwavering commitment 

to product health and safety 

is exemplified by our F&amp;N ICE 

MOUNTAIN Drinking Water. 

This product undergoes 

a world class purification 

process which consists of a 

three-tier filtration, followed  

by ultraviolet treatment, 

reverse osmosis and finally  

an ultra-shield process. 

To preserve the water purity, 

each bottle and cap goes 

through five decontamination 

steps to produce the ultimate 

clean drinking water.

We look for opportunities 

to create value with other 

partners. For example,  

BEAR Brand collaborated 

with Thai Red Cross Society 

during blood donation drives 

in early 2018. The objective 

of this initiative was to 

spread awareness about the 

nutritional importance of folate, 

especially to women. Folate is 

not only important for pregnant 

women, it also helps in red 

blood cell formation. During 

this exercise, a total of 55,000 

servings of BEAR Brand 

Sterilised Milk High Folate 

were handed out. 

FY2018 Performance 

Highlights

In FY2018, F&amp;N maintained 

our health and safety 

standards, and to the best  

of our knowledge there were 

no significant incidents of  

non-compliance with 

regulations resulting in 

a fine, penalty or warning.

We are making good progress 

towards having at least one 

healthier choice in each 

product category by 2020; 

there are currently healthier 

options in 14 out of 15 product 

categories.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE LABELLING 

Our packaging and labelling is the primary 

method through which we communicate 

information to consumers about our products’ 

quality, nutrition, safety and disposal.  

It is therefore essential that our labelling is 

comprehensive and clear, allowing our busy 

customers to make fully informed purchasing 

decisions.

Our Approach

Our labelling adheres to the 

Singapore Food Regulations  

as well as to the guidelines  

set down by Agri-Food 

&amp; Veterinary Authority in 

Singapore, the Food Act in 

Malaysia and requirements 

of the Food and Drug 

Administration in Thailand. 

But we go beyond mandatory 

requirements, and for 

all products we provide 

information on: ingredients;  

• sourcing; 

• energy per serving size; 

• recommended daily 

allowances of the different 

nutritional components; 

• expiry dates; and

• nutrition tips. 

All information disclosed on 

our labels is subject to a review 

process involving a range of 

internal experts including 

our R&amp;D and Scientific &amp; 

Regulatory Affairs teams, 

plus dietician advice. Labels 

are then sent to government 

authorities for verification and 

endorsement.

In order to make it as easy 

as possible for consumers 

to understand fundamental 

information (Calories and 

contribution to recommended 

daily Calorie intake), we include 

‘front of pack labelling’ for  

an increasing range of  

our products in Malaysia.  

This includes our 100PLUS 

range and F&amp;N NUTRISOY.

We take care to ensure that 

our marketing and advertising 

activities do not make any 

ethical breaches. We adhere 

to the Malaysian Code of 

Advertising Practice in 

Malaysia and the Consumer 

Protection Act of B.E. 2522 

(1979) in Thailand. In Malaysia, 

we are a signatory to the 

‘Responsible Advertising to 

Children’ initiative and have 

pledged to severely restrict 

marketing to children under  

12 years of age. For example, 

we will only advertise children’s 

products that meet specific 

nutritional criteria based on 







accepted scientific evidence 

and national and international 

dietary guidelines. 

FY2018 Performance  

Highlights

Throughout all of our product 

information, labelling and 

marketing communications 

efforts in FY2018, we had no 

serious events: to the best of 

our knowledge, there were no 

incidents of non-compliance 

with regulations or voluntary 

codes resulting in a fine, 

penalty or warning.

All of our product categories comply with product labelling 

requirements as below:

• The sourcing of components of the product or service;

• Content, particularly with regard to substances that might 

produce an environmental or social impact;

• Safe use of the product or service;

• Disposal of the product and environmental/social impacts; and

• Others (Halal logo, Certification on HACCP, Nutritional 

information).

• License to operate food establishment

In Malaysia, many of our products, including the entire 100PLUS product line, have been endorsed with the Healthier Choice Logo 

introduced by the Ministry of Health. In Thailand, three products lines have received the Ministry of Public Health’s Healthier Choice 

Logo. In Singapore, 59% of all F&amp;N products have been awarded with the HCS which is awarded by the Health Promotion Board: 

Some products with Singapore’s 

‘Healthier Choice Symbol’

Some products with Malaysia’s 

‘Healthier Choice Logo’

Some products with Thailand’s 

‘Healthier Choice Logo’

1. We have achieved our target for Water Stewardship to reduce the water intensity ratio at our plants across the Group by 5% from 

2017 by 2020 in FY2018. We have achieved a reduction of 14% on our Group water intensity ratio as compared to FY2017.

2. We have also met our target for Effluents and Waste to reduce solid waste intensity ratio by 5% across the Group from 2017 in 

FY2018. We have achieved a reduction of around 5% on our Group solid waste intensity ratio as compared to FY2017.

3. We are working towards achieving our targets on Energy and Climate Change of reducing the Group’s energy and GHG emissions 

intensity ratios by 5% between 2017 and 2020. Our energy and GHG emissions intensity ratios have decreased by about 0.6% as 

compared to FY2017. 

 

This is mainly due to the commissioning and trial of new operation lines at our F&amp;B and Printing operations in Malaysia. As there 

are no finished goods produced during this period, our energy intensity ratio would tend to increase by a significant amount in 

comparison to when there is production involved. As a result, our GHG emissions would also be indirectly affected.

1. We are constantly working towards meeting our new target of reducing the Group Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate to 0 by 2020.  

We have since saw a drop of about 17% in our LTIFR as compared to FY2017 and will continue to work towards our eventual goal.
