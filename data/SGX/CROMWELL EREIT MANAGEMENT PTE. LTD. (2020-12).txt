RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABILITY








The Board is pleased to present CEREIT’s third 

Sustainability Report. The report details our economic, 

social and environmental activities for the financial year 

ended 31 December 2020 and is prepared in accordance 

with GRI standards. 

CEREIT’s primary purpose is to deliver stable 

and growing distributions and NAV per Unit to its 

Unitholders over the long term. Since CEREIT’s 

inception, the Board has set a strategic direction for the 

management team to achieve this through executing 

the following key strategies: 

• active asset management; 

• acquiring for growth;

• responsible capital management; and 

• maintaining high ESG standards and disclosures. 

To prepare for this report, an independent consultant 

facilitated a yearly materiality review, comprising 

several feedback sessions and interviews with the 

senior management teams of the Sponsor, the Manager 

and the Property Manager. More than 100 internal and 

external stakeholders were also surveyed on their views 

on material topics.

The responses to the survey and the additional findings 

informed the inclusion of four new material ESG topics 

for FY 2020, in addition to the existing ten material 

topics from the previous reporting year. The Board 

validated the existing material topics and approved 

the new topics, reflecting our ongoing commitment to 

innovation, safety, climate change and an inclusive and 

diverse culture. The Sustainability Report documents 

our plans for these new material ESG topics and shares 

CEREIT’s progress against last year’s targets. The 

Board is pleased that the targets set for FY 2020 were 

largely met, despite a year fraught with challenges  

and uncertainties.

In consideration of the growing importance of ESG on all 

aspects of CEREIT’s operations, the Board also provides 

strategic oversight and regularly reviews CEREIT’s 

sustainability performance, the reporting of which has 

been integrated into CEREIT’s quarterly operational 

reports. In FY 2020 the Board has directed the Manager 

to enhance and strengthen CEREIT’s sustainability 

programme and to set aspirational targets for FY 2021 

and beyond. 

Key executives now have augmented, specific and 

measurable sustainability targets as part of their KPIs, 

that are linked to their remuneration. The planned 

target enhancements will also support CEREIT 

in meeting new sustainability-related regulatory 

requirements in its countries of operations, including 

the newly-introduced MAS Guidelines on Environmental 

Risk Management in Singapore, SFDR in Europe  

and Decret Tertiaire (Tertiary Decree) in France, 

amongst others. 

The Board would like to thank all stakeholders for their 

trust and support in the Board and the management 

team and looks forward to greater success in the  

year ahead.

03. CEO’S 

MESSAGE



We remained proactive 

in building open and 

mutually beneficial 

relationships with all 

our stakeholder groups 

during these challenging 

times.

Simon Garing

CEO AND 

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

I am delighted to present CEREIT’s third annual Sustainability Report,  

which documents the progress that we have made on our ESG journey to 

date. In keeping with our environmental preservation efforts, the report  

is exclusively available in electronic version on our website for reading  

or download. 

CEREIT’s core purpose is to provide Unitholders with stable and growing 

distributions and NAV per Unit over the long term. The Board and the 

management team strongly believe that CEREIT’s long-term success in 

achieving this purpose depends on our ability to operate as a resilient, 

ethical and socially responsible organisation. ESG has been therefore  

at the heart of CEREIT’s operations since IPO.

6

RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABILITY




Our ESG efforts and reporting remain guided by our 

Sponsor’s Sustainability Framework, which consists 

of five core pillars – Economic, Governance, People, 

Stakeholders and Environment. The framework provides 

a holistic approach towards managing ESG risks and 

opportunities and ensures consistency of approach 

across the Manager and the Property Manager. 

Despite the global uncertainty caused by COVID-19, 

CEREIT made significant progress in its third year of 

operations. We continued to invest considerable effort 

and resources to integrate ESG standards into various 

aspects of our operations, from portfolio construction 

to asset management, stakeholder engagement and 

corporate governance. As directed by the NRC, the 

Manager’s senior executives, including myself, have 

ESG targets a part of their KPIs that are remuneration-

linked. This further incentivises real measurable 

outcomes.

While CEREIT has achieved the majority of its ESG 

targets and even surpassed targets in some cases, I 

am particularly pleased with CEREIT’s performance 

in GRESB’s 2020 assessment. CEREIT’s portfolio 

comprises 107 properties located in or close to major 

gateway cities in the Netherlands, Italy, France, Poland, 

Germany, Finland, Denmark, the Czech Republic and 

Slovakia. A number of our assets are in historical 

city areas and many require special approvals for any 

asset enhancement or sustainability initiatives. It is 

in this context that I consider CEREIT’s GRESB 2020 

performance to be a good achievement. CEREIT scored 

73 points (out of 100), representing approximately 70% 

improvement as compared to its first ‘starter’ score of 

43 in 2017. This places CEREIT 8th amongst 26 European 

peers as selected by GRESB, based on asset class, 

geographical location and portfolio composition.

We have already achieved high standards in 

transparency, disclosure and communications in our 

home market, as reflected by CEREIT’s top ten positions 

in the GIFT and SGTI rankings. As CEREIT’s Unitholder 

base expands to include major global investors who now 

expect robust sustainability targets and disclosures, 

CEREIT’s ESG performance is now also being rated by 

many international agencies such as Sustainalytics, 

FTSE and MSCI. My team and I are focused on putting 

programmes and plans in place that reinforce our 

emerging position on the global sustainability stage.  

We are only beginning on this journey. 

One specific target we have is to obtain more green 

certifications for CEREIT’s assets. From a starting point 

of zero certifications at IPO, we have made substantial 

progress in the last three years. In FY 2020 alone, we 

attained nine additional BREEAM certifications and 

CEREIT’s assets now have 20 BREEAM and one LEED 

certifications, bringing the proportion of the office 

portfolio with green certifications to close to 70% and 

obtaining the first BREEAM certifications for four of 

CEREIT’s light industrial / logistics assets. We have 

also committed to achieve a 40% energy reduction goal 

in France by 2030, in keeping with French government 

regulations. 

One of our new material topics – ‘Keeping our people 

and communities safe’ - has taken on a whole new 

meaning over the past year. As this report goes public, 

I am pleased to confirm that none of the Manager’s 

employees in Singapore or Europe have contracted 

COVID-19 to date. We continue to react swiftly to 

changing situation and constantly adjust the mix of 

work-from-home and return-to-office arrangements in 

line with local government regulations. Our immediate 

focus remains the well-being of our tenant-customers 

and employees. 

We remained proactive in building open and mutually 

beneficial relationships with all our stakeholder 

groups during these challenging times. In FY 2020, we 

increased touchpoints with our investment community 

and our tenant-customers. The Manager conducted 

over 140 virtual and physical briefings with more than 

1,800 retail and institutional investors and analysts. Our 

third annual tenant-customer survey is the largest to 

date. It covered 42% of our portfolio by rental income 

and achieved tenant-customer satisfaction rates of 

over 70%. Staying close to our tenant-customers during 

this period has undoubtedly contributed greatly to our 

resilient portfolio occupancy of 95.1%. 

Tenant-customers, employees, investors and other 

stakeholders are all increasingly requiring greater ESG 

commitments. We will continue to strive to improve 

our ESG credentials, not just because regulations are 

becoming more focused on these matters, but also 

because it makes good business sense and – most 

importantly – because it is the right thing to do.

While as at 11 March 2021 CEREIT’s portfolio comprises 107 properties, 11 of those were acquired post FY 2020 year-end and therefore not part of the scope of 

this report 

Unless otherwise stated, this report covers CEREIT’s 

sustainability, economic and financial performance 

for the financial year ended 31 December 2020, with 

prior year performance included for comparison 

where applicable. Consistent with the Annual Report, 

this Sustainability Report covers CEREIT’s business 

operations for 96 properties1 that have been under 

CEREIT’s ownership within the financial period from 

1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. Data on energy, 

carbon, water and waste covered in this Sustainability 

Report is based on 104 properties that were under 

CEREIT’s ownership as at the end of FY 2019 and were 

subject to submission for GRESB 2019 assessment in 

June 2020. A full list of the properties covered in this 

Sustainability Report is available in the appendices, 

located after the GRI Content Index.

Environment

• CEREIT aligns the scope of reported energy consumption, carbon emissions, water 

consumption and waste management data to its GRESB Real Estate Assessment submission 

for consistency. The GRESB submission is based on a full calendar year and submitted 

in the month of June of the following calendar year with results published in September. 

Consequently, the data on energy, carbon, water and waste covered in this Sustainability 

Report is based on 104 properties that were under CEREIT’s ownership as at the end of  

FY 2019 and were subject to submission for GRESB 2019 assessment in June 2020. This set of 

data has been independently verified by third-party assurer, Longevity Partners

• Energy management: this report covers energy consumption for 73% of CEREIT’s portfolio 

by floor area or 89 of 1041 properties under CEREIT’s ownership that were subject to 

submission for GRESB 2019 assessment in June 2020. Out of these 104 properties, CEREIT 

had operational control (defined as CEREIT being the contractual party for the procurement of 

energy) of 54 properties and no operational control of the remaining 50 properties

• Water consumption: this report covers water consumption for 77% of CEREIT’s portfolio 

by floor area or 79 of the 104 properties under CEREIT’s ownership that were subject to 

submission for GRESB 2019 assessment in June 2020. Out of these 79 properties, CEREIT 

had operational control (defined as CEREIT being the contractual party for the procurement of 

water) of 78 properties and no operational control of the remaining one property

• Waste management: this report covers waste generation and disposal approaches for 47% 

of CEREIT’s portfolio by floor area or 60 of the 104 properties under CEREIT’s ownership 

that were subject to submission for GRESB 2019 assessment in June 2020. Out of these 60 

properties, CEREIT had operational control (defined as CEREIT being the contractual party 

for the procurement of waste management) of 43 properties and no operational control of the 

remaining 17 properties

• Data collection is easier for the properties for which CEREIT has operational control (defined 

as CEREIT being the contractual party for the procurement  of energy, water and waste 

disposal services), because then CEREIT ‘owns’ the consumption data. For other properties, 

such as single-tenant properties or master-lease properties, tenant-customers typically 

procure energy, water and waste disposal services directly. For those properties, the Property 

Manager proactively aims to, where possible, obtain the consumption data from the tenant-

customers so as to present a holistic view of the building performance. As the Manager 

and the Property Manager continue to work towards gaining access to ESG data for its 

entire portfolio, the participation and disclosure of performance data for those properties is 

dependent upon the tenant-customers’ willingness to support CEREIT’s reporting initiatives. 

Therefore, reporting data on these assets may be incomplete and is expected to vary from 

year to year

CEREIT had 103 properties under its direct ownership as at 31 December 2019. 104 properties also include Parc d’Osny office asset in Osny, France, which was 

divested in October 2019

5.2. REPORTING PRINCIPLES 

GRI’s reporting principles on defining report content and quality were fully-adopted in the materiality assessment 

and development of the report. They are summarised in the table below:

As CEREIT progresses on its sustainability journey, the Manager looks forward to the support from stakeholders 

and welcomes any feedback for improvement. Queries and comments can be directed to ir@cromwell.com.sg

05. ABOUT 

THE REPORT

Defining report content

Stakeholder Inclusiveness

In determining the material matters for reporting, the Manager has taken into consideration 

both internal and external stakeholders’ perspectives. The approach is outlined in further detail 

on pages 23 and 24

Materiality

The materiality assessment process that determined the material topics to be monitored has 

considered CEREIT’s economic, environmental and social impact in the context of the industry in 

which CEREIT operates and how these topics may influence / affect stakeholders. The process is 

outlined in further detail on pages 17 and 18

Sustainability Context 

As a Singapore-listed REIT with a diversified pan-European portfolio, sustainability context is 

international. The Manager’s approach to sustainability and reporting is developed in consideration 

of global benchmarks and reporting frameworks such as GRESB, Sustainalytics, MSCI ESG and 

FTSE ESG amongst others. CEREIT’s performance is also benchmarked against its SGX-listed 

peers and its European peer group as defined by GRESB

Completeness

This Sustainability Report covers relevant business activities for the 96 properties that were part 

of CEREIT’s portfolio as at the end of FY 2020, except for environmental performance reporting 

which covers 104 properties that were under CEREIT’s ownership as at the end of FY 2019 and 

were subject to submission for GRESB 2019 assessment in June 2020. The report includes, where 

applicable, relevant material information that could influence stakeholder decisions

Defining report quality

Balance

Every effort is made for CEREIT’s sustainability performance to be presented factually and with 

a balanced view. Gaps and opportunities for improvement are disclosed to the greatest extent 

possible with progress status and / or action plans

Comparability

The sustainability reporting framework adopted for this report is an internationally-recognised 

framework. Industry benchmarks are used where appropriate, including GRESB. Performance 

data disclosed is collected on a consistent best-effort basis and where possible, presented as 

year-on-year comparisons

Accuracy

CEREIT is committed to high standards in sustainability data management and reporting. To 

the extent possible, no data is estimated, with some exceptions around utility data and general 

verification. All data in this Sustainability Report has been measured or is supported by relevant 

documents, records and business practices. Financial and operational performance is extracted 

from the Annual Report, where reported data has been subjected to a thorough review process to 

ensure its accuracy. In the case of the FY 2020 financial statements, these are verified and signed 

off by external auditors

Timeliness

This Sustainability Report complies with regulatory requirements for the publication of non-

financial information by SGX no later than five months after the end of the financial year

Clarity

Technical jargon, if used, is fully explained on a best–effort basis. A non-exhaustive glossary of first 

mentions, definitions and abbreviations is included as a front section of this report. 

GRI Content Index is included for ease of reference on pages 75-79

Reliability and external 

assurance

CEREIT is committed to high standards in sustainability data management and transparent 

reporting. The environmental performance data is independently verified and assured by third-

party assurer, Longevity Partners. The Manager will consider seeking external assurance for other 

sustainability indicators in subsequent years as reporting practices evolve

6.2. SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE

As stated in CEREIT’s inaugural sustainability report for 

FY 2018 published in May 2019, the Manager has adopted 

Cromwell’s market-leading Sustainability Framework, 

ensuring that CEREIT remains focused on improving 

performance through a structured, responsible and 

balanced pathway to sustained success. Established 

in 2017, Cromwell’s Sustainability Framework was 

introduced to align values with enterprise risks and 

corporate strategy, underpinning the development of 

a resilient business through strong corporate social 

governance. The framework continues to evolve, 

responding to emerging legislation and new challenges. 

Under the framework, all material risks and opportunities 

are addressed across five pillars – Economic, Governance, 

Stakeholders, People and Environment. The Sustainability 

Framework has been approved by the Board. 

The Board provides strategic direction across the five 

pillars and is involved in the endorsement of the material 

matters under each pillar that are relevant to CEREIT’s 

business and its stakeholders. The Board also provides 

strategic oversight and reviews CEREIT’s sustainability

performance, reporting on which has been integrated into 

CEREIT’s quarterly operational reports. 

To ensure greater accountability, the Manager has 

established a sustainability committee chaired by the CEO 

and comprising dedicated executives or senior managers 

as the ‘owners’ for each pillar. The ‘owners’ have been 

delegated specific responsibilities by the Board to identify, 

set and deliver the objectives and targets associated 

with the material topics under each pillar. They are also 

evaluated on specific KPIs that are tied to CEREIT’s ESG 

targets, providing further motivation and commitment.

In FY 2020, the Manager and the Property Manager have 

also set up a ‘Net zero’ committee (or task force) under 

the Environment Pillar to drive greater progress in setting 

specific emission reduction and other targets across 

CEREIT’s portfolio. The task force utilises the CRREM tool 

to understand the exposure of property to transitional 

risks of climate change. The analysis is expected to be 

completed by 1H 2022. The task force will then propose 

targets based on SBTi which will align CEREIT with the EU 

commitment to transition to a climate-neutral society by 

2050, in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Action plan 

to achieve these will be developed concurrently.

6.3. MATERIALITY REVIEW 

Each year, the Manager conducts a materiality review 

to identify and prioritise the most relevant ESG issues 

against the evolving landscape. The review takes into 

account the impact that each issue has on CEREIT and 

its stakeholders. Prior to the release of CEREIT’s third 

Sustainability Report, an independent consultant EY 

facilitated a materiality review that comprised several 

feedback sessions and interviews with the senior 

management teams of the Sponsor, the Manager and 

the Property Manager. 

In addition, the Manager sought the views of 

representatives of the investment community, service 

providers business and community partners on ESG 

issues that mattered to them. The findings validated 

the continued relevance of the material ESG topics that 

were identified in FY 2018 and informed the inclusion 

of four new material ESG topics – (1) ‘Business model 

innovation’, (2) ‘Keeping our people and communities 

safe’, (3) ‘Climate change – direct impact’ and (4) 

‘Creating and embracing a diverse and inclusive 

workforce’. These topics were subsequently approved by 

the Board. 

Identify a list of sustainability 

matters formed the basis 

for determining comparative 

materiality, based on the 

interview and survey of 

CEREIT’s key internal and 

external stakeholders, peer 

review and Cromwell’s list

matters

6.5. SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK PROCESS 

Following the materiality review and the Board’s 

endorsement, the 14 material topics across the five 

pillars were used to form sustainability objectives, 

prepare relevant plans and set targets for the financial 

year. This Sustainability Report is a direct response to 

material topics identified through the review process. 

Recognising that sustainability is a shared responsibility 

that also requires alignment to international goals, the 

Manager further evaluated its chosen materiality topics 

and targets in the context of relevant UN SDGs. The 

SDGs have served as an additional guide for the Manager 

to look beyond its own operations and consider other 

progressive strategies and initiatives that contribute 

towards addressing international sustainability goals.

As the global community continues to adapt to the universal disruption onset by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board and 

senior management are focused on preserving Unitholder value, ensuring appropriate levels of liquidity and stewarding 

CEREIT’s operations through the prolonged uncertainties and business disruptions associated with COVID-19.

The Manager, the Sponsor and the Property Manager assessed and responded to COVID-19 related risks in relation to 

each of CEREIT’s sustainability pillars in FY 2020.

1H 2020: “Safety-first” mode as 

COVID-19 spread

• Focused on preserving Unitholder 

value, ensuring appropriate levels 

of cash (pre-emptively drew down  

€150 million RCF)

• Put on hold 1H 2020 transactions 

post the successful recycling of  

12 small assets into three  

German logistics in March 2020

• Deprioritised non-essential  

capex / minimised non-critical 

expenses (reduced from  

€47 million to €22 million)

2H 2020: Gradual return to normal 

operations

• Repaid RCF in full (50% in June 

2020 and the rest by December 

2020) given more normalised 

market indicators

• Resumed transaction activities

• Obtained investment-grade credit 

rating from Fitch Ratings and 

issued inaugural five-year bond

• The Manager actively worked to 

protect and enforce its rights under 

lease contracts

• The teams on the ground constantly 

monitored the potential impact of 

government measures, improving 

tenant-customer retention

• Manager did not have to make 

blanket provisions for “rent relief” 

or offer across-the-board rent 

waivers, while improving levels of 

rent collection / minimal rent free, 

with cash collection close to 100% 

from February to December 2020 

(94% from February 2020 to April 

2021)

Tenant-customers: 

• Regular contact with tenant-

customers, specific programme 

for the top 25 tenant-customers 

per country

• Focus on health and safety 

- safety briefing / guidance 

communications for tenant-

customers, increased cleaning 

rosters

• Approximately 21% of tenant-

customers by income requested 

rent reprofiling / approximately 

12% of income reprofiled 

following “smart deals”,  

resulting in less than €40,000 

given in rent abatements, only  

in exceptional cases (€264,000 by 

the end of 1Q 2021)

Investment community:

• Approximately 140 virtual and 

physical meetings with more than 

1,800 investors and analysts

Local community: 

• The Manager helped its 

community partner Child at 

Street 11 set up a fund-raising 

campaign, surpassing S$80,000 

target

Operations

activated across the business

• Since late February 2020, 

all employees in Europe and 

Singapore have been seamlessly 

working from home with robust IT 

to ensure minimal disruptions

customer handovers across the 

portfolio

Health and Safety

• Rolled out physical and mental 

health employee assistance 

programme

• Increased internal 

communications and cross-

functional virtual meetings

GRESB DISCLOSURE

1

2

Global investors increasingly expect detailed 

disclosures on ESG performance that offer comparable 

and transparent data. CEREIT’s business is real estate. 

The Manager has chosen GRESB as the most relevant 

framework to align with. GRESB is an investor-driven 

global ESG benchmark and reporting framework for 

listed property companies, private property funds, 

developers and investors that invest directly in real 

estate. Participation in GRESB’s 2020 assessment has 

grown 22%1 amid accelerating investor demand for 

ESG data, covering more than 1,200 portfolios worth 

more than US$4.8 trillion of assets under management 

combined. The Manager has reported CEREIT’s 

performance under GRESB for three consecutive years, 

starting with its first full year of operations in FY 2018. 

The 2020 GRESB Assessment structure has been 

changed to include a separate Management score and 

a Performance score, each with specific components 

and criteria. CEREIT outperformed peers in most 

Management aspect indicators, notably in stakeholder 

engagement indicators such as Employee satisfaction 

and inclusion and diversity, where CEREIT scored higher 

The Manager is pleased to report that CEREIT’s 

performance in the 2020 GRESB assessment2 further 

improved, with 73 points or 9% percent increase year-

on-year and well above the FY 2020 target of achieving 

a 5% improvement in overall score from FY 2019. The 

Manager acknowledges that due to the major changes 

in methodology that GRESB has implemented for this 

year’s assessment, reporting entities have been advised 

not to compare directly with past year performance. 

Nevertheless, the Manager is pleased with the relative 

outperformance of CEREIT in this year’s assessment 

against its peers. Notably, since its inaugural 

submission, CEREIT has made noteworthy progress 

in its sustainability endeavours and is now ranked 8th 

within its ‘Diversified – Office / Industrial (Europe)’ 

immediate peer group, well above its peer average. 

Some highlights below.

CEREIT maintained its A-rating for GRESB’s public 

disclosure assessment, which separately assesses 

participants for their performance on material ESG 

disclosures. By comparison, the global GRESB 

participants in 2019 obtained an average of ‘C’ while 

CEREIT’s listed Singapore peers obtained an average of 

‘B’ for this assessment. 

The Manager continues to work closely with the 

Property Manager to identify areas for improvement 

in the coming year with the aim to improve CEREIT’s 

GRESB rating each year. Selected existing initiatives, 

specific GRESB aspects identified for improvement, as 

well as future action plans, are detailed below.

Management

Leadership

In consideration with the growing importance of ESG on all 

aspects of CEREIT’s operations, the Board has directed the 

Manager to enhance CEREIT’s sustainability programme and 

to set aspirational targets in order to strengthen and reinforce 

its ongoing ESG efforts

Key executives have augmented specific and measurable ESG 

targets that are linked to their remuneration

Risk management 

In recognising the need to have a structured approach to 

managing the environmental impact of its operations, the 

Manager, in collaboration with the Property Manager, is 

planning to build on its existing environmental initiatives and 

set up an environmental management system that is aligned 

to the ISO 14001, an international standard on environmental 

management systems, on a property level 

The Manager has integrated environmental risks into 

CEREIT’s ERM framework, supporting the Manager’s 

progress in meeting the newly-introduced MAS Guidelines on 

Environmental Risk Management

Stakeholder engagement 

As part of the Group procurement framework, the Manager 

aims to take more proactive measures to engage its suppliers 

on ESG matters during the procurement process

Performance

Tenants &amp; community 

As tenant-customer retention remains one of the Manager’s 

key priorities, the Manager plans to increase participation 

rates in the annual ‘voice of customer’ survey, to include 

sustainability and green fitout improvements part of on-going 

AEIs and various health &amp; well-being programmes

The Manager also plans to assess and monitor the impact of 

its operations on the local communities in countries where 

CEREIT has presence and develop appropriate community 

engagement programmes 

• GHG emissions

• Energy use

• Water use

• Waste management 

The Manager is focused on increasing the coverage of its 

environmental data to gain a more complete understanding of 

its environmental performance. It continues to engage tenant-

customers, especially those with full operational control of 

their premises to access more data, which will serve as input 

to more effective environmental management 

Building certifications

The Manager targets to achieve 25 green building 

certifications by FY 2021. The Manager will consider setting 

medium-term target on green building certifications such 

as an absolute number or percentage of green-certified 

buildings within its portfolio after the ‘Net zero’ task force 

completes the analysis in 1H 2022

PRIORITISE ONLY ESSENTIAL CAPEX and increase focus on operational  

COST SAVINGS

  Achieved: 

Deprioritised non-essential capex and minimised from €47 to €22 million, while managing 

sustainability implications 

02

STRIVE TO ACHIEVE MORE SUSTAINABLE DPU in the light of the economic 

impact from the global COVID-19 outbreak

  Achieved:

The Board made a decision to pay FY 2020 Manager and Property Manager fees fully in 

cash rather than in a mix of cash and Units as was done in previous years. This preserves 

Unitholder value in the long term, because the continued practice of issuing new Units for 

payment for fees means that more than 100% of earnings is paid out, diluting DPU and NAV 

per Unit in the long term

01

IMPROVE FY 2019 TENANT-CUSTOMER RETENTION RATE

  Achieved: 

Tenant-customer retention rate improved to 59.2%1 as at the end of 2020 (up from 58.6% as 

at the end of 2019). 2H 2020 tenant retention rate was 68%, significantly higher than the 48%

05

INCREASE CAPITAL SOURCES and extending debt maturity profile

  Achieved: 

• Transformed CEREIT’s balance sheet from IPO, restructuring CEREIT’s debt profile from 

largely secured to largely unsecured loans

• Unsecured debt increasing from 7% to more than 90% of the total debt, providing greater 

flexibility and control over the asset financing 

• Achieved investment-grade credit rating of “BBB- with stable outlook” by Fitch Ratings

• Established a €1.5 billion EMTN programme

• Inaugural issuance of a €300 million five-year bond in November 2020, followed by €200 

million tap in January 2021, providing greater longer tenure and diversification of borrowing 

sources from banks to global bond markets

RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABILITY


9.1. INTRODUCTION

CEREIT’s primary purpose is to deliver stable and 

growing distributions and NAV per Unit to its Unitholders 

over the long term. As the first Singapore-listed REIT 

with a diversified pan-European portfolio, CEREIT 

offers the opportunity to invest in an income-producing, 

diversified pan-European commercial real estate 

portfolio managed by a trusted and experienced team. 

CEREIT’s strengths are: 

• Resilient pan-European portfolio diversified across 

asset classes, geographies, tenant-customers and 

industry trade sectors

• Experienced Manager, backed by a committed 

Sponsor with a substantial pan-European platform

• Majority independent Board with steadfast 

commitment to high ESG standards and disclosures

The Manager aims to deliver on CEREIT’s objectives 

and purpose and to ensure sustainable economic 

value creation through executing on the following key 

strategies:

Active asset management and asset enhancement

• Drive organic growth in revenue and income and 

maintain strong tenant-customer relationships;

• Continually monitor each asset’s expected 

contribution to earnings and NAV growth, utilising 

the proprietary 13-risk factor dynamic portfolio 

optimisation tool;

• Explore divesting assets that no longer meet the 

risk-return criteria and look to reinvest capital into 

opportunities that will ultimately increase DPU and 

NAV per Unit; and 

• Regularly evaluate properties to identify if 

potential property enhancement or redevelopment 

opportunities can contribute to CEREIT’s returns

Growth through acquisitions

• Adopt rigorous research-backed selection process 

focused on long-term sector trends and fundamental 

real estate qualities to ensure investments are 

focused on the right cities and sectors;

• Aim to grow DPU and NAV per Unit through the 

acquisition of quality income-producing commercial 

properties across Europe;

• Seek assets that can provide attractive cash flows and 

yields, which fit within CEREIT’s purpose to enhance 

returns for Unitholders; and

• Source potential acquisitions that create opportunities 

for future income and capital growth, leverage 

extensive on-the-ground teams and participate in 

both on- and off-market acquisitions

Research-backed approach to acquisitions

The Manager uses several quantifiable metrics that 

guide the execution of its strategy, adopting both a 

top-down and bottom-up approach in constructing the 

optimal portfolio. The Manager is disciplined when 

evaluating potential acquisitions. The bottom-up 

investment underwriting process ensures that only 

properties appropriately screened for environmental 

and operational risks, sustainable performance 

and expected to deliver risk-adjusted returns above 

CEREIT’s cost of capital will be pursued. 

Responsible capital management

• Maintain strong balance sheet and an investment 

grade credit rating, employing an appropriate mix of 

debt, hybrids and equity with sufficient liquidity;

• Access diversified funding sources, including global 

financial institutions and capital market investors; and

• Optimise cost of debt and financing and utilise 

interest rate and foreign exchange hedging strategies 

where appropriate 

High standards in ESG reporting and disclosures

• Employ a rigorous approach to ESG matters to 

achieve high sustainability standards in the operation 

and management of CEREIT, consistent with the 

values of the Sponsor, with guidance from the Board 

and meeting relevant regulations;

• Safeguard Unitholders’ interests through robust 

corporate governance and risk management;

• Continuously enhance corporate disclosures and ESG 

policies; 

• Augment senior management’s ESG-linked KPIs; and 

• Improve CEREIT’s ranking in relevant Singapore and 

global ESG ratings, including GRESB, MSCI ESG and 

Sustainalytics

9.2.2. Capital management: transformational debt 

refinancing

In FY 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 

the first quarter of the year, the Manager quickly moved 

to a ‘safety-first’ mode to preserve cash and Unitholder 

value. €150 million RCF was preemptively drawn down 

at a time of widespread credit market dislocation and 

concerns around bank liquidity. As market conditions 

normalised, the Manager repaid half of the RCF by the 

end of 1H 2020 and the remaining €75 million of the 

RCF by the end of 2H 2020. 

Fitch ratings assigned a BBB- investment grade credit 

rating for CEREIT in October 2021. On the back of

this recognition, CEREIT raised €300 million through 

an inaugural issue of five-year Euro bonds, followed 

by €200 million tap-issue in January 2021. While the 

interest cost for the bonds was slightly higher than the 

previous bank-sourced debt, the tenor of CEREIT’s debt 

now extends well beyond four years, providing a cushion 

to any further rises in interest rates. 

As a result of the transformation of CEREIT’s balance 

sheet over the past two years, CEREIT’s debt is now 

more than 90% unsecured, allowing greater flexibility 

and diversification of borrowing sources, including 

debt capital markets. The Board has also reaffirmed its 

commitment to maintaining its investment grade rating 

and targeted gearing range of 35-40%.

9.2.3. Portfolio management: successful execution 

transaction record

From the beginning of FY 2020 to 31 March 2021, the 

Manager successfully acquired 16 light industrial and 

logistics assets, adding €220.2 million of light industrial /  

logistics assets to CEREIT’s portfolio. The completion 

of the 11-asset acquisition in the Czech Republic and 

Slovakia marked CEREIT’s entry in two new Central 

European markets with high GDP growth potential and 

very high or high credit quality. With 107 assets valued 

at €2.3 billion as at 31 March 2021, CEREIT’s portfolio 

is now more resilient and further diversified across 

nine European countries, with a more balanced spread 

between office and light industrial / logistics. 

Full details on CEREIT’s financial performance and 

operational performance for FY 2020 and 1Q 2021 can be 

found on pages 40-57 of the Annual Report (Manager’s 

report), on pages 193 to 270 of the Annual Report 

(Consolidated Financial Statements) and in the 1Q 2021 

business update published on SGX-ST on 11 May 2021. 

9.2.4. Environmental due diligence during acquisitions

Environmental due diligence has been an integral 

part of the assessment phase of the Manager’s 

investment process since CEREIT’s IPO. This approach 

ensures that the Manager and the Board have a good 

understanding of target assets’ environmental risks 

prior to acquisition, so that they can anticipate and 

develop action plans as needed to mitigate any potential 

environmental risks, which could have a material 

impact on operational and financial performance. In 

FY 2020, 100% of new investments have been screened 

against environmental criteria such as contamination, 

flooding, indoor environmental quality and regulatory 

compliance.

RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABILITY


9.3. BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION

To ensure CEREIT can stay ahead of rapidly-changing 

market conditions, the Manager actively monitors global 

and local market trends and adapts its business model 

as necessary. The increasing importance of constant 

business model refinement resulted in the addition of 

‘business model innovation’ as a new materiality topic 

for 2021. 

The investment strategy of the Manager is focused on 

a long-term target portfolio of at least 75% or more 

within Western Europe and at least 75% or more in 

office and light industrial / logistics. CEREIT’s current 

predominant focus is on:

• Increasing exposure to the light industrial / logistics 

sector towards 50% of the portfolio, including initial 

opportunities in the post-Brexit U.K.;

• Divesting a number of select office buildings and 

other non-strategic assets; and

• Progressing key redevelopment opportunities in 

Paris, Amsterdam and Milan

The Manager sees opportunities in the light industrial /  

logistics sector where yields, while competitive, 

remain accretive to earnings. Secular trends such as 

the growth of e-commerce will drive tenant-customer 

demand for light industrial / logistics assets. Last-mile 

logistics assets, which are vital to the delivery value 

chain, will also continue to be sought after. Undersupply 

and growing demand for logistics assets is likely to 

create an upswing in valuations and rental growth. 

Based on all this, the Manager is more likely to focus on 

‘Core +’ logistics and light industrial sectors, given the 

hot demand for ‘Core’ warehouses with long leases, to 

obtain higher risk-adjusted returns.

The Manager also plans to continue to recycle assets 

to provide capital for other growth opportunities, not 

relying just on capital markets for funding. CEREIT also 

has a number of major development opportunities in its 

portfolio and continues to make progress on planning 

and approval processes at locations such as Parc des 

Docks in Saint-Ouen, Paris, France, a ten-hectare 

warehouse site that is a 15-minute drive from les 

Champs-Elysées. It is set within the vicinity of the new 

2024 Paris Olympic village, close to the new Paris Nord 

hospital and new Metro stations.

With the U.K.’s official exit from the European Union and 

a trade agreement in-place, the Manager has also begun 

exploring opportunities in the U.K. logistics market, one 

of the most liquid markets in Europe.

9.4. QUALITY OF ASSETS

The Manager regularly evaluates existing assets for 

potential enhancement or redevelopment opportunities 

to improve on quality and add additional value to 

income streams, while considering a wide range of 

ESG factors. To enhance the occupant experience, the 

management team stays updated on any emerging 

technological trends via active participation in key 

industry associations and committees. CEREIT’s Head 

of Property is a member of EPRA’s PropTech committee

PILLAR

10.1. INTRODUCTION

With strategic guidance from the Board, the Manager 

aspires to achieve the highest standards of corporate 

governance, ethical business conduct and regulatory 

compliance to manage risks and protect investors’ 

interest. Robust systems, processes and policies have 

been put in place across CEREIT and the Manager’s  

operations to achieve these goals. 

10.2. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 

The Manager is committed to continuous improvement 

in corporate governance practices. In FY 2020, the 

Manager ensured compliance with all material aspects 

with the principles and provisions set out in the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018 and other relevant global 

best-practice governance practices. The corporate 

governance section of the Annual Report from pages 

144 to 175 outlines in detail the practices of the 

Manager with reference to the principles of the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018. 

The Manager has developed and, on an ongoing 

basis, maintains a number of policies and procedures 

designed to provide a firm foundation for a trusted and 

respected business enterprise. Each policy is ‘owned’ by 

a senior management team member and applied across 

CEREIT and the Manager’s operations. Regular reviews 

of policies are conducted by the management team 

based on a risk-based approach, with critical policies 

reviewed at least annually with confirmation accorded 

by a delegation authority determined by the Board. 

The Manager updated and enhanced its Code of 

Conduct (incorporating ‘ethics code’) to further improve 

its corporate governance practices. The Manager 

has also formalised its sustainability policy, which 

guides CEREIT’s commitment to environmental and 

social sustainability. Details of selected policies are 

highlighted in Figure 12 on the next page.

Description 

Environment

Sustainability policy

Documents the Manager’s approach to sustainability (including the 

environment), broadly covering: 

• Board / senior management involvement

• Commitment to report regularly on environmental, social and 

governance issues

• Commitment to monitor environmental performance

• Commitment to setting up long-term targets for the reduction of 

emissions, releases and waste

• Commitment to regular consultation with stakeholders on 

environmental issues

• Implementation of an environmental management system

• Commitment to a culture of environmental awareness

10.3. ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-BRIBERY 

The Manager adopts a zero-tolerance stance against 

bribery and corruption. This stance is supported by a 

specific ‘Anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy’ that 

sets out expectations of the employees to uphold the 

Manager’s core values and not to engage in any corrupt 

or unethical practices. The policy also guides the giving 

and receipt of corporate gifts and concessionary offers, 

amongst others.

As a wholly-owned entity of Cromwell Property Group, 

the Manager has also adopted and adheres to the key 

Group policies which aim to establish and reinforce 

the highest standards of integrity and ethical business 

practices. These policies are reviewed regularly on 

a risk-based approach and communicated to all 

employees via emails throughout the year, along with 

the procedures for raising any concerns on policy 

breaches. In FY 2020, all of the Manager’s employees 

completed mandatory training on anti-corruption 

policies and procedures.

The Manager has adopted a series of measures to prevent 

corruption and unethical behaviour that complement the 

anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy. These include:

• Outlining the responsibilities of all employees to 

uphold anti-corruption and anti-bribery principles;

• Informing and guiding employees on how to pre-

emptively identify and avoid instances of corruption; 

• Implementing policies such as the ‘Supplier code of 

conduct’ that outlines standards of conduct expected 

of suppliers and agents acting on behalf of the 

Manager; and

• Enforcing the Manager’s stance on zero tolerance for 

breaches and gateway thresholds for short-term and 

long-term incentives requiring compliance with the 

Manager’s Code of Conduct and ethical behaviour 

standards

The Manager acknowledges that geopolitical risks 

play an important part in the growth of CEREIT and 

constantly monitors exposure to events such as political 

leadership uncertainty, inconsistent public policies and 

social unrests in all jurisdictions in which it operates in.

In FY 2020, CEREIT had assets and operations in seven 

European countries. Two of its countries of operation, 

Poland and Italy, are at present rated as “medium-

risk” in the Corruption Perceptions Index published 

annually by Transparency International, ranking 

countries on the basis of their perceived levels of 

public sector corruption. To mitigate those risks, the 

Manager has put in place a comprehensive investment 

assessment process that includes careful analysis and 

understanding of country risks. 

Country-specific risks are part of the initial investment 

feasibility assessment stage. In countries where 

the perceived risk of corruption is higher, careful 

consideration is placed on the suitability of investing in 

that particular jurisdiction. Such risks are assessed and 

tabled to the Board as part of overall risk assessment. 

Regular monitoring and risk mitigating action plans will 

also have to be sufficiently addressed.

As a matter of practice, where the Manager has 

determined that there is a greater level of bribery 

or corruption risk attached to any particular area of 

business, country of investment, asset or when working 

with an associated person such as new business 

partners, contractors or agents, rigorous due diligence 

checks are conducted prior to engaging in any business 

activities with the associated person. Processes are 

also in place to adequately address and mitigate 

the risk(s), including an ethical standard audit and 

corruption risk assessment as part of the ERM process.

42

RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABILITY


10.4. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTERING 

THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM

As a holder of a capital markets services licence issued 

by MAS, the Manager abides by the MAS’ notices and 

guidelines on the prevention of money laundering and 

countering the financing of terrorism. Under these 

guidelines, the main obligations of the Manager are:

• evaluation of risk;

• customer due diligence;

• suspicious transaction reporting;

• record keeping;

• employee screening and representative screening; and

• training

The Manager has developed and implemented a specific 

policy on the prevention of money laundering and 

terrorist financing and is alert at all times to suspicious 

transactions. The Manager performs due diligence 

checks on its counterparties in order to ensure that it 

does not enter into business transactions with terrorist 

suspects or other high-risk persons or entities. 

10.5. TRUST, TRANSPARENCY AND GOVERNANCE

Effective risk management is integral to the delivery 

of CEREIT’s strategy, especially during periods of 

increased competition and uncertainty. The Board 

works with the Manager to ensure that sound risk 

management system that reduces the chance of 

financial and reputational loss and enables timely 

reaction to opportunities when they arise is in place. 

CEREIT‘s ERM policy and the supporting framework 

promotes an understanding of risk and opportunities 

and to manage identified risks for the benefit of 

Unitholders and other stakeholders. The framework 

is aligned with Group policies and leading industry 

practices and guidelines, including the Risk Governance 

Guidance for Listed Boards, Board Risk Committee 

Guide (2016), the Singapore Code of Corporate 

Governance 2018 and SGX Listing Rule 1207(10). 

Activities undertaken include a combination of 

monitoring of risk through regular meetings of the ARC; 

maintaining a risk register outlining risks; risk ratings 

and controls; and testing of adherence to established 

processes for all functions. Risk management 

frameworks cover major management processes; such 

as compliance, due diligence, asset plans, property 

management reports, debt plans and capital and 

maintenance programmes.

10.6. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

The Manager is progressively putting plans in place to 

address several new major ESG-related regulations 

introduced or effected in its countries of operations. 

Specifically, in Singapore and in Europe respectively, the 

MAS Guidelines for Environmental Risk Management 

for Asset Managers and SFDR framework were 

introduced to encourage proactive identification, 

assessment, management and disclosure of ESG 

risks. With SFDR introduced in Europe from March 

2021 and the MAS Guidelines taking effect in 2022, the 

Manager has taken steps towards fully addressing these 

requirements, as illustrated below.

RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABILITY


10.7. BUSINESS CONTINUITY

Cromwell has made significant investments over the 

last few years in systems and processes to ensure 

business continuity in the face of global market 

disruptions. The Manager has adopted the Group’s 

business continuity framework and further augmented 

it with policies and procedures relevant to CEREIT’s 

business and with specific alignment to the MAS 

business continuity management guidelines. 

In February 2020, the Manager’s BCP was activated 

in the Singapore office in response to the COVID-19 

outbreak and has remained in place since. With the 

rapid spread of the outbreak in Europe, BCP was soon 

after activated in the Luxembourg and the German 

offices, in accordance with Cromwell’s European 

plans and country-specific regulations. A group-wide 

business continuity task force was activated to manage 

the situation and to keep stakeholders informed 

according to established escalation protocols. For most 

of FY 2020, the task force met regularly (as frequently 

as on a weekly basis at the height of the pandemic) to 

co-ordinate efforts. The COO represents the Manager in 

the group-wide business continuity task force. 

Some of the measures implemented included regular 

risk assessments, employee education, enhanced 

hygiene practices, adequate social distancing measures 

and work-from-home arrangements. Despite the scale 

of the disruption, the Manager’s diligence in early 

and regular crisis management planning resulted 

in minimal interruption to the business during the 

challenging period. The Manager also included a more 

robust pandemic response in its BCP during its annual 

review. With the global spread of COVID-19 and the 

second and third waves of the outbreak, the Manager 

continues to operate within various forms of BCP as the 

of the publishing of this report, in line with prevalent 

country regulations.

10.8. SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

The Manager is dedicated to responsible procurement 

practices, including the protection and promotion of 

fundamental human rights across its direct operations 

and supply chain. The Manager is now part of the 

newly-established procurement working group formed 

by Cromwell in FY 2020 to oversee the development 

and integration of the dynamic Group procurement 

To ensure a consistent approach to the identification 

and management of modern slavery risk, the working 

group has also formalised a human rights policy during 

the year that the Manager adheres to. 

As part of Cromwell Property Group, the Manager 

and the Property Manager abide by Cromwell’s 

human rights policy and Cromwell’s Modern Slavery 

Statement. These can be found in the sustainability 

section of Cromwell’s website https://www.

cromwellpropertygroup.com/sustainability

The Manager has adopted and abides by Cromwell’s 

Supplier Code of Conduct which sets out expectations 

framework across the Group’s global operations. The 

framework aims to increase awareness, transparency 

and accountability of sustainable procurement practices 

for Cromwell and its subsidiaries and formalises the 

practices in an updated group procurement policy 

aligned with the principles of sustainable procurement 

as defined under the international standard (ISO20400), 

and as shown in Figure 15 below. 

Figure 15: Principles of sustainable procurement 

for suppliers to comply with relevant laws including but 

not limited to those governing consumer protection, 

environment, social, anti-competition, human rights, 

modern slavery and health, safety and welfare laws. 

Service providers assessed to have higher risks in their 

supply chains on their approach to modern slavery are 

generally required to sign the Supplier Code of Conduct. 

Rigorous due diligence checks are performed prior to 

engaging in any business activities with potential high-

risk suppliers to ensure that their business practices 

are in line with the ethical standards required by 

Cromwell.

10.9. CYBER-READINESS AND DATA GOVERNANCE

Protecting stakeholders’ personal information, 

maintaining trust and competency in IT systems and 

preventing cybercrime extends to all areas of the 

business. Operating within the Group’s IT infrastructure, 

the Manager adopts and adheres to prevalent Group 

policies and practices. Cromwell has attained the 

ISO27001 information security management systems 

certification, leading to improved operational processes 

and increased sophistication in the governance 

infrastructure.

Amidst growing threats to cyber-security and data 

theft, Cromwell, including the Manager, have in place 

data handling and protection practices aligned with 

GDPR regulations in Europe. In response to GDPR, a 

tailored online training programme has been put in 

place through the Group’s human capital management 

software, Workday, to ensure that all employees 

are aware of how to comply with GDPR during daily 

operations. The modules are mandatory for all full-

time, contract and part-time employees working in 

Europe and Singapore and cover a range of topics 

including data protection and handling, third party 

policy, data protection impact policy data breach policy, 

physical security and an updated IT Code of Practice. 

All full-time and contract employees of the Manager 

have completed the training modules. The Manager is 

pleased to report zero breaches of customer privacy 

and losses of customer data across its countries of 

operations in FY 2020. 

In Singapore, the Manager also further aligns its cyber 

practices to the MAS Technology Risk Management 

guidelines and maintains regularly updated policy and 

practices in accordance with PDPA.

RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABILITY


11.1. INTRODUCTION

The Manager adopts a customer-focused approach 

to stakeholder management. This approach involves 

active and regular two-way communication with key 

stakeholders to understand and respond in a timely and 

appropriate manner to any concerns.  

11.2. INVESTMENT COMMUNITY 

CEREIT engages with the investment community in a 

regular, proactive and open manner.

To build brand awareness and keep all Unitholders 

informed about CEREIT’s financial results and 

operating performance, the Manager runs a robust 

investor outreach programme via its dedicated investor 

relations team. Updates to CEREIT’s financial results 

and operating performance are communicated on a 

regular basis to Unitholders and other stakeholders. 

Any change in business that could materially affect the 

Unit price is communicated immediately. As CEREIT 

is a publicly-listed entity, the Manager’s investor 

communication activities are guided by CEREIT’s 

market disclosure protocol and the Manager’s investor 

relations policy. The market disclosure protocol ensures 

that CEREIT discloses all price-sensitive information 

to the SGX-ST in a timely manner in accordance with 

the Listing Rules and that all Unitholders have equal 

and timely access to material information concerning 

CEREIT, including its financial position, performance, 

ownership and governance, subject to the Listing Rules. 

The investor relations policy outlines the principles and 

practices followed by the Manager to ensure regular, 

effective and fair two-way communication with the 

investment community.

Throughout the year, the Manager regularly engages 

with the investment community to provide updates 

on CEREIT’s performance, strategy and transactions 

activities, amongst others. In addition to formal 

financial results briefings and dialogues, the Manager 

also engages in two-way communication with the 

investment community and seeks its views through 

various means, such as investor relations and senior 

management team participation in local and regional 

conferences with question-and-answer sessions, one-

on-one meetings, group teleconferences, site visits as 

well as post-results investor briefings. In FY 2020, the 

team and management conducted more than 140 virtual 

and physical briefings and meetings, speaking to more 

than 1000 retail investors, more than 700 institutional 

debt and credit investors and close to 160 analysts. 

Since IPO, the Manager has focused on transforming 

and diversifying CEREIT’s Unitholder register. The 

current Unitholder base comprises more than 4,700 

investors (approximately twice the number as compared 

to IPO), with Unitholders representing approximately 

65% of CEREIT Units based in Singapore (including the 

holdings of the Sponsor) and the other 35% based in 

the U.K., the Netherlands, Germany, the Nordics, South 

Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, 

Australia, Philippines, the U.S. and Canada. While 

Cromwell remains CEREIT’s largest unitholder, its stake 

is now below 30% (28.1%). No substantial Unitholder 

other than Cromwell has more than 10% of the units. 

The investor register has institutionalised further in 

2020 and now close to 20% of Unitholders are effectively 

long-only institutional investors. 

11.3. INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS

Manager is active in contributing to the growth of the 

real estate industry by participating in a number of 

industry associations and supporting CEREIT employees 

in individual memberships. Notably, the Manager has 

representatives on the regulatory committee and the 

PropTech and innovation committee of EPRA and on the 

executive, promotional and the regulatory committee of 

REITAS. A non-exhaustive list of memberships held by 

CEREIT is shown in Figure 16. 

The Manager regularly participates in key industry 

events. In FY 2020, senior team members of the 

Manager participated as speakers and panellists at a 

number of specialist conferences such as Citi-REITAS-

SGX C-Suite Singapore REITS and Sponsors, DBS-SGX-

REITAS Future of Real Estate Series, 2020 SGX-REITAS 

Webinar and PropTech Bulgaria 2020 where they shared 

their insights on the latest industry developments.

11.4. COMMUNITY

Building on existing community partnerships, the 

Manager seeks to create positive impact to the 

local communities in which it operates. In FY 2019, 

the Manager put in place its strategy for long-term 

community engagement, with the aim to deepen its 

engagement with charities, increase its financial 

donations and involve its employees in community 

and giving efforts. Due to the cessation of face-to-face 

volunteering and fundraising events as a result of 

COVID-19, the Manager explored alternative ways to 

continue its commitments. As an example, in support 

of its adopted charity Child at Street 11, the Manager 

helped set up a virtual fundraising campaign which 

raised over S$140,000, well surpassing its target of 

S$80,000. 

The Manager plans to resume its outreach activities 

fully as soon as the situation allows.

The Manager is committed to supporting community 

development in meaningful ways and in areas where 

CEREIT is best able to contribute its expertise and 

skill set, consistent with its core business in real 

estate, asset and fund management and its corporate 

values focused on talent and skill development. 

Figure 17 below illustrates the Manager’s community 

engagement strategy journey. In line with the Group’s 

community engagement framework, there are three 

categories through which the Manager looks to make a 

difference in its local community. 

• The employee volunteer programme (EVP). The 

programme grants two days of paid leave each year 

to encourage employees to engage in community 

activities and support causes that are important 

to them. The EVP is an important platform for 

employees to support community organisations with 

their professional knowledge, skills and experience. 

Due to COVID-19, this programme was temporarily 

suspended. The Manager is looking to restart as 

soon as social distancing restrictions ease 

• Team effort in fundraising and community 

participation. FY 2019 first saw the setup of the 

Grassroots Social and Community Committee. The 

Committee is chaired on a rotational basis and is 

tasked to implement the long-term community 

strategy.

RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABILITY


• Corporate contributions. These include 

sponsorships and events in partnership with various 

selected charity, community or industry bodies. 

Apart from the fund-raising efforts for Child at Street 

11, the Manager also contributed S$15,000 to three 

community partners, donating a portion of the funds 

from the Job Support Scheme received from the 

Singapore government to assist companies during 

COVID-19. The Manager has achieved the FY 2020 

group target of S$1,500 per employee contribution. 

In early 2021, the Manager refined and restated its 

community engagement focus and framework focused 

on four main themes as follows:

» Access to early childhood education for 

underprivileged children; 

» Educational, mentorship and financial support for 

youth at-risk; 

» Supporting people with disabilities; and 

» Supporting elderly individuals in need

In FY 2021, the Manager plans to expand its community 

engagement though the establishment of a regular 

partnership with an education institution within the 

Manager’s core business of real estate, fund and asset 

management services.

11.4. TENANT-CUSTOMERS 

Recognising that the long-term success and growth 

of CEREIT depends heavily on high tenant-customer 

satisfaction levels and retention rates, the Property 

Manager has conducted an annual ‘voice of customer’ 

survey of tenant-customers across CEREIT’s portfolio 

since FY 2018, conducted by an independent third-party 

customer experience consultancy in compliance with 

GDPR regulations. The study captures feedback on a 

number of factors, including building management, 

communication, security and sustainability. Results and 

feedback gathered are then used by the property teams 

to develop and implement asset-specific plans. 

Due to disruptions brought about by COVID-19, the 2020 

survey was conducted in Q1 2021, compared to the last 

survey in 4Q 2019. Notwithstanding these challenges, 

there was a 58% increase in the number of participants, 

bringing it to a total of 128 tenant-customers surveyed 

across all the seven countries in which CEREIT had 

operations as at the end of FY 2020 (Namely Denmark, 

Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the 

Netherlands). 

The performance remained consistent in key indicators. 

75% of tenant-customers found it easy to work with 

CEREIT (up from 71%) and satisfaction as an occupier 

rose from 69% to 71% as well. Satisfaction with asset 

management services also saw an increase from 76% 

to 77%. Following the survey, a detailed analysis was 

shared with the local asset managers to help identify 

areas of strength and improvement with appropriate 

plans put in place. 

The Property Manager reported an NPS of -2.4, as 

compared to -1.4 in the previous survey. According to 

data compiled by the customer experience consultancy, 

the decrease in NPS score was a common trend 

observed in the industry due to challenges brought 

by COVID-19. The Property Manager has managed 

to outperform industry average of -14.5, on the back 

of early response, proactive engagement plans and 

support rendered to tenant-customers at the onset 

and throughout the pandemic. Another potential 

improvement area identified is on building maintenance 

issues. As CEREIT’s portfolio comprises some older 

assets, it will take time and considerable effort to 

improve their conditions; improvement works were  

also greatly delayed due to operational challenges and 

inability to do site visits caused by COVID-19. 

As the situation around COVID-19 remains uncertain, 

The Property Manager will continue to work closely 

with asset managers in rolling out an action plan for 

FY2021. These enhancements will be implemented 

in accordance with latest COVID-19 regulations and 

with the aim to gradually improve tenant-customer 

satisfaction. CEREIT strives to achieve a positive NPS 

over the coming years.

12.3. TALENT ATTRACTION, RETENTION AND CAREER 

DEVELOPMENT 

Attracting and retaining a diverse range of high-

calibre talent is key to Cromwell’s ability to execute 

its strategy. Cromwell actively monitors employee 

engagement to understand the levels of engagement 

across the business and to identify and act upon any 

areas of concern the ongoing need before they present 

a retention risk. 

In keeping with the Group’s practices, the Manager 

provides a competitive remuneration package in line 

with industry standards, including annual health 

check-ups, comprehensive medical coverage, parental 

leave, mandatory retirement contributions, access 

to company-sponsored mental health counselling 

services1 for all employees and dedicated well-being 

platform. Benefits are further tailored in accordance 

with local labour regulations and acts. All employees 

are also included in the Performance Unit Programme 

(PUP), a long-term incentive plan. Under the PUP, 

the Manager grants Unit-based awards with pre-

determined performance targets set over the relevant 

performance period, such as achieving outperformance 

of the FTSE ST REIT Index, pre-set return on equity 

targets and meeting DPU targets.

To support the employees in understanding how 

company values translate into everyday behaviour, 

Cromwell has introduced a Group-wide leadership 

framework. The framework includes six levels of 

organisational leadership and defines values and 

competencies expected at each leadership level. It 

is used for competency measurement and to help 

employees identify the leadership qualities they need to 

demonstrate for career progression within the Group. 

Discussions on performance are held informally on a 

regular basis to ensure that any improvement areas 

would be addressed in a timely manner. In FY 2020, 

100% of employees received regular performance 

feedback. The Manager will integrate this framework 

into the appraisal process for FY 2021 performance cycle.

To complement the leadership framework, Cromwell 

also commenced a job analysis project during the year. 

The project aims to re-evaluate and map the purpose 

and responsibilities of each role across the business 

in the context of the expanded global focus of the 

business and validate / articulate further the key skills, 

behaviours and qualifications required to successfully 

undertake them. This will in turn provide a clear view 

of the opportunities that exist for the employees within 

the business and attributes required to inform their 

professional developmental plans. 

To support its employees in their career plans, 

Cromwell invests in continuous learning and 

development. The Group utilises Workday – a human

employees’ growth in knowledge, experience, social 

and professional attributes. The ‘Learning@Cromwell’ 

framework is also in place to plan for structured 

training for all employees, ensuring that all key training 

priorities are met. In FY 2020, the average training 

hours per employee for the Manager was 20.5 hours, 

a slight y-o-y decrease from 22 hours in FY 2019, as 

a result of the inability to attend face-to-face training 

programmes due to COVID-19. The FY 2020 Group 

target of 20 hours per employee was nevertheless 

exceeded. The Manager will continue to support 

learning and development within the limits of the 

restrictions posed by COVID-19.

12.4. KEEPING OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES SAFE 

Cromwell is committed to ensuring the health and 

safety of employees, visitors, tenant-customers, the 

general public and any others who have touch points 

with the Groups operations. In FY 2020, in response 

to increased stakeholders’ expectations and concerns 

around workplace safety in part due to COVID-19, the 

Manager adopted ‘Keeping our people and communities 

safe’ as a new material topic, with a focus on physical 

and emotional wellbeing. 

As the nature of work for the Manager’s employees 

is office-based, the primary physical risk to its team 

is identified as sedentary work. The Manager’s team 

participated in the Cromwell’s 30-day global step 

challenge and together achieved 1,380,702 total steps 

covering 1,052 km. 

Additional stress and social isolation produced 

through the COVID-19 period ‘shone the light’ on the 

need to provide emotional and mental support to 

employees. Cromwell has been committed to mental 

health programmes to date, with yearly mental health 

workshops conducted throughout its operations. In FY 

2020 this commitment was further augmented. All of 

the Manager’s Singapore-based employees have access 

to a company-sponsored, confidential mental wellbeing 

counselling service. This programme will soon be 

expanded to the Luxembourg and the German offices. 

The Manager operates in compliance with local 

workplace health and safety regulations and reports 

workplace incidents to the relevant regulators and 

insurers as per the applicable laws. Minor incidents and 

near misses are recorded as well. Employees are able 

to report work-related hazards via the hazard report 

form or by approaching the office manager. 

As the world continues to grapple with the impact of 

COVID-19, the Manager acted swiftly and established a 

number of changes to protect the health and safety of 

its employees. Appropriate controls were put in place 

including employee safety education, enhanced hygiene 

practices and social distancing. The Singapore and the 

European offices of the Manager are well-prepared to 

switch to the appropriate mix of work-from-home and 

return-to-office arrangements in line with prevailing 

local regulations. The Manager is pleased to confirm 

none of its employees have contracted COVID-19 to date.

Beyond its own employees, the Manager has an 

additional responsibility to ensure that tenant-

customers, visitors and contractors are supported with 

healthy and productive environment. The Manager 

aims to conduct periodic indoor air quality testing or 

air ventilation duct cleaning on all properties on an 

annual basis in accordance with local legislation where 

applicable. Contracted companies are also expected to 

comply with the safety requirements of the Manager 

and the Property Manager. Incident-reporting protocols 

are in place to escalate incidents to the relevant 

departments and facilitate the timely implementation of 

corrective actions to prevent similar occurrences.

The Manager is pleased to report that there were zero 

work-related fatalities, high-consequence1 injuries 

and ill-health2 amongst its employees, the Property 

Manager’s employees and third-party contractors in  

FY 2020. There were also no cases of accidents amongst 

tenant-customers and visitors to CEREIT’s premises.

1 

As defined by GRI, a high-consequence work-related injury is when an individual cannot/ not expected to recover fully to pre-injury health within six months, 

excluding fatalities 

2 

As defined by GRI, a case of ill-health are negative impacts on health arising from exposure to hazards at work (e.g. diseases, illnesses and disorders)

12.5. CREATE AND EMBRACE A DIVERSE AND 

INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE 

The Manager recognises that a diverse, inclusive and 

safe culture promotes a sense of wellbeing which 

increases engagement and in turn supports strong 

performance. The Manager maintains a zero-tolerance 

stance on any forms of workplace harassment and has 

adopted all applicable Group P&amp;C policies as listed 

below. Employees can reach out to their immediate 

supervisors or raise concerns on P&amp;C matters through 

a formal grievance procedure. In FY 2020, the Manager 

recorded no cases of P&amp;C-related concerns through the 

grievance channels. 

To drive change from the top, a Group-level Diversity 

Leadership Council, comprising six senior and 

executive leaders from across the organization, was 

appointed in FY 2020 to raise awareness, advocate for 

and champion change that promotes greater diversity 

and an inclusive organisational culture. The Manager 

also formalised its commitment to a diverse, inclusive 

and safe workplace by including a new material topic 

- ‘Creating and embracing a diverse and inclusive 

workforce’. The Manager further set diversity targets in 

line with the Group’s, aiming to achieve at least 30% of 

each gender at each leadership level by the end of 2023. 

The Manager also adopted the Group’s D&amp;I and equal 

opportunity policies and established a regional D&amp;I 

sub-committee to champion and support D&amp;I, assist 

with the facilitation of D&amp;I initiatives and provide local 

lens on D&amp;I actions. The Diversity Leadership Council 

has already made inroads with awareness programmes 

such as a four-part education series for people leaders 

on leading inclusively and a Workday module on D&amp;I 

awareness which is mandatory for all employees.

GROUP EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEY

Each year, the Group conducts an annual employee engagement survey to measure overall engagement, 

gather feedback on what’s going well and what can be done better. The survey is designed to provide a 

formalised opportunity to provide feedback, assisting the further development of the Group’s and the 

Manager’s ‘People Pillar’ strategies over the forthcoming 12 months. 

In FY 2020, 100% of the Manager’s team participated in the annual group–wide employee engagement 

survey. The Manager achieved average engagement score of 89%, 20 p.p. points up from the previous year 

and 25 p.p. above the Group average. The improvement in employee engagement was a direct result of 

high levels of management engagement, new health and education programmes, the introduction of an 

Employee Enhancement Scheme (designed to provide greater security to employees during the COVID-19 

uncertainty) and an increase in cross-team work during COVID-19 lockdown all contributing to this result. 

An inclusive and respectful work culture and professional work environment were the key areas where the 

Manager scored best.

Improvement opportunities identified by the survey include developing clearer career developmental paths 

for the Manager’s employees, desire for more individual sessions between managers and employees and  

more active community engagement. As a follow-up, the Manager has set a target to adopt the group 

Leadership Framework and conduct regular one-on one meetings with team members. The employee 

volunteer programme is also planned for reinstatement as soon as the situation allows.

13.1. INTRODUCTION

Aligned with the Group’s strategy, the Manager and the 

Property Managers are committed to minimising the 

environmental impact of its assets and adopting leading 

practices in its operations. The Environment Pillar 

owner provides oversight on the various sustainability-

related initiatives in asset management and property 

operations across CEREIT’s portfolio. These processes 

include proper identification of environmental risks 

and integration into the ERM framework, enhancing 

collection of reliable and accurate performance data via 

robust systems as well as adopting meaningful global 

benchmarks. All these efforts allow CEREIT to identify 

areas for further improvements and manage costs and 

environmental impact efficiently to provide stable and 

growing returns for its Unitholders. Despite disruptions 

brought about by COVID-19, the Manager is pleased to 

have made progress on its environmental front. 

The Manager has a formal sustainability policy 

which reiterates its commitments to a wide range of 

environmental issues ranging from the prevention of 

pollution, minimising impact to biodiversity, climate 

change adaptation, energy consumption including 

increasing renewable energy into the existing energy 

mix and water and waste management, amongst 

others.

Cromwell had its Australian portfolio certified to 

ISO14001, an international standard on Environmental 

Management Systems in FY 2019. A review is well 

underway to formulate a strategy to roll out the 

certification across the European business, covering 

CEREIT’s European property operations as well. The 

system will provide a formalised framework to enhance 

environmental performance and support continuous 

improvement, disclosure and engagement with 

respective stakeholders.

13.2. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME

Since the introduction of the environmental 

management programme in FY 2018, the Manager 

has seen continuous improvements across selected 

light industrial / logistics assets located in Germany, 

France, Denmark and the Netherlands. In the first 

year, the programme focused on identifying immediate 

environmental hazards that require immediate 

action such as detecting the presence of asbestos 

or potential soil and groundwater contamination; 

appropriate actions were taken up to resolve these 

findings. Leveraging a real-time environmental tracking 

tool that allows close monitoring and tracking of 

sustainability-related performance, regular inspections 

were conducted to ensure lower-risk issues were 

subsequently resolved as well. Since the introduction of 

the environmental management programme, CEREIT 

has seen market improvements across selected assets 

with no further major environmental issues detected. In 

FY 2020, environmental management audits have been 

conducted across the assets, helping to identify lower-

risk issues as well as raise opportunities for further 

improvement as well. They have also been particularly 

relevant in asset disposals. 

13.3 IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY ACROSS 

ASSETS

At the start of FY 2020, the onset of COVID-19 disrupted 

operations of the Manager as well as its tenant-

customers. A large proportion of tenant-customers’ 

workforce began to work from home, resulting in a 

significant reduction in activities and demand for energy. 

In response, respective Property Managers promptly 

adjusted settings for equipment such as heating 

systems, lifts and lighting based on building occupancy 

and usage, in some cases completely closing off parts of 

assets. While significant decrease in energy consumption 

was registered due to COVID-19, the Manager 

continuously looks out to improve energy efficiency, 

increase renewable energy within energy mix and 

increase coverage of energy consumption reporting on 

a permanent basis. In FY2020, the Manager designed a 

“top five programme” aimed at introducing best practices 

in energy efficiency across its portfolio. A survey was 

also conducted in a sample of three countries to identify 

existing energy efficient features and technologies. 

Based on the survey results, more energy efficient 

measures will be rolled out at those assets to improve 

the portfolio energy efficiency. These best practices will 

eventually be rolled out across the portfolio.

Some examples of existing energy-efficient features 

identified across the portfolio are included below.















LED lighting

tenant spaces) 

Solar panels

Smart meters  

(includes main meters  

and sub-meters)

13. ENVIRONMENT 

PILLAR

13.3. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 

13.3.1. Data collection process

The Manager aligns CEREIT’s environmental data 

reporting with its annual GRESB submission. All 

GRESB-related data is collected by the local property 

managers and verified by and with additional data from 

local asset managers. At present, this continues to be a 

fairly manual process. However, the Property Manager 

has piloted a data collection tool ‘Deepki’ in France 

which supports the automatic collection and verification 

of landlord and tenant-customer consumption data. 

It is the Manager’s and Property Manager’s intention 

to extend the use of data collection tools through a 

dedicated ESG portal across all of CEREIT’s countries  

of operations. 

Starting from 2021, all GRESB consumption data will 

be progressively uploaded into the CRREM tool that 

supports target definitions in line with the new EU 

Taxonomy and the Paris Agreement. 

For directly-managed properties, CEREIT will be in a 

position to set appropriate targets with the support 

of CRREM, starting with the consumption data that is 

currently submitted for the GRESB 2021 reporting cycle 

(for FY 2020). 

For tenant-customer related data, the local asset 

managers work with the respective tenant-customers 

to collect environmental performance data where 

possible, on a best-effort basis. In France, local law 

already requires tenant-customers to submit their 

consumption data either to a governmental ESG data 

portal or to the landlord. 

13.3.2. Green leases 

Green leases are lease contracts with specific clauses 

which oblige tenant-customers to provide consumption 

data to the landlord, among other joint sustainability 

matters. CEREIT already has a large number of green 

leases in place in France and plans to roll out green 

lease clauses into its other investment countries. In  

FY 2021, the Manager aims to further increase the 

share of consumption data collected from tenant-

customers across its portfolio for a more comprehensive 

reporting and as a basis for join sustainability initiatives 

with tenant-customers, e.g. solar panels or tenant 

engagement/smart buildings apps. 

13.3.3. External data verification and assurance 

In order to ensure that the 2020 GRESB submission 

(for FY 2019) has an adequate level of reliability and 

accuracy, all information on electricity, gas, GHG 

emissions, water and waste generation has been 

additionally verified by an independent external 

consultant – Longevity Partners - in accordance to 

AA1000 Assurance Standard (AA1000AS 2008) and 

GRI G4 Reporting Principles. The assurance process 

includes the verification of reported environmental 

data with the data source, explanation on collection and 

calculation methods, criteria and assumptions, as well 

as cross checking with previous published data. 

13.3.4. Energy consumption

The energy consumption included purchased grid 

electricity (56%), district heating (22%) and fuel usage 

(23%), resulting in a total of 163,793 MWh of energy for 

73% of CEREIT’s portfolio by floor area. Energy intensity 

was recorded at 129.45 kWh/m2.

RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABILITY


The Property Manager continues to improve the use 

of renewable energy mix across CEREIT’s portfolio. In 

FY 2019, energy purchased in Denmark, Germany and 

the Netherlands was 100% from renewable sources for 

managed energy connections1. In CEREIT’s assets in 

France, 98% of procured energy under managed energy 

connections is low carbon-intensive2, of which 34% 

comes from renewable sources. Near-term intentions 

include increasing renewable energy procurement in 

Poland and Italy, subject to availability.

13.3.5. GHG Emissions

The total GHG emissions were 61,298 tonnes of carbon 

dioxide equivalent, for 77% of CEREIT’s portfolio by floor 

area. 17% of the GHG emissions (10,593 tonnes; “Scope 

3”) were directly attributable to tenant-customer’s daily 

activities3. Total GHG Emissions intensity recorded was at 

45.9 kgCO2/m2. Since the last GRESB reporting, energy and 

GHG emissions data is now collected from 89 properties, 

up from 75. Additionally, there is also greater data 

coverage from the previously reported properties as well. 

Reporting boundary definitions on page 13 cover this in 

more detail.

1 

Managed energy connections refer to the scenario where the electricity is procured by the Property Manager. CEREIT does not have managed energy connections for all 

managed properties as tenant-customers have options to procure energy directly from local power generators

2 

Low carbon intensive energy refers to electricity mix which comprises nuclear, solar and hydroelectric power. According to the GRI Standards, nuclear power is not 

classified as a renewable energy; hence, not included in the total renewable energy reported

3 

Grid emission factors have been obtained where possible by local utility suppliers and supplemented with data from European Environment Agency (EEA), where latest 

published data is available for FY 2016

of its assets and at times transform existing properties 

into new and engaging buildings. The Manager is  

also focused on obtaining globally-recognised green 

building certifications such as BREEAM, EPC and LEED 

for its assets. 

EPC is a European-wide rating scheme used to 

summarise the energy efficiency of buildings, as set 

out in the EED. Using a scale of A to G, it ranks the 

building’s ranking energy performance from best to 

least efficient. It is mandatory for EPCs to be issued 

to all buildings upon construction completion, prior 

to leasing or sale. Additionally, EED stipulates the 

establishment of mandatory inspection schemes for 

heating and air conditioning systems. Since FY 2019, 

100% of CEREIT’s assets have attained EPCs, with all 

Dutch assets meeting a minimum of C ranking.  

The Manager aims to obtain market-leading 

sustainability certifications such as BREEAM, LEED and 

WELL for an increasing number of CEREIT’s assets. As 

at the end of FY 2020, CEREIT holds 20 BREEAM (up 

from 11 in FY 2019) and one LEED certification. Close 

to 70% of CEREIT’s office portfolio has been ‘green’ 

certified, with certifications for four light industrial / 

logistics assets now also achieved. Plans are in place 

to obtain BREEAM for at least five more properties by 

the end of FY 2021 with a stretch target of nine, which 

will further increase the proportion of green-certified 

buildings within CEREIT’s portfolio to least 75% of 

CEREIT’s office portfolio by NLA.

13.5 CLIMATE CHANGE

Climate Change Risk Management 

Physical impact from changing climate and extreme 

weather conditions is projected to have a growing 

impact on climate risk exposure across CEREIT’s 

various locations of operation. In order to understand 

and prepare for associated impact, the Manager 

has committed to embedding risk management and 

resilience assessments into all relevant acquisitions 

and operational strategies. In FY 2020, the Manager 

has integrated environmental risks into CEREIT’s ERM 

framework, allowing these risks to be considered and 

managed holistically along with other organisational 

risks. This will also support CEREIT in meeting the 

newly-introduced MAS Guidelines on Environmental Risk 

Management. More information can be found in Section 

10.6 on Environmental Risk Management under the 

Governance Pillar. 

Physical Risks Management

CEREIT participated in GRESB’s Climate Risk &amp; 

Resilience Assessment which combines data reported 

in the 2019 GRESB Assessment together with a set 

of risk indices to provide a holistic view of how well 

location-specific ESG and climate risks are managed 

across the portfolio. 

The study analysed CEREIT’s portfolio for exposure 

to physical climate risks and natural hazards such as 

water stress, heating degree days1, floods, climate 

change exposure, wildfire, severe storms, landslide and 

air quality. Additionally, a specific risk score would be 

1 

Heating degree days are a measure of how far (in degrees), and for how long (in days), the outside temperature is below a threshold temperature. The Heating Degree 

Days (future climate) Index provides estimates of the average number of heating degree days a country may be expected to experience each year in the future climate 

(2036-2060).

provided for the ten largest assets in the portfolio (by 

NLA), indicating exposure to respective physical climate 

risks. Based on the locations of these assets, they 

were also further assessed to be of high risk of climate 

change, heating degree days and to severe storm 

hazards. Findings from the assessment will be used for 

asset enhancements to mitigate these risks as well as 

other operational decisions such as insurance coverage. 

The insights from this assessment have further guided 

the management of ESG risks across CEREIT’s portfolio 

and highlighted areas for improvements. 

Transitional Risks Management 

Policy Change in France 

With effect from October 2019, the Decret Tertiaire 

was passed in France, mandating all building owners 

and tenants to actively reduce energy consumption in 

buildings including office spaces, light industrial and 

logistics by at least -40% by 2030 and -60% by 2050. To 

comply with the regulation, the Manager has audited 

ten out of 21 buildings of its French portfolio’s energy 

performance and carbon emissions. Each energy 

audit looks to identify the major sources of energy 

consumption as well as energy losses. 

In FY 2021, the Manager will work with independent 

consultant to formalise carbon reduction roadmaps, 

which will help CEREIT meet the reduction goals. The 

detailed roadmaps will be finalised upon the completion 

of audit for the whole portfolio in 2021 and will be shared 

in subsequent sustainability reports. Some examples of 

mitigating measures are included in the table below.

Source of energy consumption 

Examples of mitigating measures

Heating 

Replacement of chiller and heat recovery systems 

Cooling 

Increase efficiency of cooling tower with replacement of cold pumps  

Ventilation 

Replacement of ventilation box 

Lighting 

Replacement of conventional bulbs to energy-efficient LED type 

Installation of photovoltaic panels on rooftops and at outdoor carparks 

13.6. PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE 

Aligned with the Sponsor’s climate change strategy, CEREIT’s Manager acknowledges UN Principle 15’s 

approach in applying a precautionary principle when considering the physical impacts of a changing climate: 

where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, including severe weather events, rising sea levels 

and shifting temperature zones, a lack of full scientific certainty will not be used as a reason for postponing 

cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation. 

Cromwell is committed to minimising the environmental impact associated with corporate operations through 

firstly, incrementally reducing emission intensities year-on-year and secondly, through the offsetting of 

corporate emissions. 

CEREIT’s Manager has proactively implemented climate control upgrades in its buildings and is currently 

conducting climate risk assessments that account for 1.5°C and 2°C (currently under review) warming scenarios. 

72

RESILIENCE THROUGH SUSTAINABILITY


Changes of carbon-related regulations in the future

In FY 2020, the Manager and the Property Manager 

initiated implementation of CRREM tool to evaluate 

the downside financial risks associated with a low-

energy performance and quantifying the financial 

implications of stricter regulatory environment (e.g. 

stringent building codes, regulation, and carbon prices) 

regarding carbon intensity on entire building stock. 

All energy consumption and GHG emissions data are 

directly imported from GRESB assessment. As at 31 

December 2020, the assessment is still underway with 

a view for it to complete by 1H 2021 and with results to 

be shared in subsequent sustainability reports. CRREM 

tool also recommends different decarbonisation and 

energy reduction pathways depending on country, 

building type and global warming target (1.5°C/2°C). 

Based on the risk of stranded assets and potential 

decarbonisation pathway, the Manager will work 

with the local property managers to establish asset-

level quantitative carbon emission reduction targets 

to align with disclosure requirements under TCFD’s 

and SFDR’s recommendations. Amongst others, the 

results are expected to inform the Manager’s future 

portfolio management strategy, including acquisitions / 

divestments and capital expenditure plans.
