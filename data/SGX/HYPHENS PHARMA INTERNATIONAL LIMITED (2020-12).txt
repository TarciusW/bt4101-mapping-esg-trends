Hyphens Pharma International Limited  Sustainability Report 2020  |  04





The Group is pleased to present our annual Sustainability Report for the financial year

ended

31

December

2020

("FY2020").

The

Board

has

overall

responsibility

for

sustainability and incorporates economic, environmental, social and governance ("EESG")

issues in the formulation of our corporate strategy. They review, approve Hyphens' key

material EESG factors and provide oversight to the senior management in the

implementation of sustainability efforts across all business units. These issues will be

monitored by senior management.







As the world struggles with the 

challenges faced with the COVID-19 

pandemic, our response to this 

evolving situation focused on 

ensuring continuous essential medical 

supplies to support the healthcare 

services and adapting our work 

environment to protect the health 

and safety of our employees through 

activating our Business Continuity 

Plan ("BCP"). 

Split team arrangements, safe 

distancing measures, daily 

temperature screening of employees, 

cleaning and sanitisation of the office 

premises every two hours as well as 

staggered working hours among 

employees are measures we have put 

in place at the workplace. 

We provide our employees with 

resources to support their well-being 

through distribution of health 

supplements, face masks and hand 

sanitisers. 

We have taken the necessary steps to 

ensure compliance with the advisories 

issued by the various government 

agencies while continuing with our 

business operations in Singapore. 

In the region where we have direct 

presence, our local distributors 

continue to operate and supply to the 

medical industries and pharmacies in 

full compliance with the respective 

country’s legal requirements and 

social distancing measures.

To show our support to the local 

communities, we committed 

S$150,000 to support frontline 

healthcare professionals in the region 

and donations to local marginalised 

communities affected by COVID-19 

pandemic.

COVID-19 Pandemic

Looking Forward

At Hyphens, we have been digitally 

pivoting in order to enhance 

sustainability values for our 

stakeholders above and beyond the 

crisis. 

Through the usage of our POM 

system (i.e. Pan Malayan's B2B e-

commerce platform) with improved 

security levels as well as secure third-

party e-commerce platforms, we are 

able to continue our business 

operations with minimal disruptions 

while maintaining our customers' 

privacy at the same time. 

Despite the challenging business 

environment during the pandemic, we 

adapted by striving  towards 

strategies that we believe will bring 

sustainable success in post-pandemic 

markets. We sincerely thank all our 

partners and stakeholders for their 

belief in us and for their unwavering 

support throughout this 

unprecedented period. 

Sincerely,

Board of Directors

Our stakeholders include individuals or 

groups who are impacted by our activities 

and we strive to build strong relationships 

through our regular engagements with them, 

such as collecting constructive feedback from 

employees in terms of employee 

engagement, providing communication 

channels to customers (i.e. feedback  

and query section in our 

website) for their feedback 

and suggestions.

Innovation and digitalisation are the 

foundation to our Group's sustainable 

growth and is an important driver of our 

development. We have enhanced the 

security of our POM system (i.e. Pan-

Malayan's e-commerce platform). 

Coupled with the integration of our key 

systems - from sales to invoicing and 

payment processing, this provides a safe and 

secure yet seamless platform for our    

customers to transact 

online. In addition, 

we partner with 

secure third-party         

marketplaces to 

conduct our e-

commerce activities.

By referencing to sustainability for guidance, 

we take care in ensuring that our business 

operations and processes are managed in a 

way that the impact on our environment is 

kept to a minimum.

In pursuit of economic developments, we 

understand the need to keep a fine balance 

with our social influence. Ensuring the 

health and safety of our employees are one 

of our concerns.

Through our regular engagement and communication channels with 

our key internal and external stakeholders, we are able to understand 

their perspectives on topics in relation to business risk, opportunities, 

trendspotting and risk management processes. These findings and 

benchmarking analysis have enabled us to identify the sustainability 

topics that have significant impact on our Group and our stakeholders.

An additional material topic, Customer Privacy, was assessed to be 

included in this report and there were no changes to the three 

material topics from FY2019. Our material sustainability topics 

identified for FY2020 are Anti-Corruption, Employment, Customer 

Privacy and Socioeconomic Compliance. Our assessment was based 

on the GRI standards.











Hyphens Pharma International Limited  Sustainability Report 2020  |  11





Anti-Corruption

Employment

Customer Privacy

Socioeconomic 

Compliance






Anti-Corruption

We strive to uphold our Group’s professional ethics and 

integrity when carrying out business. We have put in place 

policies and procedures surrounding workplace ethics and 

business conduct such as anti-corruption, whistleblowing, 

conflict of interest and ethical business practices. 

We ensure that all our business functions are aware of the 

established code of conduct in every district we operate. 

Furthermore, new hires are nurtured for the Group’s 

personal integrity, corporate values and ethical principles 

during the on-boarding program. Therefore, acts of 

corruption and bribery are stringently forbidden in our 

Group.

In FY2020, our Group is pleased to announce that there 

were no reported cases in relation to breaches of code of 

corporate governance, corruption and bribery.

Moving forward, our Group continues to spare no effort to 

maintain zero reported cases.





Hyphens Pharma International Limited  Sustainability Report 2020  |  12













Our corporate governance system is supported by various 

policies and principles put in place to ensure that relevant 

controls are in place. 

We adhere to the principles and guidelines of the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018 (the “Code”), issued by the 

Monetary Authority of Singapore (the “MAS”), and will 

continue to improve our practices and operating 

frameworks by updating ourselves on developments in 

corporate governance.

We reach out to members of the community to

encourage lines of communication that promote

transparency of our Group. Transparency is key to build 

trust with our stakeholders and create sustainable value 

for the future of our Group.

We have also put in place effective corporate practices to 

safeguard against fraud, with the aim of protecting 

shareholders’ interests as well as securing the long-term 

success of our Group. Unethical conduct or malpractices 

in relation to corruption and fraud by employees will be 

met with formal disciplinary proceedings.








Socioeconomic Compliance

Guided by our core values and code of conduct, we are 

committed to ensure that compliance is a key pillar of our 

management and an integral part of our corporate culture 

and business processes. Our tone for regulatory 

compliance is set clearly at the top and consistently 

reiterated from the Board throughout all levels of our 

Group. 

We provide consolidated training to all relevant 

employees alongside with pre- and post- training quizzes 

periodically to ensure their awareness of the regulatory 

updates. Our Group’s regulatory policies and procedures 

are checked and reviewed periodically to ensure they are 

aligned and in compliance with local regulations.

We are proud to announce that in FY2020, our Group had 

no reported instances of non-compliance with laws and 

regulation.

Moving forward, we will continue to monitor any 

regulatory changes to ensure compliance.



Customer Privacy

We strive towards upholding professional values when 

conducting business and handling customers’ privacy. 

Maintaining impeccable privacy and security is always our 

Group’s notion to deliver sustainable growth and to 

protect our customers’ interest.

With our Group’s endeavour in digitalisation, we protect 

our customers’ data and privacy by enhancing the security 

level of the Group’s servers and IT systems consistently. 

Moreover, all employees who handle customers’ data are 

provided with Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) 

training periodically. Data Protection Handbook is 

established and communicated to the employees for their 

adherence.

In FY2020, there were no reported cases in relation to 

personal data violation or breaches of customer privacy.

We will continue to strive and maintain our good track 

record of having zero reported cases.



Hyphens Pharma International Limited  Sustainability Report 2020  |  13








Hyphens Pharma International Limited  Sustainability Report 2020  |  14



















We embrace diversity by hiring talents from various 

backgrounds and cultures based on meritocracy and 

provide unbiased opportunities to our employees. 

We value and promote our employees’ 

well-being and work-life balance at work to 

maintain a sustainable workforce.

We listen to our employees for their constructive 

feedback in order to improve staff engagement.

We believe in achieving the above targets will help 

us attract and retain talents. Hence, we have 

developed and integrated human capital strategies 

on talent attraction, development and retention to 

enhance our Group’s employee retention 

mechanisms and talent attraction ability. 

Additionally, we have put in place a hiring policy to 

govern the procedures from sourcing of potential 

suitable candidates to recruitment and confirmation 

of employees. The established policy is 

communicated to our employees and reviewed 

internally on a periodic basis.






Hyphens Pharma International Limited  Sustainability Report 2020  |  15























While BCP was activated for split 

teams work arrangement to 

mitigate congestion in the office, 

we have also put in place 

temperature monitoring, 

enhanced cleaning regimes and 

other safe workplace protocols 

to ensure that our employees 

are protected from the risks of 

the virus infection. 

Health supplements, face masks 

and hand sanitisers were 

distributed to all employees to 

support their well-being. 

Keeping our workforce 

safe and healthy

To ensure the mental well being 

of our employees during the 

lockdown period,  we partnered 

with The Center For Psychology 

to do a virtual talk on 

"Navigating Change, Uncertainty 

&amp; Stress".

Understanding mental 

health matters too

In response to COVID-19 

pandemic, we utilised virtual 

platforms (e.g. video 

conferencing software such as 

Zoom) to minimise the need for 

physical meetings and business 

travels, and yet maintain regular 

communication with our 

employees. 

Adapting how we work 

and communicate

In line with our commitment towards creating a conducive work 

environment, we listen to our employees for their needs and 

expectations towards the organisation by consistently collecting their 

feedback in terms of employee engagement and challenges encountered 

at the work. As such, we developed the necessary measures / action 

plans to assist our employees in resolving the issues / challenges faced.

In response to the COVID-19 crisis in FY2020, the Group 

has made conscious efforts to ensure that additional 

safety regulations have been complied with.

We recognise the role of sustainability 

in value chain management















Sourcing

As such, we have stringent requirements for quality and 

therefore engage reputable suppliers who abide by global 

environmental, social and governance standards. 

We adopt sustainable procurement by ensuring our core 

values are integrated through the Group’s supply chain 

into the life cycle of the Group’s products and services. 

In addition, we continue to rely on our procurement 

policy to ensure a fair and transparent process for 

supplier selection including criteria and basis for 

selection, such as cost effectiveness and operational 

efficiency. 

Before contracting work to new suppliers, verification is 

carried out on suppliers' accreditation and compliance 

with the required regulatory, track record, quality of 

services and reputation. 

We routinely conduct due diligence on suppliers for the 

assessment of compliance with required licenses and 

industry standards (i.e. GMP/ISO/HACCP document 

verification).

Business Partners

We share our business philosophy and environmental 

action plan with our business partners. We ensure 

that the core values of the potential business partners 

are aligned with ours in terms of integrity, 

accountability and environmental protection before 

appointing them as our business partners. Frequent 

discussions and meetings are held with our business 

partners for experience sharing and improvement 

opportunities within our supply chain.

Distribution

With a fully integrated and extensive distribution 

system, we ensure that our products are efficiently 

distributed to our distributors, customers and 

consumers. Our focus is to minimise the 

environmental and social impacts from transportation 

by managing energy usage while safeguarding the 

safety of our personnel and local communities. We 

also continuously innovate our processes and 

implement digital technologies to drive efficiency.

Post-Consumption Packaging Management

In compliance with the Mandatory Packaging 

Reporting ("MPR") framework, we reached out to our 

suppliers in FY2020 to collect data on packaging 

material for our products. We are also in 

communication with waste management consultants 

to determine our 3R plan for measures to reduce, 

reuse and recycle our packaging materials. 

By undertaking these initiatives, we seek to promote 

green procurement as an essential role in driving 

sustainable value for our stakeholders.

We continue to source responsibly for partners who 

share and promote a sustainable future, and engage 

them actively in strategic partnerships.
