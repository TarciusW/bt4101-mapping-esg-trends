Sustainability Statement 

Sustainability Governance and Commitment 

The Board of Directors recognises that sound corporate governance practices are important to the 

proper functioning of The Group companies and is committed to enhancing shareholder value by 

maintaining high standards of integrity and complying with all applicable laws and regulations.  

The Board comprises six directors of which half of the Board are independent directors with strong 

financial and business background, providing the necessary experience and expertise to direct and 

lead The Group in relation to overall business management.   Our senior management team that leads 

The Group’s Sustainability Committee, is assigned the responsibility for overseeing sustainability and 

reports to The Group CEO and Board of Directors.  Refer to our FY2018 Annual Report from page 17 

to 29 for more information on Corporate Governance.  

The Group adopts environmentally friendly, resource-efficient and responsible practices as part of the 

core sustainability values. Sustainability forms an integral part of its corporate strategy and decision-

making process in achieving its vision of becoming a global leader in the manufacture of cleanroom 

and healthcare gloves.  The Group ensures that the concerns and opinion of the key stakeholders are 

taken into consideration in the course of achieving its vision.   

 

Value Chain Sustainability and Management 

A sustainable supply chain is important in ensuring continuing success for business and as such, The 

Group endorses the following sustainable practices across its entire supply chain.  

&gt;&gt; Group Procurement Policy 

The procurement activities are guided by our Group Procurement Policy to ensure the goal of cost-

effective, efficient and sustainable deliverability procurement is attained.   The Group Procurement 

Policy guidelines entail the supplier selection and evaluation criteria like good quality products, 

competitive pricing, service and support reliability are required to minimise supply chain risk and 

other negative business impact.  

&gt;&gt; Supplier Base Management 

The Group seeks to diversify the supplier base as we understand supplier diversity not only drives 

competition on price, quality and service level between The Group’s existing and potential suppliers, 

it would also encourage the growth of diverse business and economic growth of all communities

Environmental Material Factors 

The Group continues to carry out environmentally friendly practices to protect the environment for 

the well-being of future generations.   The principal operating plant of The Group is in compliance 

with ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management and we constantly engage our ISO auditors and in-

house engineering team to conduct on-going examination and discussion to independently verify that 

the applicable environmental laws and regulations are complied with.  The Group is committed to 

taking continuous effort to minimise the possible adverse impact on the environment.  

Water Conservation 

Water is a limited resource and The Group continues to work on water saving initiatives.  The Group 

strives to reuse and recycle water where applicable through innovation and water saving features as 

follows: 

1) To reduce the water consumption by developing new formulation which requires lesser 

leaching. 

 

2) To reuse the water from leaching to former cleaning. 

 

 

 

 

 

Water is recycled and reused 

Effluent Treatment Plant is in place to purify our industrial waste water for its reuse and its aim is to 

release safe water to the environment.  During the year, we built and commenced the operation of 

our rain collection system that runs the collected water through filtration at raw water treatment plant 

before releases to the production plant for manufacturing use as reported previously.  

The Group is currently in the process of working to achieve the previously set target of recycling up to 

30% of water in three years from its first reporting year and ultimately to reduce excessive withdrawal 

from water system by 5%. 

With reference to the main plant of The Group, total water consumption amounted to 1,623,000 m3 

or 0.37 m3 per 1000 units of output (FY2017: 940,000 m3or 0.29 m3 per 1000 units of output) due to 

higher water usage in the online leaching process compelled by tougher challenges on medical glove 

quality arising from more stringent customers’ requirements.

Energy Usage 

The Group continues to make conscious efforts in conserving energy by using energy efficiently and 

opting for renewable energy in an attempt to tackle the rapid global climate change by reducing our 

overall carbon footprint. We are constantly on the lookout for energy efficiency improving means.  In 

FY2017 SR, we mentioned that we would use high-efficient industrial burner for glove curing which 

could typically reduce the natural gas consumption by 10% compared to the regular packaged burner 

and we started with installing one unit for a production line in FY2018 and have planned to install 

progressively upon successful commissioning in stages.  

Natural gas usage in FY2018 amounted to 1,742,000 MMBtu or 0.40 MMBtu per 1000 units of output 

(FY2017: 1,277,000 MMBtu or 0.39 MMBtu per 1000 units of output), which increased slightly in 

comparison mainly due to higher heat temperature generated for glove curing in the oven system to 

better meet the glove quality demand. 

With respect to electricity saving, The Group regularly reminds employees of the basic electricity 

saving practices through internal memo and daily briefing. We have been using the high efficiency 

motor or IE2 (with reference to Standard IEC/EN 60034-30-1 on efficiency classes of line operated AC 

motors published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on March 6, 2014) to operate 

the dipping machine ovens aiming to reduce the electricity consumption.  Electricity usage in FY2018 

amounted to 45,842,000 kWh or 10.5kWh per 1000 units of output resulting in an energy saving of 

6% in consumption per 1000 units of output. (FY2017:  36,601,000 kWh or 11.2 kWh per 1000 units 

of output) 

Effluents and Scheduled Waste 

Hazardous waste generated by The Group is handled in accordance with the applicable environmental 

laws and regulations.  Policies and work instructions are reviewed from time to time by the 

management to ensure compliance with Departmental of Environment (“DOE”) requirements 

pertaining to the management of storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste generated from 

our manufacturing activities.  Amongst others, scheduled waste is stored with its movement being 

monitored by certified Competent Person.  We will only engage licensed and qualified contractors to 

collect our scheduled waste that is sent to facilities approved by DOE for chemical or recovery 

treatment.  Effluents are discharged strictly according to DOE requirements. 

The waste intensity in FY2018 was 0.27kg per 1000 units of output (FY2017: 0.14 kg per 1000 units of 

output. The higher figure stemmed from higher water consumption as explained on page 9. 

The Group engaged in-house Competent Person with respect to management of effluents and 

scheduled waste.

Social Material Factors 

Occupational Health and Safety 

The Group’s main priority has always been the workplace safety.  A safe workplace reflects a more 

productive and injury free workforce thereby reducing the healthcare costs.  The Group obtained 

Occupational Safety and Health Management System (“OHSAS”) accreditation ISO18001: 2007 which 

is subject to annual audit by professional independent consulting firm.  

Compliance with safety rules and procedures is overseen by a registered Competent Safety and Health 

officer who leads the Safety Committee consisting of executive staff.   Regular safety talks and trainings 

are provided to workers from time to time to ensure best safety practices are communicated across 

the entire workplace.  Safety signs and messages are put in the right work places. 

As manufacturing plants are exposed to industrial fire risk, The Group regularly conducts fire drills 

involving our effective Emergency Response Team (ERT) to ensure all workers know how to exit safely 

as quickly as possible.  We have the right type and quantity of firefighting equipment, fire hose and 

extinguishers are in place complying with Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department.  Factory firefighting 

system is also installed by the government approved contractor, who is also engaged to service the 

firefighting equipment on a monthly basis.  

The Group aims to work towards zero accidents and loss time injuries and the following are the health 

and safety highlights of FY2018 and FY2017:

to uphold the human rights of workers. 

 

Labour Relations – Training &amp; Education 

We ensure that our employees have the skills they need to do their jobs and as they build their career 

with us.  We value our employees as the human capital asset and as the backbone of our operations 

and hence, we continue to develop our human capital by having them sent for professional training 

to equip them with skills relevant to their job requirement.   Each year, our training policy requires 

heads of department to conduct Training Needs Identification (TNI) for their staff, who will participate 

the training identified on specific dates.     

Orientation briefings for new joiners and other in-house trainings are conducted on a need basis by 

our senior executives.  On average, employees of The Group requiring external training received 35 

hours of training in FY2018 (FY2017: 15) mainly on increased necessity in operational skills to keep 

abreast of the on-going plant expansion.
