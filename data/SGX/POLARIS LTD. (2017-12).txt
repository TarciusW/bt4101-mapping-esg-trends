Sustainability Report 

 

Introduction  

Polaris Ltd (“Polaris”) is pleased to present its first annual Sustainability Report. The report captures 

Polaris’s sustainability effort, performance and strategies over the financial year January 1, 2017 to 

December 31, 2017 (“FY2017”). This report includes the environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

performance for our business operations in Singapore and excludes overseas operations unless stated 

otherwise.  

This report has been prepared in accordance with the latest Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) 

Sustainability Reporting Guidelines: Core options. The GRI Content Index and the relevant references 

are provided on pages 12 – 14 of the report. Information presented in this report has been extracted 

from primary internal records and documents to ensure accuracy. 

Reporting Principles  

We have followed the GRI principles for defining the sustainability report content and quality. We 

have prepared the report having considered stakeholder inclusiveness, Polaris’s sustainability context, 

materiality and completeness. To ensure quality of the report, we have applied the GRI principles of 

accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness in preparing this report. 

Reporting Process  

Polaris’s Sustainability Committee (the “Committee”), which includes key members of management 

and executive directors, provides the overall major direction for preparing the report. The 

Committee’s responsibilities include reviewing, assessing and determining the sustainability context, 

material ESG topics, report content and topic boundaries, scope and prioritisation of issues to be 

included in the report. The Committee takes into consideration formal and informal feedback received 

throughout the year from a range of internal and external stakeholders to determine the most 

relevant material topics to be covered in the report.  

Reporting Cycle  

Our reporting cycle begins with a review of the Company’s ESG factors and material topics and their 

context in light of business environment changes and stakeholder feedback. 

Feedback  

We welcome feedback from all stakeholders. Please send questions, comments, suggestions or 

feedback relating to this report or our sustainability performance to ir@wearepolaris.com.

Letter to Stakeholders 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

  

As it always has been and always will be, the world is changing. 

 

Every generation has its own challenges and it can be argued that sustainability is at the top of our 

list. While environmental sustainability might come first to mind, the making of this report reminded 

us of the many shapes and forms of sustainability we have to address as a company. It helped us assess 

the overall state of our sustainability and encouraged us to consider how external events might affect 

us and develop strategies in relation to sustainability accordingly. The objective is to instill qualities 

and values in Polaris that deliver long-term success and make us a positive contributor to the 

community around us. 

  

To be able to take on today's challenges, and even thrive and prosper amidst the rapid changes around 

us, will take concerted and sustained efforts. As we communicate in this report, a plan for long term 

sustainability has been drawn up and execution on it started. Sustainability is now a top priority at 

Polaris. 

  

For environmental sustainability, we take inspiration and guidance from the UN Sustainable 

Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement. While having a modest overall environmental 

footprint, Polaris continually look for ways to reduce our energy consumption, minimize our waste 

and improve reuse and recycling efforts. Apart from being guided by the international efforts 

mentioned above, internal employee knowledge and business partners such as Apple, Dyson and 

Singtel all help us improve. 

  

With regards to business sustainability, our focus is on attracting, retaining and training great talent. 

Diversity, equal opportunity and an overall positive working environment are attributes that we strive 

for every day. Committed employees make Polaris successful and sustainable. Privacy and data 

security are areas of focus and also benefit from our reputable business partners' guidelines and 

systems. 

 

With procurement being a common area of governance concern, we decided to share our framework 

to address it here in our first report. In addition, the upcoming changes to the Code of 

Corporate Governance and the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Rules 

will be an area of focus going forward. Management is reviewing each business unit for optimizations 

and viability, with the objective and ambition to increase our reserves and improve our ability to 

expand investments in selected businesses.  

  

Significant efforts are also being made to engage more closely with our external stakeholders. This 

includes timely announcements for all shareholders and cultivating constructive relationships with key 

investors.  Internally, business unit heads and the executive office work closely together to enable and 

encourage speedy decision making, such as for closing deals, solving problems, entering new 

businesses or exiting existing ones. Customer service will be improved through training and by 

increasing the number of agents, enhancing the quality of service, as well as reducing waiting and 

turn-around times. 

  

This first Sustainability Report has also provided us with a structured process to guide our 

improvement efforts going forward, with selected data points to measure ourselves by. Moreover, as 

other companies in Singapore make their own sustainability reports available, best practices and 


 

3 

benchmarks are shared, benefitting our local community and society at large. At Polaris, we look 

forward to keep learning from this process as well as share our efforts and improvements.

Our Materiality Topics 

We have identified material topics for reporting based on the significance of our ESG and economic 

impacts and the degree of influence where we see the most potential for creating maximum value for 

our shareholders and stakeholders. In order to ensure an accurate determination of material issues, 

we undertook a process of identification, prioritisation and validation with our management team.  

Each sustainability factor is assigned a reporting priority that determines the actions required, as 

illustrated below: 

Description 

Criteria 

High 

Factors with high reporting priority are reported in detail. 

Medium 

Factors with medium reporting priority are considered for inclusion in the 

Report.  

Low

requirements.  

 

A summary of Polaris’s material ESG and economic issues, where the impact occurs and Polaris’s 

involvement in respect of such impacts is presented in the table below. A more detailed discussion on 

the material topics, including the management approach, will be covered in the respective chapters

Our Environmental Efforts  

Carbon Emissions 

We believe in progressively reducing our organisation’s carbon footprint by improving energy 

efficiency and minimising energy consumption. Polaris’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission is 

attributed to the use of electricity, diesel and petrol. Our emission intensity in 2017 was calculated at 

0.0028 tonnes CO2e per onsite repair jobs. Emission from electricity represented 99% of our total 

carbon.  

Energy 

In our daily operations, electricity which is used to power our office buildings and retail outlets has 

contributed to the majority of our energy consumption. Other notable consumption components 

include petroleum or diesel that is used for transportation and logistics. In FY2017, our total energy 

intensity was calculated at 0.357 per square metres. Each department’s consumption is depicted in 

Figure 1 as shown below:  

 

In FY2017, Polaris carried out a renovation exercise by changing all of the local office building ceiling 

lights to energy-saving ones. This reflects our commitment to continuously reducing and monitoring 

our energy consumption across all of our businesses. 

Waste Minimisation 

Our management approach is to reduce, reuse and recycle waste wherever possible throughout our 

daily operations. Waste from our operations includes paper and packaging waste. In FY2018, we are 

looking to implement a recycling initiative for Dyson parts.   

Over the years, Polaris has implemented several other initiatives to reduce printed marketing 

materials. We have switched to sending e-cards during festive seasons from the conventional printed 

greeting cards. Empty ink cartridges are consolidated and returned back to supplier bimonthly. 

Packaging waste are consolidated and recycled on a weekly basis.

Our Workplace  

Polaris practices fair employment and is aligned with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment 

guidelines. Our human resource policies are aimed at providing a fair performance-based work culture 

that is diverse, inclusive and collaborative. We also encourage our people to reach their fullest 

potential and provide them with a fulfilling and meaningful career.  

As of 31 December 2017, Polaris employed 74 people. Permanent employees, which includes part-

time employees, represented 97% of the total headcount. Employees with managerial or supervisory 

roles accounted for 17% of our workforce.  

Talent Attraction and Retention 

We believe investing in our people is crucial to the success of a business. We manage our human 

capital investment by attracting and nurturing the right talent, as well as caring for their professional 

growth and personal well-being during their employment with us. This can be attested by Polaris’s low 

staff attrition rate.  

In addition, we leverage our partnership with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) to support 

work-study programmes, providing internship opportunities to students as part of their course 

modules. This programme is designed to prepare students for the future workforce by equipping them 

with employable, real-world skills and experiences, whilst allowing them to complete their studies.  

Training and Education 

With the rapid changes in our industry, it is important for our people to keep updated on the latest 

industry developments. At Polaris, we encourage and aim to provide all employees with equal 

opportunities for training and upgrading. We believe that learning and training is an important, 

continuous and life-long process so that employees are equipped with the competencies needed to 

meet current and future business needs. This includes workshops, seminars, conferences, in-house 

company training and on-the-job training.  

We strongly believe that it is important to continuously provide our employees with the correct 

training. This, in return, allows the business to be cost-effective, increasing credibility and expertise as 

well as improving job satisfaction, and creates a competitive edge in the market.  

Diversity and Equal Opportunity 

We believe that creating a diverse workplace environment is essential to building and sustaining our 

competitive advantage. Such diversity fosters innovative thinking and helps tackle business challenges 

through different perspectives.  

Moreover, we strive to offer equal opportunities in hiring, career advancements, promotions and 

remuneration based on merit and experience irrespective of gender, age, racial, ethnic or cultural 

background. Female employees account for 39% of our total workforce. There are three women who 

hold a managerial position in the company and one woman who holds a director position in the 

company.  

Marketing and Labelling 

Polaris has formed strategic partnerships with global mobile device manufacturers, consumer 

electronic companies and leading telecommunication service providers to offer its customers with a 

wide range of latest innovative consumer devices and services. 

 


 

12 

We recognise that fair marketing practices and being transparent in the way we communicate can 

build trust and loyalty among our customers, partners and suppliers. We adhere to strict marketing 

codes to ensure that all marketing activities comply with the various laws and guidelines such as the 

Singapore Code of Advertising Practice, the Info-communications Media Development Authority’s 

Codes of Practice and Guidelines, and the PDPA.  

In FY2017, we have not identified any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes 

concerning information and labelling, or marketing communications including advertising, promotion 

and sponsorships in relation to products and services that we offer.  

Moving forward, we strive to maintain the quality of our products and services as well as retail and 

distribution channels by choosing the right type of products and services to fit our business model. 

Quality checks will also be continuously deployed by our staff to ensure compliance with applicable 

regulations relating to marketing and labelling in the markets we operate.  

Our Economy 

Our management approach is to create value for our shareholders and stakeholders by ensuring 

sustainable growth for our business. We are focused on adopting strategies that maximise shareholder 

returns while creating environmental, social and economic value for our stakeholders.  

We regularly review our management approach in view of the business goals, stakeholder 

expectations and the actual performance to evaluate effectiveness.  

Anti-Corruption  

Polaris adheres to a zero-tolerance policy on fraud and unethical conduct including corruption and 

bribery. A whistle-blowing process is in place and supported. There was no reported incident of 

corruption in the reporting period.  

Procurement Governance 

Polaris adopts a fair business trading framework and procures from suppliers who conduct business 

ethically.  

With the extensive varieties and ranges of products to procure from different sectors of suppliers, we 

have stringent procurement processes in place to ensure good corporate governance and compliance 

with anti-bribery and corruption rules and regulations. 

Our procured products and supplies are from two groups: principle brands which the business units 

are representing, namely Apple, Dyson, Makeblock and Singtel; and other suppliers for products such 

as mobile phone and computer accessories and audio devices. 

We encourage and support local businesses. In FY2017, our total purchase spending exceeded $60 

million. Out of our 35 regular vendors, only one was from overseas import as we represent the brand 

as its distributor in Singapore. This overseas vendor comprises 0.25% of our total purchases. 

We work actively to combat corruption in all of its forms, which includes bribery, unfair competition, 

conflicts of interest, fraud, embezzlement and unlawful kickbacks. 

All procurement is processed through our Enterprise Resource Planning system with its multi-tiered 

approval process, whereby up to three levels of approving officers are required to approve and sign 

off on the issuing of Purchase Orders in the system. This is to address conflicts of interest and ensure 

the correct latest purchase price, as illustrated in the diagram below. 


 

13 

 

 

 

 

As an integral part of supply chain management, we also diligently sort out the delivered goods 

packaging and ensure that they are disposed of in an environmentally and responsible manner. 

Going forward, we are looking at improving our warehousing and storage spaces to ensure better 

workplace safety and health.
