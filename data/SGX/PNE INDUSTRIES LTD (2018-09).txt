BOARD STATEMENT  

PNE is pleased to present its inaugural Sustainability Report for the financial year 2018. The report 

highlights PNE’s commitment towards sustainability, operational efficiency and a sound corporate 

governance.  

To better enforce the sustainability strategies, the ISO14001 steering committee has been tasked to 

monitor and review the progress of those implemented. 

 

Figure 1: Structure of the ISO14001 Steering Committee 

ENVIRONMENT 

Minimizing the harmful impact on the environment has been core to our business strategies which not 

only makes us a successful business but also a sustainable business – creating numerous benefits for 

the environment and the community we operate in.  

Employee training has been conducted to raise awareness of such vital issues which include conducting 

a supplier assessment, minimizing the use of electricity etc. Moreover, an environmental policy has also 

been established by the top management which has been effectively communicated to all stakeholders 

for continual improvement in the environmental performance relating to our activities, products and 

services. We have established various environmental objectives which include reducing solder dross and 

reducing electricity usage by replacing fluorescent lights with LED lights, and the results are constantly 

monitored and tracked to ensure the operational effectiveness and efficiency of our company.  

 

SOCIAL 

We believe that employee growth and development is vital to the success of our company, and hence; 

we emphasize on employee training, development and growth. This can be highlighted by each 

employee clocking in more than  18 hours of training on average.  

High emphasis is placed on the training of our employees due to the nature of our operations, to ensure 

that our employees are always updated with the latest technological advancements and trends. 

Moreover, due to the style of our business operations, it is our fundamental responsibility to ensure that 

our employees are operating in a safe and healthy environment. Hence, we have an active health and 




5 

 

 

safety committee which ensures the well-being and safety of our employees by ensuring that they are 

trained to handle complicated machinery, operated in a safe working environment and maintain good 

discipline. With these policies in place, we have been able to achieve an accident-free status in our 

business operations.  

Strong emphasis is placed on internal opportunities for career growth, where an individual from within 

the company is given higher preference for promotion in comparison to hiring someone externally. We 

also conduct an annual appraisal for all our employees where we reward them for their strengths and 

also encourage them to further build upon their existing strengths. The annual appraisal also caters for 

promotion of deserving employees.  

 

GOVERNANCE  

Incorporating corporate governance in our business strategies when achieving our sustainability goals 

is vital. We aim on developing an ecosystem where the highest standards of governance, and the best 

practices are applied in our day to day operations. The foundation of our business lies on transparency, 

integrity and accountability which we strive to maintain for the coming years while successfully meeting 

our business objectives.

ENVIRONMENT 

ENERGY 

Being involved in the manufacturing of electrical products, PNE tends to consume energy in the form of 

electricity with a high proportion being utilized at their manufacturing plants. However, since PNE is 

highly dedicated to develop a sustainable business model, various efforts and practices have been in 

place to control the amount of energy consumed and going forward PNE aims on utilizing renewable 

sources of energy as part of their manufacturing process. The electricity usage is monitored on a daily 

basis to filter out and investigate any anomalies. Specialists visit the electrical room, transformer room 

and main switch board room twice a month to monitor and carefully assess the readings to ensure that 

there is no abnormality in PNE’s electricity usage. The total amount of energy consumed by PNE in 

FY2018 totaled 4,665,571 kWh.

Table 3: Targets and Status of Electricity Consumed by PNE for FY2018 and FY2019 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE  

PNE is dedicated to complying with all the local and international laws and regulations such as the 

ISO14001:2015 to eliminate, prevent and minimize environmental pollution. The top management has 

established an environmental policy which specifies the objectives and strategic directions for all internal 

and external parties to familiarize them with PNE’s environmental policy and their responsibility to 

ensure that PNE complies with its policy. Training is provided to all employees for them to understand 

the requirements thoroughly as well. PNE has a dedicated team as well which keeps track of changes in 

all the laws and regulations PNE is required to comply with and also ensures that the company is meeting 

the requirements of all the policies.

PNE has completely adhered to all the laws and regulations in place which can be supported by zero 

monetary value of significant fines, non-monetary sanctions and cases brought through dispute 

resolution mechanisms. PNE strives to maintain this track record in the coming years and further tighten 

their policies to ensure that this track record is maintained as well.  

 

Figure 4: Monetary Fines placed on PNE due to Non-Compliance with Environmental Laws and/or Regulations 

 

SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT  

PNE’s strong dedication towards becoming a sustainable business, encourages PNE to evaluate all its 

potential suppliers to ensure that the suppliers onboarding meet the environmental standards required 

by PNE. When screening a supplier, PNE refers to a supplier assessment form which requires the 

suppliers to meet a set of standards. The suppliers are assessed on various topics which have been 

included in the table below.  

 

Figure 5: Supplier Assessment Criteria 

In FY2018, PNE on boarded 44 additional suppliers for its operations in Malaysia and 10 additional 

suppliers for its operations in China, thus the total number of additional suppliers on boarded would be 

54. PNE has ensured that the additional suppliers who on boarded the company in FY2018 have gone 

through the supplier assessment screening. PNE maintains an approved vendor list as well, where all 

the suppliers in the list go through an annual screening to ensure that the list is updated and all the 

companies on the list coincide with PNE’s policy.

SOCIAL 

EMPLOYMENT  

PNE strongly aims on hiring a diverse and qualified workforce which would add value to its company. 

There are various practices in place to ensure that PNE carries out an inclusive and fair recruitment 

practice based on age and gender. This would diffuse fresh perspective into the company and enable 

PNE to continue to be competitive amongst its peers.

Table 4: Summary and Targets of New Hires and Turnovers in FY2018   

 

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

PNE’s priority is the safety of its employees and several policies have been established to ensure that 

rates of injuries, occupational diseases, lost days and absenteeism and the number of work-related 

fatalities are minimal. PNE complies with all local occupational health and safety (OSH) regulations.  

To achieve an accident free status, PNE emphasizes strongly on the need for all employees to attend 

training, work in a safe environment and maintain good discipline. PNE believes that its employees are 

great assets to the company, and their well-being and safety would translate to high productivity and 

higher quality products being produced which would result in greater customer satisfaction as well.  To 

further achieve this, PNE has an active safety and health committee which works towards ensuring that 

the working environment at PNE is safe and sound. The health and safety procedures go through regular 

audit procedurals to confirm that the policies in place are updated and the safety of PNE’s employees is 

not compromised.  

In 2018, the number of injuries totaled to zero and PNE aims on maintaining this rate for the upcoming 

financial years as well. The rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost days, and absenteeism, and the 

number of work related fatalities have been summarised below.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION 

Investment in constantly evolving the skills of its employees is essential, since this would benefit the 

organization with higher productivity, higher employee satisfaction and greater efficiency further 

translating to a higher staff retention rate.  

With the aim of constantly enhancing the skills of the employees, PNE has established several programs. 

The senior management builds a training calendar at the start of the year depending on the needs and 

requirements of its employees when they are in the process of being transferred or promoted. External 

trainers are hired by PNE to train its employees, the training programs are tweaked by the trainers so 

that it successfully meets the needs of PNE and its employees. Different employee categories are 

subjected to different sets of training. The factory workers go through additional on the job and safety 

training at the manufacturing plants and the employees at the managerial level go through training to 

better manage their teams and also showcase effective leadership. There are regular appraisals which 

take place within the company to further motivate and boost the capabilities of the employees.   

In the financial year 2018, the total number of training hours offered to the employees was 24,120 

hours and on average each employee received more than 18 hours of training.
