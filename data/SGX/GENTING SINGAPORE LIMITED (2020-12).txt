SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

02.MESSAGE FROM OUR PRESIDENT

The	 world	 experienced	 one	 of	 the	 most	 significant	 periods	

of public health challenge with the COVID-19 pandemic and 

climate threats with extreme weather events. Whilst they 

created massive disruptions to people and businesses around 

the	 world,	 they	 also	 raised	 awareness	 of	 the	 importance	 of	

Environment,	 Social	 and	 Governance	 (ESG)	 and	 created	 a	

strong	urgency	to	tackle	environmental,	social	and	public	health	

issues. 

RWS is fully committed to the advancement of our sustainability 

efforts	in	five	key	focus	areas	–	People,	Customer,	Community,	

Environment and Marketplace. We responded to the pandemic 

in	multiple	ways	to	support	not	only	our	customers,	partners	

and employees but also the communities where we live and 

work.	We	fully	support	the	Singapore	Government’s	efforts	in	

deed	 and	 action	 in	 the	 fight	 against	 the	 community	 spread	

of COVID-19 by stepping forward as Managing Agent of 

Singapore’s	 two	 largest	 national	 Community	 Care	 Facilities	

(CCF)	at	the	Singapore	EXPO	and	MAX	Atria,	and	the	Big	Box	

warehouse	 mall	 which	 represents	 27%	 of	 total	 national	 bed	

space. Leveraging on our strength in hospitality and expertise 

in	 managing	 large-scale,	 non-medical	 facilities,	 more	 than	

2,000	of	our	employees	heeded	the	call	for	volunteers	and	put	

themselves on the frontline to help contain the national outbreak 

of COVID-19 successfully.  

The safety of our guests and employees remains our priority. In 

our	efforts	to	safeguard	them	from	COVID-19,	we	implemented	

multiple Safe Management Measures (SMM) to keep them 

protected as much as possible. Anti-microbial coatings are 

applied	 on	 the	 high-touch	 point	 surfaces,	 over	 600	 sets	 of	

Plasmacluster ionisers are deployed resort-wide and High 

Efficiency	 Particulate	 Air	 (HEPA)	 filters	 are	 installed	 in	 the	 air	

exchange system. 

On	the	responsible	gambling	front,	we	launched	the	Manage	

Game	 Play	 (MGP)	 Programme	 in	 2020	 –	 a	 voluntary	 tool	

developed with the Ministry of Social and Family Development 

(MSF) to help patrons self-regulate time spent at gaming 

machines.	 The	 programme	 proved	 successful,	 with	 90%	

of	 survey	 respondents	 confirming	 their	 positive	 views	 of	 the	

programme’s	efficacy.

2020 marks the beginning of the climate mitigation decade 

with	 minimum	 time	 of	 just	 over	 10	 years	 to	 achieve	 halved	

GHG emissions to keep global warming to 1.5°C. Thus it 

comes as no surprise that climate action initiatives continue to 

dominate government agenda with strong focus on roles and 

responsibilities that businesses need to play. We continue to 

make good stride on climate actions with over 81% and 64% 

cumulative energy and water consumption savings respectively 

versus	 2013	 levels,	 and	 46%	 reduction	 in	 waste	 sent	 for	

incineration.	In	recognition	of	our	sustained	efforts	in	packaging	

water	reduction,	we	were	accorded	Top	Achievement	Award	for	

the 2020 Singapore Packaging Agreement Award for the third 

consecutive year. Additional infrastructure was also installed to 

support the use of electric vehicles. 

Our sustainability strategy also entails focus on responsible 

sourcing,	 and	 fair	 and	 ethical	 business	 dealings.	 For	

advancements	made	in	these	areas,	we	were	accorded	the	

2020 CIPS Asia Award (Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; 

Supply)	for	successful	digital	procurement	transformation,	and	

earned high commendation for impactful positive contribution 

from	sustained	responsible	sourcing	efforts.	

With	the	devastating	effects	of	the	pandemic	and	manifested	

consequences	 of	 climate	 change,	 more	 collaborative	 and	

collective actions need to be taken urgently. We are reviewing 

our	long	term	sustainability	targets	for	2021	to	2030	with	the	

view of improving our achievements and instilling urgency to 

our business units to better address targets in support of the 

United	Nation’s	Sustainable	Development	Goals,	Paris	Climate	

Agreement and the Singapore Sustainable Blueprint plans. 

I	would	like	to	extend	our	gratitude	to	our	employees,	partners	

and	stakeholders	for	their	support	in	our	sustainability	journey.	

We will continue to pursue best in class sustainability practices 

as	Asia’s	leading	leisure	and	tourism	destination	for	the	sake	of	

our generations to come.

BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT

03.BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS, 

Sustainability Report 2020 sets out what we have 

accomplished in 2020 and marks the end of the 

Sustainability21 Strategy. 

Since	2019,	the	Sustainability21	has	been	built	on	five	

pillars	of	Marketplace,	Environment,	Customers,	People	

and	Community.	The	five	pillars,	which	are	aligned	with	

the	national	and	international	interests,	have	enabled	us	

to sharpen our focus on the ESG issues that are most 

pertinent to Genting Singapore.

Our	 Sustainability	 Focus	 underpins	 our	 management’s	

approach	 in	 developing	 policies	 and	 practices,	 setting	

performance targets and action plans with a goal of 

creating sustainable value for all stakeholders. 

In	 2020,	 the	 Board	 maintained	 oversight	 over	 the	

Sustainability Working Committee and Sustainability 

Steering	 Committee,	 ensuring	 the	 continued	 relevance	

of	 the	 ESG	 material	 matters	 to	 our	 operations,	 taking	

into	 account	 of	 the	 global	 dynamics,	 local	 trends	 and	

emerging regulatory developments.

When	

reviewing,	

monitoring	

and	

managing	

the	

sustainability	 risks	 and	 opportunities,	 the	 Board	

emphasised on improving the sustainability performance 

of business practices and the transparency of disclosures. 

Despite	 the	 COVID-19	 disruption	 to	 our	 business,	

Genting Singapore has remained committed to good 

sustainability performance. We will remain vigilant and 

steadfast	 in	 our	 commitments	 to	 sustainability	 efforts	

for the sustainable growth and development of the 

community and environment which we are a part of.

ANTI-CORRUPTION: 

A ZERO TOLERANCE 

APPROACH

COMPLIANCE

We adopt a zero-tolerance stance against bribery or corruption. Every supplier is required to adhere to our Supplier 

Code of Conduct which details our stance on zero tolerance against bribery or corruption. All our team members are 

required	to	acknowledge	online	that	they	have	read,	understand	and	agree	to	comply	with	our	Code	of	Conduct	on	

an annual basis.

As part of our commitment to conducting business in compliance with all applicable laws (including the Singapore 

Prevention	of	Corruption	Act)	and	maintaining	the	highest	ethical	standards,	we	have	whistle-blowing	channels	to	

ensure	that	concerns	can	(whether	anonymously	or	otherwise)	be	raised	in	a	safe,	transparent	and	accountable	

manner,	without	fear	of	reprisal	in	any	form.	This	whistle-blowing	policy	is	also	applicable	for	anyone	who	has	a	

business relationship with Genting Singapore. The whistle-blowing platforms include whistleblower hotline and email 

channels,	which	are	overseen	by	the	Audit	and	Risk	Committee,	and	administered	with	the	assistance	of	the	Head	of	

Internal Audit.

In	2020,	we	achieved	zero	incidences	of	confirmed	incidents	related	to	corruption.

The	Compliance	Committee	–	which	comprises	RWS	Director	and	Senior	Management	personnel	from	the	Legal,	

Gaming,	Information	Technology,	Finance	and	Compliance	Departments	–	is	dedicated	to	overseeing	compliance-

related matters. All incidents of non-compliance will be reviewed by our compliance team and reported to the 

Committee.	The	Committee	meets	at	least	quarterly	to	assess	the	compliance	risks,	evaluate	the	effectiveness	of	

mitigation controls and ensure progress on any action plans on the agenda.

In	2020,	we	did	not	incur	any	significant	fine*	from	the	Casino	Regulatory	Authority	(CRA)	and	the	National	Environment	

Agency (NEA). We will continue to strive towards achieving zero non-compliance cases.

WASTE 

Waste management and minimisation are key strategies 

for our organisation to ensure sustainable and responsible 

use	of	resources.	To	move	towards	a	Zero	Waste	Nation,	

Genting Singapore remains committed in identifying 

innovative	ways	to	promote	the	3Rs	(Reduce,	Reuse	and	

Recycle)	 principles	 across	 the	 resort,	 and	 being	 more	

efficient	in	our	waste	management.

MAKE	RECYCLING	FUN 

AND REWARDING

REVERSE VENDING MACHINE (RVM)

In	collaboration	with	NEA,	an	RVM	was	placed	at	RWS	

since July 2020. It is one of the 45 smart RVMs placed 

across Singapore to encourage Singaporeans to adopt 

eco-conscious lifestyles.

The RVM allows our guests to deposit empty beverage 

containers,	such	as	bottles	and	cans,	for	recycling.	It	can	

store up to 400 polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles 

and 800 cans in separate compartments. The items 

are crushed automatically to increase storage capacity 

and prevent liquid spillage before being transferred to 

recycling	facilities.	Thereafter,	the	recyclable	items	will	be	

transferred to the recycling facilities.

Guests	contributing	to	this	green	effort	are	rewarded	with	

small	appreciation	tokens,	which	are	offered	in	partnership	

with Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC).

Since	 its	 implementation	 in	 July	 2020,	 the	 RVM	 has	

recycled	 76kg	 of	 recyclable	 waste.	 The	 volume	 of	

recyclables has increased gradually as more guests visit 

RWS	after	the	easing	of	the	Circuit	Breaker’s	restrictions.

ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY 

PRODUCTS

Across	the	organisation,	we	strive	to	minimise	printed	

materials by encouraging the use of electronic materials 

among our team members as well as external exhibitors 

and event organisers. In the event where use of physical 

materials	is	necessary,	we	offer	eco-friendly	products	as	

much	as	possible,	including	reusable	aluminium	banner	

extrusions,	 biodegradable	 signboards	 and	 Forest	

Stewardship	Council	(FSC)-certified	paper.

In partnership with Dyson to promote a more eco-friendly 

integrated	resort,	we	installed	two	Dyson	Airblade	9kJ	

hand dryers at the S.E.A.A. Discovery Pool. As guests 

have to wash their hands before experiencing the 

Discovery	Pool,	the	Dyson	hand	dryers	eliminate	the	use	

of single-use paper towels. This reduces the amount of 

waste	 generated	 across	 the	 resort,	 thereby	 reducing	

carbon	 emissions	 that	 can	 cause	 ocean	 acidification	

and accelerate climate change. The dryers are also 

equipped	with	High	Efficiency	filters	that	can	purify	air	

blown	onto	guests’	and	team	members’	hands.

In	2020,	there	was	a	decrease	in	the	amount	of	waste	generated	across	the	resort	due	to	our	business	suspension	

during	the	Circuit	Breaker.	The	total	recycling	ratio,	which	signifies	the	amount	of	waste	recycled,	dropped	from	24%	

in	2019	to	17%	in	2020	due	to	an	increase	of	non-recyclable	waste	in	the	pandemic	year.

EFFICIENT WASTE MANAGEMENT

FOOD GRINDER STATIONS AND SMART BINS

To	improve	our	ecological	footprint,	we	have	implemented	three	food	grinder	stations.	These	machines	automatically	

grind	food	waste	to	a	pulp,	which	is	automatically	transported	to	a	bio-digester	that	converts	95%	of	food	waste	it	

receives	into	liquid	to	reduce	waste	volume.	As	a	result,	lesser	waste	are	sent	for	incineration	and	to	Singapore’s	

landfill	-	Pulau	Semakau.	In	addition,	72,000	plastic	trash	bags	are	saved	every	year	with	this	more	efficient	waste	

management.

We	have	also	deployed	17	Smart	Bins,	which	reduce	the	number	of	regular	bins	from	104	to	43.	These	energy-saving	

solar-powered,	larger-capacity	compactor	bins	are	able	to	compact	trash,	increasing	trash	capacity	by	eight	fold.	This	

reduces	labour	as	less	trips	are	needed	by	cleaners	to	clear	trash.	Instead,	cleaners	are	notified	via	SMS	once	the	bin	

is	full,	reducing	the	frequency	of	trash	clearing	by	25%.

Moving	forward,	Genting	Singapore	will	continue	to	support	NEA	in	promoting	recycling.	We	will	continue	to	seek	

innovative	ways	to	better	engage	both	our	team	members	and	guests	in	sustainability.	We	aim	to	offer	more	recycling	

receptacles across RWS to encourage our team members and guests to recycle. We will also work closely with our 

waste	management	service	provider	in	increasing	the	efficiency	of	waste	transportation	and	facilities.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

ENERGY

As	an	integrated	resort,	RWS	requires	a	sizeable	amount	of	energy	to	ensure	smooth-running	of	operations.	As	a	

result,	we	are	on	a	continuous	lookout	for	methods	to	conserve	energy	and	maximise	our	energy	efficiency.		

ENERGY	CONSERVATION

Genting Singapore implemented a Building Energy 

Management	System	(BEMS),		which	is	also	called	the	

Integrated	Utilities	Monitoring	System	(IUMS),	to	monitor	

major	utility	consumption	of	electricity,	water	and	chilled	

water. The IUMS allows the Facilities Management and 

Engineering (FME) department to track and monitor 

various	 consumption	 trends	 across	 the	 resort,	 detect	

abnormalities,	explore	new	energy-saving	opportunities,	

and	more	importantly,	track	the	effectiveness	of	energy	

saving	projects.	The	system	better	helps	us	to	plan	and	

execute initiatives that can boost our energy and water 

efficiencies.

Due	to	the	COVID-19	pandemic,	some	of	our	energy-

saving	projects,	which	were	planned	to	be	implemented	

in	2020,	were	deferred.

As part of the Safe Management Measures for our guests 

and	team	members	during	the	Circuit	Breaker,	we	mass	

deployed various disinfecting equipment like the portable 

air	 purifiers	 and	 Ultraviolet	 (UV)	 germicidal	 irradiators	

across	RWS,	which	resulted	in	an	unplanned	increase	in	

the electricity usage.

Nevertheless,	 we	 were	 able	 to	 gather	 and	 streamline	

resources	to	focus	on	existing	operational	savings,	such	

as optimising the air-conditioner temperature set points 

during	the	Circuit	Breaker.	With	these	continual	efforts,	a	

total	of	2,637,640	kWh	was	saved	in	2020.	We	have	also	

attained	 a	 cumulative	 energy	 savings	 of	 276,666,325	

kWh	 since	 2013,	 which	 can	 power	 more	 than	 39,900	

units of four-room Housing Development Board (HDB) 

flats	for	a	year	and	well	exceeded	our	five-year	target	set	

in 2015.

COOLING &amp; HEATING

Our	 award-winning	 district	 cooling	 plant,	 which	 is	 an	

industry	leader	in	plant	efficiency,	is	a	significant	factor	

in optimising our electricity and water usage. The 

plant	 is	 able	 to	 function	 at	 benchmark	 Coefficient	 of	

Performance (COP) with its advanced controllers that run 

on	customised	algorithms	that	control	and	vary	multiple,	

complex	operational	parameters	of	the	chillers,	pumps,	

cooling towers and heat exchangers automatically for 

optimal	efficiency.

In	addition,	we	upgraded	the	water	heaters	at	the	Beach	

Villas	with	state-of-the-art	heat	pumps,	which	consume	

less energy to produce hot water. The heat pumps also 

generate cooling energy for the cooling applications as a 

by-product.

CARPARK SENSORS

As	 part	 of	 our	 energy-saving	 measures,	 air	 quality	

monitoring	sensors	were	installed	in	RWS’	underground	

carparks. These sensors enabled us to operate the 

ventilation fans in our carparks optimally by monitoring 

the air quality and run the ventilation fans only when 

necessary.

ENERGY FROM THE SUN – SOLAR PANELS

We also use renewable energy to decrease our carbon 

footprint.	 Our	 photovoltaic	 solar	 farm,	 which	 can	 be	

found	 in	 USS,	 spans	 about	 4,500	 sqm	 in	 total	 and	

generated	 657,445	 kWh	 of	 energy	 in	 2020.	 This	 is	

sufficient	to	power	about	155	four-room	HDB	flats	for 

a year.

CLEAN ENERGY DRIVE

To increase our utilisation of clean energy and support 

the	 growing	 reception	 of	 Electric	 Vehicles	 (EV),	 we	

partnered with Singapore Power Mobility (SPM) to 

introduce eight EV fast chargers across four locations. 

Since	the	introduction	of	these	EV	fast	chargers,	they	

have	been	used	more	than	1,200	times.	In	addition,	four	

EV lots have been allocated for the BlueSG vehicles to 

support the EV-sharing ecosystem.

WATER AND EFFLUENTS

06.ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

Water	is	a	natural	resource	that	we	highly	value	and	use	with	the	utmost	efficiency.	In	Genting	Singapore,	we	monitor,	

use	and	deploy	various	sources	of	water	strategically	across	the	resort:	

Cumulative Water Savings and Performance Against Target

Our team members conduct monthly meetings to identify new opportunities in water conservation and threats of 

abnormal	water	consumption.	Overall,	we	have	attained	a	total	cumulative	of	1,831,923	m3	water	savings	since	2015,	

well exceeding our 5-year target set back in 2015.

City Water 

We use city water 

across our hospitality 

and entertainment 

venues,	via	water-

efficient	taps,	showers	

and systems.

Reclaimed Water 

We deploy a water 

reclamation system for the 

District Cooling Plant to 

recycle and reuse the cooling 

tower blow-down water and 

surface	run-off	water, 

 thereby reducing freshwater 

intake	by	almost	7%.

Harvested Rainwater 

We harvest rainwater for 

irrigation purposes in RWS.

BIODIVERSITY

RWS	has	the	privilege	of	housing	2.9	hectares	of	protected	secondary	forest	and	more	than	100,000	marine	animals	in	

our	establishment.	As	such,	we	greatly	value	this	co-existence	and	strive	to	build	and	sustain	a	supportive	relationship	

with our environment. We are conscious that we are part of the larger Sentosa Island biodiversity system and that our 

secondary	forest	serves	as	a	buffer	for	Mount	Imbiah,	one	of	the	two	nature	areas	on	the	island.

RWS also records the native plants and marine species within our premises. Among plants and animals under our 

care,	several	species	are	listed	under	national	and	international	conservation	lists	for	their	vulnerable	status.

LAND	BIODIVERSITY

We conserve and care for trees that are found naturally 

in	 RWS,	 especially	 the	 Heritage	 Tree	 -	 Garcinia	

hombroniana (Seashore Mangosteen) in USS. This 

seashore mangosteen is the largest among its species 

in Singapore.

Visual	Tree	Assessment	(VTA),	with	levels	1,	2,	and	3,	is	

conducted periodically on the Heritage Tree to monitor its 

health.	In	addition,	regular	tree	pruning	is	done	to	manage	

its	tree	crown,	and	to	establish	the	Root	Protection	Zone	

(RPZ)	to	reduce	any	negative	impact	on	the	tree’s	growth.	

Soil treatment is also conducted on a regular basis to 

prevent any termite infestation.

LANDSCAPE ACTIVITY DURING 

CIRCUIT BREAKER 

During	the	Circuit	Breaker,	our	lean	landscaping	team	of	

five	worked	closely	to	maintain	greenery	in	our	49	hectares

ENGAGEMENT 

Despite	 the	 COVID-19	 pandemic,	 the	 environment	

remains in need of care and conservation. As RWS 

resumed	 its	 operations,	 we	 had	 to	 consider	 new	

approaches	 to	 maintain	 efforts	 in	 outreach	 and	

engagement for both team members and the general 

public.

The months of April to June 2020 were designated as 

the	 Attractions’	 “Conservation	 Quarter”.	 During	 the	

year,	 	 environmentally-friendly	 recommendations	 and	

energy-saving tips were uploaded weekly onto our 

RWS Attractions page with more than 500 followers to 

encourage fellow team members to take up and support 

the cause.

To	further	scientific	advancement	opportunities,	a	team	

consisting	 of	 aquarists	 and	 Education,	 Research	 and	

Conservation (ERC) team members worked closely 

to conduct a study on preferred feeding methods of 

the	 vulnerable	 bumphead	 parrotfish	 housed	 in	 S.E.A.	

Aquarium.	The	capacity	building	of	scientific	knowledge	

for	our	team	members	can	go	a	long	way	in	efforts	toward	

caring	 for	 bumphead	 parrotfish	 in	 S.E.A.	 Aquarium,	

other	 facilities	 and	 institutions,	 and	 even	 researchers 

worldwide in the future.

OUTREACH AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENTS

In	 conjunction	 with	 Earth	 Day	 (22	 April	 2020),	 S.E.A.	

Aquarium organised a one-day online engagement 

event	with	Youth	Corps	Singapore	(YCS),	discussing	the	

effects	of	climate	change	on	the	marine	environment.	As	

the	Circuit	Breaker	halted	all	physical	events,	the	event	

was	held	over	social	messaging	app,	Telegram,	where	

participants	 were	 engaged	 with	 quizzes,	 infographics	

and bite-sized videos.

World	Oceans	Day	is	a	significant	annual	event	for	S.E.A.	

Aquarium. While we were unable to celebrate World 

Oceans Day (8 June 2020) physically with our guests in 

the	aquarium	this	year,	we	leveraged	on	the	reach	of	our	

social	media	accounts,	creating	content	to	engage	our	

fans and followers to celebrate World Oceans Day with 

us wherever they may be. 

In	 conjunction	 with	 World	 Jellyfish	 Day,	 we	 partnered	

with	Seven	Clean	Seas,	an	ocean	clean-up	organisation	

dedicated	 to	 removing	 plastic	 pollution,	 to	 organise	

an	 online	 sharing	 session.	 Conducted	 over	 Zoom,	 the	

session touched on how S.E.A. Aquarium cares for its 

sea	jellies,	as	well	as	how	plastic	pollution	affects	marine	

life and these ethereal creatures. The session was well-

received	 and	 all	 participants	 enjoyed	 learning	 about	

conservation in a fun and engaging way.

ONSITE ENGAGEMENT AT S.E.A. 

AQUARIUM

Learning	 is	 a	 lifelong	 journey.	 Lessons	 about	 marine	

biodiversity and conservation should be made available 

to	 everyone	 in	 all	 age	 groups.	 With	 that	 in	 mind,	

educational content and its visual presentation within 

S.E.A. Aquarium were re-designed as part of S.E.A. 

Aquarium’s	enhancement	project.		

Through	the	refreshed	content	and	experience,	as	well	as	

the	incorporation	of	bright	colours	and	fun	graphics,	we	

hope to bring edutainment to all who visit the aquarium 

and	 inspire	 the	 protection	 of	 the	 ocean.	 The	 ocean’s	

future lies in (y)our hands!

EDUCATION

Anchored	in	our	belief	that	learning	starts	young,	we	partnered	with	the	Early	

Childhood	Development	Agency	(ECDA)	in	their	annual	“Start	Small,	Dream	

Big”	 initiative	 to	 inspire	 preschoolers	 to	 make	 a	 difference.	 Due	 to	 Circuit	

Breaker	regulations,	we	created	online	resources,	which	parents	could	do	

together	with	their	children,	to	explore	how	they	can	protect	the	ocean	in	

accordance	to	year	2020’s	theme	-	A	Healthy	Ocean	Starts	With	You.	

We	also	partnered	with	ECDA	on	the	Innovation	Grant	Project	(IGP),	targeted	

to train and equip 24 preschool educators with knowledge and ideas to 

bring	the	aquarium,	marine	animals	and	conservation	messages	into	their	

classrooms.

In	summary,	we	engaged	15	preschools,	trained	and	equipped	24	teachers,	

and engaged more than 500 preschoolers in the pursuit of marine conservation. 

SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD AT OCEAN RESTAURANT

The	ERC	team	acts	as	an	internal	advisor	for	sustainable	seafood	regulations	in	RWS.	In	2020,	the	team	established	

a	comprehensive,	yet	easy-to-follow	set	of	sustainable	seafood	guidelines	for	internal	procurement	when	purchasing	

ingredients	for	Ocean	Restaurant.	Suppliers	who	have	not	obtained	the	relevant	certification	according	to	industry	

standards	are	subjected	to	a	secondary	round	of	research	and	assessment	by	the	team.	Cross-referencing	to	other	

internationally recognised guides for sustainable seafood such as the Seafood Watch and existing research on 

sustainable	fishing	methods,	the	team	is	able	to	conclude	if	the	proposed	ingredients	adhere	to	sustainable	fishing	

practices.

was applied across the resort on surfaces with high touch 

frequencies,	such	as	gaming	tables,	slot	machine	buttons	

and	 touch-screen	 kiosks.	 The	 coating,	 which	 lasts	 three	

to	 six	 months,	 suppresses	 viral	 loads	 and	 lowers	 the	

transmission risk of COVID-19. 

RWS also collaborated with researchers from Nanyang 

Polytechnic	in	an	independent	efficacy	testing	and	monitoring	

of	the	anti-microbial	coating,	and	its	effectiveness	against	

virus	loads,	measured	in	relative	light	units	(RLU).	Research	

results showed that on the single-coated slot machine 

buttons,	there	were	only	59	RLUs.	Any	surface	with	less	than	

250 RLUs is considered safe for usage and touch.

Plasmacluster Ionisers

RWS deployed more than 600 sets of Plasmacluster ionisers across the resort in 2020. Plasmacluster ionisers emit 

both	positive	and	negative	ions	into	the	air,	which	can	break	down	airborne	microbes	by	removing	the	hydrogen	from	

their protein surface.

According	to	independent	research	by	the	Kitasato	Research	Center	of	Environmental	Sciences	in	Japan,	Plasmacluster	

ionisers	were	proven	to	have	the	ability	to	destroy	SARS	and	H1N1,	which	are	coronaviruses	similar	to	the	COVID-19	virus.

High Efficiency (HE) Filters and Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiators 

in the Air Exchange System

Our	air	exchange	system	is	installed	with	HE	filters,	which	can	eradicate	more	than	95%	of	viruses,	bacteria	and	

particles.	 The	 system	 is	 boosted	 by	 a	 germicidal	 irradiators	 system	 with	 Ultraviolet-C	 (UV-C)	 rays,	 which	 further	

disinfects the air and kills pathogens that pass through.

Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs)

RWS deployed SDAs throughout the resort to ensure that everyone maintained at least one metre apart and stayed 

within	their	safe	distancing	markers	when	in	queue.	At	its	hotels,	SDAs	would	enforce	the	number	of	visitors	permissible	

within each room. Even characters in Universal Studios Singapore played their part in following the SMMs by standing 

at a safe distance of more than one-metre apart from guests during their segregated meet-and-greet sessions.

Cleaning, Disinfection and Sanitisation

The increased demand of cleaning and disinfection 

brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates 

the usage of innovative tools more than ever. Throughout 

the	year,	to	improve	our	efficiency	in	cleaning,	we	have	

been using the robotic scrubber extensively within the 

resort.	For	the	disinfection	of	high-touch	areas,	we	use	

an electrostatic spray gun to complement traditional 

cleaning methods. This new technology allows us to 

disinfect a much larger area within a shorter time period. 

At the Casino 

The	casino	in	RWS	has	been	a	TraceTogether-only	SafeEntry	venue	since	October	2020,	which	is	a	higher	standard	

of contact tracing using smart devices and TraceTogether tokens.  

In	the	casino,	acrylic	perspex	shields	were	installed	at	the	table	games,	gaming	machines	and	counters.	Contactless	

transactions were highly encouraged in the casino too. Gaming chips were sanitised before securing into the chip 

trays	while	progressive	game	cards	were	replaced	regularly	and	gaming	tiles	were	cleaned	at	fixed	intervals.

At the Hotels

RWS’	hotels	implemented	a	range	of	hotels-specific	SMMs	to	fight	the	spread	of	COVID-19.	For	instance,	we	provided	

baggage sanitisation during check-in and key card sanitisation with UV cabinets. Increased sanitisation of high-touch 

surfaces	in	rooms	and	common	areas,	as	well	as	staggered	check-in	timings	were	also	scheduled	to	ensure	the	health	

and safety of our guests.

Other SMMs

Over	270	hand	sanitisers	were	also	made	available	across	

RWS.	 In	 addition,	 SafeEntry	 check-in	 with	 temperature	

screening was made mandatory at strategic entry points. 

Self-service drinking points were suspended and guests 

were served personally by our team members instead.

In	summary,	we	complied	with	the	requirements	set	by	the	

SG	Clean	programme,	and	SMMs	regime	laid	out	by	the	

government. Genting Singapore has implemented a wide 

range of SMMs to combat COVID-19. 

HIGH-RISK RESPONSE PLAN 

EXERCISES IN 2020

In	Genting	Singapore,	all	exercises	for	high-risk	response	

plans	were	duly	executed.	In	2020,	most	of	the	exercises	

were conducted through tabletop exercises due to the 

COVID-19 pandemic.

In	 the	 last	 quarter	 of	 2020,	 our	 Company	 Emergency	

Response Team (CERT) and Singapore Civil Defence 

Force	(SCDF)	conducted	a	joint	fire-and-rescue	exercise	

in	 USS.	 The	 yearly	 affair	 is	 meant	 to	 familiarise	 SCDF	

responders from the Sentosa Fire Station with various 

high-risk installations in RWS. Both CERT and SCDF 

form an integral part of our emergency management 

protocols in RWS.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Guest satisfaction is one of the top priorities for RWS. We want to create positive experiences for all guests and ensure 

that	everyone	who	passes	through	our	doors	leaves	with	a	smile.	To	achieve	this,	our	team	members	remain	our	most	

valuable	asset	in	delivering	professional	services	that	drive	guest	satisfaction.	Our	service	DNA	-	creating	fun-filled	

memorable	experiences	through	a	safe	environment	and	warm	and	caring	services	-	defines	the	shared	values	that	

we hold when we engaging our guests. 

MARKETING AND 

SERVICE LABELLING

SERVICE EXCELLENCE TRAINING

To	achieve	service	excellence,	it	is	important	for	team	members	to	be	equipped	with	the	necessary	skills	for	their	

respective diverse and unique service roles. 

Even	in	the	midst	of	a	pandemic,	we	strived	to	sustain	workplace	learning	as	we	believe	that	learning	is	a	lifelong	

journey.	We	developed	new	contextualised	service	programmes	and	enabled	multiple	delivery	modes	of	learning	such	

as	in-person	learning,	virtual	live	learning	and	virtual	self-directed	learning.

Attractions:

z	One	of	the	learning	programmes	developed	is	“Work	in	a	Diverse	Service	Environment”,	which	aims	to	equip	team	 

 

members	 with	 the	 knowledge	 and	 skills	 to	 handle	 diversity,	 recognise	 the	 importance	 of	 inclusiveness,	 apply 

 

emotional	 intelligence,	 demonstrate	 resilience	 and	 monitor	 their	 own	 actions	 in	 handling	 diversity.	 This	 is 

 

especially	useful	as	we	receive	guests	from	different	archetypes.

z	In	2020,	we	provided	over	19,133	training	hours	related	to	service	delivery.

Hotels:

z	Team	 members	 can	 enroll	 themselves	 in	 various	 hotel	 training	 programmes,	 including	 “Develop	 a	 Continuous	 

 

Improvement		Culture”	and	“Internet-of-Things	in	the	Hospitality	Sector”,	which	are	guided	by	industry	professionals. 

 

Upon	completion,	team	members	were	encouraged	to	think	about	how	these	new	skills	could	be	implemented	in	the	 

 

workplace o further improve our service standards.

z	Virtual self-directed learning was also available through micro-learning courses held in partnership with Temasek  

 

Polytechnic. The four-hour courses provided our team members an opportunity to learn on-the-go through a mobile 

 

application that can be accessed at their convenience. Covering a range of topics from “Customer Service  

 

1010”	 to	 “Creating	 Unforgettable	 Experiences	 through	 Customer	 Service”,	 the	 sessions	 refreshed	 the	 existing	 

 

customer service knowledge of our team members to better provide service standards when welcoming visitors  

 

back to the resort.

z	In	2020,	a	total	of	672	hours	of	self-directed	customer	service	learning	was	completed	by	our	team	members.

Recognising	that	health	and	safety	is	a	top	priority	for	guests,	a	number	of	training	programmes	have	been	developed	

to	address	this	area	specifically.	These	included	the	SMM	training.	Sessions	were	conducted	via	small	group	briefings	

and	 virtual	 platforms,	 and	 all	 team	 members	 were	 trained	 on	 the	 SMMs	 before	 interacting	 with	 guests.	 We	 are	

confident	that	with	these	initiatives,	RWS	is	well-positioned	to	meet	guest	satisfaction	targets	upon	the	resumption	of	

international leisure travel.

PROMOTING A CULTURE OF SAFETY

We	believe	that	safety	and	accident	prevention	is	everyone’s	responsibility.	All	team	members	are	empowered	with	the	

skills and knowledge to take ownership of workplace safety.

There is a safety committee in each department that engages team members to promote safe practices relevant to 

their roles and responsibilities. They conduct monthly safety inspections with their respective Heads of Departments.

To	 build	 a	 culture	 of	 open	 communication	 and	 mutual	 learning,	 work-related	 incidents	 are	 investigated	 and	

communicated	to	team	members	during	department	safety	committee	meetings,	pre-shift	briefings,	safety	videos	

at	wardrobe	areas,	induction	training,	safety	bulletins,	safety	alerts	and	monthly	safety	reports.	To	ensure	that	these	

messages	are	effectively	shared,	safety	messages	are	provided	in	various	languages	for	ease	of	understanding.	

Most	importantly,	our	team	members	are	encouraged	to	report	any	unsafe	acts	through	various	channels	such	as	the	

whistle-blowing	channels,	RWS	Shout	Out,	HR	touchpoints	and	the	WSH	common	mailbox.

WSH INNOVATION AWARDS 2020: CELEBRATING THE BEST

For	three	consecutive	years	since	2018,	RWS	was	nominated	by	the	Workplace	Safety	and	Health	Council	for	the	

various	innovative	projects	that	can	help	to	minimise	workplace	hazards	and	risks.	The	most	recent	winning	project	

was	spearheaded	by	the	Projects	and	Technical	Services	department,	and	implemented	by	the	WSH	Lead	from	Life	

Support Systems. 

Featured	on	the	2020	National	WSH	Commemorative	Book,	the	winning	project	-	Foam	Fractionator	Enhancement	

of Automated Washdown System - is a semi-automated two-ring water nozzle spray system that keeps the Life 

Support	System’s	Foam	Fractionator	Cone	and	Collection	Cup	in	S.E.A.	Aquarium	clean.	The	new	design	reduces	

the	frequency	of	manual	cleaning	significantly,	thereby	increasing	productivity	and	minimising	workplace	safety	risks	

and hazards.

u	Before - Cleaning done manually

u	After - Semi-automated nozzle spray system

PREVENTION THROUGH PROACTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT

Hazard	identification	and	elimination	is	the	keystone	in	our	safety	efforts.	Safety	risk	management	is	monitored	by	the	

Safety and Emergency Planning department via on-site inspections with area owners and input from near miss and 

accident reporting processes.

Safety risk assessments are reviewed using the Hierarchy of Controls framework when an incident happens or when 

there	are	significant	process	changes.	Otherwise,	such	reviews	will	be	conducted	three	times	a	year.	For	all	work-related	

incidents,	corrective	and	preventive	actions	are	implemented,	and	monitored	for	their	effectiveness,	appropriateness	

and adequacy.

the criteria when selecting vendors during the procurement process. Appointed contractors and service providers will

our	corporate	social	responsibility	platform	–	even	during	an	unprecedented	year	marked	by	the	COVID-19	pandemic.



MANAGING	AGENT	OF	COMMUNITY	CARE	FACILITIES

RWS	supports	and	stands	united	with	the	Singapore	Government	in	the	national	effort	to	contain	the	community	

spread	of	COVID-19.	Staying	true	to	our	kampung	spirit,	RWS	stepped	forward	as	the	Managing	Agent	at	two	of	the	

largest	national	Community	Care	Facilities	at	the	Singapore	EXPO	&amp;	MAX	Atria,	and	the	Big	Box	warehouse	mall	with	

a	combined	capacity	of	more	than	11,000	beds.	

More	than	2,000	team	members	have	volunteered	for	this	community	effort	since	April	2020,	testament	to	the	Group’s	

strong	culture	of	volunteerism.	As	part	of	a	whole-of-society	effort	demonstrating	public-private	partnership	in	action,	

RWS	contributed	our	expertise	and	capabilities	in	managing	large-scale,	non-medical	facilities	to	support	the	Ministry	

of	Health	and	the	Ministry	of	National	Development.	Working	closely	alongside	government	agencies,	healthcare	

professionals	and	industry	partners,	our	role	–	as	Managing	Agent	–	was	to	provide	a	comfortable	environment	for	

COVID-19 patients to rest and recover.

TIMELY RESPONSE

Within a short time span of six days when the Community 

Care	Facility	at	Singapore	EXPO	&amp;	MAX	Atria	was	first	

announced	 when	 the	 first	 residents	 arrived,	 RWS	 was	

able	 to	 successfully	 and	 efficiently	 install	 systems	

infrastructure,	 and	 mobilise	 volunteers	 in	 critical	 non-

medical roles to run operations at the facility.

TRANSFERABLE SKILLS

Harnessing their skills and experience in running large-

scale	 integrated	 resort	 operations,	 team	 members	

manned	 a	 24/7	 operations	 command	 centre	 which	

oversaw	surveillance	monitoring,	incident	tracking	and	a	

call centre handling resident inquiries. They also provided 

a suite of one-stop residency services comprising day-

to-day	duties	such	as	pre-arrival	coordination,	admission	

and	 discharge,	 patient	 engagement,	 cleaning	 and	

sanitisation,	 housekeeping,	 meal	 management	 and	

supply of daily necessities.  

PROFESSIONAL TRAINING

While	 caring	 for	 the	 residents,	 our	 priority	 was	 also	 to	

safeguard	 the	 health,	 safety	 and	 well-being	 of	 our	

team members. Every volunteer received thorough and 

comprehensive training from infection control specialists 

before commencing their duties. These included 

the wearing and de-gowning of personal protective 

equipment	including	N95	masks,	face	shields	and	gloves.	

Additional	 safety	 measures	 such	 as	 team	 segregation,	

safe	distancing,	staggered	meal	times	and	installation	of	

screen dividers reinforced discipline and vigilance.

HOLISTIC CARE

On	top	of	looking	after	the	daily	needs	of	residents,	our	

volunteers also organised many engagement sessions to 

encourage them and keep them motivated and in good 

spirits.	 For	 example,	 residents	 participated	 in	 exercise	

workouts,	art	therapy	sessions	and	tucked	into	delicious	

treats during festive celebrations.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Even though we have to pack about 800 – 

1,000 kits for the residents, it is important 

that we deliver this so that we can support 

the onsite operations and make a difference. 

It may be back-breaking work, but the 

positive energy and sense of teamwork that 

I feel when working with my colleagues and 

volunteers motivates me.

– Genevieve Tan, 

 

Event Services

We are both familiar with the logistics of 

handling park operations, and seeing how 

stretched the healthcare workers were, we 

thought that it was a perfect time for us to 

step in and help. It’s not always about what 

you’ll get. To us, it’s about what you can give, 

and that’s all that matters.

– Zyman Tan and Angeline Ooi, 

 

Universal Studios Singapore

While volunteering at the CCF, I saw many 

worried faces among the residents and many 

of them miss their families or are concerned 

about their recovery. It is my privilege to be 

able to help the residents rest and recover, 

and cheer them up whenever we can. This 

will help build a positive mindset in the 

residents and keep their spirits high.

CHILDREN FOR CHILDREN

RWS	has	supported	Children	for	Children,	an	annual	community	fundraising	event	held	in	Singapore	to	celebrate	

Children’s	Day.	This	year,	RWS	sponsored	1,000	primary	school	children	from	low	income	homes	with	a	pair	of	tickets	

each	to	Universal	Studios	Singapore.	At	a	time	when	families	are	transitioning	to	a	new	normal	in	this	pandemic,	RWS	

wants to bring hope and cheer to underprivileged children and help them discover their potential. A trip to Universal 

Studios	Singapore	means	a	lot	to	our	young	friends	where	they	can	enjoy	the	many	thrilling	rides	and	meet	their	

favourite	characters.	As	RWS	resumed	operations	of	its	award-winning	and	popular	attractions,	we	are	proud	to	play	a	

role as a community venue for family bonding and friendship especially after one-and-a-half months of Circuit Breaker 

measures.

RESPONSIBLE 

GAMBLING ADVOCACY

At	RWS,	we	aim	to	provide	patrons	with	an	enjoyable	gaming	experience	by	encouraging	Responsible	Gambling	(RG)	

and are committed to the prevention of problem and underage gambling in our premises.

We are committed to ensuring regulatory compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and collaborating with 

the	Government,	RG	bodies	and	the	community	to	minimise	any	negative	social	impact	due	to	gambling	in	the	casino.	

To	deliver	this	corporate	commitment,	we	have	adopted	a	holistic	approach	via	our	RG	Programme	which	is	based	

on	the	five	main	tenets	as	follows:

Robust RG 

governance 

structure

Casino 

Exclusion

Casino Visit 

Limit

Pre-

Commitment 

Programme

Manage 

Game Play 

Programme 

New

Prompt response 

and escalation of 

problem gambling 

situations in a 

respectful and 

systematic manner

Close collaboration 

with government on 

implementation of 

player safeguards

Continuous 

awareness and 

comprehensive RG 

training for team 

members

Comprehensive 

informed decision-

making framework

One of our core commitments is to provide a safety net (i.e. player safeguards options) to our patrons to help them 

manage their gambling through awareness and making informed decisions.

In	2020,	we	collaborated	with	the	Ministry	of	Social	and	Family	Development	(MSF)	and	relevant	stakeholders	in	the 

industry	to	implement	and	enhance	our	RG	initiatives	and	safeguards	to	ensure	that	players’	gaming	experiences	are 

safe	and	enjoyable.

MANAGE GAME PLAY

RWS	 collaborated	 with	 MSF	 on	 a	 joint	 study	 to	 explore	 the	 use	 of	 technology	 to	 further	 encourage	 responsible	

gambling and help patrons make informed decisions about gambling. 

The	study	looked	into	the	effectiveness	of	possible	measures	to	promote	informed	play	such	as	providing	patrons	with	

notifications	on	time	spent	in	the	casinos	and	encouraging	patrons	to	voluntarily	set	limits	on	duration	of	play.

RWS	engaged	subject	matter	experts	to	conduct	benchmarking	and	feasibility	studies	on	an	informed	play	system.	As	

a	result,	we	developed	the	Manage	Game	Play	(MGP)	Programme	-	a	voluntary	tool	that	helps	patrons	self-regulate	

and manage the time that they spend at gaming machines. This programme completed a successful month-long trial 

at RWS in February 2020 and has been in service since the end of September 2020.

09.MAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Features of the MGP tool

z	Voluntary informed play tool 

z	Enrolment and use are free

z	Patrons may self-register for this programme at 

 

the Membership Hub

z	Allows patrons to set daily/ weekly/ monthly time limit 

 

on Electronic Gaming Machines (EGMs)

z	Patrons can receive	SMS	notifications	via	mobile	phone	at	selected	intervals	based	on 

 

the duration set

z	Patrons can choose to continue or stop playing

The MGP tool is voluntary. It aims to empower patrons with near real-time information to help patrons make more 

informed gambling decisions and better manage their play at the casino.

A survey of patrons who enrolled during the trial period determined that more than 90% of respondents found the 

programme	to	be	effective	as	it	is	easy	to	use	and	helps	them	keep	track	and	manage	their	time	spent	on	gambling	

activities.	Additionally,	a	large	majority	of	respondents	praised	the	effectiveness	of	both	the	outreach	efforts	by	the	

RWS	RG	Ambassadors	and	RWS’	efforts	in	promoting	RG	through	roadshows,	brochures	and	electronic	displays	that	

are	located	around	the	casino	floor.	

In	future,	RWS	will	continue	to	work	closely	with	MSF	to	explore	more	measures	around	informed	play	such	as	

allowing patrons an option to set a spend limit for their gaming activities.

Illustrated	by	a	new	logo	using	EGMs’	elements,	which	

patrons	can	relate	to,	MGP	encourages	patrons	to	set	an	

appropriate limit when playing at EGMs. 

The	letters	in	PLAY	are	arranged	in	a	non-linear	fashion	

depicting that the winning probability is random and 

conveying that play at the casino is a game of chance. It 

also serves to remind patrons that keeping it fun means 

playing within their means. 

The above will support patrons to spend only what they 

can	afford,	which	encapsulates	the	essence	of	RG.

RG TRAINING

RWS places emphasis on team member training 

to ensure that they are equipped with the essential 

knowledge and skills to support the RG Programme 

when	carrying	out	their	respective	functions,	especially	

for our RG Ambassadors.



Before	team	members	are	appointed	as	RG	Ambassadors,	

they must undergo additional special training conducted 

by external RG specialists from National Addictions 

Management Service (NAMS) to equip them with skills to 

recognise the observable indicators or signs of distress 

related to problem gambling as well as to provide 

appropriate information and assistance to patrons. 

Additionally,	 we	 worked	 closely	 with	 MSF	 to	 provide	

enhanced training to our existing pool of RG 

Ambassadors. The aim of the enhanced training is to 

increase the knowledge and engagement skills of our RG 

Ambassadors	to	provide	more	effective	interaction	and	

assistance to our casino patrons. 

The trained RG Ambassadors also actively engage 

patrons during various roadshows held at our casino 

premise. These roadshows aim to increase awareness 

of RG and help services available at the casino (e.g. Pre-

commitment	programme,	MGP	programme,	tips	on	RG	

etc.).

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

RG ROADSHOWS 2020

Despite	the	COVID-19	pandemic,	RWS	organised	four	RG	roadshows	in	2020.	To	comply	with	SMMs,	we	stationed	

our	RG	Ambassadors	at	strategically	throughout	the	casino	such	as	the	Membership	Hub,	cage	counters,	and	F&amp;B	

outlets	to	reach	out	to	our	patrons	directly	with	brochures	containing	RG	messages	and	a	QR	code	leading	to	RWS’	

dedicated	RG	website	where	guests	can	find	out	more	about	the	various	RG	measures	available	at	RWS.

RG ACCREDITATION

To	ensure	our	RG	Programme	is	of	the	highest	standard,	RWS’	RG	Programme	has	been	accredited	by	RG	Check	

since 2015. The RG Check standard is one of the most comprehensive and rigorous RG accreditation programmes 

in the world. 

This	independent	accreditation	by	the	Responsible	Gambling	Council	(RGC)	is	an	affirmation	of	our	commitment	to	

implementing	effective	player	safeguards,	including	the	prevention	of	underage	gambling	and	the	prevention	and	

reduction of problem gambling.

In	November	2015,	RWS	became	the	first	casino	in	Asia	Pacific	to	receive	the	RG	Check	accreditation	from	the	

RGC.	From	December	2018,	RWS	has	continuously	held	the	highest	score	amongst	all	venue	accreditations	and 

re-accreditations.

RWS will continue to collaborate with the government and relevant authorities to enhance our RG measures and 

initiatives.

RWS 2.0: OUR NEXT STEPS 

GOING BEYOND 

SUSTAINABILITY21

The	RWS	2.0	Waterfront	Development	–	part	of	our	expansion	and	

evolution	–	is	a	master	plan	to	better	integrate	and	improve	our	offerings	

as	a	resort.	The	final	built	form	will	resemble	a	mountain	sitting	partially	

on	 decking	 over	 water,	 a	 design	 that	 minimises	 ecological	 impact	

on marine life by reducing construction footprint into the water. The 

development will also include more sustainable modes of transport 

into	RWS	by	better	integrating	multiple	modes	of	Singapore’s	public	

transportation,	 linking	 the	 interchange	 at	 Harbourfront	 MRT	 station	

with the new Driverless Transport System (DTS). Cyclists are also 

connected	to	the	development,	and	there	will	be	parking	facilities	for	

bicycles.

RWS	2.0	will	be	a	green	icon,	featuring	a	rich	variety	of	nature,	flora	and	

fauna.	Lush	and	water-efficient	landscaping	will	enhance	biodiversity	

around	the	development,	while	providing	visual	relief	to	guests	and	

visitors. Green roofs on the waterfront development and Forum 

extension as well as other extensive shading structures will reduce 

heat	 island	 effect	 and	 minimise	 thermal	 heat	 gain	 into	 the	 interior,	

enhancing	 indoor	 comfort.	 Additionally,	 passive	 cooling	 –	 recycling	

of	 the	 development’s	 cooling	 tower	 water	 usage	 to	 lower	 radiant	

temperatures	–	within	the	naturally	ventilated	forum	further	enhances	

thermal comfort and also reduces electricity load.
