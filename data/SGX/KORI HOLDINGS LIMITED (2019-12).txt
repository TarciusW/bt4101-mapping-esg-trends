CEO’s Message 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

I am pleased to present the Sustainability Report of Kori Holdings Limited and its 

subsidiaries (“Kori” or the “Group”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 

(“FY2019”). This report is prepared by taking reference from the Sustainability Reporting 

Guide in Practice Note 7F of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) 

Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist (“Catalist Rules”) and references the Global 

Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards which represent the global best practices for reporting 

on a range of economic, environmental and social impacts. This report highlights the key 

economic, environmental, social and governance (“EESG”) related factors and initiatives 

carried throughout FY2019.  

The Group has a broad view on sustainability that looks beyond simply our environmental 

impact but also encompasses creating a positive impact to the society and industry which we 

are in. We believe that our continuous commitment to make positive changes to the 

community is our driving force towards long-term commercial success.  

We endeavour to reduce the environmental impact of our operations, and we are well aware 

that continuing our efforts in reusing materials is essential to achieving this environmental 

target. 

In addition, we are committed to safeguarding the welfare of our workforce. We strictly 

comply with local labour regulations where we operate, and we implement adequate safety 

measures to ensure that workplace health and safety risks are minimised. We endeavour to 

achieve zero health and safety incidents at our worksites. 

We would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees and business partners for their 

support, expertise and engagement in helping Kori establish its role as a trusted partner in 

building a more sustainable economy. 

Sincerely, 

Mr. Hooi Yu Koh 

Executive Chairman and CEO

Our Sustainability Story  

 

At Kori, we recognise that implementing sustainable policies and measures is a priority in 

our business that is important for the long-term development and success of our business. 

The Group strongly advocates sustainable practices that create positive impacts to the 

environment and society. 

We have obtained our license in structural steel for specialising in the design, supply and 

erection of ERSS, such as steel struts and steel retaining walls, as well as steel decking 

systems. To maintain the license, we are rigorously assessed by the Building and 

Construction Authority (“BCA”) for renewal of the license every three years. This ensures 

that our operations are in strict compliance with environmental laws and regulations. 

Sustainability Targets and Performance 

The Group will continue to maintain and uphold our material saving initiatives and 

sustainable construction practices. We will continue to monitor and explore new ways to 

minimize the environmental impacts of our operations, whilst maintaining strict compliance 

with local environmental regulations where we operate in.  

We will continue to develop a safe working environment for our employees and endeavour to 

maintain the record of zero workplace safety incidents. 

Below is a summary table of the Group’s sustainability targets and performance during the 

reporting period of FY2019.

Governance and Statement of the Board  

 

At Kori, sustainability is prioritised at the Board level. We have established a Sustainability 

Task Force to implement and manage the Group’s sustainability efforts. The Task Force is 

chaired by the CEO. 

The Board incorporates sustainability issues into the strategic formulation of the Group. The 

Board approves the material economic, environmental, social and governance (“EESG”) 

factors identified by the Sustainability Task Force on an annual basis and ensures that the 

factors identified are well-managed and monitored by the Task Force. In FY2019, the Task 

Force has reviewed the material EESG factors identified in FY2018 and was of the view that 

they remain relevant in FY2019. New material EESG factors such as Supplier Environmental 

Evaluation and Compliance and Socioeconomic Compliance have also been included, as 

they are deemed to be material to the Group in FY2019.  

Please refer to the Corporate Governance Report in our 2019 Annual Report for more 

information on the Group’s corporate governance practices and risk management structure.

Stakeholder Engagement  

 

The Group believes that sustainable growth is dependent upon meeting and exceeding the 

reasonable expectations of its key stakeholders. We determine material issues based on the 

principle of materiality to stakeholders. We actively engage in meaningful and productive 

dialogues with our stakeholders and participate in various industry and government forums 

to keep abreast of any material stakeholder issues.  

 

We identify key stakeholders as groups which have material impact or could potentially be 

impacted by our operations. The following table summarises our key stakeholders, 

engagement platforms and their key concerns.

Reporting Practice 

 

Our sustainability report is produced in accordance with the GRI standards’ “Core” option, 

covering our Group’s performance from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019.  

 

The GRI standards represent the global best practices for reporting on economic, 

environmental and social topics.  

 

The report also incorporates the primary components of report content as set out by the 

SGX’s “Comply or Explain” requirements on sustainability reporting under Catalist Rule 711B. 

 

GRI does not require external assurance and the Group’s Sustainability Task Force has 

assessed that external assurance is not required as the Group is strengthening the 

foundations for the sustainability report in FY2019. 

 

This report supplements the Group’s 2019 Annual Report. Detailed section reference with 

GRI Standards is found at the GRI Standards Content Index section of this report.  

 

The Group’s material topics are identified based on its impacts on our internal and external 

stakeholders, as outlined in the Stakeholders Engagement section.

Ethics and Integrity  

 

Anti-corruption (GRI 205 -1, 205-2, 205-3) 

The Group takes a strong stance against corruption and malpractice and does not tolerate 

any impropriety, statutory non-compliance or wrongdoing by employees in their work. The 

Code of Conduct strictly prohibits any acts by employees to use their position to obtain 

advantages for themselves. 

The Group is strongly committed to a high legal and moral standard in all of our business 

activities. We have adopted a Personnel Policy to place emphasis on high standards of 

professionalism and ethics. All employees are required to read, understand and agree to 

comply with the purposes and provisions of the Personnel Policy. Employees are held liable 

for their failure to comply which may result in disciplinary actions. The severity of these 

disciplinary actions depends on circumstances and the gravity of the misconduct. 

The Audit Committee of Kori had developed and approved whistleblowing procedures 

outlining their responsibilities and the procedures to receive certain complaints and 

allegations. Employees of the Group and any other persons may, in confidence, raise 

concerns about possible improper financial reporting or other matters to Chairman of Audit 

Committee, CEO or Administration Manager. The objective for such arrangement is to 

ensure independent investigations of such matters and for appropriate follow-up actions. The 

Company did not receive any whistle-blowing reports in FY2019.  

 


 

10 | P a g e 

 

Environmental Protection 

 

Kori is an environmentally responsible corporate citizen and we strive to operate in a prudent 

and sustainable manner. To optimise the environmental management of our operations, we 

evaluate potential environmental risks and impacts before implementing our sustainability 

strategies. We also strive to adopt new technologies where possible to achieve our 

environmental targets. 

Steel Reuse  

GRI 301-2 

Steel is heavily used in our structural steel projects. The steel struts we use are designed to 

meet the requirements and specifications of different projects, thus they vary in size and 

length. To save natural resources and minimise negative environmental impacts, the Group 

has adopted practices to reuse 100% of our steel materials in new projects after dismantling. 

In addition, the steel beams we use are mostly pre-fabricated off-site to reduce material 

wastage.  

Furthermore, minimal waste is produced through steel reuse, thus reducing our carbon 

footprint throughout the lifecycles of our projects.  

In FY2019, we achieved 100% reuse of steel inventory for all our projects, leading to direct 

cost and resource savings. This is higher than the latest steel industrial material efficiency 

rate available as at the date of this report, which stands at 96.3%1. 

Technology Adoption  

GRI 203-2 

With our unique and advanced expertise in steel decking works built through years of 

practice in various projects, we have successfully developed the Kori Large Panelling Traffic 

Decking System, which is a reusable steel platform for public traffic diversion with premix 

surface designed specifically for Singapore.  

For the Kori Large Panelling Traffic Decking System, we use steel panels which consist of a 

special type of rugged grid-pattern beams sections as a temporary platform which permits 

more efficient and stable decking works. This sustainable design improves the efficiency and 

stability of decking works and is now widely adopted throughout infrastructure projects in 

Singapore. We are the first in the construction industry to provide services/solutions for the 

design of reusable pre-cast road diversion deck panels. This is more cost-saving than the 

conventional method of steel road diversion deck panels and is a productive and innovative 

method duly acknowledged by the authority under the PIP scheme.  

The Group is committed to continuously monitor, develop and implement technology in our 

operations to improve our productivity and reduce material usage.

Managing Our Suppliers  

GRI  308-2 

The Group has gone the extra mile to ensure that all contractors and subcontractors are 

informed of their environmental responsibilities, and are able to meet the standards expected 

by the Group. All contractors and subcontractors are reviewed and selected based on their 

environmental compliance. Contractors and subcontractor with repeated violation records 

will not be selected. 

In FY2019, there was no incident of negative environmental impact among the contractors 

and subcontractors engaged by the Group. 

Environmental Compliance  

GRI 307-1 

Kori carefully monitors the different stages of all services to ensure strict compliance with 

relevant laws and regulations, including vector control measures or adherence to the 

permissible noise levels set by National Environmental Agency (“NEA”) and allowable 

vibration limit under the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”).   

In FY2019, there was no incident of non-compliance with environmental laws and 

regulations in our operations.

Our People, Our Assets 

 

At Kori, we strive to create an inclusive workplace environment where there is mutual 

respect, fairness and equality for all our staff and workers. We provide training and 

development opportunities for staff to continue to learn and improve their skills. We also 

strive for zero fatal accidents at all sites and have implemented measures to ensure 

workplace safety.  

Occupational Health and Safety 

GRI 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 404-2, 414-1, 414-2 

We are committed to providing a safe working environment to our employees, suppliers and 

contractors. We have implemented adequate health and safety policies, standards and 

practices, as well as a Safety Committee that actively reviews, monitors, improves and 

implements all issues related to occupational health and safety.  

Kori performs risk assessments on steel strutting and decking works regularly. Potential 

hazards are identified and evaluated, and control measures are thereafter implemented to 

minimise the identified risks.  

In addition, we educate and train our employees on proper health and safety practices at 

work. We also engage external qualified safety consultants for their advice and guidance on 

programs and initiatives to prevent any potential occupational accident and injury. 

We provide opportunities and support our staff in their acquisition of knowledge and 

certifications on workplace health and safety. Our management and supervisory staff are 

encouraged to attend certification courses such as the Building Construction Supervisor 

Safety (“BCSS”) Course for all supervisory staff and the Lifting Supervisor Safety Course for 

all lifting supervisors. In FY2019, we achieved an average attendance rate of 100% for our 

certification courses. 

Furthermore, the Group assesses all contractors and subcontractors to ensure that they are 

informed of their workplace health and safety responsibilities, and are able to meet the 

standards expected by the Group. We evaluate their track record and worksite health and 

safety practices during the quotation and tendering process before awarding the contract.  

Kori has been internationally recognised for meeting Health and Safety Management 

requirements such as BS OHSAS 18001:2007 and has obtained bizSAFE Level Star 

certificate from Workplace Safety and Health Council of certified Singapore.  

In FY2019, there was no major work-related injury and incident at our worksites and among 

our suppliers. In view of the recent Covid-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak, we have implemented 

a business continuity plan to prepare for all eventualities and we constantly monitor any 

regulatory guidelines issued to ensure the health and safety of our employees. 

 

 

 


 

13 | P a g e 

 

Our Workforce  

GRI 401-1, 405-1 

The Group does not discriminate against gender or age in staff employment to ensure 

continuity in the pipeline of skilled employees. Our employee diversity is a major force in 

driving change and innovation in the Group.  

In FY2019, our total staff strength stood at 249 employees. A total of 30 employees were 

hired, equivalent to a new hire rate of 12%. The graph below shows the gender and age 

distribution of the Group’s employees in FY2018 and FY2019. Despite the male-dominated 

nature of our industry, we maintained our workforce diversity and will continue to increase to 

male to female ratio of our workforce where possible.

Employee Benefits and Retention  

GRI 401-3, 404-2, 404-3 

We recognise the valuable contribution by our employees. On top of competitive salaries 

and performance-based bonuses, employees of Kori are entitled to a range of benefits 

including workmen compensation insurance, group personal accident insurance, medical 

and healthcare benefits as well as hospitalisation leave.  

We also support the government’s pro-family policies and follows regulations implemented 

by the Ministry of Manpower regarding to parental and childcare leave.  

Kori is also dedicated to nurturing and encouraging our employees to grow. In FY2019, 100% 

of staff received annual performance reviews to optimise their career development. The 

performance evaluation system also provides a channel of communication for employees to 

provide their feedback to the management.  

As part of our effort to enhance skills for our employees, appropriate trainings are identified 

and conducted through various platforms of knowledge acquisition such as onsite trainings, 

seminars, conferences, workshops and classroom trainings. 

In FY2019, the Group conducted 15 training courses for a total of 188 employees, and we 

achieved an average of 12.4 training hours per employee, marginally lower than 13.7 

training hours per employee in FY2018. In FY2019, we reviewed our training plan and 

increased the diversity and efficiency of our training courses by increasing the number of 

training courses from 12 in FY2018 to 15 in FY2019, as well as reducing the duration of 

training courses which resulted in a marginal reduction in average training hours attended 

per employee. Notwithstanding the marginal decrease in average training hours per 

employee, the Group had met its targeted total number of training hours to be conducted for 

all of its employees for FY2019.  

 

 


 

15 | P a g e 

 

Corporate Social Responsibility 

 

As a company that focuses on improving the wellbeing of the population, we strive to do our 

best in giving back to the society and minimising any impact of our operations on the 

community. 

Noise Management 

GRI 413-1 

Kori has implemented programmes to assess noise levels and minimise the impact of our 

operations on the community. Our movable noise enclosure concept was recognised by LTA 

and we were awarded the Innovative Noise Management Award at the 19th Annual Safety 

Award Convention in September 2017 for Contract T216. 

In FY2019, there was no incident of non-compliance with noise regulations.  

Vector Measures 

GRI 413-1 

To protect our workers and the surrounding community from dengue, vector control plans 

are implemented at every construction site, including our storage yards, to prevent mosquito 

breeding. Regular control measures are also implemented and monitored by supervisors. 

In FY2019, the Group did not receive any fine or penalty for mosquito breeding.  

Giving Back to Society  

GRI 413-1 

Kori believes that community engagement is an integral part of our business sustainability.  

We are committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and we endeavour to give back to 

the community. 

Our management has been actively contributing to the discussion on industry and workforce 

developments in Singapore through media outlets such as the Straits Times and Channel 

NewsAsia. The Company’s initiatives on foreign worker engagement and workplace safety 

and health practices are shared with the community through such channels. We also 

routinely provide donations for community prayer events. 

Socioeconomic Compliance  

GRI 419-1 

The Group endeavours to be a socially responsible employer, and we act in strict 

compliance with social and economic laws and regulations. We continue to educate our 

workforce on proper social behaviour to prevent causing public nuisance or disorderly 

behaviour. 

In FY2019, there was no incident of non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social 

and economic area.
