Center Investment Ltd (“BCI” or “the Company”) and its subsidiaries 

(collectively “the Group”). This report, which has been approved by the 

Board of Directors (“Board”), presents BCI’s material sustainability or

approach in managing these issues, and setting their performance 

indicators.

In 2018, we continue to conduct Materiality Assessment internally to 

identify our material ESG issues and integrate it into our existing risk 

management framework so as to ensure that the Board is kept abreast 

of its happenings and has the ability to support our management 

team in addressing them. We aim to make our buildings more 

productive, energy and water efficient and sustainable. The Board 

is also supported by the Audit Committee as well as the Enterprise 

Risk Management Committee in managing the Group’s sustainability 

initiatives and programs.

Within our operations, a robust governance and risk management framework guides the organisation in

aim to continue integrate sustainability into our operations and culture so that we can continue to deliver hard

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

How We Report

Being in the second year of our  sustainability 

reporting, we are committed to continue implementing 

the reporting requirements by leveraging on our 

continuous improvements approach.

Our annual Sustainability Report provides us with a 

valuable opportunity to engage our stakeholders and 

respond to issues that matter most to them and to 

our business. It will continue to inform shareholders 

on our risk management, strategy development 

and stakeholder engagement activities as we work 

to further focus and prioritise our sustainability and 

corporate social responsibility initiatives. 

This report covers the period from 1 January to 31 

December 2018 (FY 2018), and we will publish this 

report on an annual basis. Our sustainability report 

will be published in an online format on our corporate 

website, which reduce an environmental impact and 

make our reporting more targeted and accessible to 

our stakeholders.

Our 

sustainability 

report 

contains 

detailed 

information on our material issues, as well as 

the impact of our operations on society and the 

environment. We recognise that sustainability 

reporting is a journey and are adopting a phase 

implementation approach and we will seek to provide 

additional disclosures on our material topics as

management. Both reports are critical communication 

pieces in the ongoing and transparent engagement

Building Standards. Our top priority and greatest 

strength: By providing state-of-the-art facilities 

and services of the highest quality and standards, 

we are contributing to the prosperity for our 

present and future generations. The building 

has been designed by one of Shanghai’s most 

experienced foreign architects- John Portman 

&amp; Associates- who have created a design that 

reflects the corporate image of strength prestige 

and success whilst still remaining in harmony with 

the colonial architecture of the Bund. 

Some examples include:

Top quality offices, commercial spaces and hotel 

property, built in accordance with leading engineering 

and environmental standards, incorporated a host 

of intelligent building facilities required by today’s 

multinational corporations. Raised flooring; optic 

fibre cable network; satellite connection; and 

advanced building automation systems created a 

new quality benchmark in Shanghai.

Our Approach

Governance and Risk Management

GOVERNANCE 

ANTI-CORRUPTION

Our reputation is dependent on daily decisions made across the organisation. We are 

dedicated to upholding integrity and honesty in our operations, and have adopted a zero 

tolerance policy towards fraud, corruption and unethical actions. Issues that require 

whistleblowing are those that affect our ability to operate effectively and our reputation. 

We have a Whistleblower Policy that ensures any internal or external stakeholder can raise 

any issue through any of our independent and accessible whistleblowing channels without 

fear of repercussion. We clearly state what steps need to be taken when someone has a 

concern, including who to contact, who to speak to if in doubt and how the law protects 

whisteblowers. Whistleblowing and anti-corruption updates continue to be made available 

to all our staff annually. 

We will continue to review our Whistleblowing Policy during FY2019. We aim to have zero 

incident of corruption in FY2019. 

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 

We are committed to acting in the best interests of BCI and ensuring we comply with 

local and international laws, regulations and governance codes, standards and policies. 

Employees are made aware of all relevant laws, regulations and policies through regular 

training. 

Non-compliance with such laws, regulations, codes, standards and policies are tracked 

and addressed and there was no incident recorded in FY2018. There was no incident of 

non-compliance concerning marketing communications or product and service information 

and labelling in FY2018. 

We aim to maintain a clean record with no incident of regulatory non-compliance for 

FY2019. We will continue to stay abreast of all regulatory updates and changes and train 

our staff accordingly. 

Our sustainable development strategy is planned to comply with both SGX Sustainability 

Reporting guidelines and GRI Standards.

The implementation of this strategy is built around BCI’s strong corporate culture and our 

core values:

• Positive Attitude

• Integrity

• Commitment

• Continuous Improvement

• Innovation

• Loyalty

With a better understanding on sustainability issues and how they could potentially influence 

our business gradually over time, we have implemented sustainability initiatives into the 

Group’s overall governance and operations, directed by strong leadership involvement:

is central to the Company’s 

effort in building a sustainability

performance indicators, and is 

instrumental in the production of the 

annual sustainability report. The 

ERMC comprises representatives 

from the company’s business 

units, brought together to work 

collectively on driving the value of 

sustainability across the Company.

Our

structure 

consists of senior management,

and 

employees from various functions. 

The 

senior 

management 

of 

various 

operation 

departments 

is responsible for guiding each 

department to work towards to 

achieving common sustainability 

goals and targets. 

By 

integrating 

sustainability 

initiatives 

tightly 

into 

our 

existing risk management, we 

can ensure that the Board is 

always kept abreast of our 

material

issues, 

and the Group’s performance 

on the follow-up actions taken to 

address and mitigate them. As 

part of our preparations for this 

report, we have mapped most 

material issues to our Enterprise 

Risk 

Management 

(“ERM”) 

framework.

We 

place 

strong 

emphasis 

on complying with all national 

and 

regional

frameworks. 

These 

include 

Building A Culture of

regulations on operational permits, 

design

finance and accounting, labour 

laws, customer protection, and 

environmental frameworks.

We seek to proactively engage 

the 

relevant 

authorities 

to 

collaboratively develop solutions 

and frameworks such as waste 

management that will ensure the 

well-being of our surrounding 

communities.

Our employees have received 

clear guidance on the standards 

of ethical behaviour required 

of them through our Code of 

Conduct policy, supplemented 

by our whistle whistleblowing 

policy that serves as an effective 

oversight 

measure 

for 

the 

prevention of fraud, corruption 

and other types of misconduct. 

We also have policies in place 

that cover procurement activities 

and fair employment practices. 

Building an internal culture of sustainability continues to be the key to our journey towards sustainability; this ensures 

that all members of the Company act upon a shared understanding of the importance of balancing the economic, 

environmental and social impacts of the Company’s operations.

Last year we carried out a materiality assessment, beginning with a 

high-level peer benchmarking exercise to identify potential risks and 

opportunities from a sustainability perspective. This was followed by 

validation with management and Board to finalise our material ESG 

factors. We selected topics that we have the greatest impact on, and 

that have the greatest impact on our business.

The Materiality Matrix maps out the significant ESG and economic 

factors that impact our business, as well as insights gained from 

stakeholder engagements. It helps us to focus our efforts in paying 

attention to the values that are critical to the success of our business 

as well as the priorities of various stakeholders. It is reviewed regularly, 

taking into account the feedback that we receive from our engagement 

with a wide variety of stakeholders, broader sustainability trends and 

the issues facing the hospitality industry. 

Based on feedback from our various stakeholders, we have shortlisted 

the following material factors based on valuable insights that we have 

gained from our stakeholder engagement efforts, as well as factors that 

management deems to have potential material impacts to our business 

operations. These are reviewed from time to time.

We identified the following categories of material issues along with 

an assessment of the significance of their economic, environmental 

and social impacts and their influence on stakeholders’ decisions 

as followings: 

All newly hired employees are 

required to attend mandatory 

orientation 

training 

courses. 

During these training courses, 

new staffs are taught BCI’s core 

values and the policies listed 

above. We provide dedicated 

training on anti-corruption policies 

and procedures, as a mandatory 

and annual exercise for all staff.

Going forward, we will be working 

to achieve the following goals 

and shall report our progress in 

subsequent sustainability reports:

• 

Aim 

for 

integration 

of 

sustainability governance.

• Maintain zero incidents of non-

compliance with any relevant 

environmental 

and 

social 

regulatory frameworks.

• Gradual expansion of the scope 

of our sustainability reporting to 

include all other BCI projects.

• Full integration of sustainability 

metrics into our ERM system.

Our Approach

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

BCI placed a great value on the diversity of our stakeholders including customers, national and local 

governments, local communities, interest groups and industry associations and shareholders, and seek to 

engage them throughout the year. By maintaining an open connection with all of our stakeholders, we are 

better able to understand their needs and identify what we can do to grow, improve and excel. 

Throughout the reporting period, we have engaged external stakeholders through our regular channels, 

such as annual surveys, shareholder meetings and operational meetings. In addition, we interact with the 

communities through customer satisfaction surveys, engagement with local communities on education and 

healthcare, and working closely with various government entities on joint public infrastructure and safety 

projects (e.g. fire safety or public transport).

Examples of current stakeholder engagement exercises relating to sustainability topics via on-going 

communication are as follows:  

• Annual tenant satisfaction survey for our office buildings 

• Annual employee satisfaction survey 

• Marketing surveys for tenants, potential tenants and hotel guests 

• Annual corporate brand awareness survey undertaken by the management 

• Local community and government sponsored CSR programs

Key topics raised by our internal and external stakeholders during the reporting period include:

supervisors are open to feedback  

from team

• Attractive work opportunities

NEGATIVE

to address performance issues



























































































In this 2018 report, we have mapped out the various GRI disclosures that resulted from the identified material 

issues which caused an impact towards our main stakeholders (please see table on page 42 for details). 

In the meantime, we strongly encourage all readers of this report to send us their feedback on the results of 

our materiality assessment or any other concerns you may have with regard to BCI’s sustainability efforts.

Our Approach

BUND CENTER INVESTMENT LTD



Environment

Using nature as an inspiration, the 

core of our design is to encourage 

social harmony and community 

engagement, providing the right 

balance 

between 

technology, 

nature, people and workplace.

With nearly two hectares of land 

encircled by four separate roads 

namely Yanan, Henan, Guangdong 

and Jian Xi, our development 

have incorporated a number of 

unique design features including a 

spacious garden, an internal-ring 

road and three separate vehicular 

access points. In addition, a 

three level underground carpark 

providing more than 450 carpark 

lots provide ample carparks for 

all tenants and visitors to the 

building, including provision of car 

parks to the medical staffs of the 

neighborhood Renji Hospital (仁

濟醫院) which was founded in the 

year 1844, a university hospital 

affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong 

University School of Medicine.

ENVIRONMENT  

MANAGEMENT 

This section of the report, we 

continually look for ways to improve 

the energy efficiency of our buildings 

and facilities at the various ways 

in which our operations impact 

the environment and lays out our 

commitment to minimise them. 

Our environment initiatives are 

focused on minimizing the material 

environmental 

impacts 

of 

our 

operations, which include energy, 

water and waste. We also actively 

engage staff and customers to 

champion and address some of the 

environmental impacts together.

Covered in this section are:

• Our efforts to improve energy 

efficiency 

and 

reduce 

the 

greenhouse 

gas 

(GHG) 

emissions associated with our 

operations;

In This Section

• Our water usage along with data 

on our effluents and discharges 

generated;

• Statistics on waste created 

and how we are handling it.

 

During the year under review, 

we have introduced a number 

of initiatives at Bund Center 

Office Tower and Westin Bund 

Center such as installing energy 

saving 

and 

sensor-activated 

LED lightings in guest rooms 

and common areas, as well as 

adjusting the water flow in our 

guest rooms. This has resulted in 

a 1.4% decrease in energy usage 

and carbon footprint respectively. 

Non-hazardous wastes reduced 

by 22.2% from 1,084 tonnes in 

2017 to 843 tonnes in 2018 due 

to the lower occupancy rate of 

our hotel, and higher volume 

of recycled items from guest

Environment

rooms. As the average occupancy dropped, it is 

inevitable that we recorded a reduction by 5.3% 

in our year-on-year water consumption from 

2017 to 2018. We are addressing this trend by 

engaging in a number of on-site water efficiency 

initiatives, 

including 

the 

water 

recycling.  

This was achieved through a number of initiatives 

such as:

• Improving the water tap fittings and sensors to 

reduce overflow losses

• Manage the water consumption for cooling 

tower through water recirculation

We plan to implement regiment of water use 

monitoring to detect abnormal usage patterns 

by respective business unit weekly. We are 

looking forward to presenting in future reports 





In FY2018, Westin Bund Center celebrated the 

global Earth Hour champion in sustainability.

how these measures are helping to reduce our 

environmental impact.

Every little act goes a long way, even the simple 

acts of switching off lights during the lunch 

period and collecting rainwater to water plants 

and wash common areas. We have successfully 

implemented a smoking ban and designated a 

no smoking zones at our buildings and deliver 

anti-smoking messages to our employees and 

customers.

Moving ahead, we plan to engage a new waste 

disposal program to improve the recycling 

programme in our buildings. We have also 

embarked on a campaign to educate our guests 

and employees to not waste food and are pleased 

to see encouraging initial results.


20

BUND CENTER INVESTMENT LTD

Environment

At BCI, we understand the significant 

impact of climate change and strive to 

protect the surrounding environment 

through 

policies 

and 

existing 

programs. To realise our commitment 

in implementing developments with 

an environmental cause, our buildings 

are incorporating green architectures 

to conserve energy, water and 

natural resources. All our buildings 

maximise sunlight penetration while 

reducing solar heat, thus boosting 

energy efficiencies, and optimising 

air circulation.  Our buildings reduce 

air-conditioning and lighting energy 

consumption through the use of 

natural lighting and outdoor common 

walkways.

Going forward, we are exploring to 

obtain the Green Building Certification 

in our existing buildings. We have 

also embarked on a sustainability 

program with specific responsibilities 

assigned to staff across all parts 

of the organisation. Through this 

program, we will be able to better 

calculate and eventually reduce the 

energy required in the operation of 

our developments; lower our water 

consumption and carbon emissions, 

leading to better waste management. 

From FY2018 as a baseline, we 

start to disclose our performance 

targets, 

which 

will 

be 

tracked 

and in comparison with FY2019 

performances.

All figures in this section related solely 

to the two buildings, Bund Center 

Office Tower and Westin Bund Center. 

Our current system of data collection 

does not provide for separately 

reporting of our electricity and water 

consumption for Bund Center Office 

Tower and Westin Bund Center. 

Hence, the reported total energy 

consumption includes all combined 

activities from Bund Center Office 

Tower and Westin Bund Center.

Building Energy and Water Consumption 

We continually look for ways to improve our operations so as 

to reduce impact to the environment, improve service to the 

customers and to bring efficiency to our operations. Apart from 

our exploration to obtain an accreditation as an internationally 

recognised green standards building, the Group has in the 

meantime has continue undertake numerous initiatives to reduce 

consumption of energy across our buildings  such as an electrical 

switchboards replacement project made during the year, and 

other gradual implementation of control timing function for our air-

conditioning systems,  usage of energy-efficient LED lightbulbs, 

sensor-activated lightings in common areas, sensor-activated taps 

and toilet equipment. 

 

Building Energy Consumption

During the FY2018, the Bund Center Office Tower and Westin 

Bund Center have introduced initiatives on installing energy 

saving LED lightings in common areas, guest rooms, carpark, 

basements, IT rooms and Back of House.

We are mindful that our operations have 

an impact on water consumption. Water 

is a critical resource and constraints 

on the quality and quantity of water 

available limits our ability to operate 

effectively. Bund Center Office Tower 

and Westin Bund Center recorded a total 

water consumption of 461 thousand m3 

in 2018. Water used at our buildings is 

from the Shanghai Municipal Source. Our 

buildings recorded a reduction of 5.3% in 

water consumption as compared to 2017 

mainly due to the upgrading project on 

water saving devices in our office tower, 

and slightly lower occupancy rate of our 

hotel. We will continue to monitor carefully 

to minimise any water wastages and 

possible discharge of effluents into natural 

water systems.

The following charts provide details on the 

water consumption by Bund Center Office 

Tower and Westin Bund Center. We will 

be gradually expanding coverage for this 

disclosure in our future sustainability reports.

Protecting the health and safety of 

our employees is a key priority and 

we continue to seek to emphasise 

the importance of health and safety 

in the workplace and instil a culture of 

responsible, safe work practices that are 

in line with the Government’s regulations. 

We continually recommend, monitor and 

review safety procedures while identifying 

red-flagging potential risks. In ensuring 

that our practices are in line with the 

best practices of the industry, we have 

put in place reporting procedures for all 

accidents and injuries at the workplace.

Our Disciplined Approach to Ensuring Occupational Health &amp; Safety

Our OHS initiatives include safety checks to ensure compliance by 

our employees and contractors; and the annual OHS equipment 

certification for compliance with the fire safety standards of the 

Shanghai Fire Control Bureau. We have implemented the following 

important layer of occupational health and safety checks to ensuring 

the occupational health and safety: 

1. Increased frequency of checking by the project Environmental 

Health and Safety team on daily and weekly basis 

2. Regular quality assurance, assessment on risk and control on 

OHS and environment by Colliers International.  

We carry out fire drills and simulation periodically to ensure that 

these procedures are understood and implemented, ensuring a 

safety culture being instilled in our operations. We also conduct 

regular trainings and awareness programs on health and safety for 

our workforce and tenants.

We take OHS incidents very seriously. All incidents are reported to the 

Safety Department, which will be included in the Monthly Operation 

Report that is submitted to Division Heads. For some categories of 







Fire and hazards prevention exercise are being 

conducted four time annually with the participation 

of the Shanghai Fire Control Bureau.
