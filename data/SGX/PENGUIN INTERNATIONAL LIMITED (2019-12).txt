1. About Penguin International Limited 

Penguin International Limited (“Penguin”) is a Singaporean publicly listed designer-builder-owner-operator 

of aluminium high-speed marine craft. The company was incorporated in 1976 and listed on SGX in 1997. 

 

Since 1995, we have delivered over 200 aluminium vessels comprising crewboats, patrol boats, passenger 

ferries, fireboats and windfarm support vessels to ship owners around the world. These include some 150 of 

our proprietary-designed “Flex” offshore crewboats and security boats. 

 

Penguin is the world’s most prolific builder1 of mid-sized crewboats/security boats for the offshore and 

maritime security industries. In some markets, our “Flex” brand has become the industry standard. 

 

Our shipyards in Singapore and Batam build ships for stock and to order, funded mostly by the company’s 

internal cash reserves. They also undertake a variety of repair and conversion projects. 

 

In addition, we operate a fleet of our own “Flex” crewboats, passenger ferries and general workboats. These 

vessels primarily serve oil companies and government/corporate charterers around Southeast Asia. 

 

Our owned-and-operated vessels are well maintained and professionally managed by an in-house ship 

management team, backed by our own shipyards. 

 

Above all that we say and do, we prize people over profit and we abide by international standards of health, 

safety, environment and quality, corporate governance and sustainable business practices.

2. About the Report  

It is our pleasure to present you our FY2019 Sustainability Report (SR2019) covering the period 1 January 

2019 to 31 December 2019. This report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative 

(“GRI”) Standards – Core Reporting Requirements and the SGX-ST Mainboard Listing Rule 711(B). We chose 

to follow the GRI Standards as they are a globally recognised reporting framework consisting of a 

comprehensive list of disclosures that are well suited to Penguin’s business and the industry that we operate 

in. 

 

The SR2019 highlights our Economic, Environmental, Social and Governance (“EESG”) material matters that 

impact our business performance and key stakeholders across two business segments: (1) charter services, 

and (2) shipbuilding, ship repair and maintenance in Singapore, Batam and Malaysia. 

 

We have not sought external assurance on the disclosures for this report but may consider doing it as our 

reporting matures over time.

4. Our Approach to Sustainability 

Sustainability lies at the core of Penguin. We prioritise people over profit. We believe in true value creation, 

which transcends the pure profit needs of the present and leads to the betterment of people, community 

and society. 

 

From our goals and visions to our business model to our long-term strategic plans to our day-to-day 

operations, we strive to adopt and implement measures which result contribute to sustainable growth.  

 

Through our visionary management team led by the principles of servant leadership and our unique 

collective capabilities as an integrated designer-builder-owner-operator of high-speed aluminium vessels, 

we embrace challenges and change, and we drive constant improvement and innovation. 

 

Together, we stand strong in the face of adversity as we work together to stay close to our clients and ahead 

of our competitors, as we pursue sustainable returns for all our stakeholders. 

 

a. Sustainability Governance 

Penguin’s Board of Directors (“The Board”) oversees our sustainability strategy and the management of 

critical sustainability matters. The Sustainability 

Committee consisting of our Managing Director and 

our Finance and Administration Director ensures the 

implementation of our sustainability strategy and the 

evaluation of our progress against our commitments. 

The successful implementation of our strategies relies 

on our various Department and Unit Heads. They are 

responsible for integrating sustainable practices into 

our day-to-day operations.  

Through regular discussions and updates, our 

Sustainability Committee continually assesses our 

performance and provides input where needed. 

Annually, during our February Board Meeting, The 

Board reviews our sustainability performance as part of 

our overall enterprise risk management process. The 

review includes key sustainability material matters to 

ensure 

their 

continued 

relevance. 

For 

more 

information on overall Corporate Governance, please refer to pages 29 to 45 in our 2019 Annual Report. 

 

Board Statement 

The Board is pleased to present its third Sustainability Report prepared in accordance to GRI Standards and 

SGX-ST’s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines for listed companies in Singapore. The Board, together with the 

Sustainability Committee considers sustainability matters as part of the Group’s growth strategy. The Board 

has approved the material ESG factors and determined them to be relevant for the current year. The Board 

shall ensure that these ESG matters are monitored and managed.  

 

As we make progress in our sustainability journey, we urge all our stakeholders to partake in our commitment 

to sustainability as we work together towards a common goal of improving the economic, environmental and 

social well-being of the world that we live and work in.

c. Materiality Assessment 

Prior to embarking on our first Sustainability Report for FY2017, we conducted a formal materiality 

assessment in September 2017 to identify Penguin’s key economic environmental, social and governance 

matters. The sustainability material matters were reviewed again in FY2019 and determined to be relevant 

for the year.  

 

Figure 4: Our Four-Step Materiality Assessment Process 

 

Facilitated by an independent sustainability 

consultant, Penguin embarked on a rigorous 

four-step materiality assessment. 

1. Identification of potential sustainability 

matters for Penguin through a series of 

stakeholder engagement sessions and 

desktop research; 

2. Through an anonymous electronic voting 

exercise conducted among key managers 

and staff, sustainability matters were 

prioritised, which resulted in a total of 

nine sustainability matters (six material 

and three additional) for reporting; 

3. These material matters were presented to 

the Board for their validation; and 

4. Selected material matters may undergo 

review in subsequent reporting periods to 

ensure its continued relevance to 

Penguin’s operations. 

The Board had approved the relevance of the 

existing nine sustainability matters. Penguin will 

continue to disclose its sustainability 

performance data based on these nine 

sustainability matters.

5. Product Quality Stewardship  

As a market leader in mid-sized aluminium fast craft, Penguin is constantly striving to stay ahead through 

constant improvement and innovation, from ship design through to ship construction and operation, 

drawing on our core capabilities as a designer, builder, owner and operator of high-speed vessels. 

 

Here are some examples of our commitment to product quality stewardship in 2019: 

 

Industry accolade for Penguin's flagship Flex-42X and further improvements 

On 6 February 2020, Penguin made history when our flagship Flex-42X Executive Fast Crew Boat, Alkahfi 

Chief, won Offshore Support Journal’s “Support Vessel of the Year” Award at a grand awards ceremony-cum-

gala dinner in London attended by industry veterans and luminaries. 

 

This is the first time that an aluminium boat has won this coveted award, against a field of much larger and 

more complex steel offshore support vessels. The nomination and online voting process began in 2019 and 

culminated in the winner being announced during the OSJ gala dinner. 

 

Delivered in June 2019, Alkahfi Chief was the seventh and latest version of Penguin’s innovative Flex-42X 

design, which was developed in collaboration with our UK design partner, BMT. The Flex-42X can hit speeds 

of up to 30 knots and features an optimised 42m hullform, active interceptors, business class seating in 

friendly 2-by-2 arrangement and a remotely accessible electronic fuel management system. 

 

However, unlike all the Flex-42X that came before it, Alkahfi Chief has a 12m motion-compensated gangway 

permanently mounted on its aft deck. Supplied by Norway’s Undertun and marketed by Uptime, the “walk-

to-work” gangway enables the safe and efficient transfer of passengers between the ship and any offshore 

facility, including other vessels. In fact, Alkahfi Chief is one of the first mid-sized aluminium crewboats in Asia 

to feature a walk-to-work gangway. 

 

Hot on the heels of Alkahfi Chief, we have made further improvements to our Flex-42X for our 2020 

production. Watch this space in our next Sustainability Report!

Penguin’s First Crew Transfer Vessel and a World’s First in Offshore Wind 

In September 2019, Penguin made its first foray into the offshore wind industry when it delivered a 26m 

catamaran Crew Transfer Vessel (CTV) to Ventus Marine, a subsidiary of Singapore’s PSA Marine. The CTV, 

christened Ventus Beigang, was designed by BMT and built by Penguin for the transportation and offshore 

transfer of up to 12 technicians between shore bases and offshore wind turbines in Taiwan. 

 

While Ventus Beigang was under construction, Penguin and BMT were jointly developing a prototype 

windfarm support vessel dubbed the Service Accommodation and Transfer Vessel (SATV). Unlike CTV’s, the 

SATV is specially designed to enable technicians to live aboard comfortably for more than a week, while 

commuting daily to the windfarms. This new concept, based on a fit-for-purpose platform for offshore wind, 

could potentially reduce costs and downtime significantly by eliminating the need for large steel Service 

Operation Vessels and long daily commutes from shore to windfarm. 

 

As a world first, the SATV is a game changer for offshore wind, combining the features and benefits of an 

aluminium CTV with a steel SOV. However, the SATV’s development was challenged by the area of operations 

in offshore Taiwan, where the treacherous weather conditions tend to curtail offshore installation, operation 

and maintenance activities. 

 

To ensure a safe and comfortable ride in rough weather, the SATV design incorporated a large “floating” 

superstructure that is precision-mounted on special shock absorbers, as well as controllable pitch propellers 

and a variety of active ride control systems integrated with one another. 

 










12 

 

 

In March 2020, following extensive trials and tests, Penguin delivered the world’s first SATV, christened 

Ventus Formosa, to Ventus Marine for deployment in Taiwan’s Formosa 1 offshore wind project.

More Penguin Firsts 

2019 saw two other “Penguin Firsts”: 

(1) We delivered our first purpose-built patrol boats (7 in total) to the New South Wales Police in Australia; 

(2) We delivered our first-in-series stock ferry, the Flex Ferry X, to the government of South Africa.  

Significantly, these were also our first shipbuilding projects with the governments of Australia and South 

Africa. 

 

 

Patrol Boats for Sydney’s Water Police 

 

Flex Ferry X for Cape Town 

 

The above examples demonstrate Penguin’s ongoing commitment to product quality stewardship, 

continuous improvement and innovation, as well as diversification of products and markets, in our never-

ending journey of sustainability. 

 

 

 

 










13 

 

 

6. Economic Resilience 

As a global leader in our sector, we continue to harness the numerous opportunities generated by our unique 

and dynamic capabilities as an integrated designer-builder-owner-operator of high-speed aluminium ships. 

 

In 2019, we effectively broadened our product range and market reach through our maiden deliveries of 

windfarm support vessels for Taiwan and police patrol boats for Australia, as well as a first-in-series new 

passenger ferry design for South Africa. We also built on our recently established track record in fireboats to 

secure a shipbuilding contract with the Kuwait Fire Service Directorate, for whom we built five 40-knot 

search-and-rescue vessels.

Meanwhile, we delivered our 60th Flex Fighter armoured security boat to a Nigerian shipowner and our 7th 

Flex-42X Executive Fast Crew Boat to our own Malaysian fleet in 2019. As part of our fleet renewal 

programme, we sold five old vessels in 2019, while adding four new vessels to our owned-and-operated fleet.

Over in our Batam shipyard, PT Kim Seah Shipyard Indonesia, we commissioned our fifth new workshop to 

take on additional shipbuilding projects. We also commenced further expansion works in the yard, including 

the construction of an additional floor in the main office block and new waterfront facilities, all of which are 

scheduled to be completed in late 2020.

In FY2019, Penguin’s group cash and cash equivalent increased 40.6% year-on-year to $59.9 million.  

 

Despite numerous challenges on the supply side and demand side posed by Covid-19 and oil in 2020, Penguin 

continues to stand strong, thanks to a constantly evolving business strategy, a hand-to-heart approach 

towards client servicing and prudent cash management. 

 

 

Sharing the Joy: Making a Difference in Batam and Singapore 

On the community front, we continue to be involved in various outreach programmes. In Batam, we 

regularly support and sponsor various development activities at nearby villages. In Singapore, we regularly 

contribute to non-profit organisations such as the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA), Life 

Community Services Society, Singapore Association for the Deaf and others.

Festive Outreach to a Village in Batam 

 

 

 

 

 

On 8 May 2019, Penguin’s wholly owned PT Kim Seah Shipyard Indonesia (PTKS) in Batam received a letter 

of appeal from the Chief of Tanjung Riau village requesting for our contribution to their “Sembako” (basic 

necessities) for the upcoming Hari Raya. 

 

The chief shared a list of 242 needy people, who were either single and elderly or young and orphaned, 

that required support for their daily needs. The General Manager of PTKS brought this matter to the 

management of Penguin International Limited in Singapore and together, they promptly reached a 

consensus to support this worthy community outreach programme. 

 

The managers and staff of PTKS worked together to prepare goodie bags containing basic food items like 

rice, condense milk, eggs, etc. to be distributed to the villagers. 

 

On 29 May 2019, the day we were scheduled to distribute the goodie bags, the morning started off with 

a heavy downpour. However, that did not prevent our volunteers from braving the rain to transport the 

goodie bags to the village meeting point. When the rain stopped, the villagers started arriving, some with 

help from their neighbours.  

 

The event proceeded smoothly and we were able to distribute all the goodie bags to the rightful folks as 

planned.  

 

The village chief and the villagers expressed their thanks to the staff and management of PTKS. Our 

dedicated volunteers - themselves tired, hungry and wet - were happy that they could make a difference 

to the lives of the needy. 

 

We ended the day by telling the village chief that we would like to be back the following year!

YMCA’s Garden Party in Singapore 

 

On 20 July 2019, 20 Penguin volunteers comprising management and staff from our Singapore office 

joined YMCA for their annual YMCA Proms @ the Park at Gardens by the Bay. The event attracted some 

100 voluntary welfare organisations and featured Guest of Honour, President Mdm Halimah Yacob.   

 

Each Penguin volunteer was paired with a special needs child. Together, we spent the afternoon 

accompanying our new friends through fun activities and a concert in the park. 

 

For most of us, this was a truly unique experience as we got to spend the day with special needs children 

for the first time and got to see one another in a different light. In addition, Penguin also made a cash 

contribution to YMCA. 

 

Over the years, Penguin has been supporting YMCA in various ways. The organisation is all-inclusive in 

nature and it serves as a hub for more than 30 other voluntary welfare organisations and self-help groups 

in Singapore. Penguin is honoured to be working with YMCA.

7. Our People, Our Assets 

As one of the three fundamental principles in our sustainability strategy, Penguin prioritises people over 

profit. We firmly believe that our people are our greatest asset. In 2019, Penguin employed close to 600 staff, 

workers and crew in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. At all times, we maintain a culturally diverse, fair 

and inclusive workplace that nurtures and cultivates a passion for excellence, innovation and sustainable 

value creation. 

 

a. Staff Demographics 

Our workforce has been steadily increasing over the past three years, in line with an increase in our 

shipbuilding and chartering activities. In 2019, we employed 595 men and women, up from 542 employees 

in 2018. Most of our employees are full-time and permanent, with part-time/temporary staff accounting for 

16% of our total workforce. 

 

While the marine and offshore industry has traditionally been male-dominated, Penguin constantly strives 

for gender diversity in its offices, shipyards and ships. We are proud to have a female Executive Director on 

our Board of Directors, female employees in ship design and ship repair, as well as female crew on board our 

ferries. Please refer to Figures 7 and 8 below for a breakdown of our workforce statistics.

b. Workplace Diversity and Fairness 

Policies and Practices 

Penguin has been a signatory to Singapore’s Tripartite Alliance for Fair &amp; Progressive Employment Practices 

(TAFEP) since 2014, a commitment that we reaffirm year after year. As a TAFEP signatory, we believe in fair 

employment which is merit-based and non-discriminatory. 

 

Over the years, we have been able to attract and retain talents with the right skillsets, attitudes and 

capabilities to contribute to our sustainable practices. Our management practises an open-door policy where 

employees regardless of rank are encouraged to reach out and speak up at all times. This practice is 

enshrined in Penguin’s Whistle Blowing Policy, which aims to provide an avenue for employees to raise 

concerns about possible improprieties and obstructive action within the group which they become aware of, 

and to provide reassurance that they will be protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle-blowing in 

good faith and without malice. 

 

In addition, management regularly communicates updates on company developments and strategies in a 

timely manner. 

 

Our Human Resource Policies and Procedures 

Penguin is committed to fair employment practices and does not discriminate any person based on his 

or her race, religion, gender, age, marital status, nationality, disability or medical condition. We value 

and respect each and every employee and are committed to training, developing, rewarding and 

promoting employees based on their attitude and performance at work. 

Penguin’s human resource policies and procedures include, but are not limited to, the following areas of 

employments: 

• Fair Employment Practices  

• Dispute Resolutions  

• Harassment  

• Performance Management

Figure 9: FY2019 Workforce Diversity by Nationality and Age Group 

 

We have procedures in place to ensure our human resource policy and practices are consistently applied 

across all our operating units regardless of where they are located. We always comply with local laws and 

regulations. Depending on an employee’s level of employment, they also enjoy a range of welfare and 

benefits listed below. 

 

Employment Benefits 

All full-time employees enjoy a range of employment benefits from health care insurance 4, disability 

coverage, parental leave and retirement provision. 

 

Training and Development 

We encourage lifelong training and development among all our employees. Our crew, for example, are 

required to keep their relevant certificates of proficiency updated as they gain shipboard experience and rise 

through the ranks. Our shipyard workers undergo both mandatory induction and situational training as they 

journey with us in their career growth. 

 

Performance Appraisals 

All our employees – inclusive of staff and workers - are appraised annually by their superiors. Their appraisal 

results will go into determining their annual bonuses if bonuses are due for that year. In this process, there 

is no discrimination between office staff and foreign workers. Crew members working on board our vessels 

are assessed by their respective Masters and endorsed by the Crewing Officer/Manager.

c. FY2019 Employment Statistics 

In 2019, we recruited 155 new employees to keep up with the growth of our shipbuilding and chartering 

businesses. In our recruitment process, we sought out the most-qualified candidates with the right 

experience, attitude and job fit - regardless of age, gender or race. 

 

Figure 10: FY2019 New Hires and Turnover by Gender, Age Group and Region 

New Hires in FY2019: 155 

 

 

In 2019, we had a total of 102 cessations. Crew members on Seafarers’ Agreement are typically employed 

on a one-year contract and will tend to cease their employment after that. This is a common practice within 

the maritime and offshore industry. In between employment, many of our crew will use the time to undergo 

training to upgrade themselves and return to work with their higher certification. Most of our crew are 

Indonesian males who belong to the younger age group. Other reasons for cessation are foreign workers 

wanting to return home after working in Singapore for a few years. Among Singaporean employees, many 

leave for a different career or a higher salary or better perceived prospects. A handful of cessations are 

involuntary ones initiated by the company through disciplinary dismissal or contractual termination.

8. Safety  

a. Safety on board our vessels for crew and passengers 

 

In our vessel operations, we believe that everyone has a role 

to play in ensuring a safe working environment on board. We 

go beyond regulatory requirements and comply with more 

stringent Oil and Gas Producer (OGP) standards5, as most of 

our clients are in the oil and gas industry. 

 

In our fleet management team, our Deputy General 

Manager, supported by our Designated Person Ashore 

(DPA), oversees and enforces safe practices on board all our 

operated vessels. 

 

On board our vessels, our Masters have day-to-day 

responsibility over the health and safety of their crew and 

passengers and our responsibility towards the environment. 

 

We promote a no-blame safety culture among all our 

stakeholders. 

 

 

Training Our Crew to Safely Operate our Walk-to-Work Gangway 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Working with the supplier of our 12m motion-compensated gangway, we conducted several hands-on 

training sessions in 2019 for selected staff and crew in our Singapore shipyard and offshore Malaysia. Today, 

the gangway on board Alkahfi Chief is manned and maintained solely by our own crew – a first in Asia. 

 

 

 

5 Oil and Gas Producers (OGP): https://www.iogp.org/oil-and-gas-safety/ 





 

Penguin has a suite of policies governing 

safety on board our vessels for crew and 

passengers. These include but are not 

limited to: 

• Safety and Environment Policy 

Statement 

• Stop Work Authority Policy 

• Navigation Policy  

• Drug and Alcohol Policy Statement  

 

In 2019, there were no significant changes 

made to the content of these policies. For 

details of each policy referenced above, 

please refer to our 2017 Sustainability 

Report. 

 


22 

 

 

Training Our Crew in Loss Prevention 

In 2019, we conducted several sessions of this training programme, which is aimed at increasing awareness 

and competency of our vessels’ masters and crew in preventing losses on board. Loss in the context of this 

training includes injury, death, pollution, property damage and business loss. There were several safety tools 

introduced and taught by the trainer, which include Hazard Identification Risk Assessment and Risk Control 

(HIRARC), Job Safety Analysis (JSA), Safe Performance Self Assessment (SPSA), Unsafe Situation Reporting 

(UCUA), and Behavioural Observation (BEOB). 

 

 

 

 

 

“You See You Action” Safety Campaign 

We launched the Vessel UCUX (“You See You Action”) campaign in late 2018 

and continued with the programme through 2019. 

 

This campaign is aimed at raising safety alertness of crew members through 

situational awareness. 

 

Crew members are encouraged to submit daily UCUX reports identifying 

unsafe acts or conditions on board their vessel. 

 

Through this programme, we hope to bring about a behavioural change 

towards safety by highlighting the importance of hazard identification on a 

daily basis. 

 

 

Safe Bunkering Campaign 

This campaign was launched in February 2019 and was implemented throughout 2019. Unsafe bunkering 

practices is one common cause of fires and oil spills. Details can be found in the slides below. 

 

 

 

 

 










23 

 

 

Fleet Safety Performance 

Safety statistics for our fleet operations are collated and evaluated regularly. Quarterly safety reports are 

submitted to the Penguin board for review. 

 

We operate a no-blame safety culture and we target zero fatalities, zero lost work day cases, zero restricted 

work day cases and zero medical treatment cases. While we actively work towards achieving these targets, 

incidents still may occur. In such instances, we respond swiftly to establish root causes, learn from the 

incidents and seek to prevent a reoccurrence. 

 

In 2019, we recorded no reportable incident on board our vessels.

b. Safety – Occupational Health and Safety in our Shipyards 

Penguin Shipyard is certified bizSAFE STAR by Singapore’s Workplace Safety and Health Council. To achieve 

this certification, we had to obtain Occupational Health and Safety Management (OHSAS) 18001 

certification9 and have a valid risk management implementation audit report by a Ministry of Manpower-

Approved Workplace Safety and Health auditor. Our Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) committee, led by 

the General Manager, is responsible for Occupational Health and Safety Management. 

 

Since May 2019, the WSH committee has been organising monthly shipyard walkabouts involving Penguin’s 

Managing Director and members of his management team, as well as subcontractors. 

 

There was one minor reportable incident in 2019.

9. Environment  

a. Shipyards’ Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions 

Our shipyards in Singapore and Batam account for the bulk of energy consumed at our workplaces, while 

our office in Kuala Lumpur accounts for only a fraction of total consumption. In addition to drawing electricity 

from their respective power grids, our shipyards also consume diesel and lubricants used in the operation of 

fork lifts, scissor lifts, cranes and other heavy machinery. 

 

In 2019, the total electricity, fuel and lubricants consumed by our shipyards was 16,301 GJ, representing a 

36.9% rise from the previous year and translating to 1,926 tonnes of CO2 emissions. The increase in energy 

consumption and GHG emissions was due mostly to increased shipbuilding activity. However, total energy 

intensity per vessel under construction over the same period fell, as a result of improved economies of scale.

b. Vessel Emissions 

Our vessels operate primarily in Singapore and Malaysia. All of them depend on Marine Diesel Oil (MDO) for 

fuel. 

 

Our fuel consumption data account for all crewboat, ferry and workboat operations in Singapore and 

Malaysia. In 2019, our fleet consumed a total of 1,131,049 GJ15 of MDO, translating to 84,206.21 tonnes of 

CO2 emissions16. 

 

In recent years, our fuel consumption has increased in line with an expanding fleet and higher utilisation 

rates. Over time, however, we hope to improve on our overall fuel efficiency by switching to electronic 

engines (eg, Caterpillar electronic engines versus Cummins mechanical engines), installing electronic fuel 

management systems on selected vessels, enforcing a strict regime of planned maintenance and educating 

our crew on vessel handling.

10. Corporate Governance 

Regulatory Compliance 

As part of our commitment to sustainable practices, we ensure that we comply with all applicable legal and 

regulatory requirements at all times. These requirements include relevant Primary Legislative Status (Acts) 

passed by Parliament, the Subsidiary Legislations (Regulations, Notifications and Orders) issued by the 

relevant governmental agencies, and the applicable Singapore Standards and Codes of Practice. We also 

comply with the relevant industrial standards and codes, with policies and procedures in place to guide the 

implementation. 

 

At present, each department and unit within our organisation is responsible for monitoring and reporting 

compliance matters relevant to their respective functions. Information gathered on legal and other 

requirements are cascaded in a timely manner to the respective departments and units, as well as our 

suppliers and subcontractors. 

 

There was no case of regulatory non-compliance in 2019.  

 

Business Ethics 

We remain steadfast in upholding ethics in our business practices and we target zero lapses in the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018. Our robust business ethics framework and anti-corruption policies (Figure 20) 

provides guidance on the right conduct to prevent even perceived improprieties17. All employees of Penguin 

- including full-time, part-time and contract employees - are encouraged to immediately report, without fear 

of retaliation, any concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other relevant 

matters. Complaints can be raised through our whistle-blowing channel. Our whistle blowing policy is 

published on our website.  

 

There was no case of whistle blowing or anti-corruption complaints in 2019. 

 

Figure 20: Our Anti-Corruption Policies 

 

 

* Conflict of Interest Policy is applicable for purchasing department on all purchasing decisions 

 

 

17 Possible Improprieties refers to any activity, breach of business conduct and ethics or omission by an Employee of the Group; or any concerns
