Types of Customers

Our comprehensive range of inventory, years of experience and engineering capabilities allow us to respond to the needs of our 

customers quickly and efficiently, making AMOS a one-stop solutions provider for our customers.  

AMOS has a close relationship with its strategic partners 

and suppliers who are committed to high quality and safety 

standards.  The purchasing of wire rope, fibre rope, and all 

other materials are from reputable manufacturers.

The materials are assembled into finished products known as 

slings by swaging the end terminations with ferrules or hand 

splicing.  Finished products of lifting and mooring gear are 

also stocked for re-supply to end users. 

Our suppliers have to ensure that their product quality is well-

maintained.  We conduct suppliers’ assessments periodically 

to ensure high quality and that their pricing is reasonable.

AMOS adheres to a set of values that are set out in its Code of Conduct.  These values give rise to a number of principles that 

guide our employees’ conduct:

AMOS operates under the broad regulatory and standards 

umbrella associated with both offshore Oil and Gas, and 

Maritime Industries.  While AMOS and its operations are not 

always prescriptively bound by all associated regulations, 

such as the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”), Classification 

Societies, International Organization for Standardization 

(“ISO”) and International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), its 

customers often are.  Consequently, as a service company 

we remain dedicated to their requirements and expectations.  

In addition to receiving and reviewing relevant industry 

publications and technical subscriptions, AMOS is also a 

member of a number of associations that enable the business 

to keep abreast of external factors that impact its market, 

future business operations and orientation.  Some examples 

of such associations are listed below:

DEAR VALuED STAkEhoLDERS, 

On behalf of the Board of Directors (“the Board”) and 

Management, we are pleased to present our inaugural 

Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 March 

2018 (“FY2018”) as a statement of our commitment to 

creating long-term value for all our stakeholders.  

AMOS Group Limited’s strategic vision is to become a 

leading international supplier of diversified products, services 

and solutions to global customers in the marine and offshore 

sectors.  We recognize the growing importance of sustainable 

business practices in all our operations, and we believe in 

delivering shareholder value responsibly and contributing to 

society positively.  We place great emphasis on employing 

a strategic approach to manage and oversee Economic, 

Environmental, Social and Governance (“EESG”) factors 

significant to our business.  This is evidenced by the increasing 

proportion of environmental-friendly materials and solutions 

in the range of technical supplies and daily consumables we 

provide for the marine and offshore workplaces. 

To determine EESG factors material to the Group, we 

conducted our first materiality assessment in 2017.  This effort 

was facilitated by independent sustainability consultants.  

In this report, we discuss how AMOS manages these key 

material issues: dealing with customers, suppliers and 

employees, environmental protection and business strategy. 

The sustainability disclosures in this report complement the 

operational and financial disclosures in our FY2018 Annual 

Report to provide a comprehensive view of the Group’s 

performance and activities in that financial year. 

As we embark on our sustainability journey, we encourage 

our stakeholders and business partners to join us in furthering 

the economic, environmental, and social well-being of the 

communities with which we interact, together contributing to 

a sustainable society. 

Thank you.

AMOS has engaged and worked closely with Virtus Assure 

Pte Ltd (“the Consultant”) to develop a questionnaire to 

identify the EESG factors that were deemed important to 

the Group and its stakeholders.  The questionnaire was then 

independently undertaken by the Consultant using an online 

survey tool.

We contacted key stakeholders and issued the questionnaire 

to obtain their feedback on the sustainability issue of the 

Group.  These key stakeholders were identified based on 

their ability to influence the Group’s performance and provide 

effective solutions to incorporate sustainability into our 

operations. 

An online survey was sent to 25 internal stakeholders and 

22 external stakeholders to rate and prioritize what they 

deemed as important and material EESG factors. The top 5 

EESG factors selected from the survey for each group of 

stakeholders were as follows:

AMOS has an ERP system to improve business efficiency and 

provide better visibility.  ERP modules have been extended to 

include manufacturing, inventory management, raw material 

purchasing and distribution. 

In the next few years, we aim to strengthen our operations 

by implementing the ERP system fully across all subsidiaries.

Within its sustainable supply chain management system, 

AMOS achieves cost efficiency by negotiating better prices, 

free up storage space and minimize holding cost and 

improve delivery lead time.  It also improves the quality of our 

products.  We assess our suppliers to gain assurances on 

their products, raw materials or services provided. 

We developed a set of questionnaires to review and update 

the background of our suppliers.  The questionnaire includes 

query on necessary licenses to establish whether our 

suppliers have developed a quality management system to 

ensure that only good quality products are sold to AMOS in 

compliance with certain license criteria.  Another benefit for 

adopting such review methods is to enable us to identify any 

change in the current price of products sold to us.  

During FY2018, AMOS engaged with 49 new suppliers for their 

products and services.  We conducted supplier assessments 

before we engaged them.  

The scope of such supplier assessment is covered in the 

questionnaire and pertains to quality management, health and 

safety management and environment management systems, 

as well as policies and procedures that the suppliers should 

have in place or are going to put in place.  We conducted 

this assessment on 22 of our existing suppliers.  Completed 

questionnaires and copies of ISO certificates were collected 

and deemed satisfactory. 

In future, we plan to conduct such supplier assessment 

exercise on both new and existing suppliers to ensure the 

sustainability of the quality of their products.

In today’s world, we keep ourselves up-to-date with a 

rapidly changing business environment as the requirements 

and expectations from various stakeholders become 

more demanding.  We believe that the technical skills and 

knowledge of our employees are critical to the sustainability 

of our business.  Our employees are expected to improve 

their skills and knowledge through various training courses 

and attended the following training courses during FY2018 to 

attain certain specific technical skills crucial to our business:

Training programs help improve the skills and knowledge of 

our employees which in turn translates into an improvement 

in the quality of our products.  We have a strict quality 

assurance policy in place to ensure that our products are in 

good condition when delivered to customers.

The Company will continuously look for similar suitable 

training programs and enhance the technical skills of our 

employees in the future.

AMOS recognizes that health, safety, security and care of the 

environment are integral parts of our business processes. 

During FY2018, there was one reportable incident which was 

required to be reported to Ministry of Manpower.  A male 

worker had sustained a work-related injury and was taken to 

hospital immediately.

AMOS has a strong and ongoing commitment to Occupational 

Health and Safety (“OHS”) at our workplace and integrates 

OHS policies into our daily business processes.  We are 

committed to prevent ill health and injury in and around the 

workplace and are dedicated to maintaining the OHS of all 

employees, suppliers/contractors, customers, neighbours 

and other stakeholders.  This commitment is supported 

by top management and is the individual and collective 

responsibility of all employees.

To maintain a high standard and quality of our products, 

quality assurance (“QA”) management is in place when 

manufacturing to meet customers’ expectations.  

AMOS is ISO 9001:20153 and ISO/IEC 17020:2012 certified. 

We have developed a strong QA team with effective policies 

and procedures to carry out proper inspection on our work-

in-progress and finished products.  Our team also conducts 

We will continue to recognize and exercise responsibility to:

• Conduct ongoing identification of hazards, the assessment 

of risks and the implementation of necessary control 

measures.

• Minimize 

incidents 

and 

manage 

hazards 

through 

conducting OHS inspection and regular appropriate 

training.

• Comply with local OHS legislation and other requirements.

• Continually review and improve OHS management and 

performance.

Every employee is required to exercise reasonable care to 

abide by the safety rules and regulations laid down and report 

any unsafe practices and/or activity to their supervisor so that 

necessary preventive action can be taken.

Our target is to create a desirable OHS environment within the 

Group with zero reportable incidents.  

sampling tests during our manufacturing process which are 

documented and reviewed by our QA Manager.  If a defect is 

detected, our QA inspectors will identify the root cause of the 

defect and rectify the issue immediately.  We recorded a few 

cases of goods returned from our customers during FY2018 

with only a minimal related to product quality.  

We aim to manufacture future products with zero defects.
