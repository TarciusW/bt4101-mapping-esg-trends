Board Statement  

We are pleased to present AEI’s third Sustainability Report and share our progress and commitment 

towards sustainability in Financial Year (FY) 2019.  

As the sole aluminium extruder with production facilities in Singapore, AEI aims to meet our customers’ 

needs with quality and in a timely manner. In our efforts to maximize returns to our shareholder, we 

understand the need that to do so requires the ability to create sustainable value over the long-term 

which calls for the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters into our 

business.  

The Board works closely with our senior management team to understand which and how ESG matters 

could impact our business and stakeholders, including our employees, suppliers, investors and local 

communities where we operate. In our annual review to prioritise the material ESG matters that are 

most relevant to our operations, we have concluded that the same matters identified in FY2018 

remain relevant to the Group in FY2019. We will continue to provide oversight in supervising and 

managing these challenging matters. The Board is also actively reviewing the future business direction 

of the Company. 

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused disruptions to economic and social activities 

globally at the point of publication, we are committed to stepping up our existing measures to further 

safeguard the health and safety of our stakeholders, while seeking to minimise any potential 

disruptions to our operations.   

We are grateful for your continued support and confidence, and look forward to working with you to 

build a better and sustainable business.

Materiality Assessment 

In 2018, we conducted our first materiality assessment to identify AEI’s key ESG matters. Both internal 

and external stakeholders’ perspectives were considered in the process, which is summarised in Figure 

3 below. Five material matters across three focus areas were prioritised, and they remain relevant in 

FY2019, forming the basis of this report. We will continue to review these matters and update them 

where necessary.

Managing Corporate Governance 

Ethics, Bribery and Corruption 

 

We understand the importance of sound corporate governance and business ethics for sustained 

growth of our organisation. To that end, we have established corporate policies to guide our 

governance processes and our employees’ behaviours. These policies are in line with the revised Code 

of Corporate Governance 2018 issued under the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  

Whistle-blowing Policy 

AEI’s whistle-blowing policy is communicated to all employees upon employment. The whistle-

blowing policy encourages all employees to raise concerns about improprieties or potential 

improprieties confidentially, without fear of reprisals. All reports will be treated with full 

confidentiality to protect the identity and interest of the whistleblowers. Employees can report such 

matters to their immediate supervisors or the HR department, who are then required to forward the 

issues to the Audit Committee Chairman. Following investigations, the Chairman will then review the 

matter and report the findings to the Board. Thereafter, appropriate actions will be taken to ensure 

that similar occurrences will not be repeated. 

Interested Persons Transaction Policy 

This policy is established with internal procedures and controls to ensure that transactions with 

interested persons are properly reviewed, approved, and conducted at arm’s length basis. 

Insider Trading Policy 

We have an Insider Trading Policy, which details restrictions for Directors and employees of the 

Company on trading in AEI’s securities when they are privy to insider information. 

We are pleased to report that we continue to maintain a record of zero incident of corruption for 

FY2019. We will strive to maintain our positive track record of being free from any non-compliance 

with corporate governance requirements and the law.

Our Social Responsibility 

AEI believes that our employees are our key assets and we are committed to fair hiring practices and 

treatment. We hire our employees based on merit and offer suitable candidates job opportunities 

regardless of their race, gender, religion or ethnicity. We are in full compliance of all relevant labour 

laws and regulations where we operate.  

As at 31 December 2019, AEI had a workforce of 63 full-time employees as compared to 68 in FY2018. 

All the 63 employees are based in Singapore and employed under permanent contracts. As illustrated 

in Figure 4 below, the percentage of female to male employees remained rather consistent with the 

previous year.   

Figure 4: Percentage composition of total employees by gender 

 

Employee Training   

We believe that reliable and experienced employees are key to delivering quality products and 

maintaining trusting relations with our customers. As such, our HR department invests in and plans 

for appropriate training opportunities to equip and keep our employees up-to-date with the necessary 

knowledge and skillsets. A training policy has been established by the HR team, detailing a process to 

identify important training needs for the company.  

All new employees are introduced to the organisation via a mandatory orientation programme. 

Through this programme, they learn about AEI’s strategic business objectives, corporate values and 

ethics,  and sustainability direction from internal teams and the EHS Committee. Throughout the year, 

trainings are also organised with a focus on building on subject matter expertise relating to work 

requirements, which are primarily led by external training professionals. A myriad of topics is covered, 

including quality requirements, environmental risks and impacts, safety procedures and emergency 

responses, and technical knowledge such as the operating, repairing and maintenance of key 

equipment and machineries.  

To complement the trainings provided, AEI also has a quality policy in place which sets out the  

specifications and requirements to be met for our products. In 2019, we maintained our certification 

under the ISO9001:2015 Quality Management System standard which continues to guide us in our 

delivery of quality products and services.

Figure 5: Average training hours by employee category and gender 

 

 

As a result of our consistent efforts in providing training opportunities to our employees, we have 

achieved average training hours in FY 2019 that are fairly similar to that in the previous year. To 

ensure we continue to address our employees’ training needs and develop their competencies, we 

conduct a ‘Skill Test’ annually for all employees. A structured approach is adopted to evaluate and 

determine the following: 

• Adequacy of training received 

• Basis for promotion 

• Suitability of scope of work for employee 

• Appropriate salary range  

As a group, we strive to support all our employees in their career development and seek to 

understand their professional needs through the annual appraisal. We also seek to give all 

employees remuneration that is commensurate with their performance.  

Workplace Health &amp; Safety  

Workplace health and safety (WHS) is of utmost importance to us due to the nature of our business 

where machineries are in use daily. We believe in the promotion of Total WHS where our employees’ 

wellbeing is holistically taken care of. This goes beyond providing a safe work environment, and 

includes ensuring good health and productivity at work.  

At AEI, we inculcate a Total WHS culture through our EHS Action Plan, which is developed and 

executed by the EHS Committee. The plan provides a tiered approach to encourage healthy and safe 

work practices through building awareness and proactively implementing relevant measures (Figure 

6). The EHS Committee meets monthly to review our performance against the yearly targets, which 

include attaining:  

• 

Zero fatality rate; and

Accident frequency rate (‘AFR’) and accident severity rate (‘ASR’) being less than one-third of the 

industry’s average2 

Figure 6: Four tiers of AEI’s EHS Action Plan 

 

To ensure the highest standard of health and safety measures, AEI has developed and implemented a 

WHS management system that is internationally certified with OHSAS 18001:2007 (Occupational 

Health and Safety Standard) in 2018. AEI targets to obtain the ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health 

and Safety Standard) in 2020, which is an updated revision to the OHSAS 18001:2007.  

As part of our Total WHS measures, AEI has identified the high noise levels at our factories to be a 

potential health risk to our employees. As such, we provide employees with free audiometry 

assessments to detect any potential hearing losses early, so that they will be able to seek timely 

treatment when necessary.  

Through the implementation of good WHS practices throughout the year, we achieved our target of 

zero work-related fatalities, and surpassed our AFR and ASR targets with zero reportable incidents3 in 

FY2019. As at the end of FY2019, AEI also attained a total of 365 accident-free days in the year. Further 

to this, the company has no known instance of employees suffering from occupational disease during 

the period of their employment.

We also monitor our employees’ absentee rates to track the effectiveness of our Total WHS initiatives 

(Table 3).  In FY2019, the absentee rate for female employees has increased by close to 0.8 percentage 

points while that for male employees has decreased by 0.3 percentage points. We will continue to 

enforce relevant practices to improve our WHS performance.  

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic at the point of publication, we have complied with all national 

measures to safeguard our stakeholders’ health and safety and curb the spread of COVID-19. These 

include enforcing safe distancing measures and mandating the wearing of masks in our workplace.  

Sustainable Environment 

Waste Disposal Management 

Our extrusion-processing phase generates both non-hazardous and hazardous waste. We implement 

proper waste management approaches and also constantly seek to improve the efficiency of our 

waste disposal process to minimise negative impacts on the natural landscape and biodiversity. 

As part of our extrusion-processing operations, our production facility generates aluminium scrap as 

a by-product. These by-products are typically sold to our subsidiary, AEI Trading and Investments Pte 

Ltd, which then on-sells them to external third parties. Proper management of these aluminium scrap 

helps us generate greater value for our stakeholders. In FY2019, the total amount of aluminium scrap 

generated and sold amounted to 602MT.  

We also produce minimal hazardous waste such as soda and lubricant which are carefully stored in 

underground tank storages or built-in tanks within the machinery. Such waste is accumulated and 

disposed of when a certain threshold volume is met. We appoint a waste collector that has been 

licensed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) to collect and dispose of it responsibly.

Energy Use and Associated Carbon Emissions 

Given the nature of our business which involves operation of machineries and equipment, AEI is 

conscious of our energy usage. We seek to be efficient in energy usage to reduce our carbon footprint 

and achieve cost savings. As part of our EHS action plan, we continuously monitor and assess our 

energy consumption through monthly plant and equipment inspections to ensure that they are 

operating at optimal efficiency. In FY2019, AEI has successfully maintained our ISO14001:2015 

certification, which reflects our commitment in ensuring that our facility is not only compliant with 

the required regulations, but also meets the 

international environmental standards.  

 

In FY2019, the total electricity consumption and emissions4 (scope 2) increased by 12% as compared 

to the year before. The electricity and emissions intensities also increased by 14% from FY2018. This 

was primarily due to an extension in our production hours in FY2019 as we produced more products 

that had to meet stringent and time-consuming requirements. We also carried out non-routine 

testing of new mold and die tooling prior to the mass production of new products.  

We will continue to manage our energy consumption prudently across the group to lower our 

operational carbon footprint.
