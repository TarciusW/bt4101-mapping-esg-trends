SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN  

AND MD/GROUP CEO

2021 was a year characterised by resilience. 

Despite the persistent uncertainties brought 

on by the COVID-19 pandemic, Governments 

and companies like ComfortDelGro have 

doubled down on their sustainability 

commitments. In 2021, we established the 

Sustainability Committee at the Board-level 

to better integrate Environmental, Social 

and Governance (ESG) considerations 

into the business strategies of the Group. 

Ms Jessica Cheam gamely agreed to 

chair this new Committee. Her passion 

and experience will help chart our ESG 

strategies and drive our efforts towards 

sustainable mobility.

ENABLING A CLIMATE-FRIENDLY 

AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT 

SYSTEM

The sobering Inter-governmental Panel on 

Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 

6 signalled a “Code Red” for humanity as 

man-made carbon emissions were singled 

out as the definitive cause of global warming 

since the Industrial Revolution. Conference 

of the Parties 26 (COP26), a significant 

climate conference delayed by COVID-19, 

was finally held in November 2021, with 

nearly 200 countries banding together 

to ink the Glasgow Climate Pact. While 

some observers noted that more could be  

achieved, the Pact had set a strong foundation 

to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions 

and embark on a decarbonisation pathway 

that would limit planet warming to 1.5°C in 

the next century. Over 2,000 companies, 

including ComfortDelGro, have risen to 

the challenge to take accelerated climate 

action by committing to the Science Based 

Targets initiative (SBTi).

Since committing to SBTi for the “Well 

Below 2°C” scenario in February 2021, the 

Group has developed stretched targets to 

achieve the more ambitious 1.5°C scenario. 

This entails putting in-place aggressive 

decarbonisation programmes to achieve 

a 55% reduction in our GHG emissions

MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN  

AND MD/GROUP CEO

by 2032. The Group has since submitted 

its plans to the SBTi expert committee 

for approval. ComfortDelGro is the first 

mobility operator in the region to have 

committed and submitted its SBTi plans. 

We commend the Sustainability Office 

and the Business Units for their aspirations 

and efforts.

To reduce our emissions, the Group and 

its Business Units have been working 

tirelessly to move away from the use of 

Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles 

and to electrify our fleet. The tender win 

by the ComfortDelGro Engineering-ENGIE 

consortium to install 479 out of 632 

charging stations for Electric Vehicles (EVs) 

in Singapore was a significant milestone. 

We look forward to offer our expertise in EV 

charging to build up the local infrastructure 

and encourage EV adoption. This will also 

provide every opportunity for us to speed 

up the electrification of our own fleet.

Another heartening news was the award of 

the S$30 million contract to our wholly-

owned subsidiary ComfortDelGro Bus 

(CDG Bus) to operate a fully electrified 

private fleet of shuttle buses at the National 

University of Singapore campus. CDG Bus 

later also won a S$20 million multi-year 

contract to serve four shuttle bus routes 

in the Nanyang Technological University 

(NTU) with 20 electric buses. These were 

significant wins as they would position 

CDG Bus as the largest private operator  

of electric buses in Singapore. Together 

with our planned roll out of up to 400 

electric taxis in 2022, it would strengthen 

our suite of sustainable mobility solutions 

for our customers.

Metroline, ComfortDelGro’s fully-owned 

subsidiary in the UK, has also been operating 

its fleet of 20 hydrogen double-deck buses 

in London since June 2021. This experience 

will increase the Group’s knowledge in 

operating alternative clean energy vehicles, 

and enable us to explore the implementation 

of such solutions in other geographies that 

we operate in. 

 

In Australia, CDC Victoria was a commendable 

finalist in Healthy Environment category of 

the 2021 Premier’s Sustainability Awards. We 

were the first public transport operator in 

Australia to implement the use of automatic 

geofencing technology to deliver enhanced 

environmental performance by cutting 

emissions and limiting engine noise. Operating 

on Melbourne’s track bus services, 48 of 

50 of the Volvo hybrid buses have shown 

to reduce nitrogen oxide and particulate 

emissions by up to 50% and reduce fuel 

and CO2 emissions by up to 40%.

C o m f o r t D e l G r o  r e c o g n i s e s  t h a t 

electrification needs to be coupled by  

the greening of the electricity grid to further 

reduce the impact on the environment. With 

that, ComfortDelGro Engineering and ENGIE 

entered into a second joint venture to develop 

and manage solar solutions. As a start, the 

joint venture will install and operate rooftop 

solar panels later in 2022 at ComfortDelGro 

Engineering’s Loyang, Pandan and Ubi premises. 

The renewable energy generated will feed the 

energy usage of the automotive workshops 

and fast charging station for cabbies and public 

EV users at these locations. They target to 

achieve 50MWp renewable energy capacity 

by 2030, or the equivalent of powering 12,500 

four-room housing flats.

Ahead of regulatory pressure to report 

on climate risks, ComfortDelGro has also 

embarked on its Task Force on Climate-

related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) journey. 

This year, we engaged business units from 

Singapore, Australia, China, UK and Ireland 

in climate risk workshops. These workshops 

sought to establish the physical and transition 

risks and opportunities of climate change for 

our operations. The full report is expected 

to be published in May 2022.

SAFEGUARDING THE WELLBEING, 

HEALTH AND SAFETY OF 

OUR PEOPLE, PATRONS AND 

COMMUNITIES

As a global mobility operator, the health and 

safety of our employees and commuters 

continues be a priority for the Group. 

Practicing the three-pronged protocol of 

Trace, Test and Vaccinate, ComfortDelGro 

has invested our best effort to curb the 

spread of COVID-19 within our communities. 

Due to the high transmissivity of the Delta 

variant, COVID-19 clusters emerged across 

several of the bus interchanges in Singapore 

earlier in July. Over 200 of our bus captains 

were tested positive. Our public transport 

operator, SBS Transit, took swift and decisive 

actions to strengthen safe management 

measures and reduce further transmissions. 

Similarly, when a COVID-19 cluster was 

discovered at the ComfortDelGro Driving 

Centre, it was immediately closed for two 

weeks for deep cleaning and disinfection. 

We are relieved to report that there have 

been no fatalities.

We continued to provide support to our 

staff and business partners during this 

difficult period. The Group distributed 

over 200,000 Antigen Rapid Test (ART) 

kits to our staff in Singapore. On top of 

the S$86.5 million rental relief disbursed, 

ComfortDelGro Taxi also distributed ART 

kits to cabbies to support their routine 

COVID-19 testing regime. About 100 of our 

cabbies in Singapore made a total of 15,000 

trips to convey persons serving Stay-Home 

Notice (SHN) for their COVID-19 test. The 

cabbies were unfazed by the additional 

risks and kept up diligently with thorough 

cleaning routines after each trip.

In the geographies that ComfortDelGro 

operates in, we worked closely with the 

respective authorities, business partners and 

employees to encourage vaccination that 

would offer protection against the virus. In 

Australia, we ran a campaign to promote 

03

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN  

AND MD/GROUP CEO

vaccination take-up rate by offering gift-

cards to fully vaccinated workers. At the 

time of this report, the vaccination rate 

stands at more than 90% at the Group-

level. 99% of China and Singapore staff 

have been vaccinated. 

In 2021, we continued to give back to 

various causes and our communities. Our 

contribution to seniors, children, the sick 

and persons with disabilities amounted 

to S$2.07million. ComfortDelGro Taxi’s 

cabby volunteer group, CabbyCare Charity 

Group (CabbyCare), kept up its practice of 

delivering meals to the needy and made 

a total of 2,310 pro-bono trips, or the 

equivalent of about S$173,250 in fares 

forgone. This is more than double the 

number of trips made last year. 

In Australia, we have committed a  

sponsorship of A$750,000 over three years  

to the Kinchela Boys Home Aboriginal 

Corporation (KBHAC) to not only build and 

maintain a mobile bus education centre 

for KBHAC, but to also deploy drivers to 

support its community events that promote 

cultural exchange and understanding for 

the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 

people. More of our community engagement  

efforts are reflected later in this report.

GROWING OUR BUSINESS WITH 

STRONG GOVERNANCE, ETHICAL 

INTEGRITY AND INNOVATION

Strong corporate governance forms the 

cornerstone of how we do business. This 

year, ComfortDelGro refreshed several of its 

policies and practices. We have published 

our Whistleblowing Policy to improve 

transparency of our grievance mechanism. 

Our Supplier Code of Conduct  has been 

revised to reflect our growing attention to 

sustainability along our supply chain. This 

sustainability report is also the first report 

which we sought limited internal assurance. 

We plan to seek external assurance in 2023. 

In the digital economy, cybersecurity  

threats have become more prevalent. We 

have guided our Business Units to obtain 

the Data Protection Trustmark, a Singapore 

national-level certification for organisations 

that have demonstrated strong data  

protection practices. ComfortDelGro 

Engineering and VICOM Inspection 

Services have attained their Data Protection 

Trustmark in 2021. Several other BUs are  

in the process of attaining their certification 

by the end of 2022.

To drive innovation, ComfortDelGro 

collaborated with the National University 

of Singapore to establish the Smart and 

Sustainable Mobility Living Lab. This is 

intended as a sandbox for research on  

mobility technologies that can be 

commercialised for the mass market. 

Through this initiative, we would initiate 

several projects that would generate  

insights on how to operate EVs more 

efficiently and maximise the lifespan of 

EV batteries.

THE WAY FORWARD 

ComfortDelGro is a signatory to the 

United Nations Global Compact, and we 

are pleased to reaffirm our support for 

the 10 universal principles in the area of 

Human Rights, Environment, Labour and 

Anti-Corruption. This report serves as our 

Communication on Progress for 2021, 

and describes the action we have taken to 

incorporate the principles in our business 

strategy and operations. 

We are thankful that our efforts in sustainability 

were recognised when ComfortDelGro 

was selected as one of four Singapore 

companies to be included in the 2021  

Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) – 

Asia Pacific. This is the third year that the 

Group has been included in this prestigious 

index. We also maintained our rating in the 

top fifth percentile of the Sustainalytics 

ESG assessment and improved our rating 

in the MSCI ESG rating to an “AA” grade. 

This would not be possible without the 

grit of our people, the support from our 

partners and customers, as well as the trust 

bestowed by our patrons and stakeholders.

With pressing urgency for climate action, 

the sustainability journey ahead will be 

arduous. Still, the accomplishment this 

year demonstrates that we are capable of 

achieving more for the betterment of the 

planet and future generations.

 

We thank our Customers, Staff, Partners 

and Stakeholders for their support in our 

sustainability journey. We look forward to 

your continuing support.

2021 marks the year we accelerate our fleet electrification. 

Against the backdrop of maturing battery technologies 

and supporting infrastructure for Electric Vehicles (EVs), 

ComfortDelGro has significantly grown its fleet of electric 

taxis, buses and rental vehicles. With every EV we add to our 

fleet, it produces 50% less Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions 

compared to its Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) counterpart 

in its lifetime*. This enables ComfortDelGro to reduce its 

impact on the environment and contribute to climate action.

Since 2016, ComfortDelGro has been building up its 

experience in operating and maintaining these vehicles 

across its diverse geographies. Through economies of scale 

2021 IN REVIEW



from its operations, complemented by smart optimisation 

engines, it is able to operate a large fleet of EVs efficiently 

and minimise environmental impact associated with their 

lifecycle management.     

ComfortDelGro is committed to the Science Based Targets 

initiative (SBTi) and aims to achieve decarbonisation targets 

in line with the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming 

to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. We have set our sight 

to at least halve our GHG emissions over the next decade, 

and is pending the targets approval from the SBTi expert 

committee. ComfortDelGro is the first Singaporean mobility 

operator to commit to SBTi and the 1.5°C business ambition.



MAKING HEADWAY IN OUR 

ELECTRIFICATION JOURNEY 

* Statistics were obtained from the Land Transport Authority.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


In 2021, ComfortDelGro kept up with the implementation of measures and programmes to help our people and communities 

combat the effects of global lockdowns. As the world transits to a “new normal” of living with COVID-19, ComfortDelGro 

is committed to ensuring the continued safety of our people, patrons and communities. 

In Shenyang, the ComfortDelGro Lei Feng Team &lt;雷锋车队&gt; 

was appointed by the Shenyang Municipal Government and 

Transportation Bureau to take charge of passenger transfer 

at Shenyang Taoxian International Airport and Shenyang 

North Railway Station during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Led by taxi driver Zhao Yu Hai, the team consisted of 14 other 

taxi drivers and collectively, they provided about 20 trips per 

day, transferring a total of 8,000 passengers in the three-

month period. Despite the risk of contracting COVID-19,  

they persevered with their frontline efforts to transport 

travellers and contributed to a safer environment for the 

Shenyang people. During the Chinese New Year in 2021, 

the Lei Feng Team worked non-stop, sacrificing the time 

to reunite with their families, and contributing to pandemic 

prevention work for their community.

 *  Workplace Injury Rate (WIR) for Singapore falls below the 971 per 100,000 employed persons for the Transportation and Storage industry. The statistics 

is published by Ministry of Manpower in the Workplace Safety and Health Report 2020. According to the Labour Force Survey, the WIR in UK/Ireland falls 

below 1,770 per 100,000 employed persons for the industry. Australia has a “no-fault” system of workers’ compensation for work-related injuries and 

benefit systems which indirectly led to relatively high workplace injury reports and long medical leaves.

** We note the increase in workplace injury in our Australian operations. This is due to the broadening of scope to include injury count from our National 

Patient Transport, Buslink NT and Queensland operations. We have also developed and implemented a more robust workplace injury database in 2021 

that provides improved visibility and definitional consistency and comparability across the workplaces.

^ This is the first year we are reporting on China’s data and hence past year data is not available.

In our overseas operations, regional road infrastructure is not always 

designed to operate low-floor wheelchair accessible buses. The regional 

bus operations are therefore constrained from operating low-floor 

wheelchair accessible vehicles.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

BOARD STATEMENT 

As a global land mobility company, ComfortDelGro is committed to creating long-term shared 

value for all our stakeholders through sustainable growth. The Board, and the appointed 

Sustainability Committee, consider sustainability a key tenet of ComfortDelGro’s business 

strategy, and the Board exercises strong oversight of all material sustainability issues. 

As a reflection of the importance we place on sustainability, the Group has fully integrated 

Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into its overall blueprint. The ComfortDelGro 

sustainability framework is aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals 

(UN SDGs) and reflects the material topics that impact our business and society. 

The three key pillars in our framework are: (1) Enabling a climate-friendly and sustainable 

transport system, (2) Safeguarding the well-being, health and safety of our people, patrons 

and communities and (3) Growing our business with strong governance, ethical integrity and 

innovation.

 

We understand that as an international mobility operator, we play a key role in delivering 

clean, low carbon transport solutions, with the aim of reaching net zero emissions.  As part 

of our overall climate mitigation strategy, we have committed to the Science Based Targets 

initiative (SBTi) which aims to cut emissions to achieve a 1.5°C scenario and have made steady 

progress in electrifying our global fleet of vehicles.

We are also investing into emerging innovations shaping the future of mobility, entering new 

partnerships to develop climate-friendly mobility solutions and pivoting towards renewable 

energy sources. As a responsible steward, we are constantly optimising the efficiency of our 

operations and minimising our usage of energy, fuel, water and other precious resources. 

Our 24,000-strong workforce is the lifeblood of our company. Beyond ensuring a safe and 

healthy workplace for our employees and commuters, we are committed to protecting the 

mental and physical well-being of our people. We are dedicated to equal opportunities, 

diversity and inclusion, training and upskilling of all our employees. As a responsible corporate 

citizen, we strive to achieve the highest service quality, provide accessible mobility solutions 

and generate positive local impact in the communities we operate in. 

The Board also plays an active role in upholding strong corporate governance and ethical 

business practices across the entire company and its wide geographies. We are committed to 

addressing the needs of all our stakeholders through transparent and fair decision-making. 

The Board regularly reviews the terms of reference of all Board Committees as well as the 

Board competencies required to help the Group navigate the future. We are constantly 

building our Board capabilities through selected training programmes and workshops. We 

have established a clear and transparent whistleblowing process and our key governance 

priorities include cybersecurity and protection of personal data, as well as sustainable supply 

chain practices. This ensures that we work with ethical suppliers and partners that adhere 

to our sustainability principles, and enables us to use our sphere of influence to improve 

industry practices.

The Board regularly reviews its business strategy, sustainability framework and plans with 

the senior management, who is tasked with the management of ESG issues, its performance 

and disclosure. The Group has also integrated ESG factors into executive compensation, 

which will drive positive ESG outcomes that benefit both shareholders and stakeholders.

We firmly believe that our sustainability vision, integrated with our business strategy, will 

help us achieve the Group’s mission of creating long-term value for society.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

MATERIALITY APPROACH AND PROCESS

Our materiality approach focused on identifying priority ESG 

topics that would impact our business in the long term. This 

included anticipating emerging sustainability issues and market 

needs that would inform our business decisions. 

RESEARCH AND IDENTIFICATION OF  

MATERIAL TOPICS

We commenced our materiality assessment process through 

an analysis into a wide array of industry practices and standards 

to identify material topics within our industry. 

1. Understanding macro ESG developments and trends 

impacting our company and stakeholders 

2. Mapping to the UN SDGs across our geographical footprint

3. Referencing requirements from reporting standards and 

rating agencies

4. Undertaking peer analysis &amp; industry benchmarking

5. Referencing 

leading 

global 

thought-leadership 

and 

academic research

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THROUGH  

MATERIALITY INTERVIEWS

Subsequently, we proceeded to engage a range of key 

internal and external stakeholders to validate the identified 

ESG material topics. Our stakeholder engagement comprised 

of both surveys, virtual and in-person interviews. As our 

portfolio of operations span across numerous geographies and  

wide-ranging business functions, we sought to encompass all 

viewpoints through a holistic and grand-scale engagement.

DATA ANALYSIS AND VALIDATION

The materiality assessment interviews and surveys generated 

a wide array of quantitative and qualitative inputs, which were 

used to inform our sustainability strategy. Next, we organised a 

management validation workshop to finalise the material ESG 

topics critical for our business. An in-depth materiality exercise 

was also undertaken by two of our subsidiaries, namely SBS 

Transit and VICOM Group, and their results were also taken into 

consideration.

The materiality assessment resulted in 11 key material topics, 

divided across the three pillars of ESG. Under the 11 overarching 

material topics, 26 sub-topics were identified to aid in targeted 

efforts towards ensuring sustainability.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

GOVERNING OUR SUSTAINABILITY AND RISK 

We have an established governance framework to effectively 

and efficiently manage our ESG risks and opportunities. 

This ensures the long-term and sustainable growth of our 

organisation. 

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

ComfortDelGro established our Sustainability Committee in 

April 2021. Supporting the Board of Directors led by Chairman 

Mr Lim Jit Poh, the Sustainability Committee is chaired by  

Ms Jessica Cheam, and aims to champion and provide  

oversight on ComfortDelGro’s sustainability effort. ESG 

matters are deliberated by the Sustainability Committee every 

quarter. The Sustainability Steering Committee, chaired by 

our MD/Group CEO Mr Yang Ban Seng, and comprising key 

members of the Senior Management, reviews ComfortDelGro’s 

sustainability 

performance 

and 

reports 

performance 

against targets to the Board. In operationalising the Group’s 

sustainability ambitions, our Group Chief Sustainability Officer, 

Mr Jackson Chia, is assisted by the ESG Working Groups. Each 

working group convenes quarterly to review the progress 

and discuss how the Group and its Business Units can better 

implement sustainability initiatives.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK

As part of our wider governance framework, we aligned our 

governance policies and practices with the principles and 

guidelines set out in the Code of Corporate Governance issued 

by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on 6 August 2018. 

We also have in place a robust Enterprise Risk Management 

Framework which enables our Group and Business Units to 

understand the nature and complexity of the risks involved in 

the operations. This provides a systematic process to identify, 

review and prioritise resources to manage the risks.

We continue to adopt the precautionary principle in our risk-

based approach. We are a signatory of the UN Global Compact 

and are committed to the 10 principles on Human Rights, 

Labour, Environment and Anti-corruption. More information 

on our corporate governance and risk management can be

Backed by strong belief in clean energy and passion to pursue 

a sustainable future, members of the team were excited to 

spearhead ComfortDelGro’s electrification journey. As Freddie 

Chew, General Manager, shared, the transition to cleaner 

energy is a natural progression for the Fuel Sales business as 

they reviewed their corporate strategy.   

There were inevitable encounters of difficult and stressful 

situations, late nights and intense discussions in the beginning. 

They managed, however, to harness one another’s strengths and 

diverse backgrounds, aligned their goals and charge forward. 

“Our team is made up of members from diverse backgrounds 

who are open to the sharing of views and expertise. This makes 

up a great team to move forward with,” said Gene Goh, Head 

of Technology.        

It has been such a learning journey for the team. They have 

gained a more holistic view of the industry and an in-depth 

understanding of how EV chargers work. It is also crucial to 

be familiar with regulatory obligations, technical standards and 

safety precautions for the design, installation and operation of 

chargers. 

While the journey ahead will not be a straight road, the team is 

thankful for all the support they’ve received from the authorities, 

ComfortDelGro management and partners, and is focused on 

getting the EV chargers up and going. 

Behind ComfortDelGro’s electrification journey, we are proud 

to have dedicated people to pioneer and champion our cause.

CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION

Adapting and mitigating climate change and its influence on 

our business with climate-friendly and sustainable mobility 

products and services 

WHY THIS MATTERS TO US

The transportation sector is heavily reliant on fossil fuels and 

accounts for about one-fifth of global GHG emissions. Despite 

being one of the sectors most heavily affected by the COVID-19 

pandemic, the transition to a post-COVID world shows a 

likelihood of increased emissions due to growing demands and 

the limited uptake of alternative fuel and energy sources. 

With bus, taxi and rail operations in seven countries, we 

acknowledge our ability to influence and pivot towards a 

sustainable transportation sector. By actively transitioning 

our fleet to more efficient and cleaner transportation, we aim 

to significantly reduce our GHG emissions and contribute to 

mitigating the impacts of climate change. Our ultimate goal is 

to move people further, longer, and faster with less resources 

and cleaner options. 

HOW WE MANAGE THIS

Our key strategies to enable a climate-friendly and sustainable 

transport system are to electrify our fleet, improve efficiencies, 

and transit to clean, renewable energy. In February 2021, 

we committed to achieving the 1.5°C ambition through the 

Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This is a testament to 

our decarbonisation efforts to adapt and mitigate the impacts 

of climate change. Widely recognised as the leading science 

based target setting authority, the SBTi is a collaboration 

between the Carbon Disclosure Project, the United Nations 

Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World 

Wide Fund for Nature.  We worked to develop our emission 

reduction targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 and our targets are 

pending approval by the SBTi technical expert committee. 

More details on the emission reduction targets can be found 

later in the chapter. 

In addition, ComfortDelGro embarked on a journey in 2021 to 

understand the physical and transition risks and opportunities 

presented by climate change for our business. We are 

underway to align with the Task Force on Climate-Related 

Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We are expected to publish a full 

report later in 2022. Through a series of climate risk workshops, 

it illuminated two key findings: 1) the impacts ComfortDelGro 

face due to climate change and 2) the impacts ComfortDelGro 

has on the climate and natural environment. It reinforced our 

ambitions to drive climate-friendly mobility solutions that 

would reduce GHG emissions for our operations and that of 

our business partners.

CLIMATE FRIENDLY MOBILITY

Since 2015, we started to phase out our Internal Combustion 

Engine (ICE) vehicles in favour of hybrid or electric vehicles (EVs). 

As we adopt cleaner vehicle technologies, we work closely with 

vehicle manufacturers, fuel and electricity providers to provide 

valuable feedback on performance and areas of improvements. 

Our existing ICE fleet continue to meet the latest standards (Euro 

5 or higher). These standards ensure that vehicles produce lower 

levels of harmful exhaust emissions such as nitrogen oxide, carbon 

monoxide, hydrocarbons and particulate matter. This leads to 

improved fuel efficiencies as well as reduced pollutants and GHG 

emissions. We also employ route optimisation and on-demand 

services to further increase operational efficiencies and improve 

environmental performance. 

UNDERTAKING ACTIONS IN MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION OF OUR CLIMATE RISKS

In 2021, ComfortDelGro initiated a groupwide assessment of our most pertinent physical and transitional climate 

risks. We assessed the risk according to our regional locations including Singapore, China, Australia, UK and Ireland.  

Our key business units in each region identified the major impacts and the subsequent business or financial implications. 

Our preliminary findings indicate the following physical and transitional risks to be most pertinent and impactful to our 

operations. The impacts include, but are not limited to, increased repair and maintenance costs, reduced asset values, 

higher fuel and supply chain costs, higher staff spending, loss of working man-days as well as reputational costs. The 

final results will be published in our TCFD report in 2022.

SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

With the transition of our fleet, we aim to provide sustainable 

mobility solutions to all our customers. ComfortDelGro Engineering 

partnered with TÜV SÜD to train technicians in the automotive 

industry. In addition to traditional ICE vehicle repairs, there 

will be a focus on the safe handling of high voltage systems 

in hybrid and EVs. This partnership will set industry standards 

and enable more skilled technicians to be readily available as 

Singapore works towards a more sustainable future. The MoU 

signing ceremony was held in September 2021 at TÜV SÜD’s 

newly opened flagship office and witnessed by Deputy Prime 

Minister Heng Swee Keat.

In the UK, Metroline has partnered with Transport for London 

(TfL) to launch 20 environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel cell 

double deck buses. The Mayor for London, Sadiq Khan, launched 

the hydrogen double deck bus in June 2021. 

These new hydrogen fuel cell double deck buses are first being 

introduced on route 7 between East Acton and Oxford Circus. 

The hydrogen buses join a fleet of over 500 electric buses – one 

of the largest fleets in Western Europe. The aim is to make all 

buses in London zero emission by 2030.

ENABLING A CLIMATE-FRIENDLY AND 

SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT SYSTEM 



Hydrogen used in a fuel cell is free from harmful emissions, 

where water is the the only by-product. The buses will reduce the 

level of harmful nitrogen oxide released and thereby improving 

the air quality and health of Londoners. Passengers will benefit 

from smoother, quieter journeys due to fewer vibrations and will 

be able to take advantage of free-to-use USB charging points.

From 2023, the hydrogen will be even greener as it will be produced 

by electrolysis powered by a direct connection to an offshore 

windfarm. This means that it will reduce ComfortDelGro’s Scope 

3 emissions required to power the hydrogen buses. 

A new state of the art fuelling station completed by Danish 

engineering firm Nel Hydrogen will top up each hydrogen fuel 

cell bus just once per day in as little as five minutes.

In addition to around £6 million of funding from TfL, more than 

£5 million of funding has been provided by European bodies 

- by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, and the 

Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA), an executive 

agency of the European Commission – as well as £1 million from 

the Office of Zero Emission Vehicles. With sustained financial 

support from the Government, TfL could look to accelerate its 

plans for a zero-emission bus fleet from 2037 to 2030 in order 

to reduce carbon emissions and address the public health 

emergency caused by dirty air.

HYDROGEN IS AN EXTREMELY PROMISING RENEWABLE FUEL FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT 

VEHICLES AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO PROVING ITS APPLICATION ON 

LONDON’S ROADS. THE HYDROGEN BUSES ARE AN EXCITING NEW ADDITION TO OUR 

FLEET, AND HIGHLIGHT METROLINE’S CONTINUED DEDICATION TO MAKING LONDON’S 

STREETS GREENER. OUR ENGINEERING TEAMS HAVE BEEN HARD AT WORK PREPARING 

THE BUSES FOR SERVICE AND WE ARE PROUD TO BE OPERATING THE FIRST HYDROGEN 

POWERED DOUBLE-DECK BUSES IN LONDON IN THE HOPE THAT IT WILL FURTHER 

SHOWCASE THE APPLICATION OF SUSTAINABLE VEHICLES IN THE CAPITAL.

Driving one of these buses is Constantin Bichescu. Based at 

Perivale garage, Mr Bichescu has been with the company 

since 2016 and has an exceptional performance record, with 

Operations Managers at the garage calling him “an asset to 

Perivale garage.”

 

Speaking about his experience driving the zero emission bus, 

Mr Bichescu says, “It makes me feel good knowing that we 

are not polluting the environment. It is very smooth, there 

is no comparison with other buses - the hydrogen bus is 

the best.” He isn’t the only one that thinks so, with a range 

of enthusiastic responses from customers too. “Children 

seem to be fascinated with the hydrogen bus and many 

customers have given positive feedback - even other drivers 

from different companies and different routes,” he explains.

 

As a driver at the forefront of Metroline’s initiative to build 

a greener fleet, Mr Bichescu is in no doubt that hydrogen 

vehicles will be the way forward for more environmentally 

friendly buses in the future; “When you are in traffic and you 

can see the emission coming from other vehicles it makes 

you really appreciate the hydrogen bus. “This is better for 

our environment and our health”, he says..

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD 

OUR FLEET COMPOSITION AND TRANSITION PLAN

In Singapore, our public transport operator, SBS Transit, partnered 

with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to introduce an additional 

10 electric buses into their fleet, increasing the total number of 

electric buses from 20 to 30. SBS Transit continues to operate 

the 25 diesel hybrid buses, previously procured by LTA. The 

authority targets to operate 100% cleaner energy public bus 

fleet by 2040 and for all new public bus purchases from March 

2020 to be cleaner energy bus models. SBS Transit welcomes 

this cleaner fleet transition and is ready to partner with LTA to 

support and operate these buses in future. 

As Singapore’s largest taxi operator, ComfortDelGro Taxi is 

expected to put up to 400 electric taxis on the road in 2022. 

With this move, we are confident that we will achieve our target 

to put 1,000 electric taxis on the roads by 2023. We are also 

cognisant of our duty to our drivers. We engage with them to 

ensure that these new vehicle models are not only comfortable 

and safe to drive but also easy to operate and maintain.

In order to ensure success in our fleet electrification, it is 

important to invest in infrastructure support. The ComfortDelGro 

Engineering-ENGIE consortium won 479 out of 632 charging 

station for EVs which marks the first step to bolster the local 

electric charging infrastructure. This is the first tender by the Urban 

Redevelopment Authority (URA) for EV chargers and supports 

the Singapore Green Plan 2030 to have 60,000 charging points 

nationwide. The chargers to be installed comprise of 192 x 22kW 

AC chargers, 279 x 7kW AC chargers and 8 x 50kW DC chargers, 

in the Central, East and West regions of Singapore. Installation 

has begun in the end of 2021, and is targeted to be completed 

by third quarter in 2022.  ComfortDelGro Engineering currently 

operates four 24-hour Direct Current (DC) fast charging stations 

at its workshops located at Braddell and Loyang. 

ComfortDelGro Bus is also slated to operate a fully electrified 

private fleet of shuttle buses at the National University of 

Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) 

campuses in 2022. In NUS, the buses will continue to serve the 

eight existing shuttle bus routes covering the NUS Kent Ridge 

campus, University Town and NUS Bukit Timah campus daily 

from 7am to 11pm, including public holidays. In NTU, about 

20 electric buses will serve four shuttle bus routes on campus. 

These buses will be wheelchair accessible and equipped with a 

telematics system, an anti-fatigue system as well as forward and 

side collision warning systems. These two multi-year contracts 

are valued at S$50 million and marks the beginning of how 

ComfortDelGro and its private mobility offerings can support 

our clients’ sustainable mobility ambitions.

ELECTRIC BUS TRIALS IN SINGAPORE 



In July 2021, ComfortDelGro Bus trialled an electric bus 

as part of the NUS shuttle service. This is in support of 

the ComfortDelGro-NUS Smart and Sustainable Mobility 

Living Lab, a research collaboration between NUS and 

ComfortDelGro. The electric bus provides mobility-related 

data that supports various research projects under the  

Living Lab. 

ComfortDelGro Bus also supported their clients’ sustainable 

mobility aspirations by conducting on-site electric bus 

trials. One of the recent partnership was with Sentosa 

Development Corporation as they plan to electrify all of its 

on-island public transport by 2025.

In the UK and Ireland, our biggest bus operator, Metroline, 

continues to uphold their commitment to establishing a 

climate-friendly fleet. As described in the earlier section, 

the launch of the hydrogen buses by Metroline signals our 

commitment to more sustainable products and services. 

Metroline is currently operating 835 greener hybrid, electric 

and hydrogen buses. 100% of its ICE vehicles are compliant 

with Euro 6 Standard. 

In Australia, CDC Victoria was a commendable finalist in Healthy 

Environment category of the 2021 Premier’s Sustainability 

Awards. We were the first public transport operator in Australia 

to implement the use of automatic geofencing technology 

to deliver enhanced environmental performance by cutting 

emissions and limiting engine noise. Operating on Melbourne’s 

track bus services, 48 of 50 of the Volvo hybrid buses have 

shown to reduce nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions by

In 2021, we undertook a revision of our transition plans and have set more ambitious targets. For our global operations, we are 

aiming to increase adoption of cleaner, less pollutive vehicles. We consider (1) our vehicles’ lifespans, (2) regulatory requirements 

on transport vehicles and (3) forecasted commercial trends in the industry. It is expected that the pace of conversion will accelerate 

over time due to the maturation of supporting infrastructure and regulations that discourage or ban new ICE vehicles.

We will monitor and review our fleet transition plan periodically to ensure that we account for technological advancements and 

developments in commercially-viable clean vehicles. 

By optimising our fleet to higher standard of environmentally friendly operations, we can influence our peers and clients transit 

to climate-friendly and sustainable mobility solutions. In the near future, we plan to set a net-zero target and will work towards 

reducing as much emissions as possible and only offsetting those that are hard-to-abate. For these unavoidable emissions, 

ComfortDelGro will consider high quality and reliable carbon credits projects as part of our decarbonisation strategy.

EMISSIONS AND AIR QUALITY 

Decarbonising 

our 

operations 

and 

reducing 

harmful 

vehicular emissions in line with global standards for better 

environment outcomes and well-being

WHY THIS MATTERS TO US 

As discussed in the earlier section, ComfortDelGro has 

committed to the SBTi and taken steps to reduce planet-

warming GHGs as part of our climate change mitigation efforts. 

Besides rapid decarbonisation to reduce our GHG emissions, 

it is pertinent to reduce other harmful air emissions such as 

Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Sulphur Oxides (SOx) and Particulate 

Matters (PM). These pollutants are well known to have adverse 

effects on the ozone layer, as well as on human health.

Today, more than half of the global population resides in cities 

and up to 70% are projected to live in urban areas by 2030.  In 

such high-density urban settings, efforts to improve air quality 

can contribute to better health outcomes for commuters 

and road users. As a transport operator, it is hence crucial to 

examine the vehicular emissions of our fleet closely and transit 

to greener and cleaner options.  

HOW WE MANAGE THIS 

DECARBONISATION PLAN

For GHG emission reduction in line with the 1.5°C scenario, we 

have formed a sound fleet transition plan that would minimally 

halve our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in a ten-year timeframe (ie. 

by 2032). This is a step up from our previous commitment to 

the “Well Below 2°C” scenario in a 15-year timeframe.

 

While ComfortDelGro is not required to set a Scope 3 

decarbonisation target under the SBTi standards, we have 

undertaken a Scope 3 SBTi-aligned reduction target of over 60% 

to demonstrate our commitment and ambition. Companies are 

required to set Scope 3 targets if their Scope 3 emissions are 

more than 40% of their total emissions. Our SBTi targets are 

currently under review with the SBTi and will be announced 

upon completion of the validation process. 

 

Our commitment to SBTi requires annual review of our 

performance in emission reduction to ensure that we are 

decarbonising in line with our science based targets. We use 

our real-time data collection system to monitor and measure 

the fuel and energy use of our operations. Emissions are then 

calculated based on the GHG Protocol. Our business units and 

colleagues are engaged on ComfortDelGro’s decarbonisation 

and transition plans through working group sharing, quarterly 

training webinars and bimonthly newsletters. 

ACCOUNTING FOR SCOPE 1, 2 AND 3 GHG EMISSIONS

ComfortDelGro began monitoring our emissions in 2015 

and were previously reporting on locations in which we 

had significant operational control. In 2021, we undertook 

a recalculation of our GHG inventory according to GHG 

Protocol to include all of ComfortDelGro’s operations under 

the operational control approach. As such, we have broadened 

our scope and included the GHG emissions from our China 

operations in this year’s reporting.  

We established 2019 as the baseline year as this was the year 

before the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant that the GHG 

emissions would be a closer representation of our emissions as 

global economy recovers and our business activities pick up. 

This baseline year also falls in line with the SBTi requirements. 

All GHG emissions are calculated in carbon equivalent (CO2e), 

accounting for all appropriate greenhouse gases, including 

methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20). 

ComfortDelGro has calculated our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions 

according to the GHG Protocol. Our Scope 1 emissions are 

primarily from the fuel use in our fleet. Our Scope 2 emissions 

result from our electricity consumption across our operations 

and Scope 3 emissions are calculated for all relevant categories 

to ComfortDelGro. 

Out of the 15 Scope 3 categories in the GHG Protocol, 

ComfortDelGro undertook a screening process to determine 

the relevant Scope 3 categories. Our significance boundary 

was established at 5%. After the screening process, we adopted 

spend-based, distance-based and average data approaches 

for relevant categories and used readily available information 

to calculate our Scope 3 emissions. The Scope 3 emission 

categories include: 

• 

Purchased Goods &amp; Services (Category 1) 

• 

Capital Goods (Category 2) 

• 

Fuel and Energy Use Not Captured in Scope 1 and Scope 2

ENERGY AND FUELS 

Increasing efficiency of energy and fuel use in our operations 

WHY THIS MATTERS TO US 

With rise in global energy prices, it has become more 

economically and environmentally sound to reduce fuel and 

electricity consumptions across our operations. While our 

fuel use will reduce as a result of our fleet electrification, 

ComfortDelGro will continue to improve its energy efficiencies 

in the intermediate transition phase.

Coupled with the growing expectation to shift away from 

fossil fuel-based energy sources, ComfortDelGro has forayed 

into green ventures such as solar power and other renewable 

energy sources. 

HOW WE MANAGE THIS 

Our energy and fuel use are considered in two dimensions. 

Firstly, energy used by our vehicle fleet and secondly, fuels 

used by our brick-and-mortar operations (e.g. stations, depots, 

workshops, offices).

ComfortDelGro has implemented energy-efficient design 

principles and energy-saving technologies in our brick-and-

mortar operations where applicable, to reduce our energy 

consumption. These include:

• 

Eco-Office certification for our offices

• 

Energy saving escalators that reduce speed when not in 

use

• 

Energy efficient lighting (LEDs) 

• 

Outdoor air supply regulation and carbon dioxide sensors

• 

Natural lighting at entrances

• 

Retrofitting and replacement of air-conditioning systems 

with energy-efficient alternatives

For fuel and driving efficiency, we have implemented the 

following solutions: 

• 

Regenerative braking systems that store kinetic energy and 

reduce wear and tear on mechanical brakes.

• 

Driving behavioural training including, proper acceleration 

and braking techniques, switching off engines when 

stationary, filling up to a three-quarter tank and decluttering 

vehicles to maintain lighter loads. This training is deployed 

across our operational regions, and is conducted on an 

annual basis for all drivers.

Through our cloud-based data management portal, we are 

able to monitor performance on a real-time basis and identify 

operations with high energy consumption. We then engage 

with Business Units on possible mitigation measures to reduce 

consumption or increase energy efficiency. 

Our vehicle transition plans include a significant shift into 

hybrid and electric vehicles, and this requires us to pre-empt 

and manage the projected increase in electricity usage. 

ComfortDelGro is exploring to supply EV charging stations in 

Singapore with renewable energy sources. We are also pleased 

to share that ComfortDelGro Engineering has entered into a 

Joint Venture with ENGIE South East Asia this year that seeks 

to develop and manage solar solutions. The partnership will 

kick off with the installation and operation of rooftop solar 

panels at the three ComfortDelGro Engineering site locations. 

The renewable energy generated will be used to power the 

automotive workshops, and serve as the pilot site for feeding 

solar power into fast charging stations.

One of the long term goal of this JV is to meet the preliminary 

target of 50 MWp renewable energy capacity by 2030, which 

is equivalent to powering up 12,500 four-room housing flats.

POWERING EV CHARGING STATIONS WITH 

RENEWABLE SOLAR ENERGY

By the end of 2022, fully electric ComfortDelGro taxis and 

private electric vehicles could very well be fast charging at 

EV charging stations located on premises powered by solar 

power harnessed from rooftop solar panels.

 

Our second joint venture with  ENGIE South East Asia  - 

ComfortDelGro ENGIE Solar Pte Ltd - which targets to 

operate by second half of 2022 once it obtains customary 

regulatory approvals, intends to install and operate 

rooftop solar panels atop three of our buildings at Loyang, 

Pandan and Ubi for a start. Apart from these buildings, our 

automotive workshops will also run on renewable energy 

deployed from these rooftop solar panels. Our Solar JV 



also plans to offer solutions to our customers and business 

partners that are looking to deploy renewable energy to 

their own buildings.

Ang Soo Hock, Chief Executive of ComfortDelGro 

Engineering, said: “Beyond the electrification of our vehicle 

fleet is the need to build charging farms powered by 

renewable energy on our premises that offer fast charging 

solutions to our cabbies as well as the public EV users.”

ComfortDelGro Engie will also leverage the solar JV to 

offer EV charging solutions using renewable energy, as part 

of its pledge to play a major role in deploying 60,000 EV 

charging points across the Republic under the Singapore 

Green Plan 2030.

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD 

In Singapore, we continuously renovate our facilities and 

buildings to improve their energy efficiency based on the 

Building Construction Authority’s (BCA) Green Mark guidelines. 

Our Singapore Head Office was retrofitted in 2019 with a more 

energy efficient air-conditioning system, which saved up to 

20% of electricity annually. We have also fitted LED lightings for 

90% of our head office. In 2021, 21 offices have received the 

Eco-office certification by the Singapore Environment Council. 

As part of the requirements, we have established an Energy 

Management Policy Plan and a Green Building User Guide to 

provide guidance to our Business Units on energy management 

for buildings and facilities. We target for 100% of our offices to 

be certified by Green Mark/ Eco-Office certification by 2030.

The figures below include all ComfortDelGro Group operations, 

including both our Singapore listed operations, SBS Transit 

and VICOM. For details on the specific performance of these 

two entities, please refer to their Sustainability Reports. 

Going ahead, we plan to review our targets to reflect our 

ambition in reducing overall energy consumption and 

increasing renewable energy generation capacity and use.

RESOURCE STEWARDSHIP

Optimising our use of natural resources including water  

and to minimise waste and other harmful environmental 

impacts

Waste

WHY THIS MATTERS TO US 

With exponential growth of human population and depleting 

natural resources, it is increasingly challenging for our planet to 

support the overconsumption and waste generated. As a global 

corporate citizen, it is hence important for ComfortDelGro to 

be responsible steward for the resources used in our operations 

and to minimise negative impact to the environment. 

Global waste has seen a significant increase during the COVID-19 

pandemic, with recycling rates falling across Asia, Europe and 

the United States. Without effective end-of-life management 

of our waste, adverse impacts will continue to rise, not only for 

the ecosystems that surround us, but ultimately for the people 

and communities that make up our global population. Across 

our operations, ComfortDelGro seeks to be part of the solution 

and keep up with our waste management regime.

For a transport operator like ComfortDelGro, as we transit 

our fleet to EVs, it is necessary to look at the potential waste 

problem of EV batteries. Together with like-minded partners, 

it is important to collaborate and consider how end-of-life EV 

batteries can be recycled and refurnished for a second life.

HOW WE MANAGE THIS 

Most of the waste generated in our operations is a result of 

day-to-day activities, as well as commuter waste. This waste 

is handled by authorised contractors and is incinerated or 

disposed in landfills. Large-scale operational waste, such as 

batteries, engine oil, tyres and metals are recycled or reused. 

ComfortDelGro complies with all waste-related regulations in 

each location of operation.

Another key waste stream generated by our operations is the 

decommissioning of vehicles. In order to responsibly manage 

the end-of-life treatment of our vehicles, ComfortDelGro 

sends decommissioned vehicles to scrap yards, where valuable 

materials are recovered for reuse and recycling. Hazardous 

waste generated by the repair and maintenance of our vehicles 

are aptly dealt with by specialist contractors. 

In all of our operational regions, Governments have established 

clear priorities in the management of waste. In Singapore, under 

its Waste Masterplan, it aims to increase our overall recycling 

rate to 70% and reduce waste-to-landfill per capita per day by 

30% by 2030. In the UK, it aims to recycle 65% of municipal 

waste and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill to 10% by 

2035. Under Australia’s National Waste Policy Action Plan, the 

government aims to significantly increase the use of recycled 

content by governments and industry and reduce total waste 

generated in Australia by 10% per person by 2030. Lastly in 

China, it aims to build up its waste infrastructure and reuse 60% 

of its trash by 2025. 

ComfortDelGro supports these national waste strategies 

and participates in various waste initiatives. For example, we 

participated in the Say Yes to Waste Less campaign led by 

Singapore’s National Environment Agency (NEA) in October 

2021. This marks our third year participating in the initiative 

that aims to educate the public on cutting down single-use 

disposables and to use reusables for their food and beverage 

takeaways and purchases. As most of our staff were working 

from home during the campaign period, we crafted a special 

edition newsletter to engage our staff on reducing single-use 

disposables and how they could participate in the campaign 

activities. 

We also deploy recycling bins for paper, plastic and cans in our 

premises. To reduce paper waste in our bus depots, technicians 

have been issued tablets which have a Bus Mobile Maintenance 

System (BMMS) installed. Beyond using the tablet to complete 

checklists when completing maintenance works, the tablet 

and BMMS system enable the technicians’ access to work 

instructions, drawings and electrical schematics. It also allows 

for access to manufacturer portals, enabling access to detailed 

maintenance information. 

ComfortDelGro monitors and measures our waste disposal. 

We report our waste data to the NEA in line with Section 

30A of Singapore’s Environmental Public Health Act. Areas of 

high consumption are identified and reduction initiatives are 

implemented accordingly. 

Additionally, all employees are educated on reduction measures 

and responsible stewardship of waste. In 2021, we conducted 

two webinars on sustainability which saw close to 200 staff 

attending the live sessions. Regular e-newsletter on waste 

and other sustainability topics were also sent to employees to 

educate and engage them. This is part of our efforts to promote 

“Green Culture” in our company.

Water

WHY THIS MATTERS TO US 

Water in undeniably a scarce resource. As climate change 

impacts are being felt across the globe, water-scarce regions 

in particular are experiencing sudden negative changes such as 

droughts. At the current consumption rate, it is anticipated that 

two-thirds of the global population may face water shortages 

by 2025. 

Water scarcity is a key concern in some of the countries in which 

we operate, leading ComfortDelGro to assume responsibility 

over the effective and efficient management of water for our 

organisation. 

HOW WE MANAGE THIS

The bulk of our water use is for the washing of vehicles. 

In Singapore, we have implemented the use of reclaimed 

NEWater for non-potable uses such as washing of vehicles. 

Other uses of water include general office operational use, 

such as pantries and lavatories. Business Units that achieved 

the Eco-Office Plus awards have also educated their staff on 

water conservation measures. Since 2019, all of the water 

fittings in our Head Office were replaced to adhere to Public 

Utilities Board’s Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (WELS). In 

2020, our Braddell premises was awarded the Water Efficient 

Building (WEB) Basic Certification. 

At VICOM, SETSCO’s Construction Technology Division began 

a water recycling initiative in 2019 where recycled water is used 

to cure concrete cubes before they are tested for compressive 

strength. This initiative helps save up to 2,160 cubic metres of 

water a year, which is nearly the volume of an Olympic-sized 

swimming pool.

A key climate risk identified in our Australia operations was water 

scarcity. Australia, as a water scarce nation, already considers 

sustainable water use as a standard mode of operation. Our 

Australian business units currently make use of water recycling 

initiatives and have invested in infrastructure to capture water 

and wastewater. Additionally, there are communications to the 

public on responsible water use and water savings.

MAKING EVERY DROP COUNT IN AUSTRALIA 

CDC Victoria commenced harvesting, storing, and recycling 

some of its water consumption when the Oakleigh depot 

was built in 2012.  The use of recycled water reduced 

the water consumption from South East Water (water 

corporation in south-eastern suburbs) by 62% per annum.

The water is harvested from the workshop roof into 3 

large tanks (current capacity 90,000 litres) for storage. 

Consumption is split into several areas, but largely the water 

is used for washing the buses.

Bus washing is firstly done by recycled water, which is 

captured in a triple interceptor pit (tank overflow goes into 

water authority system), then pumped through a recycling 

tank to capture sediment, and cleanse the water. Buses are 

finally rinsed with fresh tank water.

This harvesting and recycling of water reduce our 

requirements from our dams by 2,120 kilolitres per annum.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

Ensuring a safe and healthy workplace for our employees  

and the public

WHY THIS MATTERS TO US

Ensuring the health and safety of our people and our patrons is 

paramount to our business. With a fleet of about 35,000 vehicles 

serving seven countries, a strong safety record is essential to 

building trust in our services. This safety-first thinking extends 

beyond the direct services we provide to our customers and 

aims to protect other road users as well. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has cast a spotlight on health and safety, 

and ComfortDelGro is prepared to play our role in ensuring our 

workforce and communities remain safe and healthy. 

HOW WE MANAGE THIS 

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

ComfortDelGro has established Occupational Health and Safety 

(OHS) systems in place, that are in alignment with regulatory 

requirements and internationally recognised safety standards 

including ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 9001, ISO 4801 and AS/

NZ4801. These standards aid in specifying the processes and 

procedures for identifying, assessing and managing health and 

safety risks in the workplace. 

All employees, vendors, contractors and operators that operate 

within our premises are covered by our OHS management systems. 

Hazard identification and detailed risk assessments are 

conducted regularly to identify any major health and safety 

risks faced by our employees, workers and customers. As a 

transport provider, these pre-emptive measures are essential. 

In our Singapore operations, annual risks assessments and 

independent physical inspections are conducted. Our Australia 

operations conduct similar risk identification and assessments 

in alignment with the ISO 14001, 45001, 9001 and 4901 

standards. In addition to the risk identification and assessments, 

our UK operations have a Safe System of Work (SSOW) policy in 

place, which aids in incident and risk documentation. 

To establish a culture of safety, we have continuous training and 

safety awareness programmes that run throughout the year. For 

instance, our SBS Transit Bus and Rail Engineering and VICOM 

operations, are subject to specific training to perform their 

various functions in accordance with regulations. This training 

is provided by accredited training agencies. Our SETSCO staff 

are also required to attend safety orientations, trainings and 

site familiarisation courses for specialised clients in the marine, 

shipyard, construction and oil/petrochemical sectors, when 

relevant and appropriate.

Our Contractor Induction Packages, Supplier Agreements and 

Tender Documents specify details to ensure our third-party 

suppliers and contractors are made aware of our prevailing 

safety measures. They are provided with these documents 

prior to any commencement of work. Our global operations 

undergo a due diligence process to ensure that all third-

party business partners are equipped with the necessary 

licenses and documentation that are align with our safety 

standards and expectations. ComfortDelGro Taxi vendors are 

required, as a pre-requisite, to have a Method Statement and 

Risk Assessment, which is reviewed by our Safety Officers for 

approval prior to any commencement of work. In addition, our 

operations in Australia, require vendors to complete induction 

programmes to ensure full compliance with ComfortDelGro’s 

OHS standards and expectations. 

ComfortDelGro has an established joint management-worker 

Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Committees to represent our 

employees and workers across all our countries of operation, with 

the aim of evaluating and improving our OHS programmes (see 

Appendix 5). The WSH Committees meet regularly to conduct 

evaluations and assessment of OHS management systems, and 

to develop appropriate solutions. The WSH Committees are also 

present on a micro-level to monitor day-to-day OHS matters. 

ComfortDelGro strongly emphasises health and safety in our 

workplace, and consistently communicate our measures and 

expectations through training, education and instilling a safety 

culture. We strongly encourage all employees and workers 

to report any work-related hazards, without fear of reprisals. 

ComfortDelGro has established an open and encouraging 

environment to flag and report on OHS hazards. Employees 

are able to report incidents or hazards to 524A supervisors, 

their WSH Committee representatives or anonymously. Our 

Australia operations, for example, are equipped with a company 

mobile application as well as a workplace kiosk, in which they 

can report incidents. Our Whistleblowing Policy (see Annex C) 

also act as a safeguard against adverse actions on employees 

who raise these concerns. 

All employees are reminded of their right to remove themselves 

from unsafe work circumstances or dangerous situations. 

National legislation in Australia also stipulates a worker’s right 

to cease unsafe work if the worker has reasonable concern 

that continuing work would lead to significant exposure to 

health and safety risks. To further demonstrate commitment 

to OHS, trained Health and Safety Representatives are given 

full authority to issue stop-work notices in situations that they

OF OUR PEOPLE, PATRONS AND COMMUNITIES

COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED


deem unsafe, enabling corrective actions to be taken before 

work is able to resume. 

All incidents and investigations of breaches in workplace safety 

are reported to the management. Any reported work-related 

breaches of safety are investigated and subsequent corrective 

actions taken to eliminate or minimise the hazard, avoiding 

recurrence. During the investigation process, OHS incidents are 

analysed to assess whether there are systemic issues that can be 

addressed through additional training or whether a change of 

procedures or equipment is required to reduce the risk of injury. 

In Singapore, relevant facilities and support services are in 

place, such as our annual and routine health screening and 

availability of first aid kits and Automated External Defibrillator 

(AEDs). To engage with our staff, especially those who are 

working from home, wellbeing talks and seminars on topics 

such as exercise, health issues, diet and mental health were 

hosted on a bimonthly basis. 

MANAGING COVID-19 AT OUR WORKPLACE

Practicing the three-pronged protocol of Trace, Test and 

Vaccinate, ComfortDelGro has put in our best effort to curb 

the spread of COVID-19 within our communities. 

Due to the high transmissivity of the Delta variant, COVID-19 

clusters emerged across several of bus interchanges in 

Singapore during the year. Over 200 of our bus captains tested 

positive and our public transport operator, SBS Transit, acted 

swiftly to enhance safe management measures and reduce 

further transmissions. Similarly, when a COVID-19 cluster was 

discovered at ComfortDelGro Driving Centre, it was closed for 

two weeks for deep cleaning and disinfection. 

In Singapore, all staff were informed to provide weekly ART 

results when they were required to work from office starting 

from September 2021. We distributed over 200,000 ART kits, 

including 65,000 additional purchases by ComfortDelGro, to 

support staff in Singapore. In UK, we procured 58,000 ART 

test kits for staff. On top of the S$86.5 million rental relief 

distributed to cabbies, ComfortDelGro Taxi also distributed 

ART kits to cabbies earnestly as they are subjected to routine 

COVID-19 testing. 

In the geographies that ComfortDelGro operate in, we worked 

closely with the respective government authorities, business 

partners and employees to encourage vaccination that would 

offer our workers the best protection against COVID-19. The 

vaccination rate stands at 99% for Singapore and China, with 

booster shots in progress for our frontline staff. In Australia, 

we ran a campaign to promote vaccination take-up rate by 

offering gift-cards to full vaccinated workers.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


*  Workplace Injury Rate (WIR) for Singapore falls below the 971 per 100,000 employed persons for the Transportation and Storage industry. The statistics is published 

by Ministry of Manpower in the Workplace Safety and Health Report 2020. According to the Labour Force Survey, the WIR in UK/Ireland  falls below 1,770 per 

100,000 employed persons for the industry. Australia has a “no-fault” system of workers’ compensation for work-related injuries and benefit systems which 

indirectly led to relatively high workplace injury reports and long medical leaves.

** We note the increase in workplace injury in our Australian operations. This is due to the broadening of scope to include injury count from our National Patient 

Transport, Buslink NT and Queensland operations. We have also developed and implemented a more robust workplace injury database in 2021 that provides 

improved visibility and definitional consistency and comparability across the workplaces.

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD

ComfortDelGro continues to target for zero fatalities &amp; injury rates below national averages in our locations of operation.



JUST THE SHOT, A  VACCINATION INCENTIVE 

PROGRAMME

While it is not mandatory for employees to have the 

vaccination, our business in Australia recommended 

all staff do so in order to have the “strongest protection 

available”. Buslink, the Northern Territory’s largest school 

and urban bus transport provider, did its part to ensure the 

safety of staff, their families and loved ones and the wider 

community, by launching a COVID-19 vaccine incentive 

programme for employees.

“Unlike the mainstream flu vaccinations, Buslink NT is 

unable to arrange onsite administering of COVID-19 

vaccinations. Hence, they ensured that locations and hours 

of operation for employee’s closest vaccination hubs were 

made available. 

Buslink NT was keen to ensure that as many employees 

as possible receive the vaccination, and to have a good 

understanding of our company-wide vaccination profile. 

This will help us to assess risks to our workforce, should a 

wave of infections occur in the community. Those who had 

questions or concerns about the vaccine were encouraged 

to contact their regular doctor.

Employees who present their vaccination certificate, 

medical certificate or MyGov statement that confirms they 

have received the vaccination will each receive a $30 Coles 

Group and Myer Gift Card.

The calculation of work-related injuries is based on the formula – No. of injuries/ No. of man hours per region x 1,000,000 man hours worked. The total number of 

man hours for 2021 is 74,501,919.

COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED


PUBLIC HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

In Singapore, we have been implementing the iSafe system 

since 2019, which comprises the Safe Green Eco System, 

GoldenEye, and MobilEye. The entire SBS Transit fleet has been 

installed with the MobilEye, a smart camera that is able to 

detect, analyse and monitor road conditions while the vehicle is 

moving, as well as provide real-time audio-visual warning via a 

display unit to the driver. Newer buses provisioned by the Land 

Transport Authority have been installed with the Integrated 

Smart Advance Warning Unit (I-SAW-U) instead of the MobilEye. 

Similarly, I-SAW-U is a smart camera system that acts as an extra 

pair of eyes to warn Bus Captains of obstructions and subjects 

in their blind spots. It also alerts the Bus Captains if a pedestrian 

is in front of the bus, if the bus strays off lane, or if it is travelling 

too close to the vehicle in front. We also made investments in 

artificial intelligence technology. 

Since December 2019, we have been operating Singapore’s 

first fully predictive anti-collision buses, which come with a 

Driver Support System that has a built-in Collision Warning &amp; 

Emergency Brake (CWEB) feature. With the system’s ability to 

initiate braking if the driver does not respond to the warnings in 

time, Volvo’s CWEB feature is a welcome safety enhancement 

that helps bus drivers avoid critical situations and accidents. 

ComfortDelGro Bus Drivers have undergone training on the 

in-built CWEB feature.

Since 2020, the Vehicle-Activated Speed Display (VASD) system 

were also implemented to provide instant feedback to Bus 

Captains (BCs) on travelling speed and serves as a reminder 

to respecting applicable speed limits. This year, we have also 

rolled out the blinker light sensor system across multiple bus 

interchanges which alerts oncoming buses or other reversing 

buses on buses reversing out of parking lots.

To protect passengers and employees, almost all of our buses, 

trains and train stations in operation across the Singapore, the 

United Kingdom (UK) and Australia are installed with CCTVs or 

in-vehicle cameras. 

SBS  Transit launched the “Travel with Confidence” programme 

such as priority boarding for passengers-in-wheelchair at all 

50 of its MRT stations. This programme adopts a precautionary 

approach to increase the safety experience of commuters with 

disability. Floor stickers were also used to increase awareness 

of the programme amongst the disability community. For 

elderly, public education posters were put up to encourage the 

safe use of escalators to avoid injuries. Other safety advisory 

includes holding on to support and staying seated until the bus 

or train stops for alighting.

In June 2021, SBS Transit also embarked on a partnership with 

Dementia Singapore to roll out “Find Your Way”, an initiative 

that helps people with dementia find their way around bus 

interchanges and MRT stations with ease through the use of 

colourful murals of childhood games or activities. The pilot test 

was held at Toa Payoh bus interchange. 

In light of COVID-19, ComfortDelGro kept up with our public 

health safety measures across our operations.  Commuters 

are reminded to wear their masks and to avoid talking loudly 

onboard public and private transports. Hand sanitisers are 

also available on vehicles and at stations to encourage good 

personal hygiene At SBS Transit, employees are trained to 

apply Electrostatic Disinfectant Spray on buses and trains. High 

commuter touchpoints in the stations are cleaned once every 

two hours while train interiors are cleaned throughout the day. 

Our private mobility operations, such as taxi and private bus 

services, were also involved in conveying those serving Stay-

Home Notices for their COVID-19 tests. This meant that our 

drivers are required to don on Personal Protective Equipment 

and adhere to the strict hygiene standards in order to protect 

themselves and others.

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD

In  2021, we recorded five fatalities across our global operations. 

Two fatalities were from SBS Transit’s bus operations, of which 

both fatalities involving a pedestrian and a cyclist occurred at 

traffic junctions. From Metroline’s operations, two fatalities 

stemmed from pedestrian collisions. In China, there was a 

fatality was due to a taxi collision in Beijing with a pedestrian 

due to a blind spot at a junction. ComfortDelGro reached out to 

all families of the deceased to provide our support during these 

difficult times.

Upon the incidents, the drivers were immediately suspended 

and investigations were launched to determine the disciplinary 

actions. At the conclusion of these cases, the drivers were either 

dismissed or subjected to further suspension with conditions 

to attend mandatory retraining and safety courses. The use of 

technology such as MobiEye continues to play a heavy role in 

ensuring the safety of our road transportations.

CONVEYING PASSENGERS SERVING  

STAY-HOME NOTICE

When drivers were needed by the Ministry of Health to 

convey those serving Stay Home Notices to and from 

swab facilities, Cabby Koi Eng Yeow, 51, was one of 110 

ComfortDelGro cabbies who stepped up and served.

At the peak of COVID-19 in June 2021, like all the cabbies, 

Cabby Koi was deployed about four times a week on 

average. Even though he is now deployed only once a week, 

he would still don the full Personal Protective Equipment 

before picking the passengers up. Understanding how it 

could be difficult for the passengers at times, Cabby Koi 

would chat with them a little and play light music to calm 

them down.

He said: “Usually, they are rather worried as they don’t 

know what to expect so I will do my best to assure them, by 

answering all their questions to my best ability.” After each 

trip, he would then drive to any public hospital to disinfect 

the whole taxi and discard his PPE properly in a biohazard 

bin. When he’s home, the first thing he does is to shower 

and disinfect before he even speaks to his wife or children.

Asked if his family is worried at all that he has been doing 

this for more than a year, Cabby Koi said: “Maybe initially 

my family was but we have come to learn how to ‘live’ 

with COVID-19. Moreover, my family and I have been fully 

vaccinated and I have even had my booster shot. I can’t do 

much to help except to use my taxi and to serve in the best 

way I can.”

WHY THIS MATTERS TO US

At ComfortDelGro, we believe our employees are vital to 

our growth and success. Employees are at the core of our 

operations, and are essential in ensuring that we deliver quality, 

reliable, safe and efficient service. With the changing landscape 

of the working environment, we are committed to ensuring our 

employees remain engaged in their wellbeing and professional 

development.  

HOW WE MANAGE THIS 

Active, consistent and constructive engagement with our 

employees is our first step to demonstrating our commitment 

to our workforce. Our business is wholly aware of the impact 

that satisfied and engaged employees can have on long-term 

business growth and service quality. 

Our active and continuous dialogue with our employees 

allows us to align our business goals and strategy across our 

operations, while also creating opportunities to be proactive in 

addressing key needs and concerns of our employees. We do 

this through targeted labour-management relations and talent 

management programmes. 

HUMAN &amp; LABOUR RIGHTS

Labour relations, including the honouring of human and labour 

rights, play a critical role in how ComfortDelGro manages its 

employees and operations. In 2021, 82% of our employees 

were covered by Collective Agreements. 

ComfortDelGro work harmoniously with employees and 

Unions in a tripartite Labour-Management relationship. The 

common goal and shared vision between us and the Unions, 

is the improvement of employees’ welfare. Working closely 

with Union representatives, who act as a vital tether between 

the organisation and the Union, we are able to ensure open 

communication and timely addressing of key needs for the 

betterment of our workforce. In  the event of significant 

operational changes that could substantially affect employees, 

a minimum one-month notice will be issued to employees 

and their representatives. The notice period and provisions 

for consultation and negotiation are specified in the collective 

agreements.

A core component of our labour relations is the upholding 

of human rights. In 2021, ComfortDelGro published our 

Human Rights Policy. It details the actions and response our 

organisation is undertaking to ensure the fortification of the 

human rights of our employees across all our operations. Our 

Human Rights Policy (see Annex B) details our obligation to 

fair employment practices, ethical labour practices, freedom 

of association and right to collective bargaining, fair and safe 

working conditions, diversity and inclusion, and growing our 

people. In the UK, Metroline refreshed its Modern Slavery and 

Human Trafficking policy in 2021 and updated its procurement 

and supplier management practices to reflect this commitment.

ComfortDelGro will continue to uphold our commitment to 

fair labour practices and human rights. We will uphold our 

commitment to instill the key principles of fair employment 

practices and abide by all regulatory requirements and labour 

laws in our respective countries of operation.

race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion, or 

affiliation to any political party or trade union. Our diversity and 

equal opportunity principles are detailed in our Human Rights

collectively issued a statement in support on the United Nations 

(UN) Women’s Empowerment Principles in 2019. We continue 

to stand by our support of these principles through initiatives 

towards gender equality in the workplace and communities in 

which we operate. 

It is our firm belief that gender equality contributes strongly 

to a successful organisation, increasing not only financial 

performance, but the benefits to the broader society and 

economy. On our Board, ComfortDelGro has achieved 

30% female representation. In the workplace, our Australia 

operations launched a Women in Transport initiative in 

2021, to attract more female talents and increase women 

representation in the transport sector. Beyond gender diversity 

and equality, our Australia operations also initiated a national 

Diversity &amp; Inclusion Committee in September 2021, to 

sponsor and support various diverse groups. ComfortDelGro 

will continue our efforts to increase female representation 

in the workplace, while ensuring an equitable remuneration 

structure based on work performance without gender bias.

Training Hours Summary, by Gender and Level (2021) – ComfortDelGro Group

EMPLOYEE WELLBEING

With the uncertainties facing the world, as well as the ongoing 

pandemic, many of our employees are beginning to experience 

fatigue. These considerations, along with prolonged social 

isolation, have highlighted the importance of mental and 

physical wellness. ComfortDelGro believes that we have a 

responsibility to ensure the wellbeing of our employees in 

order to prevent unnecessary workplace accidents as well as 

to create a positive organisational culture. 

Through a series of initiatives, training and engagement, as well 

as the provision of benefits, we aim to improve the wellbeing 

of our employees. 

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD 

ComfortDelGro abides by national guidelines on employees’ 

leave and benefits, and these are clearly documented in our 

Staff Handbook. We support flexible work arrangement and 

provide an array of leave benefits such as annual leave and 

childcare leave to support employees who are caregivers and 

parents. In addition, we provide staff discount to attractions 

to encourage staff to spend time with their family and enjoy 

work-life balance.

In 2021, our Group Human Resource team curated a series 

of programmes to help employees improve their mental 

well-being. This was rolled out across four webinars focusing 

on educating employees about managing their stress and 

encouraging them to co-monitor their peers and colleagues 

to intervene early if they detect a problem.

SBS Transit worked together with the Workplace Safety and 

Health Council and their appointed vendor to survey staff and 

Bus Captains. This was to identify key areas of focus regarding 

physical and mental health. Post-survey, SBS Transit launched 

targeted physical and mental health interventions as well as a 

four-part infographic series. This series has been disseminated 

to all employees to continuously encourage care for their 

mental wellbeing in these trying times. 

ComfortDelGro will continue to place employee wellbeing 

at the forefront of our employee engagement initiatives. This 

includes launching of our employee engagement survey and 

formalising programmes for our workforce in new and critical 

areas such as sustainability transition, non-conscious bias and 

diversity training. 

TRAINING

Training and upskilling are essential components in establishing 

long-term career development for our employees. Our 

forethought and preparation in previous years, through digital 

training and business continuity exercises, enabled an agile 

and smooth transition to hybrid work arrangement during 

the COVID-19 pandemic. This in turn, provided opportunities 

for increased accessibility to training and education material 

through virtual platforms. 

ComfortDelGro believes that it is important to bring our 

employees along on our journey, as we strive to innovate and 

transform our enterprise. We provide the requisite training and 

upskilling to our staff to achieve this. This extends beyond our 

need for a capable and adaptable workforce, to encompass 

our commitment to our employees’ professional development. 

All employees receive annual performance and career 

development reviews, assessed on the criteria of competency 

and contribution. Management level staff are reviewed on 

additional aspects such as key performance tasks and targets.  

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD 

Our broad range of training offerings allow employees to tailor 

their development according to their specific needs. In 2021, 

the average training hours is 20.2 hours, up from 18.6 hours 

in 2020. As a new initiative, the Group Sustainability Office 

organised two sustainability-themed webinars to upskill the 

workforce on the relevance of sustainability to our business, 

and the risks and opportunities it may present for the Group. 

Feedback from the sessions were used to further enhance the 

quarterly webinars. Close to 200 staff attended the live sessions 

and the average rating for the session was 4.7 (out of five) stars.

COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED


OUR PATRONS AND COMMUNITIES

Ensuring the highest service quality and accessibility of 

transportation for all, making sure that we are kind and 

responsible to our communities and broader society

WHY THIS MATTERS TO US

As a global transport solutions provider, we pride ourselves in 

our ability to connect people, but also connect with people. 

ComfortDelGro believes that safe transportation should be 

accessible to all and should aid in contributing to a more 

inclusive society. 

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are continuously 

focused on ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all our 

patrons. In these challenging times, we strive to provide care 

and support to communities which we operate in.

HOW WE MANAGE THIS 

In each of our locations, we aim to identify key community-

focused issues that we can contribute to solving. We understand 

the advantage our operations have in terms of active societal 

engagement, and continuously aim to honour our longstanding 

commitment as a good corporate citizen. We strive to maintain 

a high level of service quality and responsiveness to the needs 

of our local communities, to create shared value for all. 

Active community engagement is a core part of how we manage 

our impact and ensure a strong social license to operate. 

ACCESSIBILITY 

Accessibility to an inclusive transportation system is a 

cornerstone to establishing an inclusive society. As a provider 

of land transportation services, ComfortDelGro upholds our 

commitment to ensuring inclusive and accessible services for all. 

Accessibility and inclusivity are also integrated into our 

workplace operations, ensuring that we establish an inclusive 

culture for our people, as well as our patrons and communities. 

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD

In our workplace operations, we have ensured accessibility 

through the provision of wheelchair ramps and lift access as 

well as wheelchair accessible restrooms. 

In our public transportation operations, we have proudly 

ensured that 100% of our public buses operated in Singapore, 

UK and Australia are wheelchair friendly buses that are able 

to transport persons-in-wheelchairs (PIWs) comfortably and 

safely. Our bus drivers are also trained on how to effectively 

deploy the ramps and how to appropriately assist the 

passengers. 

ComfortDelGro has a rigourous training programme for all 

bus drivers, based on our eight service standards for different 

customers, addressing the elderly as well as persons with 

disabilities. The training extends beyond persons with physical 

disabilities, to include those with invisible disability such as autism. 

In the UK and Ireland, employees are trained in disability 

awareness and loading of wheelchairs onto vehicles. 

Metroline has established internal maintenance protocols and 

procedures to support this, such as deploying the wheelchair 

ramp at the garage before any journey is started to ensure it is 

functioning well. Metroline continues to organise accessibility 

communications activities, campaigns, and awareness and 

sensitivity training sessions with various partners throughout 

the year. In London and Liverpool, all Hackney Carriages 

of Computer Cab are wheelchair accessible. In Australia, 

all Forest Coach Lines drivers as well as drivers from Blue 

Mountains Transit were trained on assisting the elderly and 

those with disabilities. For taxis, all of Swan Taxis’ cabbies were 

trained to help the elderly and those with disabilities. CDC 

Victoria also conducted a Customer Connect Care training as 

part of induction to a total of 93 bus drivers and 124 existing  

bus drivers as well as three Operations Control Centre staff 

in 2021. In China, free rides are provided to those in need on 

Disability Day.

In Singapore, ComfortDelGro Driving Centre waived the S$850 

annual membership fee for private driving instructors who train 

learner drivers with disability. For ComfortDelGro Taxi, all taxis 

are equipped with boot space to place wheelchairs and drivers 

are trained to assist those who have disabilities. For those that 

are visually impaired and require a guide dog in their day-to-day 

activities, they also receive up to three booking waivers a day 

to get around. Through our ComfortDelGro MedCare services, 

seniors and persons with mobility issues may hire our fleet of 

specially equipped minibuses for medical appointments or 

social outings. These vehicles are capable of accommodating 

a range of wheelchairs, including those that are motorised and 

bulkier. The automatic hydraulic lifts allow wheelchair users to 

get on board without dismounting. 

ComfortDelGro commits to continuous improvement in our 

accessibility offerings throughout all of our operations. We 

will strive to integrate any new and useful technologies to aid  

in inclusivity.

SERVICE QUALITY 

Ensuring the highest quality of safe and inclusive transportation 

allows ComfortDelGro to maintain and enhance trust with 

our patrons. Service quality is one of the key differentiators in 

setting ComfortDelGro apart as a leader in transport services. 

We have a robust set of processes to ascertain customer and 

community feedback on our service quality. 

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD 

For  commuters across our global operations, we have 

information counters at bus interchanges/ MRT stations, 

websites, apps, hotlines, and social media channels to engage 

customers and to promote our services. Upon receiving 

queries, we adhere to high service standards to respond within 

a reasonable timeframe. For example, ComfortDelGro Taxi 

adheres to a formal process certified under ISO 9001:2015 

to handle all customer feedback and for the investigation 

process. Currently, the target is to respond to 80% of cases 

within five working days, and they have achieved 85% in 2021. 

For business clients, we conduct regular engagement and 

feedback sessions to ensure that we continue to meet their 

needs.  

For our public transport operations, it is our priority to operate 

services according to planned schedules and adhere to robust 

safety standards and stringent checks. In 2021, SBS Transit 

partnered with Stratio to implement Bus Condition Monitoring 

as part of their efforts to explore cost-effective solutions to 

increase fleet uptime and improve customer satisfaction. As a 

result, they were able to deliver a safe, comfortable and reliable

service for commuters by optimising maintenance process and 

improving bus reliability. SBS Transit also has a mobile app which 

communicates train and bus arrival timing to commuters. More 

initiatives of SBS Transit commuter inclusion and accessibility 

are available in their Sustainability Report 2021.

We also work closely with the Traffic Police to improve road 

safety and conduct up-to-date training for all Bus Captains 

and Customer Service Officers to ensure the highest standards 

of safety and security. To manage COVID-19 on transport 

services, we continue to adhere to government protocols and 

implement Safe Management Measures.

In Singapore, the Public Transport Council also conducts 

the Public Transport Customer Satisfaction Survey (PTCSS) 

to determine service quality. For PTCSS 2021, commuters 

remained satisfied with public transport services. The mean 

satisfaction score was 7.8 out of 10, a score that was maintained 

since 2019. For Point-to-Point (PtP) Transportation Survey, 

a mean satisfaction score of 8.4 out of 10 was received for 

2021, comparable to 2020 and 2019 scores. ComfortDelGro 

is proud to be one of the public transport and PtP operators 

that continue to deliver on our service and result in commuter 

satisfaction.

Our commitment to honouring service quality and successful 

customer engagement remains a priority for ComfortDelGro 

and we will continue to do so indefinitely. We will strive to 

improve on our service quality and integrate constructive 

feedback into our processes. 

In our overseas operations, regional road infrastructure is not always designed to operate low-floor wheelchair accessible buses. The regional bus operations are 

therefore constrained from operating low-floor wheelchair accessible vehicles.

AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR (AED)-ON-WHEELS PROGRAMME

As one of 50 first-responders of the Singapore Civil Defence Force-ComfortDelGro AED-on-Wheels programme, Cabby 

Sin York Tan has been trained on how to use the AED as well as to render first aid. As such, when he chanced upon an 

injured cyclist involved in a traffic accident with a car, the Good Samaritan stopped to help. Later on, he also attended to 

an injured motorcyclist by helping him bandage his bleeding knee before the paramedics arrived.

CDC Victoria provided support to the Red Cliffs Community 

Resource Centre by providing a vehicle that delivered food 

to the disadvantaged in Mildura and also provided support 

to a multicultural community organisation in Melbourne’s 

western suburb of Werribee to help secure water for their 

community garden. CDC Victoria donated A$20,000 to 

support the underprivileged but talented and motivated young 

people in Melbourne’s West so as to help them realise their 

potential through merit-based, tailor-made scholarships and 

opportunity programmes. 

CDC Victoria continued to sponsor A$10,000 towards a three-

year environmental project with the Victorian State Government 

and major bus industry suppliers, Volvo Bus Australia, and CMV 

Truck &amp; Bus for the development of Australia’s first dementia 

friendly forest and sensory trail in Victoria’s Woowookarung 

regional park in Ballarat. The all-abilities sensory trail winds 

through native bushland and is designed to stimulate 

positive memories, feelings and sensations for people living  

with dementia. It offers visitors an experience in nature  

that is accessible for wheelchair users and their carers, people 

with assistance dogs, and groups from residential aged  

care facilities.

UK

The UK operations focused on positive contribution to the 

communities and the national economy, by focusing on 

employment opportunities and supporting the UK Governments 

Kickstart Scheme. The Kickstart Scheme provides funding to 

employers in the UK to create jobs for young people who 

are at risk of long-term unemployment due to the economic 

impact of the pandemic. Metroline created 30 new paid job 

placements at its London bus garages under this programme. 

The roles included garage operations, recruitment, IT, 

engineering administration, service delivery, and roadside 

support. In addition, Metroline provides career advice for these 

staff to enhance their future job prospects.

The UK Government also introduced a ruling allowing levy 

paying employers to gift up to 25% of their apprenticeship levy 

to fund new apprenticeships. Metroline gifted £200,000 of its 

unused levy to Total People, a large-scale social enterprise 

focused on providing work-based learning and apprenticeship 

opportunities. 

Our UK operations also provided a contribution of £24,000, 

towards Save the Children and Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospice, 

instead of organising the traditional annual Christmas dinner 

due to the pandemic.

LOCAL IMPACT &amp; CSR

Creating positive local impact beyond our direct operations 

allows us to demonstrate our commitment to bettering the 

communities we operate in and extend our care to those in 

need. Each location is responsible for their social responsibility 

outreach, to ensure programmes are tailored specifically 

to the needs of their communities. In 2021, ComfortDelGro 

collectively gave S$2.07 million in donations, up from S$1.44 

million in 2020.

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD

AUSTRALIA 

A key focus area for our Australia operations is the outreach 

and uplifting of indigenous peoples. National Aborigines and 

Islanders Day Observance Committee week took place in July 

2021, with CDC Australia commemorating and honouring 

indigenous Australians across depots and business units across 

Australia. 

CDC NSW continued their work with Kinchela Boys Home 

Aboriginal Corporation on our programme to promote and 

share stories of aboriginal history and facilitate healing through 

a partnership over three years. CDC Victoria also hosted 12 

young indigenous people at the Wyndham Depot and head 

office, with the aim of educating them on potential career 

opportunities that are available. 

Our Australia operations, through their continuous community 

engagement, also understand the value of sport in unifying 

people and building common ground. Buslink NT used this 

principle to provide support to the Deadly Cup indigenous 

rugby league event in July 2021. Buslink NT also provided 

sponsorship for the Jabiru Bombers, a team in the Australian 

rules, a football code unique to Australia. CDC NSW provided 

support in Sydney for various sporting events, including the 

provision of safe and accessible transport for fans to get to the 

games. 

The community outreach in Australia also extends beyond 

indigenous peoples and sport, to address other community 

touchpoints as well. Moove Media Australia supported the 

vaccine rollout by providing 100 cityside panels, equivalent to 

$140,000 of advertising, free of charge as part of Government’s 

vaccination publicity campaign. CDC NSW provided monetary 

sponsorship and advertising for Blacktown Arts in multicultural 

Western Sydney to support artistic and cultural innovation 

exhibitions, performances, workshops and events.

CHINA

Our China operations focused much of their social 

responsibility efforts in providing financial aid to those in need. 

In 2021, Beijing Jin Jian Taxi Services donated S$10,519 towards 

the Beijing Warmth Foundation, which actively encourages 

workers to raise funds to help those amongst them who are 

facing financial difficulties.

Our taxi drivers from Shenyang ComfortDelGro Taxi visited the 

elderly in a nursing home in the Da Dong District, and our taxi 

drivers from Chengdu ComfortDelGro volunteered to deliver 

rice and provide free taxi trips to the elderly and the disabled. 

Our taxi companies in China also continued to provide free taxi 

trips to needy students during the country’s National Education 

Entrance Examination.

SINGAPORE

ComfortDelGro understands that the global economy is still 

in a state of recovery in the gradual transition to the “New 

Normal”. To alleviate some of the financial burden, the Group 

continued to extend rental waivers to its hirers amounting to 

S$86.5 million. 

To extend this aid to the community, our Singapore business 

units, ComfortDelGro Taxi and ComfortDelGro MedCare, 

participated in the Kind Citizen Platform. This is an innovative 

“pay-it-forward” marketplace platform, where members of 

the public can purchase vouchers of listed essential services, 

such as transport services, which can later be redeemed by 

beneficiaries of established social service agencies. To date, 

over 100 pay-it-forward S$5 vouchers has been purchased. 

During the Chinese New Year period, ComfortDelGro Taxi 

also matched the voucher dollar-for-dollar and upsized the 

taxi voucher value to S$10 for the receiving beneficiaries. Our 

participation signifies commitment towards contributing to 

the communities by providing safe, efficient, and accessible 

mobility to all.

In Singapore, ComfortDelGro have been contributing to NTUC 

Eldercare since 2005. This programme provides social day 

care services to the elderly poor. To-date, we have contributed 

a total of S$2.03 million to this cause.

ComfortDelGro Taxi also has an established volunteer group, 

comprised of taxi cab drivers, CabbyCare Charity Group 

(CabbyCare). In 2021, CabbyCare continued its practice of 

delivering meals and bread to the needy for free, having made 

over 2,310 trips. The fares forfeited from these three-hours 

trips equate to approximately S$173,250. ComfortDelGro Taxi 

also contributed a decommissioned taxi to St Luke’s Hospital 

for its patient rehabilitation services.

In addition to caring for the elderly and poor, we also 

continuously engaged with the younger generation, giving aid 

to children in need.  ComfortDelGro Driving Centre conducted 

road safety talks to about 1,640 secondary school students. 

Due to COVID-19, these talks were recorded in-house and 

broadcast to the students via their schools’ audio-visual 

systems. 

As part of VICOM’s Care &amp; Share initiative, VICOM participated 

in the HCA Hospice Care Vertical Challenge 2021 to raise 

funds for patients with life-limiting illnesses. This will allow the 

patients to spend their final moments with dignity at home 

in the company of their loved ones. In the vertical challenge, 

participants can clock their vertical gains through climbing hills, 

parks, ridges or stairs at their own time and pace. At the same 

time, participants are encouraged to be creative in sharing their 

HCA Vertical Challenge profile with their friends and families 

to raise funds. VICOM sent a total of 31 participants and as of 

1 Dec 2021, VICOM’s team has raised S$26,000 for the HCA 

Vertical Challenge. 

Beyond the vertical challenge, VICOM distributed groceries 

and Chinese New Year goodies to the elderly at the Thong 

Kheng Seniors Activity Centre and THK Indus Moral Care. 

Our subsidiary SBS Transit also sponsored S$12,000 to the 

“Dot Me Stickers” Campaign by The Helping Hand, which is a 

halfway house in Singapore that focuses on the rehabilitation 

of former drug addicts.

ComfortDelGro will continue to enhance our social licence to 

operate and community trust through active and meaningful 

engagement with our local communities. We will continue to 

strive to be a socially responsible corporate citizen and create 

positive impact wherever feasible.

In the past, Group Internal Audit (IA) team members were required 

to travel once every quarter to conduct audit checks overseas. 

When COVID-19 pandemic hits, the IA team had to stay home 

whilst continuing their audit work to satisfy the audit objectives.  

It was challenging in the beginning to coordinate these 

virtual audits. However, as they learned from their experience,  

they were soon able to perform system walkthroughs effectively 

through screenshots with auditees. With cloud technology,  

audit evidence, samples and data requested can be accessed 

remotely from anywhere. The time saved on commuting actually

ETHICAL INTEGRITY AND INNOVATION

ETHICAL BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY 

Maintaining ethical, transparent and compliant operations 

with zero tolerance for bribery, corruption and anti-

competitive behaviour

WHY THIS MATTERS TO US 

Ethical business practices and operational integrity are 

integral pillars of our corporate identity. We believe that good 

governance is essential to create and preserve value for all 

stakeholders. With operations that span across seven countries, 

it is critical for all of ComfortDelGro’s businesses, entities as 

well as its employees, suppliers, agents and representatives to 

be in full compliance with local laws and regulations. 

Businesses face high ethical and business risks including legal 

and reputational risks, potential financial costs and erosion of 

internal trust when they fail to effectively combat corruption in all 

its forms. As such, not only do we strive to avoid bribery, extortion 

and other forms of corruption, ComfortDelGro is working 

proactively to address corruption within our supply chains.

HOW WE MANAGE THIS

ComfortDelGro conducts our business with integrity and 

transparency. It is our commitment to:

• Conduct our affairs in a manner consistent with the highest 

ethical and professional standards

• Engage in fair and honest business practices

• Show respect for each other, our customers, business 

partners, suppliers, shareholders, the authorities, and the 

communities we operate in

• Communicate in a factual, honest, and prompt manner

• Be open and transparent in our dealings

ComfortDelGro does not condone any form of corrupt 

practices such as bribery, extortion or embezzlement. We do 

not condone any fraudulent practices including intentional 

deception or misappropriation of resources. 

Strong policies and processes are in place to ensure impartiality 

and regular internal audits are conducted on our practices 

and processes to ensure the highest levels of integrity are 

maintained. 

Our employees receive education on corruption risks and are 

prohibited from accepting payments, gifts or other kinds of 

reimbursement from a third-party that could affect or appear 

to affect their objectivity in business decisions. 

Our ethics and integrity policies are extended to our partners 

and suppliers. We require all suppliers to accept and operate 

within the principles as detailed in our Supplier Code of 

Conduct (see Annex A) and to be in full compliance with all 

applicable laws and regulations. 

All representatives of ComfortDelGro are prohibited from 

extending or accepting any rewards or benefits to customers, 

potential customers, suppliers, consultants, governments, 

agencies of governments or any representative of such entities 

in order to obtain or retain business or to gain any other 

improper advantage.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


GROWING OUR BUSINESS WITH STRONG GOVERNANCE, 

ETHICAL INTEGRITY AND INNOVATION

All ComfortDelGro representatives and officers responsible for 

administering and approving contracts, in which they or close 

relatives have significant interests, are required to disclose, 

declare and recuse themselves from the handling of these 

contracts. All staff in our procurement team undergo an annual 

declaration on conflicts of interest and are required to attend 

a workshop on “Procurement Fraud Prevention and Detection” 

within their first two years of service. 

ComfortDelGro has established an Alert Line in accordance 

with the principles as stated in our Whistleblowing Policy. This 

Alert Line reports to the Chairperson of the ComfortDelGro 

Audit and Risk Committee and the Group Chief Internal 

Audit Officer. All whistleblowing reports undergo thorough 

investigation, fairly and independently, with swift and accurate 

closure. 

The Audit and Risk Committee has the remit to ensure that 

ComfortDelGro complies with all emulations and listing rules, 

and that risk management measures and internal controls are 

adequate and effective. We have implemented an Enterprise 

Risk Management (ERM) framework. Further details on our 

corporate governance and ERM framework can be found in 

our Annual Report 2021 pages 63-83 and 88-93 respectively.

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD 

ComfortDelGro reported one fraud incident this year. The 

service staff was charged under the “Criminal Breach of 

Trust” and since, we have put in place measures to prevent 

similar incidents from occurring. We will strive to improve our 

performance in future. 

In 2021, there were zero cases of bribery and anti-competitive 

behaviour. This is the third year we have maintained our track 

record.

ComfortDelGro will continue to uphold the highest standards 

of ethics and integrity and will consistently aim for zero cases 

of corruption, bribery and anti-competitive behaviour.

CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY AND INNOVATION

Upholding protective processes and compliance with local 

legislation to prevent data &amp; cyber breaches, and adopting 

innovative technologies 

WHY THIS MATTERS TO US 

Globally, digitalisation and technological adoption has been 

changing the way we operate our business. With the pandemic 

accelerating the digital transformation, there has also been a 

rise in scams, malware attacks, data and cyber breaches. As this 

trend continues, it is an absolute must that our safeguards, data 

protection processes and cybersecurity defences are kept up to 

speed to safeguard the interests of our customers, employees 

and partners.

In addition, ComfortDelGro is constantly studying new and 

innovative technologies to enhance our operations and 

offerings. Where feasible, we will pilot these solutions with 

potential clients in the locations where we operate. This enables 

us to assess the performance of the innovative technologies 

and roll them out in a strategic manner, enabling the maximum 

benefits to be captured.

HOW WE MANAGE THIS

COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED


GROWING OUR BUSINESS WITH STRONG GOVERNANCE, 

ETHICAL INTEGRITY AND INNOVATION

To increase the security and integrity of our online systems, 

ComfortDelGro has instilled processes to increase our 

understanding of attack vectors and associated mitigating 

behaviours in the events of cyber-attacks. We have established 

a number of procedures, processes and initiatives to equip our 

company and employees with the competencies to effectively 

deal with incidences such as data breaches. 

Our Cyber Security Awareness Training, conducted via e-learning 

platforms, aims to instil awareness amongst employees and raise 

alertness to the latest information security policies, procedures 

and risks. This training is mandatory for all employees. This 

training also aims to prepare and effectively equip all employees 

with the capabilities, techniques and methods that are critical in 

the effective mitigation of security risks. 

As all of our business operations rely heavily on Information 

Technology (IT), this is a key risk for ComforDelGro. We have 

ensured that our IT security management framework follows 

industry standards. This aids in mitigating any disruption of the 

business, loss of data or security breaches of our IT systems. In 

addition, ComfortDelGro has also established various control 

and data recovery measures to mitigate these risks. These 

measures include, but are not limited to, the use of intrusion 

prevention systems, multi-level firewalls, server protection, 

software code hardening and data loss prevention controls to 

manage internet and cyber security threats. 

The regular undertaking of penetration test and audits on the 

integrity of our systems help to identify potential vulnerabilities, 

allowing us to strengthen the security of our systems and to 

ensure the highest standards of protection are maintained. 

As our operations deal with public patrons, ComforDelGro has 

developed its Personal Data Protection Policy, that complies 

with Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). Going 

beyond this, ComfortDelGro has also established a Data Breach 

Management Plan, as a swift and thorough response in the 

event of data and security breaches. To deter potential cyber-

attacks, we ensure encryption of sensitive personal information 

to minimise the risks of personal data leakage. ComfortDelGro’s 

Personal Data Protection Policy will be reviewed every two 

years or whenever there are amendments to Singapore’s PDPA. 

Relevant stakeholders will receive updates about any changes 

to the Policy. ComfortDelGro also undertakes compliance 

audits on a regular basis to ensure adherence to the Group’s 

Personal Data Protection Policies. 

A Data Protection Work Group was established to ensure 

compliance with the Group’s PDPA Policies consisting of 

appointed Data Protection Officers across our Business Units. 

Business Units are also encouraged to obtain the Data Protection 

Trust Mark (DPTM) certification to ensure conformance to 

PDPA best practices. To date, ComfortDelGro Engineering, JIC 

Inspection Services, Setsco Services and VICOM Inspection 

Centre have obtained the DPTM certification. Multiple business 

units in Singapore have also began their DPTM consultancy and 

will target for assessment in 2022.

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD

ComfortDelGro will continue to strengthen and uphold our IT, 

data and cyber security measures and will consistently aim for 

zero breaches. We will also continue to embrace innovation in 

our operations and offerings.

CDG-NUS SMART AND SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY LIVING LAB

In March 2021, ComfortDelGro committed to investing about S$50 million in a mobility-focused CDG-NUS Smart &amp; 

Sustainable Mobility Living Lab that will focus on Energy Sustainability, Integrated Urban Mobility as well as Smart and 

Intelligent Mobility Technologies. It will research, test and analyse mobility technologies to generate insights that could 

later be implemented in solutions for the mass market.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


GROWING OUR BUSINESS WITH STRONG GOVERNANCE, 

ETHICAL INTEGRITY AND INNOVATION

includes supplier’s declaration of conflict of interest, non-

compliance on environment, health and safety, verification 

of various pertinent ISO certifications status and compliance 

with our Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of 

Conduct outlines our expectations on compliance with law 

and regulations, fair practice, ethical conduct, social and 

environmental sustainability. We refrain from working with 

suppliers who do not comply with our Policy. Read more about 

our Supplier Code of Conduct in Annex A.

We conduct Supplier Performance Management exercises 

regularly to assess our suppliers’ performance against market 

norms and the expectations agreed upon in our contracts. 

Key suppliers are appraised on their cost management, safety 

and service standards. These contribute to our risk mitigation 

efforts, allowing us to accurately uncover the root causes of 

potential problems and resolve them as quickly as possible. 

Moving forward, we plan to further integrate ESG criteria into 

the supplier performance scoring system. 

Since 2020, we implemented a new procurement software, 

ComPASS (ComfortDelGro Procurement, Analytics, Sourcing 

and Supplier). As of January 2022, more than 95% of the 

transaction volume in Singapore is through ComPASS. The 

electronic spend management system drives end-to-end 

procurement processes, which cover supplier onboarding, 

sourcing, contract management, procure-to-pay and spend 

analysis functions. ComPASS has enabled a more robust 

supplier governance, and helped us work more closely with 

suppliers to improve processes and ensure compliance with 

environmental and safety regulations. To-date, over 71,967 

orders and 71,488 invoices have been processed electronically, 

reducing paper wastage.

As part of our continuous digitalisation efforts, we have 

rolled out a procurement tender portal in November 2021. 

The tender portal enables suppliers to explore procurement 

opportunities with us and register their interest online. Not 

only does this portal improves efficiencies and eliminates 

unnecessary paperwork, it also maximises participation and 

provides flexibility and convenience for suppliers to register 

anytime, anywhere.

OUR PERFORMANCE AND LOOKING FORWARD

The bulk of our purchases consists of energy and direct material 

and services for the operation and maintenance of our fleets. 

In 2021, we have long-term contracts of more than three years 

with 506 suppliers. This demonstrates our commitment to 

build long term relationships with our suppliers. About 87% of 

the contracts by value were established through competitive 

sourcing exercises, including 67% through public tenders. The 

rest of the contracts were established with suppliers who are 

sole source, or incumbents with whom we leveraged existing 

contract volumes.

In 2021, no supplier incident of social and environmental 

non-compliance occurred on ComfortDelGro’s premises, or 

was linked to ComfortDelGro’s operations. ComfortDelGro 

continues to integrate more stringent ESG considerations 

into our supplier engagement and performance systems, and 

reserves the rights to terminate any suppliers found to be in 

violation of regulations. More details are in our Supplier’s Code 

of Conduct. 

We are committed to upholding the highest level of integrity 

within our supply chain.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

Integrating environmental and social screening criteria 

into our supply chain practices

WHY THIS MATTERS TO US 

COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of traditional, long supply 

chains with lockdowns causing severe disruptions to business 

operations and delays to shipments. With increasing risk and 

scrutiny of the environmental and social impacts of global 

supply chains, it is critical to increase the transparency and 

oversight of ComfortDelGro’s supply chains. This will pave the 

way for the transition to a more sustainable and resilient supply 

chains. we grasp the importance of maintaining a strong and 

ethical supply chain. Additionally, awareness of our supply chain 

and its impact can help us to mitigate our Scope 3 emissions 

and other ESG impacts. As an international organisation, 

establishing strong relationships and working ethics with our 

suppliers are essential to our operations and would allow us to 

garner the best out of our supply chain. 

HOW WE MANAGE THIS

We work closely with our suppliers to maintain high standards 

of operations, and to improve business performance, cost 

efficiency, customer satisfaction, while at the same time 

enhancing positive relationships with our suppliers. We uphold 

fairness, respect, openness, transparency in our dealing with 

our suppliers and we keep our end of the bargain.  

Our suppliers are selected using a multi-criteria weighted 

matrix, with each criterion assigned a weightage according to 

its relative importance. The criteria used include:

• The supplier’s technical capabilities

• Service quality

• Supply assurance

• Environmental responsibility 

• Safety records

• Financial stability 

• Cost competitiveness

Following supplier selection, onboarding is the next step 

towards supplier management. To this end, in 2021, we have 

focused on collecting supplier’s information and assess 

supplier’s compliance and risks to mitigate supply chain 

risks in the areas of Fraud and Corruption, Supply, Legal, 

Price, Environmental, and Health and Safety. The assessment

COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED


ANNEX C: WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY

 1.  WHAT IS WHISTLEBLOWING? 

 

As employees are expected to abide by the principles of 

the Code of Business Conduct (“Code”) and also maintain 

and demonstrate the highest professional standards and 

ethical conduct in the performance of their duties, they are 

encouraged to bring to the attention of Management any 

violations of the Code; and/or any unethical or unlawful 

business conduct or dealings, with the intention for 

necessary corrective actions to be taken to address the 

violations. 

2.  WHO IS A WHISTLEBLOWER? 

 

A whistleblower may be an employee or external party who, 

in the course of his/her duties or personal engagement 

with the Company or employee, has witnessed or who has 

knowledge that another fellow employee has previously 

engaged, is currently engaging or will be engaging in 

practices/activities that will be in violation of the Code, 

or unethical or unlawful business conduct or dealings, 

and decides to highlight these practices to Management 

with a view that necessary corrective actions will be  

taken to prevent the occurrence of such undesired 

practices/activities. 

 

Whistleblowing is not a means by which anyone including 

a disgruntled employee can abuse, wreak revenge on or 

sabotage another person or fellow employee without any 

just cause or to hold an employee at ransom. Any action 

of whistleblowing must be genuine, substantiated with 

proper evidence, and directed to the ComfortDelGro Alert 

Line within a reasonable time. Where necessary, employees 

must be prepared to testify or provide statement of such 

actions. It should not be unfounded or malicious allegations 

made against another employee. ComfortDelGro will not 

tolerate the abuse of this Whistleblowing process. 

 

A whistleblower need not have to be directly or indirectly 

affected by or have a personal interest in the outcome 

of the actions giving rise to the whistleblowing. So long 

as an employee has a genuine concern and reasonable 

grounds to believe that the actions of a fellow employee is 

in breach or will be in breach of the Code or principles of 

ethical conduct and fair dealing, he can be a whistleblower. 

However, the whistleblower must act in good faith at  

all times. 

 

The Policy allows for reporting by Employees or 

External Parties of such matters, without fear of reprisal, 

discrimination 

or 

adverse 

consequences, 

and 

also 

permits ComfortDelGro to address such reports by taking 

appropriate action, including, but not limited to, disciplining 

or terminating the employment and/or services of those 

responsible.

• 

Theft, damage or misappropriation of company’s 

properties, using company’s properties for own benefit 

or any unlawful purpose, or unlawful dissemination 

or disclosure of company’s proprietary information, 

know-how and trade secrets; 

• 

Fraud. For example: 

 

(i)   falsification or alteration of company’s records,  

 

accounts or financial information; 

 

(ii)  submission of false invoices and claims for   

 

reimbursement of expenses; 

 

(iii)  failure to account or misuse of company’s monies  

 

in possession; and 

 

(iv)   knowingly provide information which is false or

in breach of any legal or contractual obligations. For

threatened violence, bullying, bribery or acceptance 

of monies, gifts or monetary benefits in exchange for 

personal favours;

Making statements or remarks which are defamatory or 

cause disruption to racial harmony; 

• 

Sexual harassment or adopting discriminatory practices;
