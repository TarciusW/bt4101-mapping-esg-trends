Founded in 2002 by Mr. Pang Lim and headquartered 

in Singapore, Koufu Group Limited (“Koufu”) has been 

one of Singapore’s most well-known operators and 

managers of food courts and coffee shops. Since 

July 2018, Koufu has been listed on the Mainboard 

of the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”). 

Our business comprises of two segments – Outlet &amp; 

Mall Management and F&amp;B Retail. Under the Outlet 

&amp; Mall Management business segment, Koufu 

operates and/or manages food courts, coffee shops, 

a hawker centre and a commercial mall. Under the 

F&amp;B Retail business segment, we operate F&amp;B stalls 

located within food courts and coffee shops, as well 

as F&amp;B kiosks, quick-service restaurants and full-

service restaurants. Our brands include Cookhouse 

by Koufu, Elemen, R&amp;B Tea, Grove and many more. 

Koufu (口福) refers to the Chinese belief that it is 

one’s good fortune to feast on good food. Using the 

same belief to bring forth ‘Koufu’ to everyone, we 

make it our mission to offer accessible good food 

and services steeped in traditional Singaporean 

cuisine and culture.

The Board of Directors (“the Board” or “We”) of Koufu Group 

Limited (“Koufu” or “the Group”) is pleased to present our 

inaugural Sustainability Report. 

We hold strongly to our belief of bringing “Koufu” to everyone. 

We recognise a great responsibility to do so in a purposeful 

and sustainable manner for future generations to enjoy a 

fortune of good food. Sustainability has always been a part of 

Koufu’s strategy in driving business practices, as embodied in 

our mission statement, ‘Better Food, Better People, Better Life’. 

The Board, along with various stakeholders, have identified and 

determined the material environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) matters. We seek to closely monitor these key ESG 

matters for their continued relevance to our business.

Notwithstanding the COVID-19 outbreak subsequent to year-

end, we expect to remain competitive with our productivity 

efforts and strategic expansion plans in place. We will be stepping 

up on precautionary measures as advised or mandated by the 

government and continue to bring forth new food options and 

varieties to our customers in a sustainable manner.

Our report, in alignment with our three-pillared mission, 

summarises our non-financial performance and commitments 

towards the ESG matters that we have determined as material to 

the Group. We endeavour to work closely and provide guidance 

to the Management team to achieve a desired balance between 

profitability and long-term sustainable growth.

Materiality Assessment 

We have undertaken a four-step materiality assessment approach for our inaugural sustainability report, to 

identify, prioritise, validate and review sustainability matters relevant to Koufu. Through this, we focus on the 

six sustainability matters as listed in Figure 3 that are pertinent to Koufu’s business and embodies our overall 

mission to cultivate better food, better people and better life.

Figure 2: Four-step materiality assessment

KOUFU’S SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

IDENTIFICATION

A preliminary list of sustainability 

matters was collated based on 

desktop analysis of sustainability 

reports published by industry 

players. Subsequently, these 

matters were discussed with 

management to distil those that 

were relevant to Koufu.

4





















































VALIDATION

Results from the materiality 

assessment workshop were 

presented in a materiality matrix 

and validated by the Board. 

3

REVIEW 

The validated sustainability 

matters will undergo yearly review 

to ensure that these remain 

relevant and important to Koufu’s 

business and our stakeholders.

PRIORITISATION

In allocating weightage to the 

sustainability matters identified in step 1, 

we have engaged an independent consultant 

to facilitate a materiality assessment workshop involving senior 

management and key members across several departments. This 

workshop allowed us to prioritise matters according to the likelihood 

and extent of impact to our business whilst taking into consideration 

the perception of both internal and external stakeholders.

Koufu’s Sustainable Value Chain

Koufu’s value chain comprises largely of four categories as shown in Table 3. We seek to continually improve 

and better manage each aspect to ensure the sustainability of our business. This involves the tenants of our 

food courts who play a key role in the reputation and success of Koufu.

Food Safety and Hygiene

Why It Is Important

Providing safe, high-quality food is of utmost importance to Koufu as a food management 

and service provider. To that end, one of our greatest priorities is to maintain high standards of 

food safety and hygiene, and to comply with all food and safety regulations across our central 

kitchens, food courts and F&amp;B retail outlets. We believe that through this, we will be able to 

build Koufu into a trusted brand for individuals and families.

Practices

We have established a standardised approach in guiding our employees and tenants on food safety 

and hygiene practices, and procedures that should be followed across our food operations. Regular 

evaluation procedures are also implemented to ensure adherence (refer to Table 4). In addition,  

we are currently exploring certifications such as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point 

(“HACCP”) for our proposed integrated facility.

2 

A major food safety incident is defined as Mass Food Poisoning deemed to have occurred when at least five unrelated 

customers are affected from consuming food items produced by the Central Kitchen supplying to our retail outlets.

3 

Our proposed Integrated Facility will expand the central procurement, preparation, processing and distribution functions of 

our existing central kitchens to manufacture and supply semi-finished and/or finished food products to our food courts and 

self-operated F&amp;B.

Policy

Koufu strictly aligns our food safety 

and hygiene practices in accordance 

with 

SFA 

regulations. 

Obtaining 

the relevant licensing, permits and 

qualifications are also strictly enforced.

Targets

• Zero major2 food safety incidents at 

Koufu’s outlets

• SFA Grade “A” license at new proposed 

Integrated Facility3 by FY2021

!

Table 4: Approach and evaluation processes on food safety and hygiene

Central Kitchen  &gt;&gt;

Outlet Management and  

F&amp;B Retail  &gt;&gt;     

◆ Verification of relevant 

approval documents and 

certificates before accepting 

deliveries of fresh produce, 

dairy products and meat.

◆ Before appointing new 

suppliers, we require samples 

to be sent to us for testing in 

order to meet our stringent 

quality standards.

◆ “First in, first out” method – a 

system which organises food 

by expiration or use-by date – 

adopted for our raw ingredients to 

control the quantities ordered and 

minimise wastage.

◆ Food preparation carried out under 

strict temperature-controlled 

environment.

◆ Our central kitchens are thoroughly 

washed down and cleaned at the 

end of each day.

◆ All Koufu’s service personnel are 

to maintain food quality and safety 

requirements listed in our strict 

internal control procedures such 

as our daily food hygiene checklist 

for individual stall owners/tenants 

and guidelines and NEA’s Food 

Hygiene Handbook.

◆ Chefs and kitchen staff involved in 

the food preparation are trained 

in food handling, cooking and 

hygiene control.

◆ Randomised checks on the 

quality of raw ingredients 

supplied by our regular 

suppliers.

◆ Periodic evaluation of 

suppliers’ performance, 

reputation, track record, and 

the quality of the ingredients 

supplied.

◆ Our food products are further 

subjected to visual quality control 

checks at every station for any 

abnormalities, with a final check 

conducted at the respective 

packing stations.

◆ Inspection conducted 3 times 

a week by the Food Hygiene 

Manager (“FHM”), quality assurance 

team and factory manager.

◆ Daily visual checks are also 

conducted on the F&amp;B products 

served.

◆ Food Court Managers (“FCMs”) 

and Floor Managers conduct daily 

routine inspections to uphold the 

level of cleanliness and hygiene 

standards in our food courts and 

coffee shops consistently.

Approach

BETTER FOOD


14

Should any non-compliance incident be raised by the Singapore Food Agency (“SFA”), our FHM and Zone 

Trainer will investigate the incident, and subsequently, educate the parties involved. The Service Manager

Qualifications Requirements 

At Koufu, our employees and tenants must be equipped with the necessary Workforce Skills Qualifications 

(refer to Table 5) before commencing work at Koufu or at Koufu’s premises as a food handler. 

Table 5: WSQ qualifications requirement

Performance4

We have achieved zero major food safety incidents at Koufu’s outlets in FY2019 and are working towards 

obtaining SFA Grade “A” license for our Integrated Facility in FY2021. Although we have received from NEA 

a total of 4 demerit points from one case relating to poor housekeeping in FY2019, this was down from 26 

demerit points from 6 cases in FY2018. In response to this, we have put in place corrective actions for this 

case in FY2019 which includes additional reviews on the housekeeping of that stall. There were no incidents 

of non-compliance with voluntary codes and regulations resulting in a warning.

 Our performance only includes cases where Koufu has direct operational control over (i.e. excludes tenants).

To ensure a certain standard of food safety and 

hygiene at our retail outlets, our FHM conducts 

an inspection on food stalls thrice a week, taking 

into consideration areas such as the potential 

cross-contamination of raw and cooked food 

and labelling of expiration dates. After the audit, 

our FHM will have a meeting with our FCMs and 

SMs to address the non-conformities observed 

during the audits and the respective corrective 

actions to be taken.

Customer Satisfaction

Why It Is Important

Due to the nature of Koufu’s business, the main contributing factor to our customers’ 

satisfaction is their dining experience – which includes the quality of services and food 

served within our premises. To ensure that our customers have a pleasant dining experience, 

our commitment towards customer satisfaction goes beyond just meeting the regulations. 

As such, our policies and procedures are catered to place our customers’ well-being and 

happiness at the heart of our services.

Practices

In managing the overall service level at 

our outlet management and F&amp;B retail, we 

have in place the following measures to 

enhance customer satisfaction.  

Policy

To accomplish our mission of “Better Food, Better People, Better Life”, we commit to the 

following:

1)  To listen, understand and respond often in creative ways to the evolving needs and 

constantly shifting expectations of our customers 

2) To communicate our service vision to employees at every level to ensure quality service is 

personally and positively delivered to customers 

3) To increase customer satisfaction from our products and services

Targets

The Group conducted a benchmarking survey in FY2018 as a measure of our standing against competitors, 

which further provided insights to areas that can be improved. On average, 600 survey participants were 

picked at random to rate service-related aspects such as service efficiency, courtesy of staff, quality of food 

and beverage, affordability, variety, cleanliness, seat availability, ambience and convenience of location. The 

information gathered from this survey enabled us to improve our service quality by focusing on the key 

service-related aspects that are important to our customers.

Performance

Overall, Koufu is pleased to share that we have achieved more than 70% for our Mystery Shopper Programme 

in FY2019. The audit identified some gaps in our employees’ customer service standards. Proper guidance and 

training interventions were then planned and implemented.

Case Study: Mystery Shopper Audits

At Koufu, we engage the Mystery Shoppers twice 

a year to conduct audits on tenants in terms of 

customer service and payment processes. These 

Mystery Shoppers will then score the tenants 

based on a set of customer service criteria from 

the beginning till the end of transaction. Then, 

these scores are consolidated and shared to 

outlets to allow tenants to review and improve at 

the next round.

Our Workforce Profile 

As Koufu strives towards our mission statement “Better People”, we seek to ensure that our workforce is 

resilient in numbers to adequately support our business expansion. This year, our permanent5 employee 

numbers rose by 15.4% from 1,276 in FY2018 to 1,473 in FY2019. There were no significant variations6 on a 

month to month basis in our employee numbers for both FY2018 and FY2019. 

Being in the F&amp;B industry, we also engage a significant number of workers who are not employees to support 

Koufu’s operations, comprising largely of cleaning services and tenant operations. As of FY2019, we engaged 

574 cleaners and 1,968 workers of tenants, an overall increase of about 3.1% from 555 cleaners and 1,910 

tenant employees in FY2018.

Active Employee Engagement

Why It Is Important

An engaged employee refers to one who has the ability and is committed to contribute to the 

success of the organisation. Higher employee satisfaction leads to higher productivity, which leads 

to increased customer satisfaction – a key contributor to the continuing success of our Group.

Practices

To ensure that our remuneration packages remain attractive and competitive, we benchmark 

our salary packages against the Singapore National Employers Federation (“SNEF”) salary and 

benefits data. 

To ensure our employees are actively engaged, we provide skill enhancement programmes, 

incentives and platforms for employees to voice out their feedback as shown below. 

Policy

Koufu believes that actively engaging our employees 

and the effort put in towards understanding them can 

enhance their overall level of satisfaction working for 

the Group. As such, our employee engagement policy 

is designed to help our employees grow individually 

and professionally while remaining committed to the 

growth of our organization.

Chinese New Year

As an annual routine, Koufu had invited all outlet staff 

to join a fun-filled CNY get-together session at our 

Head Office. Activities such as karaoke, lucky draw 

and lo hei were arranged to celebrate the Lunar 

Valentine’s Day

Valentine’s Day was made special with Do-it-

Yourself cookies where Koufu staff were able to 

show off their creativity and present it to their 

colleagues or loved ones.

Mid-Autumn Festival

During Mid-Autumn festival, Koufu greeted our 

employees with beautifully boxed mooncakes. Mid-

Autumn festival is a cultural tradition that is passed 

down from generations to enjoy mooncakes on this 

occasion with friends and family. Gifting mooncakes 

to loved ones is our form of exchanging well wishes.

Occupational Health and Safety

Why It Is Important

Safety is of utmost importance at Koufu, where the physical and mental well-being of our 

employees forms the crux of our operations and contributes to the success of our business. We 

are committed to ensuring a safe and healthy work environment for all. In this respect, Koufu has 

established our Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) handbook which includes Koufu’s policies, 

as well as, the respective roles and responsibilities, general safety precautions, measures and 

incident reporting procedures at premises within the Group’s control.

Practices

Workplace Safety and Health Management System(“WSHMS”)

Equipped with BizSAFE Level 4, Koufu has developed our WSH handbook with reference to 

the Singapore Standard SS506 Occupational Safety and Health Management System (“SS506”) 

standards. The Group’s occupational safety and health management system replicates 

the Plan-Do-Check-Act (“PDCA”) model (refer to Table 9) to ensure oversight over the 

management of workplace safety across our operations. Our WSHMS system covers Koufu’s 

employees and contractors working at Koufu’s premises. Our contractors have a specific set 

of requirements to comply with Koufu’s WSH rules and WSH Act at all times. Our contractors 

have to report any hazards or incidents to their supervisor and Koufu-in-charge if the hazard 

is located within Koufu’s premises.

Policy

Koufu is committed to excel in our workplace safety and health performance through 

inculcating a safety-first culture with the appropriate training and leadership development 

opportunities provided to our employees. Koufu also commits to implement safe practices 

and procedures that comply with the WSH Act and other relevant regulations. 

All employees and contractors are expected to comply and align with Koufu’s WSH policy.

Targets

Zero fatality and high-consequence work-related injury12 among employee and non-

employee workers13

!

12 High-consequence work-related injury is defined as work-related injury that results in a fatality or in an injury from which the 

worker cannot, does not, or is not expected to recover fully to pre-injury health status within 6 months.

13 Non-employee workers comprise cleaners and workers of our tenants.

Corporate Governance

Why It Is Important

At Koufu, we recognise that having good corporate governance is key to the sustainability of our 

business. We seek to ensure that our sustainability objectives and targets are aligned with the 

Group’s business strategy. The Board is committed to ensure that high standards of corporate 

governance are practised throughout the Group to protect the interest of our stakeholders and 

enhance shareholders’ value through the growth of the organisation.

Practices

Established by the Board, the Audit and Risk Management Committee (“ARMC”) is responsible 

for developing and monitoring the Group’s risk management framework covering policies and 

procedures, as well as, review the potential risks faced by the Group. 

All directors of the Group are also required to fulfil the minimum requirement of at least one 

training each year on matters related to corporate governance, either conducted by internal 

or external parties.

On an annual basis, the Group’s internal controls will undergo an internal audit performed 

by external consultants and separately, an external audit will be carried out by accredited 

independent auditors. For more information on corporate governance, please refer to the 

‘Corporate Governance’ section of Koufu’s Annual Report 2019.

Compliance with laws and regulations

To ensure that the Group complies with the laws and regulations of the countries that we 

operate in, our Group’s policies as shown above, are reviewed annually to ensure its relevance 

to current practices and legislations. Annually, the external auditors appointed by Koufu update 

the ARMC and the Board on revised or new regulations applicable to the Group. Internally, 

Koufu has assembled our own compliance assurance team (“CA Team”) headed by our COO 

and supported by our quality control officers. The CA team seeks to ensure compliance by 

conducting periodic surprise visits to each of our F&amp;B outlets and our central kitchens. To 

update the Board on regulatory compliance matters, our COO will report to the Board on 

a quarterly basis. In addition, Koufu provides a feedback channel for members of the public 

on our Group’s website at www.koufu.com.sg. This allows direct feedback to our Group and 

actions can be taken to continually improve our Group’s compliance performance.

Policy

As a commitment to our stance on a strong corporate governance, we have put in place 

various policies such as our code of conduct and ethics, whistle-blowing, monitoring trading 

activities, investor relations and dealing in securities policy, etc. For more information on our 

corporate governance related policies, please refer to the ‘Corporate Governance’ section of 

our Annual Report 2019.

Economic Performance

Why It Is Important

Good economic performance leads to better remuneration for employees, enhanced shared 

value for shareholders, sustainable business for suppliers, landlords, and tenants, value creation 

for customers, and stable tax income for governments. To thrive in this competitive food service 

industry, it is imperative for Koufu to take measured steps to sustain our reputation as one of the 

key food court management service providers in Singapore.

Practices

Building a Sustainable Business Model

To ensure a sustainable business model, our current multi-brand strategy is built on top of our 

traditional food court management business. This enables the expansion and development 

of our business on a wider-scale by targeting several market segments concurrently. Our 

multi-brand strategy allows us to capture more business opportunities with our differentiated 

focus on the delivery of diverse dining experiences for the tastes, preferences, budgets and 

occasions. This has thus contributed to the strong and perpetual growth of our customer base 

and market share, both locally and globally. In FY2019, we continued to witness a growth in 

the total number of outlets from 156 in FY2018 to 184 in FY2019, comprising both local and 

international outlets.

Ethics, Bribery and Corruption

Koufu takes a strong stand against corruption, with integrity being one of our core values. 

We have established our Code of Conduct which acts as the first line of defense against 

unethical and corruption acts. Koufu does not condone any fraud, corruption and other forms 

of unethical behaviour or conduct, and we urge all stakeholders to reach out to us at whistle-

blowing@koufu.com.sg if any of such matters come to your attention. All reports lodged will 

be assessed directly by the ARMC Chairman. Should internal stakeholders have any feedback 

or grievances, they are advised to reach out to their immediate area managers, or contact 

the HR personnel, CEO or Executive Director. In addition, to ensure that our suppliers and 

contractors are aware of our anti-corruption requirements, the Group’s procurement team 

will communicate these requirements to them during the negotiation phase.

Performance

Koufu is pleased to share that we have met our targets of zero confirmed cases of corruption and cases20 

involving significant fines and non-monetary sanctions in FY2019. In addition, we do not have any cases 

brought through dispute resolution mechanisms during this reporting period.

20  Excludes cases relating to food safety and hygiene. Please refer to the Food Safety and Hygiene section for more information.

Koufu has also been identified as an enterprise with a track record of growth and potential, coupled with 

the ambition to scale further and faster under the Scale-up SG programme. This programme is a 2.5-

year programme that helps selected local companies become leaders of their respective fields, who can 

significantly contribute to Singapore’s economy. As a pioneer of this programme, Koufu is committed to 

leverage on the resources provided to expand our operations in a rapid yet sustainable manner and create 

good job opportunities for our Singaporeans.

Managing Economic Performance

We seek to ensure that every management action is appropriately accounted for through key performance 

indicators tracked by the finance and procurement team accordingly. Some of these include outlet sales, gross 

profit margins and rate of rent renewal. Not forgetting that employees are key contributors to Koufu’s success, 

our employees are adequately remunerated for their efforts in helping the Group attain our economic goals.

Caring for our Community

Beyond the focus on building a sustainable business, corporate social responsibility has always been an 

integral part of Koufu’s mission since the inception of the Group. Koufu holds the strong belief that help needs 

to be extended, especially for the less fortunate and elderly, in order for the society to thrive and achieve 

betterment together.

With the aim to create positive impact on the society and talent development, Koufu actively gives back 

through selected outreach programmes and bursaries that support the same cause:

BETTER LIFE



• 

Share – A Bowl of Rice: An annual event where 

Koufu partners with distinguished Singapore 

artist, Mr Tan Kay Nguan, to raise funds for the 

less fortunate community through the charity 

sale of delicately created art paintings using rice 

grains and acrylic paint. 

• 

Sun Love Home: Koufu regularly visits our adopted 

charity – Sun Love Home, which provides care to 

intellectually-infirmed individuals. On occasions 

such as Chinese New Year, Mid-Autumn Festival 

and Christmas, staff and their families bring along 

treats and spend quality time with the residents, 

engaging them in a myriad of activities to spread 

festive cheers all around.

• 

Koufu Endowed Bursary: In 2019, Koufu has 

agreed to gift $1,000,000 in aggregate to Nanyang 

Technological University (the “University”) over a 

period of two years in support of ASEAN students 

with financial needs and who wish to pursue an 

undergraduate degree with the University.

• 

R&amp;B Tea X APSN CSR Event: As part of R&amp;B 

Tea’s 2nd anniversary activities, our staff visited 

the students of the Association for Persons with 

Special Needs (APSN) at their Katong Campus. 

Through a fun-filled day of interaction and tea 

brewing, we brought a smile to the faces of each 

and every beneficiary.

Listed as one of the Singapore 1000 and SME 

1000 – Top 1000 companies and small medium 

enterprises in Singapore based on financial 

indicators such as revenue, net profit, return on 

equity and overseas revenue – the Group has been 

featured on The SME Magazine by the Business 

Times in November 2018. Through this publication, 

we are humbled to announce that we will continue 

to innovate and automate our processes via the 

increased use of technology throughout our 

business and operations, to differentiate ourselves

technology initiatives include the self-ordering 

and payment kiosks, smart tray return robots and

Performance

Koufu is pleased to share that we have achieved our target of increasing our food court and F&amp;B retail presence 

in Singapore and internationally in FY2019. We have grown our total number of outlets by 28 which include 

food courts, coffee shops, F&amp;B stalls, F&amp;B kiosks as well as full service restaurants. In FY2019, Koufu is proud to 

share that we have an increased economic value retained largely due to increased economic value generated.
