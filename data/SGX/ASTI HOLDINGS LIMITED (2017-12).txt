Board Statement     

The Board of Directors is pleased to present ASTI Holdings Limited (“ASTI”)’s inaugural sustainability 

report.  

 

The Board is responsible for maintaining an oversight of the development and implementation of 

sustainability strategies and strives to integrate sustainability principles into business policies and 

practices. The Board oversees the selection of ASTI’s material topics as well as monitors and manages 

issues relating to these topics regularly. ASTI has a sustainability committee that supports the Board in 

these sustainability endeavours.  

 

Companies in many industries, including the semiconductor manufacturing industry, are seeing the 

value that sustainable practices bring to their business and the manufacturing industry as a whole are 

recognising the importance of focusing on and reporting sustainability issues such as eco-efficiency 

and occupational health and safety. 

 

As a world-class manufacturer of automated backend equipment, we strive to continually evolve to 

respond to the changing landscape of the industry in order to remain successful and grow our 

business. We place honesty and quality customer service at the forefront of our business and these 

principles extend throughout our activities, from providing our employees with a safe and positive 

working environment, to being honest and transparent in our dealings with our customers and 

suppliers and carefully monitoring our adherence to global and industrial standards and guidelines.  

 

Our strong commitment to ethical business practices and product quality guide everything that we do 

and we believe these principles are of particular significance to our profitability and long-term 

success. Therefore, sustainability will remain a priority as we move forward in the years ahead.

Sustainability Governance 

Successful integration of sustainability into our business operations requires strong leadership and an 

effective governance framework. At ASTI, we have a robust governance structure and various 

procedures to manage the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that are important to 

us and our stakeholders.  

 

Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) 

The Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) is represented by senior members of the Administration, 

Finance, Human Resources and Information Technology divisions at ASTI. The role of the SSC is to 

provide advice and assistance to the Board in ensuring that policies and procedures in relation to ESG 

issues are aligned with ASTI’s business strategy. The SSC is supported by a Sustainability Task Force 

(STF), which is responsible for driving sustainability initiatives and programmes across ASTI.  

Monitoring and Benchmarking 

 

We monitor and evaluate our sustainability performance against our peer companies in order to 

improve our own performance and to identify areas of improvement. Once performance gaps have 

been identified, we conduct a review of our approach to sustainability so that we are in a better 

position to execute targeted actions to address the gaps.

Assessing Materiality 

It is important that we focus our sustainability efforts in areas that are of most importance to us as a 

business and areas where our stakeholders are most concerned. We engage with stakeholders on an 

ongoing basis and we use these interactions to better understand the ESG issues that may be of most 

concern to them. Our approach to stakeholder engagement is presented in the following table, which 

includes information on our key stakeholders and how we regularly engage with them:  

 

 

As well as considering stakeholder priorities, we reflected on ESG issues that are material to us based 

on their significance to our business. With the help of an independent consultant, we undertook a 

materiality assessment involving members of the senior management team from ASTI in FY2017. The 

identification of material issues involved conducting research on global and local trends in our 

industry, material topics identified by our peers and industry best practices.  

 

We strive to manage, measure and report on issues that are material to us and our stakeholders. In 

FY2017, we focused on the following material issues:

Environment 

Energy and Emissions  

 

In the equipment manufacturing industry, energy consumption is responsible for a significant portion 

of operating costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The industry faces the ongoing challenge of 

managing the impacts of rising energy costs and climate risks. Therefore, reducing energy 

consumption and GHG emissions is integral to improving our efficiency and supporting the transition 

to a low carbon and sustainable future. We strive to adopt sustainable practices and implement 

initiatives that focus on reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions, while improving our 

energy efficiency and lowering costs.  

 

At ASTI, a substantial amount of energy is used for equipment manufacturing, cleanroom heating, 

ventilation, and air conditioning. We have implemented robust systems to manage and monitor our 

energy consumption to ensure that our resources are used efficiently and that our operational costs 

are kept to a minimum. Our utility consumption patterns are tracked and monitored each month to 

make sure that our operations are as energy efficient as possible.  

 

Several measures have been put in place to reduce energy consumption, including:  

• 

Installing an auto-timer in the air-compressor room at the manufacturing site;  

• 

Conducting regular maintenance checks on equipment, including air compressors to 

ensure optimal performance; 

• 

Maintaining the air-conditioning within our office at a temperature of 24oC; and 

• 

Encouraging employees to turn off lights and air-conditioners when not in use.     

 

In FY2017, ASTI’s total electricity consumption was 287,798 kilowatt hours (kWh), an increase of 8.8% 

compared to 264,428 kWh in FY2016. Similarly, the electricity intensity grew from 276 kWh/m2 in 

FY2016 to 300 kWh/m2 in FY2017. The increase is attributed to a higher production of manufacturing 

equipment. There was a 7.7% increase in our GHG emissions from electricity use, from 1121 tonnes 

carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in FY2016 to 1212 tCO2e in FY2017. Nonetheless, the GHG 

emissions intensity from electricity use rose slightly from 0.12 tCO2e/m2 in FY2016 to 0.13 tCO2e/m2 in 

FY2017.  

 

1 2 CO2 emissions released were calculated using conversion factors of 0.4192 kg CO2/kWh and 0.4237 kg 

CO2/kWh – Singapore’s Average Operating Margin (OM) Grid Emission Factors (GEFs) in 2017 and 2016, 

respectively.

Our People 

Talent Attraction and Retention  

 

We attribute a great part of our success to the value we place on the technical knowledge and 

operational know-how of our employees. Each of our employees plays a valuable part in providing the 

highest quality products and services to our customers to ensure that we stay ahead of competition. 

Therefore, the hiring and retention of talent remains our top priority.  

As of 31 December 2017, ASTI had 633 employees and all of them were based in Singapore. More 

than half of ASTI’s employees were within the 30-to-50-year age group. Male and female employees 

accounted for 43% and 57% of ASTI’s workforce, respectively. In FY2017, our average monthly 

turnover rate was 1.2% while our average monthly new hire rate was 0.5%.  

We collect, track and monitor our human resources (HR) data, including overtime, vacation balances 

and the number of training days on a regular basis.

Benefits provided to our full-time employees include health care coverage, parental leave and 

retirement plans.  We also strive to ensure that sufficient benefit coverage is provided to part-time 

employees. Exit interviews are conducted to allow us to identify reasons why employees leave the 

Group. Through the interviews, we gather feedback and comments from employees, which give us 

key insights into how we can improve our ability to recruit and retain talent. 

Training and Education 

 

At ASTI, we strive to meet current and future skill requirements for our business operations as well as 

to enhance the personal and professional development of our employees. Whereas our employees 

tend to learn many skills they need on-the-job, succession planning is one of our most important 

focuses. We aim to groom and train individuals that show promise and dedication and invest time and 

effort in order for them to take on more responsibility within the company.   

Furthermore, we provide all new employees with training under the supervision of experienced 

employees. The training needs and progress of our employees are monitored regularly, allowing them 

to take ownership of their professional development.  

Occupational Health and Safety 

 

Safeguarding the health and safety of our employees is essential to achieving long-term success and 

furthering our commitment to sustainability. We recognise that it is our responsibility to ensure a safe 

and healthy working environment for our employees and to address potential health and safety risks.  

 

ASTI has a workplace health and safety committee to promote health and safety initiatives and 

programmes in the workplace and to ensure that health and safety issues are adequately addressed 

throughout the Group. The committee consists of management and employee representatives 

working together to identify any health and safety issues in the workplace. The committee holds 

meetings on a regular basis and provides recommendations to improve health, safety and working 

conditions at ASTI. We also have established processes to measure and monitor our occupational 

health and safety performance. 

 

Safe work practices, such as implementing standard operating procedures and providing emergency 

response training to our employees, are adopted to reduce the risk of accidents, injuries and health 

hazards to our employees and contractors. We require all our employees and contractors to comply 

with standard safety practices and requirements that are listed in our safety handbook. All our 

employees receive appropriate health and safety training to ensure that they are able to identify 

common hazards in the workplace and ways to deal with them.  

 

Machines, equipment and work areas within our premises are inspected regularly to identify any risks 

to employee health and safety. We also review the conditions of the work environment and other 

relevant work practices in order to identify foreseeable hazards and to monitor the effectiveness of 

local risk control implemented.

We ensure that fire extinguishers are placed in various locations within our premises and that training 

is provided to employees to use them. Inspections on fire extinguishers are conducted periodically to 

ensure that they function properly. Our employees and occupants are expected to follow the 

emergency evacuation plans and procedures in each building during an emergency situation. In 

addition, fire drills are held twice a year in order to ensure that our employees are familiar with 

emergency procedures during a fire.  

 

We have put in place measures to reduce noise and air pollution within and outside our 

manufacturing plants. For example, compressed air guns in our manufacturing plants are used in 

short intervals and regular maintenance and inspections of the compressors are carried out in order 

to cut noise and air pollution. We also ensure that signs are posted in areas where hearing protection 

is mandatory to reduce employees’ exposure to excessive noise. There were zero reported workplace 

fatalities and zero major accidents among our employees in FY2017.

Our Suppliers 

Supplier Assessment 

 

We consider our suppliers as important partners that contribute to our sustainability goals and 

business success. Since we manufacture semiconductor equipment, our raw materials are sourced 

from various suppliers that meet our requirements in terms of sustainable practices, quality and 

pricing. All our suppliers are expected to produce top-quality raw materials and products and conduct 

their business in an ethical, legal and sustainable manner that is consistent with our values and 

standards.  

 

We ensure that only the best raw materials are used in the production process by putting in place a 

stringent selection process and procurement standards to select, monitor, audit and manage our 

suppliers. Approved suppliers from which we procure materials for our production of equipment are 

included in a list and their performance is monitored on a regular basis. Suppliers that fail to meet the 

expected 

quality 

and 

delivery 

requirement 

will 

be 

removed 

from 

the 

list.  

In FY2017, no new suppliers were engaged, and therefore evaluated in terms of their ability to supply 

materials according to our requirements.  

 

We require our suppliers to comply with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive, 

which includes a CE-marking directive. Our suppliers are also required to meet the requirements of 

relevant laws and regulations.

Regulatory Compliance 

Compliance with Laws and Regulations  

 

We believe that good corporate governance practices are about conducting business in a transparent 

and ethical manner for the benefit of all stakeholders. We strive to comply with relevant laws, 

including environmental laws and socioeconomic regulations by having various procedures and risk 

management standards in place. All our employees are required to act with integrity and to conduct 

business in accordance with the highest ethical standards.   

Environmental Compliance  

 

We are committed to complying with all laws and regulations in the places where we operate. In 

Singapore, we are required to adhere to laws and regulations set by the National Environmental 

Agency (NEA), the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). A breach 

of any law or regulation will significantly inhibit our ability to operate. 

In FY2017, there were no incidents of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations. 

Anti-Corruption  

At ASTI, all forms of bribery and corruption are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. All our 

employees are required to abide by the Code of Conduct and policies on corruption within the Group. 

Each employee has access to the Code of Conduct, which includes information on workplace ethics 

and the whistle-blowing policy.   

We have a whistle-blowing policy that provides our employees an opportunity to raise any concerns 

regarding suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest practices or other similar matters. Our employees 

are encouraged to report any suspicious practices or inappropriate activities in the workplace. All 

complaints will be dealt with by the Head of Human Resources (“HR”) and/or any member of the 

Executive Committee in a fair, respectful and timely manner. Appropriate disciplinary action will be 

taken towards employees who are found guilty of fraud, dishonesty or criminal conduct.  

In FY2017, there were zero incidents of non-compliance with anti-corruption laws and socioeconomic 

regulations.  

Information on ASTI’s corporate governance, compliance and risk management policies and practices 

can be found in Appendix 1 – Corporate Governance Report (pages 1 to 15) of the Annual Report.
