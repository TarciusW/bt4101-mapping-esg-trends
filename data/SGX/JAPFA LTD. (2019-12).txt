A MESSAGE FROM 

OUR CEO

Dear Stakeholders,

 

 

Sustainability is deeply rooted in the Company’s vision 

and in what we do every day, which is nourishing 

millions of people with affordable staple protein foods. 

Over time, more and more people across our Group 

have embraced sustainability in their daily activities. 

To emphasise this relentless progress, we chose 

Embracing Sustainability as the theme for our 2019 

sustainability report. 

As part of our sustainability journey, we aim to grow 

Japfa’s business in a responsible manner and positively 

impact all our stakeholders - from consumers and 

contract farmers to employees, shareholders and the 

community. Society faces many challenges, including 

malnutrition, food security  and climate change. Being 

an agri-food company dedicated to feeding the huge 

and growing population in emerging Asia, Japfa is in the 

unique position to contribute positively in addressing 

some of these challenges. We take this responsibility 

seriously because we can help improve the lives of 

millions of people. Our vision is clear: we want to grow 

together with our stakeholders and be prosperous.

We are aware of the importance of ensuring food security 

while preserving natural resources and ecosystems. 

Ultimately, we recognise the importance of sustainability 

for the long-term success of Japfa. As part of our 

industrialised business model, we aim at integrating 

sustainability in our operations and corporate culture. We 

seek better ways to improve our sustainability efforts by 

setting concrete goals, taking appropriate actions and 

continuously monitoring outcomes.

Our people understand the importance of adopting 

a sustainable approach in our farms and offices by 

implementing actions that positively impact our 

stakeholders. With this in mind, everyone works hand-

in-hand to achieve sustainable operations in every 

country that we operate in. 

As CEO, I cannot be prouder of our people and 

how many have taken ownership and promoted 

sustainability not only by implementing and driving the 

Group’s effort but also taking the initiative to come up 

with suggestions for improvement. Indeed, they are our 

Sustainability Champions. 

I take this opportunity to thank all employees who 

have supported the Group’s sustainability efforts. I 

also want to thank all stakeholders who share our 

sustainability vision and are working alongside us to 

make improvement across the value chain and in the 

communities within our markets. 

As I present our Sustainability Report 2019, let us never 

stop thinking on what more we can do. Together we 

can make a real difference.

A Message from Our CEO


A MESSAGE FROM OUR 

SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE

Dear Stakeholders,

Over the years, Japfa has continuously enhanced 

its sustainability processes. In 2017, we started 

by monitoring and reporting our sustainability 

practices.  In 2018, a Sustainability Committee 

and Sustainability Pillars were established to align 

Japfa’s practices across the Group. 

Backed by the commitment of the top 

management, Japfa has embraced sustainability 

more fully across the organisation. We have 

gradually developed, introduced and implemented 

systems aimed at monitoring and managing 

sustainability activities first in Indonesia then 

also in Vietnam, India and Myanmar. We also see 

a greater number of people taking ownership of 

sustainability. Those who demonstrated increasing 

engagement and interest in these strategies were 

identified as our Sustainability Champions to drive 

our efforts and promote sustainability initiatives 

across our daily operations.

In 2019, we have implemented many initiatives to 

further align our operations to the UN Sustainable 

Development Goals. Our Human Resource (“HR”) 

department played a pivotal role in promoting 

social and environmental system and initiatives, 

including the roll out of occupational health and 

safety practices across the Group’s operations and 

environmental protection policies in relation to 

wastewater treatment plants. Our HR team has also 

worked with our Information Technology department 

to develop the Japfa Sustainability Reporting System, 

a sustainability platform to monitor the environmental, 

social and financial performance of the Group. To 

understand more about the environmental impact of 

our products and operations, we took the initiative 

to conduct a Life Cycle Assessment for several of our 

operational units in Indonesia. Our Aquaculture team 

has been an exemplary Sustainability Champion by 

implementing environmental initiatives autonomously, 

and this is a motivation to other units within the Group to 

do the same.

On behalf of the Sustainability Committee, I am proud 

to present to you this sustainability report that aims 

at giving a fair and informative progress update of 

our efforts throughout the year. We believe that 

there are still challenges ahead which we will strive 

to overcome as we continue to make improvements 

in our sustainability efforts. I especially thank our 

Sustainability Champions for all their hard work and 

contribution – it is through the collaborative effort of 

each of you that Japfa is able to do its part to make 

the world a better place. 

We continuously endeavour to take our sustainability 

initiatives to the next level, and we hope that all 

stakeholders will support us along this journey.  

Thank you.

ABOUT OUR 

COMPANY

Japfa Ltd is a leading, pan-Asian, 

industrialised agri-food company 

dedicated to feeding emerging 

Asia with essential proteins. For 

almost five decades, we have been 

able to grow in scale and become 

leaders in multiple protein 

segments by embracing an 

integrated industrial approach 

to livestock and food production 

across the entire value chain

[GRI 102]

Japfa Ltd (“Japfa”, “the Company”, or together with its 

subsidiaries, “the Group”) is a leading, pan-Asian, industrialised 

agri-food company dedicated to feeding emerging Asia with 

essential proteins. We are a public company listed on the 

Singapore Stock Exchange. 

Headquartered in Singapore, we employ over 40,000 people 

across an integrated network of modern farming, processing 

and distribution facilities in Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, India 

and China. We specialise in producing quality dairy, protein 

staples (poultry, beef, swine and aquaculture) and packaged 

food that nourish millions of people. 

For almost 50 years, we have grown in scale to become 

leaders in multiple protein foods, by embracing an integrated 

industrialised approach to farming and food production across 

the entire value chain. Our large-scale standardised operations 

allow us to consistently produce high quality proteins and 

to replicate our business model across different markets and 

protein types. 

In addition, our business is vertically integrated from animal 

feed production and breeding to commercial farming and 

food processing. This not only creates opportunities for us 

to capture value at different points in the agri-food chain but 

also provides our customers with greater food security and 

traceability. 

We pride ourselves on our use of superior breeds and a 

sophisticated approach to animal husbandry, animal health, 

nutrition and welfare – all of which reinforce the quality of our 

products and the high production yields. We place a strong 



focus on biosecurity with stringent operating procedures, 

while building strategic alliances with global leaders in 

breeding research.

Today, we are one of the two largest poultry producers 

in Indonesia1. We have also replicated our industrialised, 

vertically integrated business model for our operations. On 

top of this, we have successfully replicated our Indonesian 

dairy business in China, where we are now amongst the 

leading producers of premium raw milk in the country, 

commanding one of the highest milk yields. Our raw milk in 

Indonesia and China is also of the highest quality in terms 

of nutritional standards. 

We leverage on the high quality of our raw materials to 

produce premium and mass market consumer branded 

food products under leading brands such as So Good, as 

well as Greenfields, which is the top fresh pasteurised milk 

and stirred yoghurt brand in Indonesia2.

Given the growing affluence of our target middle- and 

lower-income consumer groups, we expect protein food 

consumption in these markets to rise. As one of the most 

competitive and efficient producers, we are focused 

on tapping the growing animal protein consumption in 

the five emerging economies that we operate in, where 

more than 40% of the world’s total population lives. 

We plan to forge ahead with our strategy of expanding 

across multiple protein segments in these high growth 

emerging Asian markets by replicating our integrated 

industrialised business model. [GRI 102-1, GRI 102-7,

Chapter 01 – About Our Company


Our Business Segments

[GRI 102-2, GRI 102-4, GRI 102-6]

Our animal protein segment consists of poultry, swine, beef 

and aquaculture. For almost 50 years, we have consistently 

adopted an industrialised supply chain model which has 

enabled us to become market leaders in multiple proteins. 

Animal Protein - PT Japfa Comfeed Indonesia Tbk 

In Indonesia, we run our animal protein operations through 

IDX-listed PT Japfa Comfeed Indonesia Tbk (PT Japfa Tbk), 

our 52.4%-owned subsidiary.

Under this business segment, we produce quality animal 

proteins, namely poultry, beef and aquaculture, and we are 

also a large-scale producer of specially formulated animal 

feed. We partner with world-leading genetics companies 

to breed high performance parent livestock in modern farm 

facilities using advanced management systems.

As the 2nd largest integrated industrialised farming 

company for poultry1, we produce premium-quality animal 

feed for our own poultry operations and for sale to third 

parties. Our feed brands, Comfeed and Benefeed, are 

among the most recognised in Indonesia due to their 

consistent quality and effective feed conversion ratios (i.e. 

total amount of feed required per bird kilogramme). We 

also deliver high performance Day-Old-Chicks (“DOCs”) in 

collaboration with world leading poultry genetics company 

Aviagen.

Dairy

We pioneered the first “grass-to-glass” vertically integrated 

modern dairy in Indonesia in 1997. Now, we own, in 

Indonesia and China, nine world-class fully operational 

dairy farms and one processing plant that are designed and 

equipped to meet and exceed international standards in 

productivity and biosecurity.  

In China, Japfa produces premium raw milk mainly for sale to 

leading dairy companies. Our premium raw milk consistently 

tops the market in terms of quality, nutrition and safety and 

our Holstein cattle produces one of the highest milk yields.

In Indonesia, we are the largest dairy farm operations by 

volume of premium fresh milk produced and sell a range of 

dairy products including yogurts, UHT milk and premium 

cheeses.

In addition, our milk and dairy products are exported to 

Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, 

Brunei, Hong Kong and Myanmar where they can be found 

at major retailers, leading hotels, restaurants and more.

Consumer Food

Backed by our strong expertise in agri-food production, 

we are a pioneer provider of protein-based processed food 

in Indonesia. Our downstream consumer food products 

are manufactured for the most part using our own animal 

proteins as raw materials, and this enables us to better ensure 

consistency in the quality and reliability of our products. As 

such, the consumer food products we produce are well trusted 

and widely enjoyed by families across Indonesia.

Our So Good and So Nice brands are leading brands in 

Indonesia for processed meats, such as chicken nuggets, meat 

balls and shelf-stable sausages. We also manufacture and 

market small-pack UHT liquid milk under the Real Good brand 

in Indonesia.

We have been publishing sustainability reports annually 

since 2017. This is our third report, covering the reporting 

period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. Our last 

report was published on 17 April 2019. Our previous reports 

cover the poultry operations in Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, 

India. For this report, we have widened our scope to include 

our aquaculture operations in Indonesia. [GRI 102-49, GRI 

102-50, GRI 102-51, GRI 102-52]

Year 2019 marks the launch of our sustainability platform, 

Japfa Sustainability Reporting System (JSRS), that captures 

traceable, validated data for the creation of this report. This 

system has been fully implemented throughout Indonesia in 

2019 and we target to rollout to Vietnam, Myanmar, and India 

in 2020. 

The Sustainability Report is produced as a form of public 

communication and acts as an internal audit and assessment 

system. This report has been prepared in accordance with 

the GRI Standards: Core option. GRI’s Food Processing 

Sector Guidelines is also used for our sector disclosure 

requirements. GRI stands for Global Reporting Initiative, it is 

an international independent standards organisation that 



helps businesses, governments and other organisations 

understand and communicate their impacts on issues such 

as climate change, human rights and corruption. We also 

include the disclosure figures in the relevant sections of this 

report to improve readability. A GRI Content Index is provided 

as a list of disclosures at the end of this report. [GRI 102-54]

This report is published in English and is available for 

download at Japfa’s website, www.japfa.com. We welcome 

any stakeholders’ input and feedback. We also accept

Key Priorities for 2019

[GRI 102-46]

To understand what matters most to our company, first we 

need to listen to the voice of our stakeholders. We applied 

ten reporting principles to define the content and quality of 

the report. The four reporting principles that must be met 

when defining the content of the report are stakeholder 

inclusiveness, the context of sustainability, materiality and 

completeness. The quality of the report is governed by the 

remaining six reporting principles of accuracy, balance, 

clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness. 

The process begins with an internal meeting of the 

Sustainability Committee and the management to identify 

the materiality aspects for the report. This is followed 

by focus group meetings, circulated questionnaires to 

the Poultry &amp; Aquaculture Operations management, as 

well as various departments such as Human Resources, 

Finance and Accounting, Social Responsibility, Legal 

and Registration and Japfa Foundation. Their feedback 

represents the voice of internal stakeholders. We also 

conducted surveys to get input from our external 

stakeholders including our clients, vendors, producers, 

local communities, government and Non-Government 

Organisations (NGOs).

Using quantitative analysis, we constructed our materiality 

matrix and defined our topics for this year’s report.

266 internal &amp; external stakeholders 

participated in our materiality 

survey. There were 13 material topics 

which we focused on in 2019

We applied ten reporting principles based on the 

Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting 

Standard to define the content and quality of the 

report

PEOPLE 

DEVELOPMENT

Sustainability is deeply rooted 

in the Company’s vision and in 

what we do every day, which is 

nourishing millions of people 

with affordable staple protein 

foods. Over time, more and 

more people across our Group 

have embraced sustainability in 

their daily activities.

[GRI 401, GRI 403, GRI 404, GRI 405]

We truly believe our people are the key drivers in advancing 

sustainability throughout our operations. Initiated by a 

commitment from our top management and driven by our 

Human Resources (“HR”) department, our employees across 

units and departments are motivated and empowered to 

improve the environmental and social conditions of our 

operations and also our surroundings. 

Having been established for almost 50 years, our 

organisation’s knowledge has been truly embedded in 

our people, and is our most valuable asset. We believe that 

preserving this knowledge further is critical to maintain both 

our business success and sustainability at the same time. 

Our HR approach is “To always have good people to lead 

Japfa’’ through three pillars, which are retaining employees, 

driving performance, and sustaining our future. 

Every country we operate in has distinct cultures, needs, and 

challenges. The strategies implemented in each country are 

localised and customised according to the different local 

challenges and needs, on the premise that no single solution 

can apply for all. In Indonesia, focusing on succession 

planning is essential to promote diversed demographics 

in the workplace and accomodate different perspectives 

across generations. In Vietnam, talent attraction is our 

focus as we face challenges to attract people to work in 

the agricultural areas. In India, attracting young talent and 

promoting inclusiveness and diversity are the adaptive 

solutions against the social issues related to women 

empowerment and local farmers. While in Myanmar, the 

knowledge gap between senior and junior management 

leads to the urgency for further developing employees’ 

skills through career progression programmes and cross-

functional strategy. Again, all of these attempts should be 

in line with our approach, which is “To always have good 

people to lead Japfa”. 

We identified 7 Japfa Employee Values through 

collaboration between employees in division and corporate 

units. These values, known as “DOLPHIN”, are what binds us 

together in our vision of Growing Towards Mutual Prosperity. 

As we value and develop our own people, we realise that 

we are moving closer to our sustainability goals while also 

increasing our business performance.

Management

[GRI 403-2, GRI 404-2]

In the modern world of digital transformation, new 

ways of working and organisational requirements have 

changed how HR works. The availability of communication 

technology demands rapid decisions which require 

team-oriented platforms to facilitate collaboration and 

communication. Japfa has developed a digitalised system 



We embrace technology and digital 

transformation to support our transition 

towards more sustainable practices. Focusing 

on innovation, we apply nimble methodologies 

in managing our people, identifying talents and 

preserving knowledge

of HR management as a strategic advantage in response 

to this challenge. The ongoing digital transformation in 

our HR process is incorporated in our SAP Human Capital 

Management (SAP HCM).

We have developed the Japfa Sustainability Reporting System (JSRS) to 

help us gather the organisation’s OHS, environmental and 

employment-related data from all divisions and operational units to 

generate a sustainability report in accordance with GRI standards.

This year, we are proud to have implemented all stages of the JSRS system 

across most of divisions of Tbk’s Poultry and Japfa Aquaculture, while other 

countries, namely Vietnam, Myanmar and India, target to fully implement 

the system by 2020.

Japfa Ltd Sustainability Report 2019


Japfa conducts a wide range of training and career 

development programmes to ensure consistency in the 

standards and skills acquired by our younger employees or 

talents. We also provide full time recruitment opportunities 

to our high-performing contract workers. 

In Indonesia, we recognise the challenge to promote more 

age-varied demographics in the workplace. Certain critical 

roles that have been identified in our company require 

regeneration to embrace broader perspective and creativity 

in decision-making. Thus, we have a succession planning 

programme in place to ensure that every employee gets 

the opportunity for career progression, thus ensuring a 

more diverse workplace. 

In Vietnam, we face challenges in finding young talent to 

work as agricultural technical assistants. Young people are 

more interested in other industries such as banking, oil and 

gas, and IT, and this poses us challenges to find suitable 

young candidates. In 2019, Japfa Vietnam developed plans 

for regeneration and succession planning in order to attract 

more young talents to work in the agricultural field, thus 

promoting inclusivity in the workplace. 

Also in India, talent attraction and retention is a challenge 

in the agriculture industry, especially in poultry. With the 

fast-moving developments in India, people are increasingly 

attracted to IT, banking and other more popular 

sectors. Though Japfa is an established company with 

long-standing core values, finding the right talent to suit 

these values can be challenging, especially for technical 

roles. We have engaged with several universities through 

job fairs to attract talented students with agricultural 

academic backgrounds. Other platforms that we use to 

provide job opportunities include employee referrals, social 

media, and job portals.

Inclusive diversity also means gender equality, women’s 

empowerment and being respectful to one another. In 

Vietnam, we realise that women play an important role 

in nurturing our chickens in poultry farms. Those with 

experience in housework and raising children, are better 

able to look after, feed, and handle our chickens with 

great care. Our focus this year is to empower women by 

providing them more opportunities to work at our own 

farms, and helping them contribute more income to their 

families. 

In Myanmar, women also play an important role in our 

development. However, limited employment opportunities 

and the lack of skills are often cited as the biggest 

obstacles in hiring them. In Japfa Myanmar, we strive to 

empower women by employing up to 60% female workers 

in most of our breeding, hatchery, and commercial farm 

operations. These jobs allow women to make decisions,

earn incomes to improve their families’ financial conditions. To 

address the gap between higher and lower level management, 

we implemented a cross-functional strategy and map out 

career paths for employees to further develop their skills and 

promote career progression in the organisation. 

Advanced technology and automation are implemented in 

our Myanmar feedmill operations to improve efficiency. This 

transition of manual labour into automation has required Japfa 

to modify their labour requirements. During 2019, there was 

a labour reduction of up to 313 people. Proper management 

following the regulation was conducted and carried out 

smoothly and fairly as the Group gradually replaced unskilled 

labour with skilled labour. We also provide internal training

In India, issues on sexual harassment are a social risk that 

receives a lot of attention. In Japfa India, we have initiatives 

to combat sexual harassment, ranging from training and 

communications to the development of a formal committee 

as mandated by the national government. These initiatives 

are implemented accross all units and roles to include 

salespeople and service providers. While the workers at our 

feed mill units are primarily men, it is still important for us to 

ensure that everyone is well-informed about how to behave 

respectfully towards women, whether they are co-workers or 

external parties.

Training And Development

[GRI 102-41, GRI 404-1, GRI 404-2] 

Our development programme has been designed 

specifically to equip our employees with the skills 

they require to develop their careers

In addition to standard training provided across the Group, 

some training programmes are provided specific to the 

conditions in the various countries. 

In Indonesia, we provide a pre-pension programme for 

employees at all levels in the form of training, which is held 

twice a year in Jakarta and Surabaya.

In 2019, our Aquaculture reopened the Training Centre 

in Banyuwangi to provide improved development 

programmes for our employees. We provided training 

programmes for our employees in collaboration with 

Universiti Sabah, Malaysia and Kindai University, Japan, 

to prepare them in facing future operational challenges 

through joint research and development as well as 

practical training. Currently, there are four Aquaculture 

Management Trainees attending a 9-month on-the-job 

training course in Kindai University, Japan, after the 

completion of an earlier programme at Universiti Malaysia 

Sabah for three months.

Our further commitment to learning and development is 

demonstrated through the ongoing development of the 

Japfa Training Centre. We target to  complete this project 

in 2020. At the moment, the construction of employee 

housing and new infrastructure is still underway.

In Myanmar, we have mapped out a career path for 

each employee. The mapping was conducted through a 

personality assessment, coaching and mentoring. Each 

employee’s career path is consistently tracked, followed 

with tailored recommendations and advice on how to 

achieve their personal career goals.  We also have a cross-

functional strategy to further develop the skills of our 

people. 

Starting this year, we set up a career path for each 

employee based on their personality assessment, coaching 

and mentoring. The range of training programmes 

avaialble to our employees includes:

Foundation Programme 

(FP)

To equip them with principles in management, 

leadership, cross functional knowledge and a 

“transformative” mindset

Middle Management Programme 

(MPP) 

To broaden their knowledge and strengthen their 

abilities to take on responsibilities at managerial level. 

Materials provided in MMP include Human Resources 

Management (HRM), Marketing (MKT), Finance 

(FIN), Project Management (PJM) and Operational 

Excellence (OPE)

Senior Management Programme 

(SMP)

To improve their capabilities in strategic thinking, 

analysing the business competitive environment and 

also market positioning and strengthening, they have 

to attend 4 training clusters as follows:

• 

Cluster 1: Business Acumen and Financial 

Intelligence 

• 

Cluster 2: Strategic Thinking and Execution

• 

Cluster 3: Driving Innovation and Change

• 

Cluster 4: Personal Leadership and Influence

This year, we implemented advanced technology and 

automation in our Myanmar feed mill operations that resulted 

in labour reduction due to modified labour requirements and 

improved efficiency. The reduction was conducted according 

to regulations and carried out smoothly and fairly. We also 

conducted training programmes to help our employees 

upgrade their skills.

In Myanmar, we support the right of collective bargaining for 

our employees and workers. While in Vietnam, we support 

the employees’ right to freedom of collective bargaining 

and association. Most of our employees are members of the 

labour union (100% in Vietnam Consumer Food, 95% 

in South Vietnam Poultry and 93% in North Vietnam 

Poultry). In Indonesia, we established a Bipartite 

Cooperation Institution in accordance with applicable 

laws in the form of a Communication Forum (FORKOM) 

to facilitate better communication, consultation and 

discussion between managers and employees. Relationship 

issues, jobs, and grievance are the common topics 

discussed in this forum. A similar forum is conducted in 

Myanmar in the form of “Division Conversation” or town hall 

meetings with senior management. The topics discussed in 

this forum include relationship issues, jobs, and grievances 

with the aim to foster an open communication in the 

workplace. This will increase employees’ productivity and 

satisfaction, which are key to a sustainable business. We 

have a bipartite agreement with our employees, which 

enables them to discuss diverse topics across hierarchies. 

This forum is also useful for management to communicate 

regulation and policies to employees. 

We also have “Japfa Conversation” as a forum for senior 

leaders and talents to converse in a formal yet friendly 

manner in order to improve communication, facilitate 

engagement and assist relationship building so that 

employees are motivated to continue progressing their 

careers.

Japfa Ltd Sustainability Report 2019


In Indonesia, our OHS system has been implemented and 

internally audited in all units, including poultry feed, poultry 

breeding, and aquaculture. We target three poultry feed units 

in Padang, Cirebon, and Medan to obtain certification in 

2020 as outlined in Government Regulation No. 50 Year 2012 

regarding the Implementation of Occupational Safety and 

Health Management System. In 2019, we received certification 

from the Ministry of Manpower Indonesia for our OHS 

management system for our poultry feed in Padang. For other 

units, we internally measure their progress by incorporating 

the 166 criteria of OHS management system certification as 

part of our managers’ key performance indicators.

Internal training programmes are also provided beforehand 

to increase their competency in attaining OHS management 

system certification. Our aquaculture feed mills in Banyuwangi 

and Gresik also received zero-accident certification from 

the Ministry of Manpower Indonesia for their efforts in 

implementing a safe work environment. In India we also 

recorded zero accidents throughout this reporting period.

We were awarded OHS Personnel Certification by the Ministry 

of Manpower and another certification body in Indonesia as 

follows:

 • First Aid Officer Training

Implementing ratio of one certified for every one hundred 

workers.

In Indonesia, we also provide routine OHS training to our

Initiated by the Industrial Relations Department (OHSE 

Sub Department),  all HSE personnel from PT Japfa Tbk 

business units and subsidiaries in Indonesia gathered and 

discussed at PT Japfa Tbk HSE National Forum in Solo.

We aim to implement Behaviour-Based Safety (BBS) 

consistently in our business units. BBS is a method used 

for accident, injury and loss prevention at our workplace. 

It involves behaviour observation and unsafe activity 

detection, followed by interventions for behavioural 

change to achieve safe operations. Implementing BBS 

enables us to embed a culture of safety across our 

operations and at different levels of management, leading 

us to attain an improved employee and organisational 

performance.

In Vietnam, the OHS management system has been 

implemented in accordance with Vietnamese legislation on 

occupational health to ensure our employees’ occupational 

health and safety at the workplace. We conduct certified 

OHSAS training annually for our employees. During 

working hours, we equip our employees with personal 

protective equipment (PPE) along with warning signs 

for hazardous areas, slogans, and posters that remind 

them to stay safe in the workplace. At our feed mills, for 

every 300 employees we have one medical and OHS 

specialist in place, in accordance with the Vietnamese 

legislation on occupational health and safety. Currently 

there are 24 people in our feed mills who have joined the 

OHS committee, and OHSAS training is conducted for 

all workers at each site. Following the implementation of 

the Vietnam national standard legislation on OHS, certain 

indicators such as accident reporting are used to ensure 

the effectiveness of our OHS management system.

In Myanmar, the awareness of OHS has started to increase 

recently. This has prompted the government to create 

national rules for OHS. We took the initiative by assisting 

the Ministry of Labour to develop and formulate the OHS 

policy. Starting 2019, we established the OHS Committee 

consisting of nine representatives who are selected from 

the staff and management. 

In India, the OHS management system set up by our 

safety committee includes safety procedures, biosecurity 

measures, and identification of hazards and warnings. This 

OHS system has been designated to prevent accidents in 

the first place. As we are aware of our full responsibilities 

to create a safe workplace, safety training programmes are 

also provided to our outsourced workers. These combined 

strategies enable us to minimise productivity loss caused 

by workplace injuries that may affect our operational 

performance.

In January 2019, the Industrial 

Relations Department held the Japfa

SUSTAINABLE 

CONSUMPTION 

AND 

PRODUCTION

Climate change poses risks to 

farmers’ productivity and may 

impact our business operations. 

It is critical for us to cope with 

this challenge by transforming 

our production and resource 

consumption. Promoting efficient 

use of resources, zero-waste and 

emission reduction is our focus 

this year, as these help increase our 

operational efficiency. 

[GRI 102, GRI 204, 303, GRI 306, GRI 302, GRI 305]

56


Committed to further embrace sustainability, we conducted 

a Life Cycle Assessment to understand more about the 

environmental impact of our products and processes. By 

taking into account climate-related risks, we can aim to 

provide affordable nutritious proteins sustainably.

Our agri-food and aquaculture operations are highly 

dependent on the climate. The rapid changes and weather 

or extreme events pose challenges to our farmers in raising 

livestock or cultivating fish. Drought may threaten raw 

material supplies. The impact of heatwaves can reduce 

fertility and increase the vulnerability of our chickens to 

diseases. Fish farmers may face lower productivity due to the 

alteration of physiology and behaviour of the fish caused by 

climate change. Warmer water temperatures and rising sea 

levels bring disruption to marine ecosystems. 

It is clear that climate change is affecting our agri-food and 

aquaculture farmers and is very likely to get worse if we do 

not measure or mitigate those risks. Developing goals and 

strategies that embrace sustainable use of natural resources 

is thus key for us to safeguard our business operations 

amid the pressing issue of climate change. We believe that 



focusing on our goals to install more rainwater harvesting 

systems; construct additional wastewater treatment plants; 

increase the use of renewable energy; improve efficiency; 

use of mobile applications for more effective monitoring of 

the freshwater ecosystem; minimise waste; and secure raw 

material supplies will help farmers and Japfa to be ready 

for the uncertainties arising from global climate change 

while reducing our own impact on the environment and our 

carbon footprint. 

With the initial ambition to promote efficiencies across all 

operations, we continue to improve our sustainable agri-food 

and aquaculture practices, which aligns closely with the UN 

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly SDG 

Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production 

patterns. All of these enable us to attain affordable and 

sustainable animal protein and fish production, which are 

the primary contributing factors to global food security. 

Throughout our operations, we comply with environmental 

laws and regulations. [GRI 307-1]

Water availability is a potential risk in the 

agriculture sector, yet an indispensable part of our 

production. We take this potential water-related 

issue seriously by reducing our water dependency 

through our rainwater harvesting projects

Poultry

303-1]

We use water mostly for producing steam in the boilers 

and drinking water for our chickens. We source our water 

mostly from groundwater, municipal water and harvested 

rainwater. Used water is then treated in our water treatment 

plants utilising technology such as reverse osmosis so that 

it is suitable for process means and consumption. Each 

facility in our operations has its own water treatment plant. 

Water scarcity has been identified in two of our operations 

in Indonesia, caused by issues such as salty water, heavy 

metal-contaminated water, and drought. We installed 

a rainwater harvesting system and recycled the treated 

effluent discharged from the wastewater treatment plant 

(“WWTP”) as domestic water. Since August 2018, our 

Cikande Feedmill has ceased buying or taking water from 

third parties or groundwater. It has been operating solely 

on harvested rainwater. We are continuously exploring 

Cikande Feedmill has used 

harvested rainwater since August 

2018

opportunities to install rainwater harvesting systems in 

other units. 

Some regions may have ecosystem limitations that hinder 

us from constructing a rainwater harvesting system. For 

example, in Myanmar Poultry, rainwater harvesting is 

not an option due to highly polluted air conditions in 

the industrial area where our farms are located. The air 

pollution affected the quality of the rainwater, causing it 

to be acidic and containing heavy metallic residue.

In India Poultry, we are currently constructing a new 

water reservoir in the SK PS Farm with a capacity of 

10 million litres, equal to the monthly needs of our 

operations and domestic usage. Further research 

and analysis is still required regarding the capacity of 

rainwater harvesting and reservoir especially during 

prolonged drought in India.

Water quality is a critical factor affecting fish health 

and performance in aquaculture production systems. 

Different fish species require specific water quality aspects 

(temperature, pH, oxygen concentration, salinity, hardness, 

etc.) to grow, thrive and reproduce. We continuously 

monitor the physical and chemical conditions of our 

aquatic ecosystems to ensure that it is optimal for the fish 

under culture at all times.

We utilise Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), semi-

RAS and 2-step on our shrimp farming system to maintain 

the water quality of our intensive aquaculture operations. 

Aquaculture

These innovations enable us to increase the culture 

productivity and reduce waste output at the same time. 

Our Shrimp Technical Team also developed an Android-

based mobile app called TKT (Tim Kerjasama Teknis 

– Technical Cooperation Team) Mobile. It serves as a 

tracking system to monitor the freshwater ecosystem. 

The application of TKT Mobile covers all shrimp farming 

activities, from pre-spread to harvest. The app allows us to 

analyse and control the environmental conditions based 

on certain parameters such as, water conditions, shrimp 

growth, feed amount and performance monitoring.

Chapter 04 – Sustainable Consumption and Production


The combination of untreated domestic sewage, solid 

waste disposal, and industrial effluents can lead to 

depletion of available water resources and deterioration 

of water quality. Japfa Group has implemented some 

initiatives to address this issue.

In our poultry operations, we mainly use water for domestic, 

biosecurity and sanitation processes, especially in 

breeding farms and hatcheries. The wastewater produced 

is then sent to Waste Water Treatment Plants (“WWTP”) 

before being discharged to water bodies. The WWTP 

reduces contamination of discharged water that may harm 

the environment. 

In Tbk Poultry segment, most of our operations are 

equipped with WWTPs. The treatment plants in breeding 

farms and hatcheries on top of that are already certified 

by authorised bodies. During the reporting year, we 

constructed more WWTPs for domestic processes which 

also comply with the regulations. 

 

Vietnam Poultry also has same level of commitment. 

We aim to go beyond the government’s minimum water 

discharge quality requirement by trying to achieve the

highest standard of wastewater treatment i.e. Grade 

A. In 2019, we received Grade A certifications from the 

government for our breeding units. 

WWTPs are also operated in the central hatchery in Chaw 

Gone and Myota hatchery of Myanmar Poultry unit. In 2019, 

the commercial farms followed with the construction of two 

new WWTPs that cover 10 units of double-storey closed 

houses in Nyaung Napin, Hmawbi. In this WWTP system, 

we use fish as a bioindicator. Our feed mills follow the local 

regulations by treating their wastewater in the industrial 

zone sewage system. 

In India Poultry, the treatment is separated into the Sewage 

Treatment Plant (STP) and Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). 

During the reporting period, only our feed mills in Supa 

installed the ETP. In the future, we target to incorporate 

ETP in new projects as our commitment to go beyond 

requirements.

Aquaculture

In Tbk Aquaculture, we adopt Recirculating Aquaculture 

Systems (RAS), semi-RAS and 2-step in our shrimp farming 

system to maintain the water quality of our intensive 

aquaculture operations. Such innovation improves the 

productivity of the culture while reducing wastewater 

production at the same time.

As a commitment to conserve water and reduce freshwater 

consumption, we designed a proper wastewater treatment 

for our operations (fish, shrimp, and eel feeds, shrimp 

and freshwater fish breeding, shrimp, eel, freshwater fish 

farming and fish processing industry, and cold storage). 

In our Tilapia Processing at Janggir Leto, the treated 

effluent is recycled and reused for process water after 

being treated by reverse osmosis. In the feedmill unit, we 

are starting to reuse the water known as condensate for 

the boiler machine. It can save water use up to 20%. The 

use of condensate can reduce the energy usage for the 

pre-heating machine, thus minimising the carbon footprint 

from the production as well.

In our poultry operations, we continuously promote 

efficiency in our production processes, with the aim of 

minimising waste generated and maximising recycling 

through waste sorting. Our solid waste mostly comes from 

our livestock such as manure and carcasses. In our poultry 

operations, some effluents absorbed by shaved wood 

are eventually mixed to the manure. The end result of this 

process is then reused as fertiliser.

In Tbk Aquaculture, we generate almost the same solid 

waste from our production process, which is dead fish. 

That is then reprocessed as by-products in our Tilapia 

Processing unit at Janggirletto. Same as what we do in the 

poultry unit, the fish waste and dead fishes are reused as 

fertiliser.

Other solid wastes, such as hazardous and non-hazardous 

waste, are collected to be handled by licensed third-party 

contractors.

Energy And Emission Efficiency

[GRI 302-1, GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2, GRI 305-7]

We are committed to using clean energy for our 

production processes. We prefer to use natural 

gas and renewable energy from biomass, when 

available, in addition to electricity and diesel

In Indonesia, our biomass fuel is sourced from oil palm 

shells, candlenut shells, oil palm fiber and firewood. PT 

Japfa Tbk is committed not to use coal in all its operation 

units. In India, our biomass briquettes are made from 

the waste of agricultural products, such as rice husks, 

sugarcane bagasse waste and others. In Myanmar, 

we use mixtures of sawdust, strips, bark, forest wood 

chips, shavings or grains seasonally as the source of 

our renewable energy. Due to limited alternative energy 

sources, we have to use coal in Myanmar. We continue to 

explore other more environmental-friendly energy sources 

in Myanmar. Most of this energy is used to run boilers in 

feed mills, breeding and vaccine areas.

An increase in the prices of electricity by 30-100% by the 

Myanmar government since August 2019 has spurred 

Japfa to be more efficient in energy usage. Together 

with other divisions, we are looking for alternative 

energy solutions such as using solar panel systems in 

our commercial farms units to achieve cost savings on 

electricity. We installed energy metering in our plants 

in India to monitor the daily energy usage for energy 

optimisation. 

We continuously strive to use 

renewable energy sources and 

explore ways on how to improve our 

energy efficiency

Our energy and emission reduction strategies

We monitor the air emissions from our operations, such 

as from boilers, regularly.  In Indonesia we conduct 

monitoring of air emission biannually, following the local 

environmental regulation. Our air emissions are always 

maintained within the regulated threshold.

In our Tbk Poultry, we conduct emission sampling on a 

regular basis, as well as analyse the emission samples 

in collaboration with an external air laboratory who has 

been accredited by NAC/KAN (National Accreditation

production to distribution of the finished products – 

including raw material sourcing.

We have stringent requirements in selecting the best raw 

materials for our products as well as suppliers. Our trusted 

suppliers of ingredients are committed to the same high 

level of food safety and quality as we are. All suppliers are 

subject to the Supplier Code and are required to comply 

with the Japfa Code of Conduct, which sets out standards 

in compliance with government laws and regulations on 

employment, the environment, health and safety. 

For example, for the aquaculture suppliers, we require our 

prospective partners to meet the Best Aquaculture Practices 

(BAP) Certification, MSC and/or IFFO Certification, and 

various certifications to prove that they use materials that are 

traceable and non-genetically modified. Our assessment is 

not only limited to product quality but also related to social 

aspects. In India, child labour and sexual harassment of 

women are major social risks. We always pay attention to 

child labour and sexual harassment which can potentially 

occur in our suppliers.

We prioritise local suppliers within our countries of operation 

as we are aware that using local raw material has both far-

reaching benefits for the community and the environment. 

Most of our feed mills have applied this effort, including 

poultry operations in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar 

with corn as the most used local raw material.

The biggest growth of local sourcing occurred in poultry 

operations in Indonesia with a 8% increase – from 56% 

to 64% in 2019. In Aquafeed, 52% of our fish oil supplies 

are produced from local companies. We do appreciate 

the suppliers who give their best efforts in our business 

partnership, therefore we also provide retention 

programmes to maintain our mutual beneficial partnership.

For our packaging material, we use biodegradable 

packaging at our hatchery and processing plant for Tilapia 

thus promoting more sustainable practices along the 

supply chain. 

To support our rapid supply chain process, we develop 

an Import Material Monitoring System which is integrated 

with Systems Applications and Products (SAP). This system 

provides faster and more accurate data throughout the 

supply chain system. In the end, it increases efficiency, 

accuracy, and transparency of the whole system.

We monitor the material inside our plants and the cargo 

transportation from ports to our warehouses. Transporting 

products to short-distance customers has enabled us to 

decrease the number of carbon footprints produced.

ANIMAL 

WELFARE

Climate change causes increased 

magnitudes of extreme weather 

events such as drought, heat waves, 

and floods, which can all directly or 

indirectly impact animal welfare. In 

Japfa, we always strive to ensure that 

our animals are healthy and happy, 

according to the principles of five 

freedoms of animal welfare. Focusing 

on stringent biosecurity measures 

and a healthy and controlled 

atmosphere in our closed or open-

house farm system is paramount to 

mitigate risks to our animals due to 

climatic impact such as heat stress, 

unfavourable temperatures and 

disease contamination 

[GRI 102, GRI 416, GRI 417, FP10, FP12, FP13]

76


Climate change can cause negative consequences on 

the chickens’ health. This may arise from changes in 

environmental conditions, including air temperature, 

precipitation, humidity. The direct effects of climate change 

on poultry include illness and death related to increased 

temperatures and heat waves. Depending on the intensity 

and frequency, heat stress can cause behavioural changes, 

impaired reproductive function, and reduced immunity on 

our broiler chickens. The indirect impact may be primarily 

due to the influence of climate on disease distribution, 

microbial distribution, food and water supply, or food-

borne diseases. 

Consumers today are more concerned about how 

their food is produced and sourced, including whether 

the animals are humanely treated and bred in healthy 

conditions, with the belief that healthier animals mean safer 

food and better nutrition. This demands more transparency 

on our production and consumption system. Our vertically 

integrated operations, from animal feed manufacturing 

to breeding and fattening of poultry and aquaculture for 

further processing, have allowed us to have traceable high-

quality products. 

FAO projected that global food demand will double the 

population growth by 2050. Yet, around 600 million people 

are still suffering from food-borne illnesses each year as 

recorded by WHO (2019). Against this backdrop, we aim at 

ensuring food security and food safety across our supply 

chain, without compromising on our natural resources. 

As one of the largest leading agri-food companies in Asia, 

we believe that food safety goes hand in hand with animal 

welfare. Utilising modern technology through a real time 

monitoring system in our open and close house farms, 

we can address animal welfare and food safety issues 

while improving efficiency and productivity and thus food 

security.

We strive to maintain the traceability of our products’ 

supply chain while ensuring that our animals are treated 

appropriately and that they are healthy, comfortable, 

well-nourished, safe, and not suffering from unpleasant 

states. We believe that happy animals are healthy animals. 

Therefore, throughout our operations, we prevent diseases 

by implementing biosecurity measures; conducting 

appropriate veterinary care; providing shelter, management 

and nutrition, and a stimulating and safe environment; and 

performing humane handling and humane slaughtering. 

Through our activities, we aim to maintain food security 

and improve the welfare of our animals and stakeholders, 

including the family farmers. Our strategies and practices 

to ensure animal welfare are elaborated in the following 

approaches.

Freedom from 

hunger and thirst

Freedom from 

discomfort

Freedom from pain, 

injury or disease

Freedom to 

express normal 

behaviour

Freedom 

from fear and 

distress

Housing

We believe that a happy chicken is a healthy 

chicken. We follow the principles of 5 

freedoms of animal welfare. We ensure that 

they are free from hunger and thirst, free from 

discomfort, free from pain, injuries and disease, 

free from aggressive behaviour, and free from 

fear and distress. Our broiler chickens are 

raised in a condition where they can eat, drink, 

rest and roam freely in the closed or open-

house farm systems

Handling and

Traceable Distribution

As part of our efforts to make our product 

distribution as effective as possible, we consider 

the distance from our production unit to 

consumption areas. Therefore in Vietnam, we 

are planning to have slaughterhouses near 

public markets. This has been our major concern 

since it can increase food safety and hygiene 

throughout the value chain

Animal Welfare

Our Approach

79

Chapter 05 – Animal Welfare


Stringent Biosecurity

Practicing strict biosecurity and hygienic 

procedures to prevent the entry and spread 

of pathogens into farms is paramount to our 

operations  

The health of our chickens is our main priority in every step 

of our production cycle, and we ensure their well-being by 

preventing flock infection from external sources. We focus 

on identifying, evaluating, and resolving issues relating to 

animal well-being both within our farms and with our local 

farmers. We implement a three-zone biosecurity system 

throughout our Parent Stock (PS) farms to prevent the 

introduction and spread of disease-causing organisms in 

poultry flocks.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our biosecurity is measured based on 3 major components:

Isolation/

Quarantine

Traffic

Control

Sanitation

Strict biosecurity implementation requires the 

collaborative effort of all parties. Japfa maintains strict 

discipline on its farm personnel and ensures that they 

uphold good animal husbandry practices. Continuous 

training and employee development are conducted to 

ensure compliance. We developed biosecurity policies 

and strategies to manage pests and infectious diseases 

from entering, emerging, establishing, or spreading 

within our operations. Our biosecurity measures are 

based on three major components, namely isolation, 

traffic control and sanitation. 

Involves an enclosed housing 

in our breeding farm and 

applying separate hygienic 

air handling, feed and water 

troughs to avoid the risk of 

cross-contamination

Includes both traffic into the farm and 

traffic patterns within the farm using 

strict arrangements and policies. Our 

traffic flow patterns are outlined to avoid 

disease agents from entering the farms 

by keeping contaminated objects such 

as clothing, footwear, vehicles, hardware, 

away from the poultry

Includes the disinfection of 

materials, individuals, and 

equipment entering the farm 

and ensure workforce hygiene

80

Japfa Ltd Sustainability Report 2019




We strengthen our biosecurity protocols, especially during 

outbreak seasons, in every aspect of our facilities including 

feed mills, breeding farms, hatcheries, commercial farms 

and slaughterhouses. In Vietnam, we focus on biosecurity 

in our farms including contract farms. All our farms in 

South Vietnam and most of our farms in North Vietnam 

have already achieved the Vietnamese Good Agricultural 

Practices (VietGAP) certifications, published by the Ministry 

of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Socialist 

Republic of Vietnam. The certification is awarded to 

producers who fulfil several criteria in respect of productive 

technique, food safety, product traceability and protection 

of the environment and health.

In Myanmar, we upgraded our biosecurity system to be 

stricter on breeding and hatchery sanitation. As part of 

our commitment, we are in the process of acquiring ISO 

2018 for our feed mills - an update of ISO 2015,  which we 

received previously.

Salmonella is one of the biggest risks to poultry, which 

may pose a real threat to farmers. In Indonesia, random 

samplings are regularly conducted in several areas, from 

the farms to the slaughterhouses. We continuously achieve 

100% salmonella-free on our random sampling test in GP 

and PS Breeding Farms , as well as slaughterhouses.

Similar to the poultry biosecurity system, we also 

implement the three-zone biosecurity system throughout 

all aquaculture farms. As a result, we achieved Best 

Aquaculture Practices (BAP) two years in a row due to our 

best effort. We also received several certifications such as 

Halal certification  from Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) and 

Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) certification.

81

Chapter 05 – Animal Welfare


Vaccine 

We produce our own vaccines through our 

subsidiary, PT Vaksindo Satwa Nusantara 

(“Vaksindo”), which is the leading poultry 

vaccine research plant in Indonesia that 

carries out research on endemic diseases in 

the Asia and Africa regions 

Vaccines prevent disease by boosting the chicken’s immune 

system in such a way that it enhances the immune response 

when the chicken is subsequently exposed to a pathogen (or 

disease-causing organism). As we strive to maintain healthy 

chickens, vaccines are utilised as prevention and treatment.

Our researchers and veterinarians conduct research and 

produce vaccines by following Good Manufacturing Practices 

Standard and ISO 9001:2015 under the supervision of our Quali-

ty Assurance (QA) department.  Our researchers also collaborate 



[FP13]

with overseas institutions on predictive modelling and DNA 

mapping. 

Vaksindo operates certified Biosafety Level (BSL) 3 facil-

ities, which provide special handling facilities for hazard-

ous biological materials. In 2019, it expanded its vaccine 

production plant and adopted both semi-automatic and 

automatic technologies. To support research and develop-

ment for its vaccine products, it is currently constructing a 

Science and Innovation Centre.

Our vaccine manufacturing 

plant are Certified with Good 

Manufacturing Practice

Balanced Nutrition

[GRI 102-12, GRI 417-2, GRI 417-3, FP12]

We strive to produce innovative feed 

products to optimise yield performance 

through continuous research and 

development that allows us to stay 

competitive

Balanced Feed Formulation

We create specially formulated feed through continuous 

innovative research and development. Our formula 

considers all the requirements for balanced nutrition 

suitable for various phases of chicken development, 

especially in the tropical climate where we operate. We 

work alongside our expert nutritionists and use advanced 

technology such as the Near Infrared Reflectance (“NIR”) 

to develop balanced feed formulation, precision and 

improve production efficiency concurrently. The use of 

NIR reduces the wet chemical testing from 32% to 25% in 

providing detailed amino acid profiles, contributing to less 

environmental impact and higher cost efficiency.

 

Our aquafeed products are well-established and well-

known as one of the top and the only one Fish-Free-

Feed (F3) products in Indonesia. We are committed to 

continuous improvement based on resource efficiency 

and cleaner production using the traffic light action plan 

to monitor improvement. During the reporting period, 

we achieved the runner-up of the Asian Feed Miller 

Sustainability Award held in Bangkok. We were the first 

Indonesian aquaculture company that was invited as a 

speaker in the Free Fishmeal/Fish Oil Feed (F3) Conference 

in San Francisco, USA in 2017 and 2019. We were also the 

first aquaculture company in Indonesia to produce low 

phosphorus Tilapia diet, ensuring low phosphorus content 

in freshwater environment.

Fish-Free-Feed (F3) has been 

implemented for most aquaculture 

feed products (Tilapia, Common 

Carp, Pangasius, Milkfish, and 

Macropomum)

Since 2018, PT Japfa Tbk has stopped the usage of 

Antibiotics Growth Promoter (“AGP”) to comply with 

government regulations (14/PERMENTAN/PK.350/5/2017), 

while for aquaculture products, we have stopped using 

AGP since many years. In Vietnam and India, we have 

voluntarily stopped the usage of AGP. In 2019, AGP free 

(NCH Probiotic Echocarger 1000) is used in all processes 

from breeding, growing, and laying, by transferring to 

nipple system directly. This initiative eliminates human 

intervention and therefore reduces mortality by 2% by 

preventing the bacteria/virus from spreading.

83

Chapter 05 – Animal Welfare


Research Plant and Feedmill 

We conduct continuous research on nutrient requirements 

for optimum poultry growth and performance. To support 

our research and development, we constructed the 

most advanced and biggest in-house poultry research 

infrastructure across Asia Pacific, called Japfa Poultry 

Research Farm (JPRF) with a special-purpose-built 

experimental feedmill. This facility comprises Research 

Farm, located in Mojokerto, and Research Feedmill, located 

in Sidoarjo.



Prebiotics, probiotics, Medium Chain Fatty Acids (MSFA), 

essential oils, and/or herbs are used as substitutes for 

antibiotics. When necessary, antibiotics are given as 

medication, as prescribed by the veterinarian, following the 

allowed recommended dosage.

We provide clear and comprehensive labels on our 

packaging in compliance with strict labelling regulations 

from the government, especially in Myanmar, Vietnam, 

and India where the governments have specific 

labelling requirements. Our labels provide information 

on ingredients, nutrition value facts, quality, freshness, 

direction of use and expiry dates.

We recognise the importance of knowledge sharing and 

capacity development. Our research facility is open to 

graduate research students and we continuously publish 

our research in journals, accessible to the poultry science 

community.

For aquaculture feed research and development, we 

constructed the most advanced aquafeed research plant, 

84

Japfa Ltd Sustainability Report 2019




Japfa Aquaculture Research Station (JARS), in Sumatra. 

Similar to poultry feed, we tailor-made all of the aquafeed 

to produce superior balanced-nutrition feed. Our aquafeed 

research plant is well-known throughout Indonesia with 

continuously increasing demands on research activities 

from other countries. Bringing diverse know-how and 

synergy through collaboration with researchers from 

leading local and overseas universities has helped us to 

identify new and innovative solutions more quickly.

We use both controlled and non-controlled environments 

with large samples of broilers to obtain accurate data on 

how individual nutrients and farm management techniques 

affect chickens’ performance.

There are several automation initiatives conducted in 

2019 throughout our regions. In Indonesia, we built a new 

fully automated plant in Medan with a target capacity of 

more than 600,000 tons of output per year. This plant will 

support the domestic demand for feed. While in North 

Vietnam, we installed an expander machine between 

mixture and pelletising process to increase quality and 

maintain a stable quality of feed. The machines together 

with the new automated packaging and pelletising robot 

allow improved hygiene and time savings. 

With the aim to lessen the environmental impact of our 

products, we conduct trustworthy business activities and 

operation through compliance with laws, regulations, and 

requirements related to the environment. We use silo trucks 

to transport feed from feed mills to farms. There are many 

benefits by using silo trucks as transportation, such as less 

packaging and improved hygiene.

Housing

[GRI 301-3, FP13]

We believe that a happy chicken is a healthy 

chicken. We follow the principle of 5 freedoms 

of animal welfare, being freedom from hunger 

&amp; thirst; discomfort; pain, injury or disease; fear 

and distress; and freedom to express normal 

behaviour

Equipped with temperature control, plastic slatted 

flooring, and adequate lighting, our closed-house 

systems are designed to create a comfortable and healthy 

environment for our chickens. We use automated rotating 

fans to maintain a favourable air quality in order to control 

humidity and prevent bacteria from growing. Our open 

house systems are used in Vietnam, Myanmar, India and 

some parts of Indonesia. 

Different approaches have been applied to accommodate 

different temperatures and climate conditions such as 

using custom heaters in Vietnam and Myanmar.

 

In Myanmar, we implemented a ventilation system that 

balances between inlet and outlet air (Balance Oxygen, 

CO2 and Methane) so we can ensure there is no negative 

pressure within the chicken house.  Plastic pads are 

preferred to provide better air circulation and, at the same 

time, prevent the chickens from directly stepping on their 

manure. We are constantly trying to improve the quality of 

maintenance of our chickens and their environment. 

India is a country with a harsh environment and extreme 

temperature. In terms of weather extremes, 2019 was 

a year to remember. The high impact weather events, 

including extremely heavy rainfall, heat and cold waves, 

snowfall, thunderstorm, dust storm, lightning, and 

floods, affected all parts of India during 2019. The India 

Meteorological Department (IMD) has acknowledged that 

the high impact weather events killed more than 1,500 

people during the past year (The Weather Channel India, 

2020). As a precautionary approach to protect our chicken 

from climate change, we started using technologies to 

help us improve air circulation, ventilation and feeding 

management in 2019. On the following page, the 

technologies adopted include:

Our chickens are raised in conditions 

where they can eat, drink, rest and 

roam freely in the closed or open-

house farm systems

86

Japfa Ltd Sustainability Report 2019




87

Chapter 05 – Animal Welfare


In addition, in India, trees are planted around the chicken 

houses to control air temperature. These trees provide 

shade, protecting the house from sunlight and cleaning the 

air by absorbing the CO2 produced by the manure. For our 

hatchery in India, we built a dedicated washing place for 

transportation vehicles for chicks and eggs, and reusable 

DOC plastic boxes so we can improve the cleanliness, 

enhance wastewater management, and have a waiting area 

for the drivers while the cars are being washed. 

In aquaculture, the animals live and are dependent on their 

water ecosystem. Water quality is vital to our aquaculture 

operations. We take great care on this to ensure that our 

fish and shrimp grow in a healthy and safe environment 

while we uphold the principles of animal welfare. We 

continuously monitor the physical and chemical condition 

of our aquatic ecosystem’s water to maintain the optimum 

range of our aquaculture needs.

We implement a Recirculating Aquaculture System 

(RAS), semi-RAS and 2-step in our shrimp farming system 

to maintain the optimal water quality of our intensive 

aquaculture operations. These systems allow us to 

provide good quality of water consistently, as we could 

completely control our water conditions, prevent diseases, 

and subsequently maintain and improve our animals’ 

performance. 

The commitment to ensure water quality throughout our 

aquaculture operations enable us to provide a stable and 

optimal environment for our animals under culture, which 

leads to less stress and better growth. 

Trial of Maximus Controller System

Maximus Controller System is an integrated management 

system designed specifically for agricultural businesses. 

Its features enable us to remotely control and automate 

building management (ventilation, heating, temperature, 

humidity, light, fan/air velocity, power consumption, 

feeding management, water management, etc.) using 

computer/smartphone/tablet in order to achieve a uniform 

and optimum result of production. This year, we conducted 

a system trial in our existing PS Farm for coop 15 &amp; 16 and 

managed to adopt the system in two of our SK Farms. The 

other SK Farms were targeted to adopt by 2021. 

Installation of Automatic Inlet/Window

We installed automatic inlet/window (lowest) in PS Farm 

to replace the manual curtain to control air velocity and 

temperature. The inlet will be automatically adjusted based 

on temperature and humidity conditions in the room. 

Replacement of Conventional Fan into 

Inverter/Controller Fan

We installed an inverter/controller fan in two houses of our 

PS Farm. This new technology of inverter fan will adjust 

the speed fan according to the ambient temperature thus 

helps to reduce energy consumption and improve energy 

efficiency.

Replacement of Manual into Automatic 

Pan Feeder

Built-in with a feed sensor, this system helps to 

automatically feed the chicken and thus ensuring the 

uniformity of the chicken growth. At the moment, an 

automatic pan feeder has been implemented in each 

chicken coop for brooding while the automatic chain 

feeder has been installed for laying.

We are honoured to be recognised 

for our commitment to promote 

sustainable aquaculture 

through certifications such as 

Best Aquaculture Practice and 

Aquaculture Stewardship Council

Japfa Ltd Sustainability Report 2019


Handling

The common natural behavioural problems found in 

chickens are aggression and feather pecking. Before 

they establish the pecking order, they tend to fight 

with each other, which in turn can lead to injuries. The 

natural pecking behaviour in chickens may also create 

cannibalism and mortality, especially among untrimmed 

hens. We use laser beak trimming on our broilers in order 

to prevent harmful pecking and mortality. Compared to the 

conventional hot-blade beak trimming, laser beak trimming 

is more promising as it offers better beak uniformity and 

improved animal welfare as there are no open wounds 

among the chickens. This beak trimming practice can 

prevent scattered feed and facilitates better feeding and 

mating. Besides beak trimming, we monitor the ratio of 

male and female chickens in farms to prevent cannibalism.  

In Indonesia, we were the pioneer in using advanced 

laser beak trimming technology. While in India, we will 

be piloting natural beak smoothing in 2020. Natural beak 

smoothing involves a rough surface on the feeder for both 

male and female chickens that would naturally smoothen 

the beaks which promotes animal welfare even better. In 

Vietnam, we continued to implement beak trimming as 

well.

Handling and Traceable Distribution

[GRI 301-3, GRI 416-1, GRI 417-2, GRI 417-3, FP10, FP13]

In Japfa, we care about animal welfare. This is 

applied to how we handle our animals in the farm, 

processing and distribution of our products. Our 

vertically integrated business model allows us to 

ensure that this practice is traceable and applied 

throughout our operations. 

Halal and Hygiene Processing

Currently, we have the most chicken slaughterhouses 

across Indonesia. Tbk Poultry products have received the 

Halal certification by Majelis Ulama Indonesia/Indonesian 

Council of Ulama (MUI) for proper and appropriate ritual of 

Halal cutting and slaughtering standard requirement. Some 

of our multinational clients have very strict requirements 

on sustainable poultry practices that we follow and 

uphold. We do not have any slaughterhouse operations in 

Myanmar, India, and Vietnam as we sell live birds to various 

agents, distributors, and traditional markets. In Indonesia, 

before the slaughtering process begins, chickens are 

stunned by well-trained workers to ease the process which 

is in line with sustainable poultry practices. Slaughtered 

chickens are then transferred to the packing and delivery 

department.

In Vietnam, we are planning to have slaughterhouses near 

the public markets. Distance has been our major concern 

since proximity to the markets will improve food safety and 

hygiene throughout the value chain.

Tbk Aquaculture operates its own product processing 

plant, cold storage and value added product facilities. 

After the harvest, the fish are transported live to our own 

cold storage and processing facility located near the lake. 

We use modern equipment and processes such as tunnel 

congelation to maintain the optimal freshness of our goods. 

This integrated production structure allows us to meet the 

requirements of best practice in traceability and food safety 

for domestic and global food service companies.

89

Chapter 05 – Animal Welfare




Traceable Distribution

Due to our integrated operations, our chicken products 

are traceable to its origin. This traceability is achieved with 

the support of technology and system adjustment. For the 

example, in Indonesia, we control our DOC distribution 

using satellite which is integrated with our SAP system. 

Parameters for the chick vans such as temperature, speed, 

humidity, as well as the chicks’ parameters are visible for 

checking. Our chick vans, around 300 vans, can be digitally 

monitored by the customer so they know when their order 

will be delivered. In Indonesia, more than 90% of the boxes 

used to transport DOCs by Japfa are reusable plastic boxes, 

while the remaining are cardboard due to long-distance 

travel. Every DOC that has been packed in the box can be 

monitored using a barcode. The bar code is electronically 

stored in our system and provides complete trace-forward 

(plant to customer) and trace-backward (customer to plant) 

capability.

In India, all our chick vans for hatchery follow the best 

practise and recommendations from the experts. Chick 

vans are equipped with air conditioning system, wet and 

dry thermometer, and the GPS to monitor the real-time 

location, to maintain chickens’ well-being. 

Since 2016, the Vietnamese Government has been working 

to strengthen the national food safety monitoring and 

surveillance system by improving data management and 

developing a database of food businesses according to 

their risk profiles. These efforts aim to understand and 

target effective interventions and enforcement. To support 

government initiatives, we are enrolled in Ho Chi Minh 

City’s programme, TE Food Vietnam, for tracing the origin 

of poultry meat sold at retail outlets since 2018. In 2019, 

this programme expanded to some commercial rental 

farms in North Vietnam.  

Customers can now use the QR Code from www.te-food.

com to scan the barcode on our chicken packages. The 

barcode contains, amongst others, information about 

the poultry breed, breeding period, name of farm, feed, 

vaccination schedule and time of slaughter. This approach 

improves food traceability and security across the supply 

chain. We are also in pursuit of the Food Safety Chain 

Certificate which will give us the ability to expand our 

market, as the Vietnamese Government only allows some 

institutions, schools as an example, to buy fresh products 

(fruits, vegetables, livestock products) from companies that 

are listed in the Food Safety Chain list. 

In order to make safe and affordable staple proteins more 

accessible to the masses, as well as explore business 

opportunities, especially mid-downstream, we opened 

up meat shops. The price offered at our meat shop is 

considered pocket-friendly compared to the public market. 

Up to 2019, in Indonesia, we have more than 250 meat 

shops, spread along Sumatra, Java, Bali, Kalimantan, 

and Sulawesi. Meanwhile, in Vietnam, the meat shop is a

SUPPORTING 

OUR 

FARMERS

Over recent years, climate 

change has influenced the 

productivity of farmers to a 

different extent, posing risks to 

global food accessibility and 

security. Building partnerships 

with farmers has been our main 

focus to improve their well-being. 

This involves supporting small-

scale farmers in improving their 

productivity. 

[GRI 413-1]

The SDGs aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition 

by 2030, making sure all people have sufficient and 

nutritious food all year. Aligning with the SDG 2: Zero 

Hunger, our sustainability goal must include farmers as 

they are the source of world nutrition. This enables us 

to mitigate our exposure to climate and food security 

risk and at the same time, contribute to socio-economic 

development. 

Aligning with the SDG 1: End Poverty in all its forms 

everywhere, we empower local communities to be 

knowledgeable and profitable farmers through contract 

farming programmes, which we view as key drivers of local 

economic growth. In 2019, we have collaborated with more 

than 10,000 farmers. We are committed to helping these 

farmers thrive as we believe it is integral to sustaining our 

long-term business success.

Our farmers consist of both farmers who work on our 

own farms and contract farmers. A contract farming 

arrangement is a commitment that involves Japfa 

supporting a contract farmer in relation to good farming 

practices and technical assistance. In return, the contract 

farmer provides labour, chicken housing and fisheries. 

Through this arrangement, we provide benefits such 

as price stability and guidance for our contract farmers 

throughout the farming process. At the same time, we 

create more job opportunities and provide economic 

contributions to the local community, in line with our 

commitment of Growing towards Mutual Prosperity. 

As part of our proposition to provide total farming  

solutions, we have teams of mobile Customer &amp; Technical 

Service professionals to help farm operators extract the 

best value from our products. Our poultry experts are 

professionally trained in animal husbandry, nutrition and 

veterinary science and are able to offer complete on-site 

support to thousands of contract farmers throughout 

Indonesia. In the process, they routinely trouble-shoot 

and provide technical training on all aspects of farm 

management from ventilation, biosecurity and yield 

optimisation to disease prevention. 

We add significant value by sharing the latest findings 

from our in-house R&amp;D with poultry farmers. We also tap on 

our laboratories to help contract farmers obtain accurate 

diagnostic results for specific samples from their farms.

Our KAVAS programme is aimed at a group of small-scale 

shrimp farmers who only have one or two ponds within the 

same area. In KAVAS, STP provides technical assistance 

dedicated to its area, mobile lab, and knowledge transfer 

that help farmers to upgrade their farming method, either 

through the technology used or feeding regime optimisation. 

Through the programme, we promote responsible shrimp 

farming and improve the quality of shrimp farming. 

Our Digital Fishery Village programme aims to empower 

and educate fish farmers in Losarang, Indramayu, on ways 

to improve their farming quality and efficiency. The regular 

aquaculture technical support and research that we provide 

has attracted a lot of non-local farmers. Our Digital Fishery 

Village has become a facility for farmers to interact and share 

knowledge with our experts and other farmers’ communities. 

In addition to these two empowerment programmes, we also 

create a more sustainable way of fish farming by providing 

automatic feeder technology developed by eFishery, 

Telkomsel, and Tbk Aquaculture.

Moreover, we operate a shrimp farm partnership programme 

with experienced and qualified technician, 24/7 standby 

at shrimp farm until harvest. Technicians deployed in this 

program are carefully selected through psycho-test and 

graduated from Tbk Aquaculture top notch training centre in 

Banyuwangi, East Java.

Training programmes are also provided by People 

Development of Tbk Aquaculture Human Resources to equip 

farmers with soft skills, such as communication skills, to 

help them maintain a more effective and efficient day to day 

operation. In 2019, we conducted three training events at 

Madura, Makassar and Manado.

In 2019, we conducted three major 

trainings at Madura, Makassar and 

Manado 

Through FISS, we can foster stronger trust-based 

relationship between the farmers and ourselves.

In India, our farmer assistance programme also focuses on 

educating farmers in the construction of a soaking pit for 

wastewater management. This is in line with the country’s 

government regulations.

Temperature fluctuation due to climate change may 

significantly affect the health of poultry and as a result, 

farm productivity. In line with SDG Goal 13: Climate 

Action, we provide technical assistance to help our 

contract farmers move to a closed-house system which 

has improved temperature and humidity controls, to raise 

poultry resilience. The closed-house system reduces 

the impact of climate change on poultry, and therefore 

improve their productivity.  

Beyond our contract farmers, Japfa aims to empower 

small-scale aquaculture farmers to ensure they reach their 

full potential. This is done through our KAVAS (Kawasan 

Vannamei STP or STP Vannamei Area) and Digital Fishery 

Village (Saung Perikanan Digital) programmes.

Knowledge Development 

and Management

We have identified the need to further develop 

farmers’ knowledge on the best practices in 

animal protein business, adapting to the local 

conditions and resources.

The transition towards more sustainable agriculture 

requires new knowledge and new processes of learning.  

Combining the experience of farmers will enable us to 

strengthen our farming resilience.

Harnessing information technology and digitilisation, India 

Poultry has started to create a knowledge management 

platform as a new process of learning, called JapfaNeeti. 

JapfaNeeti is an initiative by Japfa to help farmers by 

providing them access to best practices in animal protein 

production across the value chain. We conduct JapfaNeeti 

sessions in our farmer meetings in partnership with leading 

companies in animal protein business. We also share 

snippets of information, farming tips and poultry practices 

to our community of farmers through channels like 

WhatsApp, Facebook and YouTube.

Our JapfaNeeti initiative reaches farmers and help them to 

establish a sustainable model of farm practices. Our main 

aim is to educate farmers about various issues and diseases

and help them evolve with up to-date farm management 

tactics. We have organised farmer meetings in Orissa, 

Assam, Bihar, UP, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Kerala, 

Telangana and Maharashtra. These farmer meetings have 

seen a participation of over 1300 farmers from diverse 

sectors like broiler, layer etc. and from various farming 

ranges like low, medium and high. Our meetings are 

designed for all the farmers in the poultry industry.

JapfaNeeti identifies detailed content pieces that will be 

useful for farmers. We target to develop more content to 

help farmers. The content aims to increase our company’s 

brand value among the customers. In developing 

JapfaNeeti, we collaborated with:

• 

Medicine, vaccine companies and poultry magazines 

to support and facilitate the programmes;

• 

Video editing vendors for animation and content

programmes were held in both Malang and Subang. All 

knowledge provided should be applied in our own farmers’ 

farming practices and pre/post tests were conducted to 

measure the success of these training programmes. 

In addition to provide education for future farmers, we 

have been cooperating with Gajah Mada University (UGM) 

and Brawijaya University to provide Teaching Farm since 

2003 and 2013 respectively. This program aims to prepare 

agricultural graduates to be work-ready qualified farmers. 

We facilitates the farm inside its partnered universities to 

be used as laboratory and learning facility for graduates to 

conduct research on chicken cultivation and animal heath.

Facilitate Access to Funding

Tbk Aquaculture collaborates with Rabo Foundation, BCA 

Syariah and other crowdfunding channels to facilitate 

funding access to farmers who use Japfa’s Aquafeed 

and follow its sustainable practices. Banks do not have to 

perform due diligence if farmers have followed the quality 

Improving food security is critical as the 

global population and demand of poultry and 

aquaculture continues to increase. Especially 

in developing countries, this can only work if 

farmers are supported both technically and 

financially. Overcoming this challenge, we take 

initiatives to facilitate funding access for farmers

and sustainable standards of Tbk Aquaculture. Japfa 

Vietnam cooperates with various banks in North Vietnam 

to provide financial support for customer farmers, while 

in India, we collaborate with equipment suppliers for 

equipment financing for farmers.

COMMUNITY 

DEVELOPMENT

Malnutrition in all its forms – 

undernutrition, micronutrient 

deficiencies, obesity and diet-

related non-communicable 

diseases (NCDs) – imposes 

unacceptably high economic 

and social costs on countries. 

It is one of the greatest 

impediments to human and 

national development

[GRI 203]

102


Malnutrition adversely affects physical growth as well 

as the cognitive development of the unborn and young 

children, undermining the capacities and capabilities of 

individuals and communities. 

The global call for action through the Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) to end all forms of malnutrition 

have continued to be the key target relating to Goal 2: 

Zero hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition 

and promote sustainable agriculture. Without adequate 

good nutrition, achieving other SDGs will be impossible. 

Combating malnutrition through nutritious and safe food 

also depends on other factors relating to healthcare, 

education, water, sanitation and hygiene, and more. Thus, 

the ambition to attain SDG Goal 2 should not be separated 

from other goals that contain measures that closely link to 

nutrition. 

Malnutrition is common in developing countries especially 

among families with deprived access to education and 

good sanitation. In line with SDG Goal 3: Ensure healthy 

lives and promote well-being for all at all ages and Goal 

4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and 



promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, answering 

this issue requires a more comprehensive solution that 

stresses on nutrition education and hygiene infrastructure, 

which are closely linked to each other. 

As a leading agri-food company, our focus has always 

been to end malnutrition and even beyond, which is in 

line with our vision of Growing Towards Mutual Prosperity. 

Our capability to provide availability, affordability, and 

consumption of safe and nutritious foods would not be 

enough without proper engagement with the community 

to address their needs. They need to learn that good and 

healthy eating ensures a well-nourished community. 

In remote areas, infrastructure is required to provide 

accessibility, improve hygiene environment, and to 

accommodate learning activities. Aligned with SDGs Goal 

2, 3 and 4, combating malnutrition through promoting 

nutrition-related education, developing sanitation and 

hygiene infrastructure, and providing social support as our 

focus approaches, will contribute to improve the health and 

well-being of the populations, as it is key to foster countries’ 

social and economic development.

self-produce fertiliser from animal manure and produce 

fried onions to increase their income. In 2019, we provided 

support ranging from facility provision, quality control and 

packaging to promotion strategy.

Organic Fertiliser Development from 

Left Over of Fish Production

We introduced technologies to produce organic fertiliser 

from Tilapia fish production waste in Tambun Raya village, 

Simalungun Regency. In 2019, around 3,000 litres of liquid 

and 8 tons of solid organic fertiliser have been produced 

out of 15 tons of fish production waste from Tilapia fish 

culture.

Community-Based Tourism 

Development in Toba

In supporting the Indonesian government’s plan to 

develop Toba as a new tourist destination, we took the 

initiative to form tourism-aware communities in Tigaras 

and Tambun Raya village, Simalungun regency. Based on 

social, cultural, and environmental mapping conducted 

before hand, we held tourism activities at the end of 2019 

such as Japfa Fun Bike and Kemah Ceria located around 

our operations in which tourists can enjoy the natural 

beauty of Toba and communicate with locals via cultural 

activities.

Waste Bank

Over the course of 2019, we continued our SI REPI waste 

bank programme in Sragen. There was a 23% increase in 

assets this year compared to 2018. To further our initiatives, 

we expanded the programme by building a new waste 

bank in Sragen Urban Forest, called KECIK waste bank. 

In 2019, KECIK waste bank successfully collected 906 

kg of waste from 43 members worth a total asset of IDR 

1,489,000.  

[GRI 203-1, GRI 203-2]

We strive to give back to the community through our social initiatives and efforts, as follows: 

Chapter 07 – Community Development

“Japfa Peduli” Disaster Relief

We care for those affected by disasters and their impact. There were several natural disasters that occurred in recent years. The 

Sunda Strait and Konawe in Indonesia were hit by a tsunami and floods around end 2018 and June 2019 respectively while in 

Myanmar, floods took place in the areas of Hwmabi and Mon State Mawlamyine.  Our focus was on helping the communities that 

were affected. PT Japfa Tbk offered aid to these stricken areas in the form of basic necessities, tents, medicine and emergency 

trauma services, while Myanmar Poultry offered donations and mercy funds to aid the people during this time of need.

Infrastructure Development

These infrastructures were developed in the hope of aiding the social welfare of the community.

Two projects to aid the surrounding infrastructure are:

 • Administration building. The administration office at 

Kalar Gone Village was renovated to allow better service 

for employees and surrounding communities 

 • Road infrastructure. Paving 1.5 km road to allow greater 

access through and from the surrounding villages

Three projects to aid the surrounding infrastructure are:

 • Construction of toilets to allow more sanitary living 

conditions for the community

 • Renovation of school buildings to provide children with 

a better facility that engages them in learning

 • Installation of water purifiers at schools to provide clean 

water source which the children could utilise

We are also making efforts to promote greater healthcare

understanding. As part of our commitment to support 

the clean water delivery programme of North Sumatra’s 

environmental department, we have built an Ultra Filtration 

Water Treatment facility at Tambun Raya. PT Suri Tani 

Pemuka was also involved in the construction and supply 

of toilets and trash bins for schools around Danau Toba.

We also developed new communities surrounding our STP 

Unit in Danau Toba through our fish fertiliser utilisation 

programme. We built production houses equipped with 

fish shredder machines to reuse the leftovers of Tilapia 

fish farming production and convert them into solid and 

liquid organic fertiliser. In 2019, we converted 200 kg of 

our Tilapia fish waste and tested the fertiliser on cucumber 

plants. Two new female farmer groups (KWT) were formed 

in Dusun 1 and 4 with a total of 20 members. These two 

KWTs succeeded to produce 3,000 litres of liquid organic 

fertiliser and 8-ton of solid organic fertiliser from 15 tons of 

the Company’s Tilapia production waste in 2019.  

Aquaculture Community Initiatives

Efforts have been made to deepen our contribution in 

all industries, including aquaculture, towards the local 

community. Aquafeed Medan donated educational 

equipment in the form of desk sets to provide a better 

teaching and learning environment for the students at 

Yayasan Pendidikan Al-Mukhlishin.

As part of our spiritual support, we provided Zakat system 

(food supplies) specifically for indigenous communities in 

Kedunen and Glondong village around Banyuwangi town. 

This year we engaged with the community surrounding 

Bomo I Ponds unit to mark a happy Idul Adha moment 

by offering qurban to local mosques. These traditions 

and activities are the ways we show gratitude within the 

spiritual and social aspect. 

In the Aquafeed Gresik unit, we work with Palang Merah 

Indonesia (PMI) to collect blood from donors once in a 

month. Each employee at Aquafeed Gresik can voluntarily 

donate blood and this helps them to develop a sense of 

social responsibility. Other teams continue to hold blood 

donors annually in the relevant areas, in conjunction with 

local PMI.

CONTRIBUTION 

AND CORPORATE 

GOVERNANCE

Japfa believes that mutually 

rewarding relationships with all 

stakeholders are the cornerstones 

for the success and sustainability 

of the company. Being one of 

the region’s leading agri-food 

companies, providing animal 

protein staples across five 

countries with support of our 

employees and farmers, require a 

robust policy and guidelines that 

govern day-to-day operations

[GRI 102, GRI 201, GRI 205, GRI 206]

120


Japfa’s policies and guidelines help to ensure efficiency in 

our operations, maintain a robust financial performance, 

and provide benefits to relevant stakeholders. Japfa’s 

culture promotes a safe, ethical and transparent 

environment to foster innovation and growth.

We continue to strive to achieve our goals by having 

a strong corporate governance structure, a robust risk 

assessment process, effective internal audit function, anti-

corruption policy, and whistleblowing system.



Throughout 2019, the poultry industry faced a lot of 

uncertainties and pressure. However, the Group has 

managed to keep the profit margin stable which underlines 

its strong position as a low cost and efficient producer of 

staple proteins in Emerging Asia. 

This year, our achievement was highlighted by the 

placement of Japfa Group in the Forbes Asia’s 200 Best 

Over A Billion 2019 list.  During the reporting period, we 

complied with all laws and regulations in the social and 

economic area. [GRI 419-1]

Risk Management

[GRI 102-15]

Japfa incorporates risk management strategies to efficiently and systematically handle and mitigate risks throughout the 

organisation. 

Internal Audit and Control 

[GRI 205-1]

Japfa has an Internal Audit (IA) function to review and 

monitor operations to ensure adequacy and effectiveness 

of internal controls, adherence to the Company’s 

policies and procedures, and compliance with laws and 

regulations.

 

The head of IA reports directly to Japfa’s Chief Executive 

Officer and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors 

of Japfa. A quarterly report is prepared and updated to the 

Audit Committee and audits are selected and prioritised 

based on IA’s risk assessment process. Over the course of 

2019, there were 36 internal audits performed where the 

scope of each audit included between 4-5 functions, which 

constituted approximately 10% of the total operations in 

Japfa Group.

Japfa also engages an external auditor to further 

strengthen the company’s corporate governance and 

internal processes, provide more credibility, and identify 

potential areas for improvement to further mitigate risk. 

A new internal control system was established in Japfa 

Myanmar in 2019 to allow integrated control activity 

for each division to ensure their performance is aligned 

with the company’s targets, standards, and strategies. 

This system allows for the assessment and review of all 

of the business processes in its operations as well as for 

continuous improvement using the Plan Do Check Act 

(PDCA) cycle.

 

Competition

Japfa prioritises product quality, product 

efficiency throughout its value chain from 

upstream to downstream,  and building 

good relationships with its customers. This 

sustains Japfa’s position as a key player in 

the industry.

Japfa engages in hedging transactions, where 

feasible, to reduce impact from the fluctuation 

of foreign currency.

Epidemics

The Company applies rigorous biosecurity 

protocols to mitigate the risk of major 

outbreaks of disease, including animal vaccine 

research and production.

Prices and Availability 

of Raw Marterials

The risk of raw material price fluctuations is 

mitigated by the ability to  pass on any price 

changes to our feed selling price. We also 

encourage local farmers to grow the raw 

materials used in our operations.

Chapter 08 – Economy Contribution and Corporate Governance


[GRI 205-2]

Anti-Corruption Policy

Conducting our business ethically and with 

integrity is important to Japfa. Therefore Japfa 

has developed anti-corruption policies which are 

implemented across the Group

We expect all employees to uphold high ethical standards

and strive to promote a culture that is transparent, safe, and

accountable in our day-to-day operations that involve

engagement with our internal and external stakeholders.

Upon their appointment, employees are provided with

the Employee Handbook and are required to read Japfa’s 

Induction Programme to ensure they understand

and comply with the Anti-Corruption/Anti-Bribery Policy. In

addition, Japfa has a web-based Whistleblowing System

which allows employees and external parties to report

violations of this policy and other frauds and irregularities.

Japfa’s internal whistleblowing system is called 

JAPFALERT. Communication on JAPFALERT and

information on its use has been communicated across the

business units.

JAPFALERT is part of our commitment to enforce good 

corporate governance and ensure that business practices 

are carried out based on integrity.

The whistleblowing system provides a communication 

channel for staff and partners to report misconduct, 

criminal acts and infringements of corporate regulations 

and code of conduct affecting workers and/or associated 

entities of the Company. This tool further reinforces 

compliance with the Company’s policy.
