Feedback

Our stakeholders’ feedback is important to us. We welcome feedback on this report and 

any aspect of our sustainability performance. Please address all feedback to Divisional 

Vice President Public Affairs at public_affairs@singaporeair.com.sg.



Overview



This Sustainability Report aims to inform Singapore Airlines’ stakeholders of our 

sustainability performance in a transparent and accountable manner. It covers issues 

related to community, the environment, governance and stakeholder engagement.

Through this report, we seek to identify opportunities for improvement to our 

sustainability management as well as issues that are integral to our business in order 

to address them effectively and appropriately. We endeavour to integrate sustainability 

throughout our customer experience and engagement process. Together with relevant 

partners within our value chain, we seek to explore ways to improve sustainable 

practices across all aspects of our operations.

Reporting Period

SIA’s Sustainability Report is published annually in June. This report covers the financial 

year 2017/18 from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. The previous Sustainability Report 

was published in June 2017. 

Reporting Scope

The information and figures in this report refer to the Head Office of the Parent Airline 

in Singapore, and exclude subsidiaries in the Singapore Airlines Group - SIA Cargo*, SIA 

Engineering Company, SilkAir, Scoot as well as Tradewinds Tours and Travel - unless 

otherwise stated. The ‘$’ sign used in this report refers to Singapore Dollars unless 

otherwise stated.

Reporting Process

Singapore Airlines’ Board members provide guidance and work with the Management 

Committee, which consists of the Chief Executive Officer, two Executive Vice Presidents 

and Senior Vice Presidents from all divisions, to prepare the report. The Management 

Committee endorses the report’s contents, supported by a strategic team of department 

head-level staff. Information for this report is collected from various departments  

and overseas offices, which are required to confirm the accuracy and authenticity  

of the data through documentary evidence or past operational performance. We aim  

to continuously improve this process to ensure that our data collection is effective  

and robust.

GRI Guidelines

This report is aligned with the latest Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core 

option. Due to the GRI Standards’ universal application, we selected it as a guideline for 

the report so as to allow for comparability of our performance over the years. The report 

also takes reference from Singapore Exchange’s (SGX) ‘Comply or Explain’ requirements 

for sustainability reporting. We have not sought external assurance for this report. 

However, since our first Sustainability Report published in 2013, we have engaged 

external consultants to perform an annual gap analysis.

*As of 1 April 2018, SIA Cargo was re-integrated as a division within SIA.

About the Cover 

The Boeing 787-10 is the latest addition to 

Singapore Airlines’ fleet. Its revolutionary design 

and state-of-the-art technology contributes 

to its superior fuel efficiency, highlighting 

Singapore Airlines’ longstanding commitment to 

caring for the environment.


In June 2017, I travelled to Cancun, Mexico and signed the United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce 

Buckingham Palace Declaration to prevent illegal trafficking and transportation of wildlife and their 

products. 

 

We also continued to support the communities in which we operate, as we celebrated Singapore 

Airlines’ 70th anniversary in 2017. Through a series of events, a total of $2.55 million was raised for the 

Community Chest of Singapore, to support more than 80 social service organisations under its care. 

We will continue to do our part for the community, in Singapore as well as in the various overseas 

markets that we operate in.  More details can be found in the ‘Supporting our Communities’ section of this 

report. 

 

A significant corporate development during the financial year was the integration of our low-cost airline 

subsidiaries Scoot and Tigerair under the Scoot brand. Another major corporate development was the 

transition of SIA Cargo from a wholly-owned subsidiary to a division within Singapore Airlines, providing 

greater synergy with the SIA Group.  

 

Together with our subsidiaries, we aim to progressively broaden our scope of reporting in the coming 

years. In FY2017/18, representatives from SilkAir and Scoot joined the Sustainability Strategic Working 

Committee, which is an internal working group made up of department head-level staff who set the 

direction for our sustainability reporting.   

 

Intensifying competition and rising fuel prices will continue to pose challenges to the aviation industry 

in the year ahead. Despite the challenges, we remain committed to our sustainability goals by investing 

in new technologies and building on our digital capabilities. Some initiatives included the generation of 

flight disruption statements online and the elimination of physical service recovery vouchers, as well as 

the launch of a chatbot to expand digital servicing channels for our customers.  

 

In January 2018, we launched our Digital Innovation Blueprint as part of SIA’s ongoing Transformation 

Programme, contributing to the development and nurturing of digital aviation and the travel technology 

community. As our diverse workforce of dedicated employees is one of our greatest assets, we 

continue to invest heavily in our people, and digital training initiatives have been a major focus, to help 

foster an innovative culture and mindset.  

 

SIA seeks to continue developing as a responsible corporate citizen through a sustainability strategy 

endorsed by the Board as well as our Management Committee. Over the past year, we reviewed the 

17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which were adopted by world leaders in 2015, to stimulate 

action over the next 15 years in areas of importance for the planet and humanity. Three SDGs have 

been identified as being relevant to our sustainability strategy and are long-term targets we seek to 

achieve in the future: 

• Goal 8:  Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all

• Goal 12:  Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

• Goal 13:  Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts 

As we enter into our next phase of growth, we remain committed to building on our already strong  

position as a sustainable organisation.

GRI

In FY2016/17, we transitioned to the latest Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards for disclosures 

on topics important to SIA and our stakeholders. We are also now basing our report on new Singapore 

Exchange (SGX) rules for sustainability reporting. Recognised by SGX as part of the SGX Sustainability 

Leaders Index in 2016, we endeavour to press on with our sustainability journey, and remain a 

frontrunner in environmental, social and governance standards.  

 

We have been encouraged by the positive feedback received about the quality of our sustainability 

reporting to date. We consider it to be a constant improvement process, and this year we are further 

enhancing sustainability-related disclosures through this report. 

 

Our customers are of course very important to us. In line with efforts to constantly improve the travel 

experience, we made significant investments over the past year in the development of long-haul and 

regional cabin products, which debuted on new Airbus A380 and Boeing 787-10 aircraft. In November 

2017, we unveiled new industry-leading A380 cabin offerings, providing more space and privacy for 

customers across all classes. In March 2018, we also launched our new regional Business Class cabin 

products on the world’s first Boeing 787-10 aircraft. 

 

To meet ever-growing customer expectations, we are constantly enhancing the three main pillars of our 

brand promise: Service Excellence, Product Leadership and Network Connectivity. This year, we will be 

taking delivery of the world’s first Airbus A350-900 Ultra-Long-Range (ULR) aircraft, which will enable us 

to re-launch non-stop flights between Singapore and both New York and Los Angeles, reducing travel 

time for our customers.  

 

Our aircraft orders are in line with a longstanding practice of maintaining a modern and fuel-efficient 

fleet, through which we can operate more efficiently and expand our network reach. Our significant 

investment in new fuel-efficient aircraft also advances our objective of reducing carbon emissions. 

 

For example, SIA operated a series of 12 ‘green package’ flights over a three-month period on our 

non-stop San Francisco-Singapore route in 2017, in partnership with the Civil Aviation Authority of 

Singapore. The ‘green package’ flights combined the use of biofuels, optimised flight operations and 

the latest fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce fuel burn and carbon emissions. The initiative supports the 

Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015 to develop Singapore as a Leading Green Economy, contributing 

to a Sustainable Singapore.   

 

A ‘From Farm to Plane’ concept was also introduced in October 2017 to promote environmental 

sustainability and support local farmers’ communities through the use of more sustainable and 

meatless ingredients, as well as local produce, for in-flight meals.   

 

On the ground, we are committed to achieving a 15 per cent reduction in electricity consumption in our 

offices and a 30 per cent reduction in waste generation from our buildings by FY2020/21. Many of the 

initiatives are documented in the ‘Managing Environmental Impact’ section of this report. 

CEO’s Message

This is Singapore Airlines’ sixth Sustainability Report, 

in which we detail our sustainability initiatives and 

achievements related to economic, environmental  

and social issues over the past financial year.

Historical Timeline 

1947

1963

2018

The Singapore 

Airlines story dates 

back to 1947, when 

Malayan Airways 

Limited (MAL) was 

born. On 1 May, an 

Airspeed Consul took 

off from Singapore’s 

Kallang Airport, on 

the first of three 

flights a week to 

Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh 

and Penang.

Malayan Airways 

Limited becomes 

Malaysian Airways 

Limited in 1963 

and later, Malaysia-

Singapore Airlines 

(MSA) in 1966.

1972

The Singapore Girl is created, with the formation 

of Singapore Airlines following the separation 

of the former MSA into two carriers. In her 

distinctive sarong kebaya in batik material 

designed by Parisian couturier Pierre Balmain, 

she epitomises Singapore Airlines’ tradition of 

friendly service and Asian hospitality.

1989

Singapore Airlines becomes the first airline to 

operate a commercial flight across the Pacific 

Ocean with the Boeing 747, from San Francisco 

to Singapore via Hong Kong.

1991

Singapore Airlines launches the world’s 

first global sky telephone service, enabling 

passengers to stay in touch with people on the 

ground while they are in the air.

1998

In September, 

Singapore Airlines 

sets up the 

International Culinary 

Panel, comprising 

award-winning chefs 

from the culinary 

capitals of the world 

to take in-flight dining 

to new heights. 

1999

Singapore Airlines launches the frequent 

flyer programme, KrisFlyer. The launch of this 

programme allows Singapore Airlines and SilkAir 

customers in all cabin classes to accumulate 

KrisFlyer miles and redeem tickets for travel.

2001

Singapore Airlines is the first airline to provide 

audio- and video-on-demand to passengers in all 

cabin classes with KrisWorld, Singapore Airlines’ 

in-flight entertainment system.

2004

Singapore Airlines, together with partners, 

establishes Tiger Airways (which operates as 

Tigerair), a Singapore-based no-frills airline that 

offers affordable travel options. 

On 28 June, Singapore Airlines launches the 

historic, non-stop flight from Singapore to New 

York using the ultra-long-range Airbus A340-500. 

The flight traverses a distance of close to 9,000 

nautical miles over the North Pacific, and sets 

a new record for the world’s longest non-stop 

commercial flight.

2007

Singapore Airlines makes history when it 

becomes the first to fly the Airbus A380, the 

world’s largest commercial aircraft. The 

next-generation aircraft will grow capacity on 

high demand routes, while delivering operational 

efficiency, environmental improvements and 

customer benefits.

2011

Singapore Airlines announces plans to establish 

low-cost subsidiary airline Scoot, for medium- 

and long-haul routes. Scoot begins its first flight 

to Sydney, Australia in 2012.

2012 

The giant pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia arrive in 

Singapore on 6 September, after flying in comfort 

on board a Singapore Airlines Cargo Boeing  

747-400 freighter from Chengdu, China. 

Singapore Airlines becomes the Official Airline 

for the giant panda collaborative programme 

between Wildlife Reserves Singapore and the 

China Wildlife Conservation Association.

2016

Singapore Airlines welcomes the latest-generation, 

highly fuel-efficient A350-900 aircraft to its fleet 

in March, and later launches its new non-stop 

Singapore-San Francisco service using this 

aircraft. 

2017

Celebrating 70 years of excellence in 2017, 

Singapore Airlines unveils its new cabin products 

which will be fitted to its Airbus A380 fleet following 

an extensive four-year development programme. 

With the SIA Group emphasising the need to 

adapt nimbly and flexibly to industry changes so 

as to stay relevant in the competitive environment, 

Scoot and Tigerair merge under the Scoot brand 

name.

2015

Singapore Airlines unveils its new Premium 

Economy Class seats and in-flight offerings 

following a two-year development programme. 

Singapore Airlines operates its first-ever Charity 

Flight on the world’s largest commercial aircraft, 

the Airbus A380. More than 300 beneficiaries 

were treated to a three-and-a-half-hour flight.











Singapore Airlines once again leads the aviation 

industry, becoming the first to fly the new Boeing 

787-10 Dreamliner.  Designed to be uplifting in 

every way, the cabin offers a more comfortable 

in-flight experience for customers. 

Today, the Singapore Airlines Group network 

covers over 140 destinations, including services 

by subsidiary airlines.

Risk Assessment and Management 

The Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s risk governance. 

Represented by the Board Safety and Risk Committee, it reviews the 

effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Risk Management 

Process. The Committee also convenes on a quarterly basis to review 

the robustness of the Company’s risk governance and reports key risks 

to the Board of Directors annually. 

The Risk and Compliance Management (RCM) department initiates 

and coordinates activities to drive risk management efforts across the 

SIA Group and its subsidiaries. Aside from the Board Safety and Risk 

Committee, various Risk and Compliance Management Committees, 

which comprise members from the Senior Management team, are set 

up at both the company and group level to review risks and controls. 

They also ensure that risk management efforts are coordinated across 

business functions and the SIA Group respectively.  

RCM monitors group-wide risk review exercises and ensures that they 

are conducted bi-annually. Each exercise involves the identification of 

new or emerging risks, evaluation of existing risks to determine their 

relevance in the current context, and ensures controls and processes 

are in place to manage economic, environmental and socio-political 

risks. The risk management process provides guidance for managing 

risks from both a top-down and bottom-up approach. This ensures 

that the needs and expectations of all stakeholders and corporate 

requirements are accounted for. 

Other key initiatives under RCM include mandatory training for all 

staff through a web-based facility and managing a schedule to verify 

Business Continuity Plan tests on a regular basis. These initiatives are 

in place to ensure staff awareness and familiarity with risk management 

processes and requirements, and that alternate plans for various operational 

areas are adequate and effective. Updates on these activities are also 

reported to the Board Safety and Risk Committee and other relevant 

Risk Committees within the SIA Group. 

Ethics and Integrity

Singapore Airlines is committed to achieving high standards of 

corporate governance. Ethical business conduct is a significant guiding 

principle that we adopt in our worldwide operations. Our partnership 

with agents, contractors and employees is underpinned by their 

integrity in the conduct of their work which is critical to our business 

operations and reputation. 

Singapore Airlines has channels for employees, stakeholders and 

the public to raise concerns about possible improprieties in any 

matter, in confidence. The Company has a whistleblowing programme 

called ‘Policy on Reporting Wrongdoing’ that is communicated 

to our employees though our internal Intranet, Staff Regulations 

and a mandatory web-based training module. Under this policy,          

employees may report suspected matters of wrongdoing 

affecting the Company, either through email at  

ethics_hotline@singaporeair.com.sg or via telephone

at +65 93875667. 

The Audit Committee continuously reviews the programme 

to ensure that it is adequate. All whistleblower reports 

are reviewed by the Audit Committee at its quarterly 

meetings to ensure independent investigation and 

adequate resolution. There were no confirmed incidents 

of corruption involving our employees or business 

partners in FY2017/18. There were also no legal cases 

of corruption brought against the Company in the 

same financial year. Please refer to page 70 in the 

FY2017/18 Annual Report for more information on our 

whistleblowing programme.

Conflict of Interest

Singapore Airlines requires employees involved in a 

conflict of interest situation or in one which could 

potentially lead to a conflict of interest to report the 

matter to the Company. All employees are required to 

declare any conflict or potential conflict of interest 

situation to the Human Resources Division annually.

Anti-Corruption Training

Anti-corruption policies and procedures are communicated 

to Singapore Airlines employees via a web-based training 

module. The module includes information and assessments 

relating to the Company’s anti-corruption policy. Employees 

receive email notifications which prompt them to complete 

the web-based training. Business partners and service 

providers are required to sign contracts which include an 

anti-corruption and anti-bribery clause. Singapore Airlines’ 

Suppliers’ Code of Conduct is also included in the contracts. 

For more information on the Suppliers’ Code of Conduct, 

please refer to page 37 of this report. 

Singapore Airlines targets to have at least 95 per cent of 

employees required to take the anti-corruption training 

complete it by the due date annually. The percentage 

excludes line pilots and cabin crew as they are not 

required to complete the anti-corruption training.

In FY2017/18, 4,288 (96.2 per cent) out of 4,457 ground 

employees completed the anti-corruption training. Of all 

ground employees, 307 (93.0 per cent) out of 330 senior 

management* completed the anti-corruption training.

Materiality Assessment

The SSWC conducted a Materiality Assessment in 2013 by reflecting on significant economic, environmental and social impacts which 

are material to SIA. The process included evaluating feedback from various internal and external stakeholders, such as our employees 

and customers. As SIA’s Head Office is located in Singapore and a majority of our training facilities are based here, the topic boundaries 

are focused on our operations in Singapore, unless otherwise stated. The Materiality Assessment was last reviewed in 2017 and endorsed 

by SIA’s Management Committee and the Board. We strive to include our subsidiaries’ sustainable practices in our Sustainability Report 

progressively, so as to provide a more holistic picture of the SIA Group in terms of opportunities, risks and performance.

SIA’s Safety Performance

The safety of our customers and staff is our first and foremost priority.

It is the core of our operations and our success.

Flight Safety Policy

The safety of our customers and staff is our first and foremost priority. It is the core of 

our operations and our success. We believe it is every employee’s responsibility to work 

towards a strong and positive safety culture.

SIA’s Flight Safety Policy is founded on the premise that:

safety-related information can be reported freely so that lessons can be learnt and 

improvements made. This culture supports learning and sharing, and is necessary to 

ensure safe operations.

• We are committed to always improving so as to sustain the high standards of our 

people and systems.

Safety and Health Policy

Singapore Airlines places the greatest importance on the safety of our customers and

collective responsibility. We also have a Suppliers’ Code of Conduct which we expect all 

our suppliers to adhere to.

prevent injuries or illnesses and/or loss or damage to property and equipment.

Safety Surveys

SIA conducts a company-wide online safety survey with air crew every two years. 

The safety survey assesses a number of areas such as safety management, violations 

observed during operations and readiness of crew to report safety occurrences or issues. 

It provides an overall assessment of the safety climate and culture in our operational 

environment, as well as safety concerns of crew. We also have a comprehensive list of 

quantitative and qualitative performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of our 

efforts. These indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis and benchmarked against 

industry standards.

Employee Feedback 

We place emphasis on seeking employee feedback to improve safety standards in

the workplace. Employees are encouraged to identify hazards and report flight and

occupational safety incidents to create awareness and highlight risks. 

Cabin Operation Safety

Determining the level of safety in our cabin operations is key to helping us understand 

the effectiveness of our safety procedures and to review our improvement plans. With 

the Cabin Safety Observations (CSO) programme, we are able to adopt a holistic quality 

approach in upholding our standards of safety performance and commitment.

Observations from the CSOs, conducted by our qualified Inflight Auditors, provide 

real-time assessment on the safety competency of our cabin crew. Such information 

is collated and discussed with all stakeholders, including Cabin Crew Management and 

our cabin crew. Areas for development are then identified and worked on.

Safety and Security Week (SSW) 2017

The SSW was held from 4 to 8 September 2017 to promote safety and security awareness 

among staff in the SIA Group. The week-long event’s theme was ‘Continuous Improvement, 

Continuous Attention’, which highlighted the importance for staff to be alert in an

ever-changing operating environment. Staff who exhibited exemplary judgement and 

great skills in averting or handling a safety and security incident were presented with 

awards and citations during the ceremony. 

From 2018, staff who identify significant hazards will also be recognised for their

vigilance. A series of videos titled ‘Vigilance in Daily Operations’ and ‘Office Safety’

put together by the Safety, Security and Environment Division were aired during the 

launch ceremony to highlight SSW’s key messages. Various divisions and units in the 

SIA Group also organised programmes such as forums, seminars and campaigns to 

promote safety and security in their respective work areas.

Apart from strengthening safety as a core value, SIA’s Safety Programme aims to  

promote greater understanding and awareness of safety concepts as well as the 

Company’s efforts towards safety management. This helps employees to better  

appreciate the roles they play, as well as the contributions they can make towards higher 

safety standards. The programme covers the following areas: Introduction to Safety, 

Effective Safety Management, Safety Culture as well as Our Approach and Commitment 

to Safety. Every employee is enrolled in the programme and undergoes a refresher  

assessment every three years.

Management Oversight

SIA’s safety governance structure consists of five groups to guide safety management:

• Air Safety Committee (ASC)

• Board Safety and Risk Committee (BSRC)

• Divisional safety departments / Safety Action Groups (SAG)

• Occupational Safety, Health and Environment (OSHE) Committee 

• Safety, Security and Environment (SSE) Division 

Ground Ramp Incident Prevention (GRIP) Programme 

The SIA GRIP Programme is currently in its 14th year. Regular ramp audits are carried out 

at all our stations to ensure ramp operations are carried out safely. Any unsafe practices  

or conditions observed are followed up on and corrected accordingly. In 2017, over 

1,500 such audits were carried out.

Workplace Safety and Health 

In order to continue strengthening Workplace Safety and Health awareness in the  

organisation, as well as to meet Risk Management Regulations set by Singapore’s 

Ministry of Manpower, relevant staff were trained to carry out risk assessments at the 

workplace in FY2017/18. The training focused on the fundamentals of hazard identification, 

risk prioritisation and mitigation through the application of risk management principles.

 

Flight Data Analysis Programme

Flight data is captured in our aircraft’s Quick Access Recorders (QAR). The data, which 

captures much of the aircraft’s flight and systems performance, is regularly downloaded 

from the QAR and analysed for irregularities so as to identify trends. Where necessary, 

corrective and/or preventive measures will be implemented to improve flying standards 

and enhance safety.

Safety Risk Management

SIA’s Safety Risk Management policy guides the organisation in proactively identifying 

risks. Measures are subsequently implemented to mitigate the risks to levels that are 

acceptable and necessary to enhance the value of the Company.

Recurrent Training

This programme is mandated by the 

regulators to ensure that aircraft systems 

and certain manoeuvres are completed in 

a three-year cycle. It is conducted twice a 

year in the full-flight simulator. It seeks to 

enhance our pilots’ proficiency in handling 

abnormal and emergency situations. 

In the world of automation, the 

Recurrent Training programme also 

allows our pilots to maintain their mastery 

in manual flight under different situations 

and environmental conditions.

SEP Training

This annual training refreshes pilots’

proficiency and knowledge, testing them

in the areas of aircraft emergency

procedures and cabin safety.

CRM Training

This refresher course is conducted once 

every three years to revalidate the pilots’ 

knowledge and application of

non-technical skills.

Recency Training

This programme is conducted to requalify 

pilots who have not flown an aircraft for 

more than 35 days.

Developmental Training

Pilot Development Unit is a dedicated

unit in the Flight Crew Training department 

which oversees the training and

development of SIA pilots, ranging from 

First Officers to Captains and Instructors.

This unit engages in-house trained

instructors and facilitators, as well as

external consultants with the aim of 

achieving the highest standards of

developmental training.

Other Training

Apart from training mandated by regulators, SIA also conducts other forms of training 

for our pilots which is deemed beneficial or necessary in enhancing their knowledge, 

skills and aptitude. This training takes into account their operating experience and recent 

events or incidents in the aviation industry as part of the Evidence and Event-based training 

programme. The Flight Crew Training department also participates in aviation training 

conferences and seminars by industry organisations and aircraft manufacturers. 

As part of the continual revalidation process, every pilot undergoes a minimum of three 

checks a year. These checks ensure that the pilots’ knowledge, manual flying skills and 

flight deck management skills are continuously practised, refreshed and tested. Base 

Checks are bi-annual and conducted in the full-flight simulator. Pilots must demonstrate 

competency in manual flying under various conditions and manage abnormal and

emergency scenarios. Line Checks are also conducted annually to ensure that their 

knowledge and skills in operating a regular flight are in accordance with company

policies and standard operating procedures. These checks continue throughout the 

pilots’ careers.

As part of pilot development, the Pilot Mentoring programme further elevates our pilots 

to a higher level of competency and professionalism, reinforcing SIA’s core values.

This programme plays a pivotal role in moulding our pilots’ development through

coaching and role modelling.

SIA’s Safety Performance (Cont’d)

Globally, all caterers are certified by their relevant local authorities for food safety 

and hygiene. Caterers are required to comply with their local laws and regulations. 

They will advise SIA of such regulations during the development of meals, so that the 

meals prepared are in line with local regulations. Health and safety impact assessments 

are evaluated through the following: 

• Invitations to tender to suppliers have to comply with local legislation and 

regulatory requirements

• Review of products during prototype stage

• Suppliers’ certifications

• Suppliers’ contractual obligations to adhere to local authorities’ health and 

safety requirements

In FY2017/18, SIA did not record any incidents of non-compliance to food safety 

and hygiene that resulted in any fines, penalties or warnings.

Food Safety

SIA is committed to serving in-flight meals that meet the highest levels of food

safety and hygiene. We have a policy of not using Monosodium Glutamate in the 

meals served to our passengers. Our caterers ensure that ingredients are sourced 

from licenced and accredited establishments which conform to the requirements of 

relevant regulatory authorities, as well as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control 

Points (HACCP) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) systems. 

The Quality Assurance team from our local caterer, SATS Ltd, conducts factory 

audits on external suppliers, regular laboratory tests and random quality checks 

on incoming raw ingredients.

Locally-manufactured items are procured from establishments licensed by the

Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore, or the equivalent authority in

other countries. In addition to our caterers’ food safety compliance with their local 

regulations, SIA has engaged Medina Quality Assurance to conduct regular audits

on SATS Ltd and selected overseas stations.

Fatigue Risk Management (FRM)

As with any hazard, SIA actively monitors fatigue issues of both our pilots and cabin crew. Crew rest facilities on our aircraft are 

regularly evaluated to ensure proper rest is available for crew on duty. SIA continuously monitors, evaluates and mitigates crew fatigue. 

We submit our reports to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) on a regular basis. All feedback from crew is considered in a 

tripartite manner, involving SIA’s Safety, Security and Environment Division, Flight Operations Division and the Air Line Pilots Association 

Singapore (ALPA-S). SIA is also an active member of the IATA Fatigue Management Task Force, which keeps abreast of the latest regulatory 

and industry developments in this area. 

 

Aircraft Maintenance

Engineering Division’s pursuit of operational and technical excellence is fuelled by the strong correlation between safety and reliability.

Our aircraft maintenance complies with the requirements set by CAAS, as well as the recommendations of the International Civil Aviation 

Organization (ICAO). 

While this focus on achieving high standards in aircraft maintenance remains a key objective, the drive towards a safe working environment 

for our staff and contractors is also a priority. The incorporation of Safety Management System practices into airworthiness requirements 

by both CAAS and ICAO has given fresh impetus to the Engineering Division’s longstanding emphasis on ‘Safe Aircraft, Safely Maintained’. 

For this reason, our Engineering Division has sought, attained and maintained accreditation by TUV SUD PSB Pte Ltd, a global testing, 

certification, inspection and training provider, in the following aspects:

Passenger Safety

Our cabin crew are enrolled in various safety and security courses, such as SEP training and the FRM programme. They are also 

trained in situational awareness, with an emphasis on workplace safety. Information on passenger safety is shared with cabin crew 

through videos, circulars, campaigns and regular communication sessions. The importance of balancing service with safety and 

security is also consistently emphasised through these channels. We target zero high-severity incidents annually.

Customer Service and Engagement

Customer service remains a crucial differentiator for Singapore Airlines.

We continue to place emphasis on the quality of service customers receive 

at all Singapore Airlines touchpoints: pre-flight, on board and post-flight.

We also actively listen to our customers through verbal and written feedback, 

focus groups and surveys.

Social media has become an important channel through which we interact with our customers, allowing 

communication of important travel information as well as to obtain feedback from our customers on a 

daily basis. A dedicated 24/7 Social Media Engagement Unit (SMEU) has been in place since September 

2014 to provide quick responses to feedback from customers and real-time service recovery on our social 

media channels. Last year, the Weibo accounts for both Singapore Airlines and SilkAir were merged to 

enable seamless communication with our customers in China. 

SIA currently has Facebook pages in seven different languages, including English, French, German,

Indonesian, Italian, Spanish and Turkish, to better reach out to customers in different regions. These

platforms provide additional contact points for greater online customer engagement.

Stakeholder Engagement: Customers (Cont’d)

Enhancing Customer Experience 

Singapore Airlines conducted a survey in 2017 via the in-flight entertainment (IFE) system 

to find out customers’ interest in receiving personalised content. Survey results were 

positive and customers indicated their preference for personalised content to be accessed 

via their KrisFlyer membership account. Using the results, the Customer Experience (CE) 

department worked with IFE developers and subsequently conducted user tests with 

customers for personalised content. 

 

In November 2017, SIA unveiled new cabin products to be fitted on the A380 aircraft, together 

with a wide range of in-flight offerings which included the launch of myKrisWorld, a new  

interactive IFE feature. This personalised IFE experience includes content recommendations 

based on customer preferences and viewing history. KrisFlyer members are able to bookmark 

and resume content, as well as customise and save preferences on myKrisWorld for  

subsequent flights. This new IFE feature is also available on Singapore Airlines’ Boeing 787-10 

Dreamliners, which the Airline took delivery of in March 2018.  

 

As part of Singapore Airlines’ ongoing efforts to be more environmentally friendly, CE has 

started moving away from hardcopy customer feedback forms and now provides customers 

with the option of providing feedback through digital platforms such as online surveys. 

The new feedback system has been very well received by customers. The questionnaire 

has also been revised to be much shorter, based on feedback from customers. CE aims to 

launch a fully electronic feedback system by FY2019/20, eliminating the need for hardcopy 

feedback forms.



Singapore Airlines has a dedicated Customer Affairs (CA) department which attends to 

feedback and enquiries from customers. Where necessary, investigations are carried out 

and the department targets to respond to all feedback and enquiries within 10 working days. 

 

Where required, appropriate service recovery is taken to resolve service lapses, address 

customer concerns and restore confidence in the SIA brand promise. In line with SIA’s 

pursuit of excellence, CA shares trends and insights from case investigations with the 

relevant business units. Taking feedback and concerns into consideration, business units will 

regularly review the Airline’s service and product offerings, as well as operational procedures. 

 

As part of SIA’s ongoing efforts to better address customers’ concerns, CA strives to 

further leverage technology and data analytics to enhance feedback handling and 

interaction with customers. The use of analytics will also identify pertinent issues 

more accurately, so as to help the relevant departments better anticipate needs and 

service customers. A case management system is also in place to track individual case 

assignments and closures. Case assignment tracking and management reports are 

prepared regularly to monitor the achieved response rates. To track customer satisfaction, 

CA monitors the number of replies received from customers, as it reflects whether 

customers’ concerns have been adequately addressed. 

 

In the next three years, CA aims to encourage more customers to take up self-help options 

which are currently available on our website, such as generating their own flight disruption 

statements online. The flight disruption portal was introduced in July 2017 and a review 

will be conducted in the first quarter of FY2018/19 to determine if it has reached the target 

of a 50 per cent reduction in the issuance of manual flight disruption statements. Additionally, 

CA targets to use electronic service recovery vouchers within the next three years.  

 

To continually improve customer servicing, CA prepares a monthly Service Quality 

Performance report on compliments and complaints received, to enable business units 

to track and refine their service performance. The Service Quality Committee, chaired 

by Senior Vice President Customer Services and Operations, meets bi-monthly to review 

customer trends and anticipate customer needs. With a focus on elevating SIA’s overall 

service standards, the committee closely monitors the end-to-end customer experience 

and formulates strategies to achieve service improvement.

Customer Satisfaction

Our Customer Contact Services (CCS) department manages various customer servicing channels such as calls, emails and web chats. Customers may contact 

Singapore Airlines through these platforms for reservations and ticketing enquiries, among other requests.  

 

Customer satisfaction is an important measure in SIA’s journey to uphold service excellence. Customer surveys are among the methods Singapore Airlines 

uses to measure customer satisfaction. Survey responses provide feedback on how well our customer service representatives understand and meet our customers’ 

needs. Customers are able to opt in for post-servicing surveys prior to the start of their call. The surveys are designed to be short and to the point so as to 

increase participation rates.  

 

Results from these surveys and all customer feedback are monitored regularly. When customers share their feedback with us, their main concerns are identified 

and these issues are re-evaluated with the relevant staff or department for follow-up or improvement. 

 

Customer Privacy

When servicing customers’ reservation and ticketing requests, CCS may collect and access customers’ personal data. The confidentiality of such customer 

information is respected and safeguarded as employees abide strictly by SIA’s Privacy Policy, which is available on our website, as well as the guidelines laid out 

by the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) of Singapore. Any collection, use and disclosure of customer data through channels such as calls and emails can 

only be used for the purpose of customer servicing. 

During customer interactions, our customer service representatives also perform verification and authentication to ensure that customers’ personal data is 

not revealed to unauthorised personnel. These processes have been drawn up in consultation with the Company’s Legal department to ensure strict compliance 

with the PDPA. Audit processes such as monthly call calibrations are conducted to ensure that our vendors are compliant with our policies pertaining to the 

protection of customer data. 

In addition, CCS regularly reviews processes and customer feedback to identify issues pertaining to customer data protection. Any issues identified will be 

evaluated in consultation with the Legal department to better align them with SIA’s Privacy Policy and the PDPA.

Apart from CCS, Customer Affairs (CA) department also abides strictly by SIA’s Privacy Policy. While CA accesses customer data such as personal particulars 

and customers’ travel history with the Airline in the course of handling feedback, all data is treated as strictly confidential. Complaints, queries, withdrawal of 

consent, requests for access, corrections and updates in relation to personal data must be handled according to established internal organisational processes. 

These processes have been drawn up in consultation with the Legal department to ensure strict compliance with the PDPA. This compliance thus cultivates 

confidence among customers who entrust the Airline with their personal data, facilitating the provision of a safe, smooth, efficient and customised experience.

SOAR as ONE

Despite changes in the airline industry, customer service across all touchpoints remains at the core of Singapore Airlines’ brand promise. To strengthen SIA’s 

service culture, the SOAR as ONE framework was introduced in May 2017 as the Airline’s guiding service philosophy. It underlines a commitment to extend 

service excellence throughout the SIA Group and among service partners under a single, unified call to action. 

 

SOAR as ONE aims to enable frontliners to better appreciate and understand their roles in the SIA service chain, as well as their impact on the overall customer 

experience. This sets the stage for SIA to reinforce a service culture that engenders consistently high service delivery standards across all customer touchpoints. 

Service beliefs and standards, structured service training programmes, service audits as well as performance metrics and service recognition schemes provide 

a framework which drives a strong service culture in Singapore Airlines. Since 2004, the annual CEO Service Excellence Awards, formerly known as the CEO 

Transforming Customer Service Awards, have been recognising exemplary individuals and teams for their outstanding service performance throughout the 

year, encouraging frontliners to uphold SIA’s reputation of service excellence.

Singapore.

We expect all employees to comply with the staff regulations set out in their employment 

contracts. Singapore Airlines has an established Disciplinary Inquiry Process to handle 

cases of misconduct. Such proceedings are recorded and a summary report of each 

inquiry is submitted to Senior Management. 

The Company’s staff regulations are also reviewed regularly by Human Resources Division 

and Legal department to ensure relevancy. Changes are communicated to all staff in a 

timely manner. The number of grievances to third parties, if any, are captured annually 

and reported in Singapore Airlines’ Sustainability Report.



Industrial Relations

Singapore Airlines has a close working relationship with the Air-Transport Executive Staff Union (AESU), Air Line Pilots Association

Singapore (ALPA-S), and Singapore Airlines Staff Union (SIASU) to put in place sustainable terms and conditions of service which are 

encapsulated within the respective Collective Agreements. Progressive wage increments benchmarked against company performance 

and productivity growth are also discussed with our unions. Approximately 98 per cent of SIA employees are covered by collective  

bargaining agreements. 

A collaborative partnership approach is adopted in our engagements with the unions. Management and union leaders meet monthly to 

address matters pertaining to the workforce and share updates on company initiatives. New initiatives aimed at developing our employees’ 

careers and competencies are also explored during these forums. 

In FY2017/18, Singapore Airlines successfully launched several programmes to ensure the continuous development of employees’ 

skills, bolstering an improvement in individual performance and productivity.

SIA’s Chairman and Senior Management have quarterly lunch meetings with union leaders to share the Company’s business outlook 

and discuss workforce matters. Union leaders are also invited to company functions such as product launches, aircraft arrival ceremonies, 

retirement and long service award ceremonies, as well as SIA’s Business Meetings. Union-Management retreats are also organised for 

both parties to discuss long-term strategic workforce initiatives.



The health and well-being of our employees are important to 

Singapore Airlines, and crucial to the success of the Company.

Performance and Productivity

SIA Core Values and Leadership 

Competency Framework

Singapore Airlines’ Core Values and Leadership 

Competency framework were refreshed in 

FY2016/17. Our core values define who we are 

as an organisation, while the Leadership 

Competency framework provides clarity on the 

competencies required and behaviour expected of 

an SIA leader, synched with our core values. With 

the alignment of core values and competencies, 

it creates a powerful force for SIA’s continued 

growth and success. These core values and  

leadership competencies are also reinforced in 

our onboarding programme and embedded in the 

performance development system. 

 

Careers@SIA

Introduced in April 2016, the Careers@SIA 

framework aims to provide all head office ground 

employees with equal opportunities to achieve 

their career aspirations in the Company. Under 

the framework, employees can aspire to progress 

up the ranks based on their competencies, job 

performance and the potential they have to take 

on an enlarged job scope.

Performance Development by Integrated 

Talent Management Suite (myTMS)

In April 2017, a new performance management 

system was introduced. The new system focuses 

on goal alignment, ongoing feedback and 

empowering employees to take charge of their 

own development. Talent sourcing is also 

managed through myTMS to bring about more 

efficiencies such as analytics capabilities as it 

provides a holistic view of all talent development 

processes. 

 

All permanent SIA employees received their 

regular performance and career development 

review in FY2017/18.

Employee Engagement

Singapore Airlines’ employees are engaged through communications via the following channels: internal platforms, events, wellness and health activities, 

community service as well as social functions. In addition, staff surveys are conducted regularly to measure the level of engagement with employees.

Staff are also encouraged to join quarterly breakfast sessions with SIA’s CEO (for all staff) and HR forums (for managerial grade staff) to discuss matters pertaining to 

the Company. 

In May 2017, past and present SIA Group staff and family members were invited to Singapore Airlines’ Family Day to celebrate SIA’s 70th anniversary and to 

raise funds for charity. A commemorative book, ‘A Great Adventure - Singapore Airlines’ 70-Year Journey’, which documents SIA’s milestones, was produced 

and given to all employees.

In June 2017, SIA Group staff celebrated 50 years of Singapore’s National Service (NS) by turning up in their NS uniform or army-themed wear. Games such 

as an interactive Laser Gun Challenge were also organised to celebrate the occasion. Frontline ground staff in Singapore also wore NS50 pins to mark their 

appreciation for NS Men’s services to the nation. In FY2017/18, a total of 95,918 hours of reservist time off was granted to male employees.

1SQ app, Singapore Airlines’ first-ever employee mobile app, was launched in February 2018 to allow staff on-the-go access to the latest company news and 

corporate deals, and submit leave requests and claims conveniently. The launch of this app marks a step in our journey towards creating a consumer-grade 

employee experience within the organisation. New features will be added in design sprints, adopting an agile methodology.

Examples of internal communication channels which provide updates on news and information include: 

• Bi-annual Business Meetings to communicate the SIA Group’s commercial activities and financial results

• Internal online platform that enables interaction among employees, improving productivity and collaboration at work

• LCD TVs in common areas such as canteens, meeting rooms and Cabin Crew Control Centre, which broadcast company-related videos and news

• Outlook, SIA’s in-house monthly magazine

• Quarterly pulse surveys to gather feedback from employees to help shape SIA’s transformation journey

• Senior Management engagement sessions at various courses 

• SIA’s corporate Intranet site with each division having its own portal to disseminate information specific to its area of work

• Other forms of employee engagement include regular communication sessions, departmental debriefs, as well as sessions between senior managers 

and team members

Singapore Airlines’ staff lounge at Airline House, 7Degrees, has been well received by employees as it provides them with a space to unwind and network. 

The lounge also serves as an alternate venue to hot desk, as well as to hold meetings and social functions. 

Regular fleet meetings are held to brief pilots on the Company’s financial performance as well as company matters. Recent aviation-related events, trends and 

industry developments are also shared with operational crew at Safety Focus Forums held once every two months, as well as through fleet meetings, instructor 

meetings, event bulletins and circulars. Flight Operations Division also engages with its pilots and ground staff through social events throughout the year. 

This helps to foster better understanding, teamwork and camaraderie amongst all employees in the division. 

Cabin crew are engaged via social media, web-based applications, as well as face-to-face dialogues. Held monthly, each session will see up to 30 crew participants 

who discuss and obtain updates on matters pertaining to the Company or their duties. To reach out to more crew members, informal gatherings with Ward 

Management Leaders are held regularly at the Cabin Crew Control Centre.

Ground Staff Training

Structured learning roadmaps help SIA 

provide targeted training for employees at 

different stages of their careers. All courses are 

developed to meet the strategic objectives of the 

Company and are reviewed regularly to ensure 

alignment to changing business needs.  

 

In FY2017/18, CLC introduced a flagship 

Leadership Series, targeting leadership 

competencies expected from employees in 

different grades. CLC also developed a new  

‘Developing People, Driving Performance’  

programme in support of the Company’s  

movement towards a performance development 

culture. 

 

In line with national initiatives, the Future@Work 

suite of courses was launched to cultivate a 

future-ready workforce equipped with digital 

skills. Courses focused on agile methodology, 

data analytics and design thinking across  

different job functions and levels. 

 

As part of our ‘SIA Future Learning’ scheme, the 

Company provides a one-time subsidy of up to 

$500 for staff to learn via a curated catalogue 

of SkillsFuture courses. This is in addition to 

the $500 grant from the Singapore government 

and the $250 grant from NTUC’s Union Training 

Assistance Programme.

 

CLC seeks to continue enhancing the suite of 

courses available, adopting new digital tools and 

technologies to aid blended learning, and drive a 

culture of self-directed learning throughout the 

Company.

Community Service

Our employees continue to serve the community passionately through group visits to homes, outings 

with beneficiaries and fundraising initiatives throughout the financial year. The spirit of giving was  

also not forgotten during festive periods when employees granted the wishes of TOUCH Ubi Hostel  

beneficiaries in December 2017. 

 

As part of SIA’s 70th anniversary celebrations, a total of $2.55 million was raised for the Community 

Chest through three fundraising events supported by more than 1,000 staff volunteers. Proceeds from 

the SIA Family Day, SIA Charity Gala and the SIA Group Charity Run went towards supporting beneficiaries 

from social service organisations under the Community Chest. 

 

Training

In line with the Company’s mission, core values and business objectives, the Corporate Learning Centre 

(CLC) adopts an integrated approach to learning and development. This is achieved through the alignment 

of competencies, which enables us to drive performance. 

 

Our employees are a key competitive asset, and Singapore Airlines places strong emphasis on their 

development. Significant resources are invested to develop our employees globally. In FY2017/18, we 

invested a total of $32.5 million in training and development, which includes a $1.4 million training 

grant from SkillsFuture Singapore. Each employee also underwent an average of 5.4 days of training 

during the financial year in review.

Cabin Crew and Pilots

Crew Welfare

Singapore Airlines ensures that our flying crew have ample time to rest during layovers and after flights. 

In addition to rest days, cabin crew and pilots are given in-flight rest on longer flights. The in-flight rest 

periods exceed mandatory requirements stipulated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. Singapore 

Airlines regularly shares information on fatigue risk management to encourage our flying crew to have 

adequate rest before they report for their flight duties. 

 

Extracurricular Activities (ECA)

Our cabin crew and ground staff from the Cabin Crew Division can choose from 24 ECAs covering a 

wide range of interests to participate in. To hone their creative and artistic talents, crew can opt to join 

the Cabin Crew Performing Arts Circle, Music Society or the Creative Circle. For crew who enjoy outdoor 

activities, they can participate in the Cabin Crew Football Circle or Cabin Crew Shuttlers. Other interest 

groups include the Fitness and Nutrition Circle, Toastmasters, Wine Appreciation Group, as well as Grains 

and Pixels.

Returning Crew Scheme

As the safety of our staff is of utmost importance to Singapore Airlines, pregnant crew are not permitted 

to carry out duties on flights. Under the Returning Crew Scheme, we encourage crew to return to their 

flying duties after delivering their child. After meeting a pre-set list of criteria under this scheme, cabin 

crew can return to their flying duties with minimum disruption to their careers, with their previous years 

of service retained.  

 

The Company reaches out to crew who left due to their pregnancy to attend bi-annual talks conducted 

by healthcare professionals so as to encourage and assist them to return to their flying duties. Every 

year, SIA aims to organise two such health talks. There was a 40 per cent increase in the number of  

successful applications for this scheme in FY2017/18. We target to achieve a 100 per cent increase in 

the number of applications by FY2023/24. 

 

This initiative is reviewed at divisional level meetings, which take place on a quarterly basis. The progress 

of the initiative is reviewed and appropriate action plans are implemented to ensure targets are met by 

the set timelines.  

 

Career Transition Programme

To prepare crew who wish to continue working beyond retirement, a Career Transition Guide and a list 

of career opportunities will be shared with them six months before retirement. Potential employers will 

be informed to make contact with retiring crew. Financial management courses are also available to 

help crew make sound financial decisions in preparation for their retirement. 

 

Digitisation of Crew Reports and Resources

Our cabin crew are provided with tablets to help digitise onboard work processes and to aid them in 

providing better customer service. Singapore Airlines’ digital drive has led to greater efficiencies as well 

as an improvement in environmental sustainability. Constituting over 90 per cent of all voyage reports, 

digital reports have led to a significant reduction in paper consumption. In addition to digitising manuals 

and procedural documents, digital reports were introduced to further reduce our corporate carbon 

footprint. Singapore Airlines targets to go fully paperless for voyage reports by FY2020/21. Additionally, 

the Cabin Crew Division is working towards a paperless cabin crew uniform requisition process, which 

is targeted to be fully implemented by FY2020/21. These targets are tracked at quarterly divisional 

meetings.  

 

Project World At Your Fingertips (W@YF) was implemented in August 2016 to harness the use of  

technology and mobility to increase the timeliness of operational information transmission to pilots. 

All pilots were issued iPads in a bid to go paperless. Pilots are now able to access applications such 

as enhanced weather awareness (eWAS), a centralised and tailored document repository (Aerodocs), as 

well as airport navigation and terminal charts (Jeppesen FD Professional).

Harnessing Technology for Training

Under the Company’s paperless movement, Cabin Crew Training department implemented a series of 

initiatives geared towards paperless training. In addition to course completion certificates, all course 

materials and handouts are digitised and available on the Corporate Learning Platform. 

 

Adoption of technology has also enhanced the classroom learning experience, creating multi-channel 

learning opportunities for our crew. Apart from sharing observations, instructors and participants can 

also make use of live streaming and recording capabilities to capture their performance in class for 

review and improvement. 

 

Classroom training has become more interactive with the use of e-tools. Through real-time polling sites, 

instructors are able to create simple quizzes and receive participants’ results immediately. These changes 

have resulted in an increase in participation and engagement rates, making learning more enjoyable 

and interactive. 

 

Cabin Crew Training

All new cabin crew members undergo a 14-week basic training programme which includes a variety of 

modules such as social etiquette, personal grooming, meal service procedures, food knowledge and 

wine appreciation courses. Crew will have to complete a series of classroom and on-the-job training 

before they can perform their flight duties on board. 

 

Cabin crew are also taught passenger handling skills, which include techniques in interacting with 

young children, the elderly and mobility-challenged individuals. They are also taught skills to communicate 

with our customers. This area of training equips our crew with skills to better understand and meet the 

needs of a wide range of customers. In line with Singapore Airlines’ focus on safety and security, our 

crew are also trained in security, safety and first aid procedures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation 

(CPR) during their basic training programme. 

 

Beyond functional skills required for cabin crew to carry out their duties on board, opportunities for 

self-development are provided through our Self-Directed Learning programme. A wide range of courses 

such as skills development in languages, culinary arts, training and leadership, as well as people  

management, are offered. This empowers our crew to take control of their development needs and 

complements their core skillsets with selected certified professional competencies. 

Pilot Training

Singapore Airlines designs and conducts training programmes for our pilots to achieve the highest 

standard of training that meets all regulatory requirements and SIA’s training objectives. 

 

Apart from mandatory training programmes, development programmes are conducted across all ranks 

to enhance their operational competencies and flying skills. 

 

In addition, a mentoring framework is put in place to facilitate our pilots’ competency and professionalism, 

and instil the Company’s core values in them. More details on our flight operations training can be 

found on page 20 of this report.

Other Forms of Training

Air Sommelier Scheme

Suitable crew are identified and trained to be sommeliers on board to provide professional wine services 

to our customers. 

 

To be eligible for the Air Sommelier Scheme, cabin crew must attain the internationally-recognised Wine 

and Spirit Education Trust’s (WSET) Level 3 Award in Wines Certification. In addition, crew are required to  

attend a six-month in-house programme with training workshops, periodic assessments and assignments. 

Successful participants who obtain the WSET Level 3 Certificate and pass the in-house programme will 

earn an Air Sommelier badge on their uniform. 

 

Air Sommeliers are expected to strengthen their tasting skills and wine knowledge regularly. This is 

achieved through obtaining professional certifications, as well as attending tasting sessions and seminars 

by wine experts. To ensure that they stay abreast of trends and maintain adequate knowledge and skills, 

all Air Sommeliers are required to sit for an annual proficiency assessment. 

 

Foreign Language Scheme

Singapore Airlines currently has two foreign language schemes available to our cabin crew, namely 

French Language and German Language Schemes. 

 

Cabin crew selected for these schemes will undergo training at established language institutes. 

Through an intensive eight-week course, the crew will be inducted into the language and culture. Upon 

graduation, they will attain a level of proficiency required to attend to the needs of our French or  

German-speaking customers. 

 

Crew members under this scheme will don a name tag bearing the French or German flag, and operate 

on specific flight sectors requiring their language skills. They also undergo annual refresher training 

and have their language proficiency assessed at least once a year. 

 

Partnership with SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG)

Singapore Airlines is an In-house Approved Training Organisation supported by SSG and offers many 

Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) accredited courses for our cabin crew. Nationally-recognised 

Statements of Attainment are issued to all participants who successfully complete the courses and 

pass their assessments. Crew who graduate from the initial Cabin Crew Readiness Programme (CCRP) 

will achieve a nationally-recognised certification under the WSQ Service Excellence framework. 

 

Building on the accreditation of the CCRP programme, Singapore Airlines’ Cabin Crew Leaders 

Programme (CCLP) was accredited with the Advanced Certificate in Service Excellence under the 

nationally-recognised WSQ Service Excellence Competency Framework in 2017. About 200 

newly-promoted cabin crew leaders are expected to benefit from this certification each year. 

 

All crew who complete the CCLP are awarded a WSQ Advanced Certificate in Service Excellence. This 

accreditation ensures that SIA’s training programme is benchmarked against national standards, and 

reinforces the importance of empowering our employees with nationally-recognised certifications for 

training and development. This initiative reaffirms SIA’s commitment and ability to continue attracting 

the best talent and support to grow the Company.

Singapore Airlines’ Supply Chain

Singapore Airlines strives to integrate sustainability across the various touchpoints of our customers’ journey. As such, it is 

important to work closely with our partners and suppliers within the supply chain to constantly explore ways to improve and 

integrate sustainability across all aspects of our operations. Divisions such as Customer Experience, Customer Services and 

Operations, as well as Engineering among others, work closely to ensure that the key aspects of our customers’ experience 

are met in a satisfactory manner.  

 

Our commitment to providing air transportation services of the highest quality begins on the ground when a customer makes 

a booking with us, then at check-in, followed by on board the aircraft and finally, assisting customers who have feedback and 

require post-flight services.

Supply Chain Expenditure

With more than 13,000 suppliers worldwide, Singapore Airlines’ supply chain is managed by many departments across the  

organisation. SIA’s supply chain expenditure primarily focuses on aircraft maintenance and rental, fuel costs, in-flight food 

and beverages, as well as ground operations and handling. SIA also outsources certain key airline-related operations to 

third-party service providers. These include aircraft cleaning and maintenance, catering, certain aspects of customer servicing 

as well as ground handling operations. In FY2017/18, the total expenditure for suppliers’ services engaged by Singapore 

Airlines was over $10 billion.

 

Singapore Airlines works closely with our partners and suppliers to 

explore ways to improve and integrate sustainability across all 

aspects of our operations.

Environmentally 

friendly proposals 

are favourably 

considered

Environmental

management is 

a key parameter 

in our supplier 

assessment

In line with our focus on sustainability, Singapore Airlines has adopted the following 

best practices in our engagement with suppliers:

Suppliers’ Compliance with Applicable Laws

SIA has provisions in purchasing contracts that require suppliers to commit and warrant 

that the items supplied are in compliance with all applicable laws and related requirements, 

including but not limited to employment laws, industrial laws and labour laws. 

Bio-Degradable Material

SIA welcomes proposals from suppliers that include bio-degradable or recyclable 

materials as alternatives to more commonly used raw materials such as aluminium 

and plastics. 

Lightweight Design

Our Product Innovation department engages SIA Engineering Company, a subsidiary 

of SIA, to build, repair and modify our aircraft cabin interiors as well as seat mock-ups. 

We are constantly exploring lighter-weight designs of cabin and in-flight items such as 

cutlery. This helps to reduce the amount of fuel needed for flights, which in turn helps 

to cut down emissions. We also look to technological advancements that enable 

lightweight design of aircraft cabin interiors such as seats and in-flight entertainment 

systems.

Engineering Spares 

SIA’s policy is to source for spares only from Original Equipment Manufacturers and 

their accredited agents even though the procurement of engineering spares has been 

outsourced. For engineering components, repair organisations are required to be certified 

and approved by internationally-recognised authorities such as Australia’s Civil Aviation 

Safety Authority, European Aviation Safety Agency, Hong Kong’s Civil Aviation Department, 

Transport Canada Civil Aviation and the US Federal Aviation Administration, before any 

procurement is carried out. 

Consistent with our Safety Management System practices, we have in place key performance 

indicators for warehousing operations to monitor performance in all aspects, including 

health and the environment, quality and safety. While we have outsourced warehouse 

operations to supply chain company Bolloré Logistics, our Engineering Division continues 

to chair a joint monthly Warehouse Safety Committee meeting to ensure compliance 

with our environmental, health and safety standards. Bolloré is included in our ISO 

accreditation by TUV SUD PSB Pte Ltd, a globally-recognised company that provides 

product testing, inspection and certification services.

Sourcing Suppliers with Sustainable Business Practices

SIA encourages and welcomes suppliers to submit environmentally friendly proposals. 

Such proposals are favourably considered during the product assessment and selection 

stage. For example, we request suppliers to declare in their bid submission if their paper 

products comply with Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) guidelines. Commercial Supplies 

department aims to ensure paper suppliers have an FSC certification or are able to 

show that raw materials are not sourced from errant suppliers blacklisted by the local 

government, where such a list exists. 

The FSC is an international non-profit, multi-stakeholder organisation established in 

1993 to promote responsible management of the world’s forests. Its main tools for 

achieving this are standards-setting, independent certification and labelling of forest 

products. 

Environmental Management

Environmental management is one of the key parameters in our assessment of suppliers. 

SIA’s Commercial Supplies department conducts factory visits when opportunities arise, 

to assess if the suppliers have proper environmental management practices such as  

ISO 14001 in place. If suppliers are found to be errant, contracts will be prematurely  

terminated. These suppliers will subsequently be barred from doing business with SIA. 

Recycling Obsolete or Scrap Products

As much as it is practicable, we work with suppliers to collect obsolete items from 

Singapore Airlines’ local offices and facilities for recycling. These include paper-based, 

plastic and metal products. SIA is also in the midst of implementing food waste recycling 

within the Airline House canteen in Singapore. 

Improving Quality of Service to Our Customers

On top of monitoring the performance of suppliers through the Service Level Agreements 

in our contracts, feedback from customers about their ground and in-flight experience  

is obtained. This enables us to further improve on the quality of products and services.

Feedback from 

customers helps to 

improve the quality 

of SIA’s products and 

services

Basic Requirements for Catering and Handling Services

It is mandatory for our caterers to comply strictly with local laws and regulations with respect to hygiene, safety and security. Facilities used for storage, 

preparation as well as the production and transportation of meals and beverages must meet the standards set by the International Air Transport Association 

(IATA), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points concept developed and administered by the 

International Flight Catering Association and International Flight Services Association.  

 

All catering and ground handling companies must comply with the IATA Aircraft Handling Manual to ensure ground safety. A copy of the aircraft handling 

safety standards is included as part of the contract. Catering and ground handling staff also receive adequate training to operate in our aircraft.  

 

Each supplier is required to have a system in place to monitor the training needs of their employees to ensure proficiency. Examples of such training include 

opening aircraft doors, driving ground support equipment, handling catering equipment in high lifts and IATA dangerous goods awareness regulations.  

Reducing Food Wastage

SIA engages caterers to ascertain the amount and type of food wasted after each flight, and to adjust our uplift accordingly. Beyond the initiatives on board, 

SIA aims to raise awareness of food wastage and embark on initiatives such as food waste recycling, food donations and reduced packaging in FY2018/19.

Anti-Corruption Practices

Clauses on anti-corruption and anti-bribery practices have been included in all new contracts since June 2012. The clauses mandate that all suppliers, including 

but not limited to ground handling agents and caterers, must comply with all local laws where they operate. This includes the acceptance of payments, gifts 

or other items to secure an improper advantage or to influence any decision or act, directly or indirectly. Suppliers are to inform SIA immediately should they 

learn of any such violations.

Suppliers’ Code of Conduct

The Suppliers’ Code of Conduct was developed in accordance with SIA’s business values, with the intention of promoting sustainable development. Suppliers 

are required to comply with the code of conduct that forms part of the contract. It is also based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact related to 

human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption, and takes into account operational, social and environmental issues.  

 

In the event a supplier is unable to include the code of conduct in their contract, a review is carried out by the Public Affairs department and a waiver can only 

be approved by Divisional Vice President Public Affairs or his/her alternate. Through the introduction of the Suppliers’ Code of Conduct, SIA aims to have oversight  

of appointed suppliers’ conduct, and mitigate any potential impact they might have to the environment they operate in.  

 

The Suppliers’ Code of Conduct can be found on page 37 of this report.

Evaluation of Suppliers

Suppliers are evaluated on both cost and quality of the products and services provided. To aid the evaluation process, suppliers are required to provide background 

information on the company, its current operations and clients. In addition, suppliers which participate in SIA’s request for proposal exercises are deemed to 

have agreed with the terms set out in the Suppliers’ Code of Conduct. SIA’s long-term target is to conduct spot checks on suppliers when opportunities arise.

Singapore Airlines is proud to play a part in helping to better the lives of 

beneficiaries and will continue our support in the years ahead.

Singapore Airlines recognises the importance of building strong 

relationships, not only with customers and business partners, but 

also with the many communities we serve. Corporate donations, 

sponsorships and staff volunteerism are just some of the ways in 

which Singapore Airlines extends support to a wide range of

community groups. They include charities, educational institutions, 

arts and sports events as well as the environment and conservation.

Community Projects in Singapore

With a longstanding commitment to help grow the Singapore arts scene, Singapore 

Airlines continued to support the National Arts Council, Singapore Chinese Orchestra,

Singapore Dance Theatre, Singapore Lyric Opera and Singapore Symphony Orchestra.

In 2017, Singapore Airlines was named ‘Friend of the Arts’ by the National Arts Council, 

for our ongoing contribution to Singapore’s arts scene.

In the educational sector, Singapore Airlines continued to provide opportunities to 

students for them to realise their full academic potential. Cash and air ticket sponsorships 

were given to organisations such as LASALLE College of the Arts, as well as NTUC 

Education and Training Fund to encourage students and working adults to upgrade 

their skillsets. 



Staff also actively volunteered with charitable organisations such as the Asian

Women’s Welfare Association and Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore, among many

others. To engage the beneficiaries, staff volunteers brought them on tours to the

SIA Training Centre as well as Resorts World Sentosa’s S.E.A. Aquarium. 

In February 2018, over 100 volunteers from SIA’s Cabin Crew Club for Community  

Care collaborated with Fei Yue Family Service Centre to bring together over 300  

elderly and 80 children from low-income families for a fun-filled day of activities at a 

local community club. Staff volunteers shared interesting information about the airline 

industry with the children and taught them essential service skills such as how to serve 

food and beverages, food nutrition knowledge and public speaking. Other activities, such as  

a lion dance performance, Zumba session, as well as song and dance performances 

were also arranged for the beneficiaries to enjoy. 

As a supporter of the Community Chest, a non-profit organisation that raises funds  

to empower beneficiaries in Singapore, Singapore Airlines participated in the annual 

Fu Dai event where volunteers packed goodie bags and delivered them to the less 

fortunate to spread joy during the Lunar New Year in February 2018. 

Through the Community Chest, Singapore Airlines also invited Metta School and Association 

for Persons with Special Needs (APSN) Katong School to join the aircraft arrival ceremonies 

for the first Airbus A380 aircraft fitted with all-new cabin products, as well as the world’s 

first Boeing 787-10, in December 2017 and March 2018 respectively. The beneficiaries, 

along with their caregivers, had the opportunity to tour the two aircraft and try out the 

seats and in-flight entertainment systems.

As part of SIA’s 70th anniversary celebrations, a total of $2.55 million was raised for 

Community Chest through three fundraising events supported by more than 1,000 staff 

volunteers. Proceeds from the SIA Family Day, SIA Charity Gala and SIA Group Charity 

Run went towards supporting beneficiaries from social service organisations under

Community Chest.

Singapore Airlines is proud to play a part in helping to better the lives of beneficiaries

and will continue our support in the years ahead.

SIA KrisFlyer and Make-A-Wish Singapore Partnership

KrisFlyer, the SIA Group’s frequent-flyer programme, has partnered Make-A-Wish

Singapore since February 2017 to fulfill the wishes of children with life threatening 

illnesses. KrisFlyer miles donated by members will go towards supporting flights 

on Singapore Airlines and SilkAir for beneficiaries that involve overseas travel. In 

FY2017/18, 24 wishes were fulfilled, where beneficiaries visited various parts of the 

world such as Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. This scheme is in addition 

to the support that Singapore Airlines provides directly to Make-A-Wish beneficiaries.

Major Developments of 

Hutan Harapan in FY2017/18: 

Improvement of Monitoring System

Hutan Harapan is in the midst of upgrading its 

forest patrol unit’s monitoring system by using 

technology such as smartphones and the

Cybertracker application. The upgraded system 

will allow faster data collection, analysis and 

response on the health of the forest such as fire 

threats, logging and wildlife poaching. This will 

help to improve the quality of Hutan Haranpan’s 

forest ecosystem.

Mitigating Human-Wildlife Conflicts

With deforestation and the expansion of 

agriculture, elephants in Sumatra are experiencing 

fragmentation of their habitats. As a result, there 

is potential for more frequent human-elephant 

conflicts, such as the destruction of crops in 

Hutan Harapan farms. Field staff implemented a 

community-based conflict mitigation plan where 

patrol groups were tasked to reduce conflicts with 

elephants. The communities in Hutan Harapan 

were also educated about mitigation methods 

and how to keep elephants out of their farms.

Agroforestry Programme

An agroforestry programme was introduced to 

help communities generate income while reducing 

deforestation. By mixing both trees and agricultural 

as well as horticultural crops on the same piece 

of land, communities can improve their income 

while providing environmental benefits such as 

carbon sequestration and soil erosion prevention.

Harapan Rainforest Initiative

‘Tumble in the Jungle’ Event

Held in the Harapan Rainforest, the first ever 

mountain bike race generated public support for 

conservation initiatives. Through the set-up for 

this event, basic infrastructure such as camping 

grounds, drinking water supply schemes and

permanent toilets were also provided for the

communities in Hutan Harapan.

Strengthening the Livelihoods 

of Indigenous People

Community empowerment is one of the most 

important components of ecosystem restoration 

in Hutan Harapan. In 2017, formal education

was provided to children in the Hutan Harapan

communities through the establishment of a 

school within the forest. 



The Harapan Rainforest, also known as Hutan Harapan, is an ecosystem restoration concession covering 

nearly 100,000 hectares of once commercially-logged lowland tropical forest in central-south Sumatra, 

Indonesia. Hutan Harapan remains an important habitat for over 1,350 documented animal species,

133 of which are globally threatened, including several endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger 

and Sumatran elephant.

Since August 2010, Singapore Airlines has been the exclusive airline partner for the large-scale green 

project, funding core operations such as the employment of forest patrols to prevent illegal logging and 

forest fires, as well as programmes for the protection of plant and animal species. 

The Harapan Rainforest Initiative is driven by a consortium of three partners’ operations comprising

Burung Indonesia, BirdLife International and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

The initiative seeks to conserve one of the most biodiverse rainforests in the world and support the 

indigenous communities which depend on the forest for their livelihood. Apart from agroforestry  

partnerships that were launched with more than 200 families, sanitation projects and even a school 

have been set up to benefit these local communities.

Airport. In support of this programme, staff were interviewed about the Company’s history, 

services and job opportunities, raising awareness of the aviation industry amongst the 

students.

             India

Singapore Airlines partnered various schools and organisations in FY2017/18 to support 

education, healthcare and sports causes in India. A healthcare screening exercise which 

consisted of a general health and eye check-up was conducted for over 200 underprivileged 

children in Kolkata, India. The children, who received healthcare kits, were taught the 

importance of proper healthcare and hygiene. 

To forge a long-term relationship with the underprivileged children, Singapore Airlines 

partnered Little Pencils, a non-profit organisation, where staff were paired with a child

to engage them through book-reading and other activities.

In collaboration with Concern India Foundation, Singapore Airlines facilitated a Sports 

Day in Mumbai for 200 disabled children in February 2018. Volunteers from the Singapore 

Airlines team provided food for all participants and assisted the students in their races. 

All children received participation certificates and winners received medals for their 

achievements. 

 

Japan

Singapore Airlines staff in Japan brought Christmas cheer to children warded in Narita 

Red Cross Hospital and Fukuoka Children’s Hospital with gifts. Greeted by Santa Claus

SIA’s Sustainability Policy

With more than 180 of our aircraft taking to the skies daily, the SIA Group remains dedicated to our long-term responsibility to protect 

the environment while providing air transportation services of the highest quality. Singapore Airlines has in place various programmes 

to implement sustainable practices across our operations in a responsible manner to manage issues such as carbon emissions, waste, 

noise and the consumption of energy and resources. We also continue to explore new sustainable practices in all areas of our operations.

 

In 2017, the highest global surface temperatures and the lowest Arctic sea ice extent were recorded. According to the monthly analysis 

of global temperatures by scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, there were five months in 2017 which 

recorded the second-warmest temperatures in 137 years of record-keeping.

SIA continuously strives to improve our fuel productivity through the implementation of various initiatives. These include fuel efficient 

policies and procedures, application of data analytics to drive efficiency, optimised flight routings as well as aircraft weight management. 

We also take measures to improve our engine performance. These fuel-saving measures, together with regular fleet renewal, help to 

reduce our emissions. In addition, we are an active member of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG), which is committed to 

accelerating the development and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels. 

The aviation sector contributes to two per cent of global carbon emissions. However, the aviation industry recognises the need to address 

the global challenge of climate change. This is reflected in the International Air Transportation Association’s (IATA) three targets and 

four-pillar strategy.

Engineering

• Fleet-wide engine washing is 

carried out regularly, resulting 

in 10,400 tonnes of fuel savings 

annually

• Modifying the A380 Trent 900 

engine to enhance performance, 

resulting in 10,010 tonnes of fuel 

savings annually

• Quarterly review of the performance 

of fuel efficiency initiatives

• Developing performance 

improvement packages for 

airframes and engines to reduce 

airframe drag, improving engine 

fuel efficiency

• Embarking on initiatives both within 

SIA and with Original Equipment 

Manufacturers to reduce aircraft 

weight

- Water uplift is customised based 

on flight sector requirements 

through a tailored potable water 

programme and removal of unutilised 

overhead storage compartments 

located in between the galleys of 

SIA’s Boeing 777-300ERs. These 

initiatives resulted in 2,400 tonnes 

of fuel savings annually

Ground Operations

• Deploying mobile ground power units 

and pre-conditioned air units during 

night stops and long transits to reduce 

reliance on aircraft auxiliary power 

units, which is expected to save at least 

2,400 tonnes of fuel annually

• Implementing the Centre of Gravity 

Optimisation initiative into SIA’s Load 

Planning System to derive a preferred 

centre of gravity position to load cargo 

pallets and containers. This improves 

fuel efficiency in our aircraft operations

Data Analytics

• Applying data analytics to expand 

and improve SIA’s fuel conservation 

initiatives by accurately measuring 

performance

• Identifying and prioritising opportunities 

for further fuel productivity improvement

Flight Operations

• Participating in international discussions 

to establish new airways for more efficient 

flight routes

• Actively engaging in route-planning 

procedures to determine the most 

fuel-efficient routes

• Encouraging continuous descent 

operations to minimise fuel use without 

compromising safety and participation 

in the ASPIRE programme

• Implementing ‘Reduced Engine Taxi In’ 

for all aircraft types across different 

airports to optimise fuel efficiency. 

Upon landing, pilots are able to use one 

engine for twin-engine aircraft, or three 

engines for four-engine aircraft during 

taxiing

• Improving flight operation procedures 

that reduce fuel burn for A380 aircraft 

at Heathrow Airport in London. SIA’s 

A380s departing from Heathrow Airport 

now use less power during take-off,     

resulting in fuel savings and less  

emission of CO2 and NOx, while  

complying with the airport’s strict  

noise procedure guidelines

Aircraft Fleet

• Maintaining a modern and fuel-efficient 

fleet

- SIA currently has 21 A350-900

Four-Pillar Strategy (Cont’d)

Pillar 3: Improved Infrastructure

Infrastructure improvements present an opportunity for airlines to reduce fuel use and CO2 emissions.

Such improvements are led by the optimisation of air routes through efficient air traffic management. 

Asia and Pacific Initiative to Reduce Emissions (ASPIRE) Programme

SIA has been participating in the ASPIRE programme since 31 January 2010, when we operated our first 

‘green flight’ demonstration from Los Angeles to Singapore via Tokyo.

The ASPIRE programme is a partnership among air navigation service providers which share the aim of 

reducing carbon emissions from fuel burn in all phases of flight. It involves incorporating best practices and 

initiatives in air traffic management and flight operation procedures. Some examples include measures 

that permit pilots to take full advantage of atmospheric conditions such as prevailing winds to reduce 

separation between aircraft, and to shorten flight time. 

SIA’s non-stop service between Singapore and San Francisco is the latest addition to the ASPIRE programme. 

SIA adopts elements from the ASPIRE programme such as route straightening and continuous descent to 

achieve further fuel savings. 

Pillar 4: Global Market-Based Measure (MBM)

As an interim measure while the first three pillars of the four-pillar strategy develop, a global MBM plays a complementary role to reduce carbon emissions. At the 39th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)

Assembly in 2016, ICAO’s Member States adopted a global carbon offsetting scheme for international aviation. ICAO’s Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) aims to address the 

annual increase in total CO2 emissions from international civil aviation beyond 2020. The adoption of CORSIA is the first climate measure of its type for any global industry. It allows for airlines to achieve carbon neutral 

growth in a cost-efficient way.

SIA recognises that CORSIA will play an integral role in ensuring that carbon emissions are accounted for, eliminating duplicate economic measures. As such, SIA fully supports the ongoing efforts towards meeting the 

requirements in the CORSIA Monitoring, Reporting and Verification system of carbon emissions. 

Singapore will voluntarily participate in CORSIA from 2021 to 2026, after which the scheme becomes mandatory. Singapore is one of the 73 states which represent 87.7 per cent of international flight operations.

Other Environmental Measures

Aircraft Noise 

SIA focuses on aircraft noise management at the source, reducing aircraft engine noise. Compared to 

aircraft manufactured 10 years ago, modern jet aircraft are approximately 50 per cent quieter. Continuous 

improvements are being made to further reduce engine noise emissions.

ICAO introduced a new and more stringent Chapter 4 noise standard in 2006 as part of its Balanced 

Approach to Aircraft Noise Management to reduce noise at source. The continual improvement of 

noise certification strives to ensure that the latest noise reduction technology is incorporated into aircraft 

design. This results in noise reduction around airports.

SIA’s fleet of Airbus A330-300, A350-900, A380-800, Boeing 777-200, 777-200ER, 777-300, 777-300ER and 

787-10 aircraft; SilkAir’s A319, A320, 737 MAX 8 and 737-800 aircraft; as well as Scoot’s Airbus A319, 

A320, 787-8 and 787-9 aircraft, all meet the latest ICAO Chapter 4 noise standard.

Aircraft Emissions

ICAO sets the international standards for NOx, CO2, hydrocarbons and exhaust levels from aircraft engine 

emissions under ICAO Annex 16, Volume III. This standard is applicable to new aircraft designs as of 

2020 as well as new deliveries of current in-production aircraft types from 2023. SIA supports the new 

CO2 standard set by ICAO so as to meet the aviation industry’s long-term commitment to reduce CO2 emissions.

The current NOx standard, endorsed in 2004 and applicable to new engines manufactured from 2008, 

is 12 per cent stricter than previous standards. SIA’s passenger and freighter aircraft, together with 

SilkAir and Scoot’s aircraft, meet the stringent 2004 ICAO CAEP/6 Emissions Standards for NOx.

Ground Emissions

All new and existing vehicles on the ground powered by diesel or petrol comply with the National Environmental 

Agency’s requirements on motor vehicle emissions. Vehicles also undergo regular maintenance and 

inspections. For example, diesel-powered vehicles undergo an annual Chassis Dynamometer Smoke 

Test to ensure the smoke opacity limit meets local standards. In addition, staff are reminded to switch 

off engines while their vehicles are idling to conserve fuel, promote better air quality and to adhere to 

anti-idling engine regulations.

Energy and Resource Management

As part of the SIA Group’s ongoing conservation efforts, energy and water consumption levels in buildings owned by SIA or SIA Engineering Company (SIAEC) 

are monitored by the respective facilities teams. Consumption figures are reviewed by the Occupational Safety, Health and Environment Committee on a  

quarterly basis and updates are provided to SIA’s management. These figures are tracked and compared across the years to ensure that we match or lower 

our utilities consumption as a company. SIA is committed to achieving a 15 per cent reduction in our office electricity consumption by FY2020/21 from base 

year FY2010/11.

Energy Conservation Initiatives

In FY2017/18, SIA’s energy-saving initiatives continued to focus on managing air-conditioning and lighting within buildings and hangars. We are guided by the 

Singapore Energy Market Authority’s electricity conservation adoption, reporting standards and methodologies of electricity conservation. 

SIA’s five-year plan for upcoming equipment retrofitting works will guide us in ensuring that all the equipment supporting our building premises is energy efficient 

and in good condition. SIA’s Facilities team also conducts regular reviews to assess if there are better technologies or more efficient methods for building

essentials pertaining to air-conditioning, lighting and water. Some of our energy-savings efforts in FY2017/18 are as follows:  



Air-Conditioning 

• Modifications to the existing heat rejection 

source for the Computer Air-Conditioning 

Units (CAUs) from condenser water to 

chilled water, hence saving the utility cost 

to run additional cooling towers

• Ongoing replacement of Fan Coil Units 

(FCUs) within the buildings with more 

efficient models. These FCUs, for after-office 

hours usage when the centralised Air 

Handling Units are turned off, reduce 

off-peak load on the main chiller plant 

system, reducing electricity consumption

• Replacement of CAUs serving the aircraft 

simulator computers with higher efficiency 

units

Lighting

• Completion of replacement of high bay lights 

for Hangar 1 from 1,000W sodium metal halide 

lamps to 400W dimmable LED high bay lights, 

leading to reduced energy consumption as well 

as maintenance cost savings

• Submeters are used to track the difference in 

electricity consumption to ensure the  

effectiveness of these initiatives

SIA is committed to achieving a 15 per cent reduction in our office electricity consumption 

by FY2020/21 from base year FY2010/11.

Water

• Conducting regular water audits and 

submitting a water efficiency management 

plan to the Public Utilities Board (PUB) 

annually

• Displaying educational posters by PUB on 

water conservation at shower rooms and 

public hand wash areas in the canteen 

• Harvesting rain water in Airline House, 

SIA’s Head Office, to water plants and flush 

toilets. This initiative resulted in water savings 

of 12,000m3 per year at Airline House

- On average, 1,500m3 of rainwater is  

collected monthly. This accounts for 

22 per cent of SIA’s total monthly water 

usage at ALH

• Introducing submetering at areas with  

high water consumption within SIA’s  

premises to monitor water usage. Along 

with daily analysis of meter readings,  

water-saving opportunities and water  

leakage within our premises can be  

identified

• Monitoring daily water consumption levels 

to ensure that leaks are detected early

• A ‘Reduce Wastage’ campaign launched in 

2016 aimed to increase awareness among 

cabin crew about waste reduction on 

flights

• Reference materials are displayed digitally 

for meetings

• Under the corporate paperless movement, 

Cabin Crew Training department  

implemented a series of initiatives to 

work towards paperless training. Course 

completion certificates, course materials 

and handouts have been digitised and are 

available on a digital Corporate Learning 

Platform

• Electronic Flight Bags and iPads were 

issued to all pilots, resulting in a significant 

reduction in paper consumption used in the 

printing of documents and flight plans

Reuse

• Delivery of internal correspondence in envelopes 

designed for multiple use

• Rejected or old crew uniforms are used as art 

and craft materials for charity events

• Empty wine bottles from our aircraft are  

collected and brought to the SIA Training  

Centre for training purposes

Recycle

• Carton boxes, magazines, newspapers and 

glass bottles are collected after flights for 

recycling

• Recycling bins are conveniently located 

around offices and canteens for recyclable 

waste such as paper, magazines, newspapers 

and aluminium cans

• Staff are encouraged to recycle electronic 

waste

Waste Management

SIA targets to achieve a 30 per cent reduction in waste generation from our buildings by FY2020/21 from base year FY2010/11.

In FY2017/18, we disposed of 3,522 tonnes of waste accumulated from our office buildings. All the Toxic Industrial Waste (TIW) generated from our aircraft 

maintenance activities is labelled and segregated from general waste, which is collected by licenced general waste collectors and sent for incineration in 

waste-to-energy plants. A licenced TIW collector is engaged to remove and treat the TIW before final disposal. No industrial effluents are generated from 

our commercial activities and all waste water is discharged to government-operated water reclamation plants for treatment.

To meet SIA’s waste reduction target, short-term targets are set at departmental level to reduce paper use or to go paperless within three to five years. 

Longer-term targets include exploring waste reduction initiatives such as food waste recycling and working towards paperless in-flight menus. 

 

SIA incorporates the three Rs in our daily activities to improve our waste management practices and maximise efficient use of resources:

Environmental Awareness Initiatives 

Prevention of Illegal Wildlife Trafficking

Recognising that wildlife traffickers regularly exploit the increasing connectivity of global transportation and leverage on the supply chain industry for their

illegal trade, SIA signed the United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce Buckingham Palace Declaration in June 2017 in support of efforts to prevent illegal  

trafficking and transportation of wildlife as well as their products. 

As a signatory, SIA agrees to implement actions under the relevant commitments outlined in the Declaration, such as adopting a zero tolerance policy regarding 

illegal wildlife trade, increasing awareness among passengers and staff, providing staff training to identify and report suspected illegal transport of wildlife, 

and engaging the relevant stakeholders in these efforts.

 

SIA is against the illegal transport of wildlife and unsustainable animal products. The Company also prohibits the carriage of any animals or wildlife by passengers, 

with the exception of domesticated cats and dogs that are checked in, as well as service and emotional support dogs in the cabin.

Held on  

31 October 2017

‘From Farm-to-Plane’ Concept

Our sustainability efforts continue on board our flights. In October 2017, Singapore Airlines introduced a ‘From Farm to Plane’ concept to promote environmental 

sustainability and support local farmers’ communities. Through this initiative, we intend to use more sustainable and meatless ingredients, as well as local 

produce, in our in-flight meals. 

SIA will work with partners globally to source for sustainable ingredients. Currently, SIA uses fish from fisheries with certified sustainable fishing practices, and 

obtains produce from local farms in the various destinations we serve. In addition, SIA’s International Culinary Panel of world-renowned chefs created in-flight 

menus using more sustainable ingredients and local produce such as cherry tomatoes, pumpkins, green beans and lettuce. The new menus were introduced 

to Suites customers on selected routes late in 2017 and will progressively be made available to customers travelling in other cabin classes. Singapore Airlines 

also introduced organic French Shiraz wine on board, available to Business Class customers on selected flights from December 2017.
