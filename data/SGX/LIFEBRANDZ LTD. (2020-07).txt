Sustainability Organisational Structure  

 

Sustainability is a vital part of our corporate strategy for achieving long-term growth. The values we create for 

our people, the environment and society at large very much determine our financial performance. We 

developed a sustainability organisational structure to move things forward.  

 

1) The Board formulates related strategies and guideline. 

2) The Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) coordinators, which comprise the Board and key 

management team which includes the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), the Chief Financial Officer 

(“CFO”) and the respective heads of business units (collectively, the “Management”), help to 

organise, communicate and coordinate the CSR practises of all departments and subsidiaries. 

3) Employees from various departments are responsible for the implementation of CSR practises.  

4) The CEO and the CFO monitor the adoption of the CSR practises in the various departments and 

ensure that the Group is working towards its CSR goals as a whole. 

 

Sustainability Strategy   

 

At the Group level, our sustainability strategy aims to create integrated values. Together with disciplined 

execution of our strategy and a commitment to doing business responsibly, we commit to deliver value to all 

our stakeholders through the following:  

 

1) Economic Sustainability  

2) Regulatory Compliance  

3) Environmental Sustainability  

4) Social Responsibility  

 

The sustainable strategy is underpinned by our comprehensive internal policies on the following:  

 

1) Compliance Manual, which LifeBrandz is committed to conducting its business in accordance to the 

highest standards of its business ethics. The Group works diligently to ensure that its employees 

comply with applicable laws, regulations and professional codes of conduct. 

2) Risk Management Policy, which covers procedures to implement effective risk management practices, 

covering both the operational risk associated with the firm and the risks (market, liquidity, credit and 

counterparty risks) inherent in the management of investment portfolios. 

3) Operations Manual, which covers all other aspects in our business operations, especially on 

investment procedures, dealing with counterparties, valuation, cash management, business continuity 

and disaster recovery plan. 

 

The strategy is also guided by external sources, including GRI Standards, Sustainability Reporting Guide in 

Practice Note 7F of the Catalist Rules. 

 

Sustainability Materiality  

 

We recognise the need to continuously develop our responsible business approach in order to address growing 

stakeholder expectations around our impact on the economy, environment and society. As such, we 

periodically consult with our stakeholders to determine the issues that are most relevant to them and 

LifeBrandz. Some of our stakeholder’s comments can be found in Appendix A: Consulting our stakeholders.    

 

Using a materiality index, we align our responsible business priorities with the Group’s principal business and 

operational risks, as illustrated in the diagram below.

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has added unprecedented complexity to the Group’s businesses and 

operations, for which no one could have foreseen. The weak consumer sentiment coupled with the required 

implementation of stringent Covid-19 preventive measures greatly disrupted the operations of F&amp;B and travel 

agency services businesses. The Group has permanently ceased operations for two high-end sushi restaurants 

in Singapore and San Francisco, the United States respectively. The Group is now working on the restructuring 

of its businesses and debts. At the same time, the Group is controlling its costs to improve its operational 

efficiency. Our goal is to continue to improve the financial performance in the mid- to long-term.

To maintain a fair, ethical and efficient business and working environment, LifeBrandz strictly adheres to the 

local laws and industry regulations relating to corporate governance, risk management, and code of conduct 

including anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, fraud and confidentially.  

 

Corporate Governance   

 

We have enhanced our accountability and transparency by upholding high standards in business ethic and 

corporate governance in all areas of our operations, thus building stronger trust with our stakeholders.  

 

The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring effective corporate governance across the Group, including 

ensuring that effective risk management and internal controls are in place to address any identified risks and 

ensure business continuity. 

 

We have in place the relevant Standard Operating Procedures (“SOP”) in our Operations Manual which 

establishes principles and practices with regard to matters which may have ethical implications. The SOP 

provides communicable and understandable guidelines for staff to observe in their dealings with customers, 

suppliers and amongst fellow colleagues. 

 

Some topics covered by our Operations Manual include the following:  

 

• 

Staffing and segregation of duties  

• 

Information technology controls  

• 

Investment procedures  

• 

Dealing with counterparties  

• 

Valuation policy  

• 

Cash management  

• 

Business continuity and disaster recovery plan 

 

Preventing Bribery and Corruption    

 

The Group prohibits all forms of bribery and corruption. The Group requires all employees to strictly abide 

by professional ethics and eliminate any corruption and bribery. All employees are expected to discharge their 

duties with integrity, to act fairly and professionally, and to abstain from engaging in bribery activities or any 

activities, which might exploit their positions against the Group’s interests.

Whistle-blower can be reported verbally or in writing to the Management of the Group for any suspected 

misconduct with full details and supporting evidence at invest@LifeBrandz.com. The Management will 

conduct investigations against any suspicious or illegal behaviour to protect the Group’s interests. The Group 

advocates a confidentiality mechanism to protect the whistle-blower against unfair dismissal or victimisation. 

Where criminality is suspected, a report is made to the relevant regulators or law enforcement authorities 

when the Management considers necessary.

Risk Management  

 

We view risk management as one of the most important responsibilities we owe to our clients, employees, 

regulators and counterparties. Every business and investment decision involves a consideration of the balance 

for risk versus reward. 

 

We are committed to developing the appropriate systems, policies, procedures, arrangements and controls to 

ensure effective risk management is exercised and promoted within our Group culture. We believe in 

appropriate training of our staff and communication with our clients as requisite to fulfilling our risk 

management goals. 

 

Our risk management practices cover both the operational risk associated with the firm and the risks (market, 

liquidity, credit and counterparty risks) inherent in the management of investment portfolios. 

 

We view our risk management policies and procedures as dynamic in response to the evolution of our 

investment strategies, the development of our business and the innovation within financial markets and risk 

management tools. We will strive to improve our risk management capabilities and processes to stay abreast 

of market best practices. We believe that effective risk management is crucial to the long-term success of our 

business. 

 

Our four cornerstones of effective risk management and sound internal controls are: 

 

• 

The role of the Board in its oversight of risk management policies and their implementation; 

• 

The role of Management in ensuring that sound policies, effective procedures and robust systems are 

in place; 

• 

The presence of sound risk management processes and operating procedures that integrate prudent 

risk limits with appropriate risk measurement, monitoring and reporting; and 

• 

The presence of competent personnel in the firm’s compliance, controls, risk management, and audit 

functions. 

 

More information on the Group’s risk management and internal controls will be disclosed in the FY2020 

Annual Report.

Regular Compliance Updates     

 

In FY2020, the Group, through its Company Secretary, has updated the Board on relevant new laws and 

regulations affecting the Company. From time to time, and through Board meetings and other meetings, both 

formal and informal, our CEO has been advising our Directors of the changing commercial and business risks 

faced by our Company. 

 

Management are encouraged to attend seminar and receive training to improve themselves in the discharge of 

Managements’ duties and responsibilities. Changes to regulations and accounting standards are monitored 

closely by the Management. To keep pace with such regulatory changes, the Company provides opportunities 

for ongoing education and training on Board processes and best practices as well as updates on changes in 

legislation and financial reporting standards, regulations and guidelines from Catalist Rules that affect the 

Company and/or the Directors in discharging their duties. Such training costs are borne by the Company.

At LifeBrandz, we are committed towards protecting the environment.  

 

Waste Management  

 

The Group adopts the Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (“3Rs”) methodology to manage our waste. We believe 

that by practising the 3Rs, we can help to protect the environment and conserve limited resources. The Group 

believes that every small effort counts and goes a long way in contributing to the conservation and protection 

of the earth’s natural resources. 

 

Our waste management efforts are focused mainly on paper. We are constantly working to reduce waste from 

our operations, as well as finding efficient ways to recycle. Measures were communicated to all the new and 

existing employees through induction and informal meetings to reduce, reuse or recycle whenever possible. 

 

Reduce  

• 

Employees are educated to print double-sided documents.  

• 

Paperless work flow system is being considered to store documents electronically. 

• 

Employees are encouraged to think before print. 

 

 

Reuse  

• 

Employees are encouraged to reuse paper for note taking during meetings. 

• 

Employees are also encouraged to use waste paper as draft paper. 

• 

Employees are encouraged not to print documents for discussion purposes and display them on 

screens instead.  

 

Recycle 

• 

Waste cardboard and paper are sent for recycling. 

 

We aim to reduce the usage of paper over time. As the current usage is not significant, the Group does not 

collect any usage data. However, the Group will work towards providing the quantitative indicators should 

the usage becomes material in the future. 

 

Energy  

 

We play our part by reducing the energy use in our operations through adopting greener and more 

environmentally-friendly technologies and measures. For example, we have begun the replacement of 

electrical compliance with more energy efficient model in our restaurants.  

 

We strive to minimise the energy consumption over time. As the current usage is not significant, the Group 

does not collect any usage data. However, the Group will work towards providing the quantitative indicators 

should the usage becomes material in the future.

At LifeBrandz, we strike to carry out our business operations in a socially responsible manner. 

 

Customer Health and Safety 

 

A great customer experience is built upon the foundation of perfecting taste and quality, coupled with the 

highest standards of safety and hygiene. With food safety and hygiene as the top priority across our divisions.  

 

For our high-end F&amp;B sushi business in Singapore, we sourced from licensed Agri-food and Veterinary 

Authority (“AVA”)-approved suppliers.

Training and Education  

 

LifeBrandz understands that there is a continuous need to upgrade staff skills and knowledge. This is beneficial 

to the staff’s development and also to the Group. Thus, staff are encouraged to go for courses and seminars 

to upgrade themselves and improve their skills. Staff are also sent by the Group, to attend courses to obtain 

skills or certifications that are necessary in the course of their work. 

 

Diversity and Fair Employment 

 

We embrace diversity, and at the same time expect employees to be aligned with the Group’s vision and 

strategic initiatives of enhancing overall business performance and to deliver sustainable growth. Our 

employees consist of people coming from different nationalities and academic qualifications. We strive for 

fair treatment of all our employees, regardless of nationalities, age, gender and educational levels. The lower 

ratio of the age group over 50 years old due to the nature of the work of F&amp;B industry.  

 

We offer good career progression and competitive salary and benefit packages to our employees, including 

annual leave, sick leave, transportation and dental allowance, medical insurance, worker compensation 

insurance, patiently and maternity leaves for staff.
