Sustainability Report

About This Report

Yanlord Land Group Limited (“Yanlord” or the “Company”, 

and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) reaffirms 

its commitment towards sustainability with the publication 

of this annual sustainability report. This report is prepared 

in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) 

Standards: Core option, the global standard for sustainability 

reporting, for the financial year ended December 31, 2019 

(“FY2019”). 

This report further adheres to the four reporting principles 

prescribed by the GRI Standards:

In late-October 2019, the Group launched mandatory offers 

(“UEL Offers”) for all the issued and paid-up ordinary stock 

units (“UEL Ordinary Shares”) and preference shares in the 

capital of United Engineers Limited (“UEL”), a corporation 

with key business activities in property rental and hospitality, 

property development, engineering and distribution, as well 

as manufacturing, which was then listed on the mainboard 

of the Singapore Exchange but has since been delisted in 

February 2020. The UEL Offers were triggered following the 

Group’s acquisition of the remaining 51% interest not already 

owned by it in Yanlord Perennial Investment (Singapore) 

Pte. Ltd. (now known as Yanlord Investment (Singapore) 

Pte. Ltd.), a company principally involved in the investment 

of shares in UEL. On November 15, 2019, the UEL Offer for 

UEL Ordinary Shares was declared unconditional and UEL 

became a subsidiary of the Company. This was followed by a 

compulsory acquisition of all UEL Ordinary Shares of non-

assenting ordinary shareholders after the Group acquiring 

not less than 90% of the UEL Ordinary Shares on January 2, 

2020. The compulsory acquisition for UEL Ordinary Shares 

was completed on February 25, 2020, the date on which the 

Group owned all the UEL Ordinary Shares.

UEL and its group of companies related ESG factors are not 

included in this sustainability report as the report is prepared 

based on the pre-acquisition status of Yanlord, unless 

otherwise stated. The Group shall include any relevant and 

material UEL and its group of companies related ESG factors 

and performance data in sustainability report 2020,  

as appropriate.

We are currently exploring the option of obtaining external 

assurance for future sustainability reports.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019




Message from the Board

to our commitment to consistently enforce a safe 

workplace culture to keep incidents to a minimum. 

With the same vigour, we care for the well-being  

of our customers at every stage of our operations 

when developing a property. We have always been 

able to leverage on our positive and communicative 

relationship with our customers to discover 

areas where pre-emptive measures should be 

implemented. This allows us to create a healthy 

environment, free of compliance breaches.  

We also gathered feedback from our customers 

via surveys conducted by an independent agency 

and are proud to disclose that we have once again 

performed above the industry average. 

In FY2019, we further highlighted our dedication to 

protecting our customers’ personal data. Personal 

information is treated as strictly confidential and 

is protected against cyber threats with effective 

controls in place. Continuing our record, there 

were no non-compliance issues, customer health 

and safety incidents or data breaches within 

FY2019, and we aim to maintain this streak. 

With the topic of sustainability positioned in 

the spotlight on the world stage today, we at 

Yanlord are excited to intensify our sustainability 

efforts – beginning with the further integration 

of sustainability in our dealings and enhanced 

disclosures of the material economic and ESG 

topics in our subsequent sustainability reports.  

We will continue to work closely with management 

to ensure that the Group’s material ESG factors are 

monitored and managed appropriately.

Board Statement

 

At Yanlord, we continue to intensify our efforts to 

incorporate sustainability initiatives and goals in our 

strategies and operations. As the Board of Directors 

of the Company (the “Board”), we are continually 

striving to strike a balance between conducting a 

sustainable business and delivering high-quality 

development projects to our customers. With that 

said, the Board stands by our belief that business 

success can be achieved through the integration of 

sustainability in our long-term strategies.

For FY2019, our materiality matrix refreshment 

exercise resulted in the expansion of the list of 

material economic and ESG topics, adding to the 

topics from the last two financial years. During  

the refreshment exercise, material topics are 

evaluated against the current business strategy, 

market conditions, stakeholder concerns,  

and other considerations. With this robust process, 

we are assured that the list of material topics used 

to develop the content of this report is relevant to 

the current context of the Group.

As our employees continue to play an essential role 

in contributing to business growth and success,  

we focused on ensuring that the health and safety of 

our employees are safeguarded. Our commitment 

to maintaining proper health and safety measures 

remain steadfast. Despite the increase in human 

capital in FY2019, the number of injuries and lost 

day rate decreased. This serves as a testament

Caring for  

Our Customers

We consistently prioritise the health 

and safety of our customers and 

consider their well-being at every stage 

of our operations when developing 

a property. Within all our residential 

and commercial properties (for 

sale, hospitality or held for rental 

purposes), we strive to sustain a healthy 

environment and avoid compliance 

breach. We are devoted to identifying 

all potential hazards that our customers 

could encounter and implement pre-

emptive mitigation measures where 

necessary. To safeguard the health 

and safety of our customers, we 

have instituted several policies with 

provisions to ensure that accidents 

and non-compliance of regulations 

are avoided. Further, while diversifying 

our development projects, we adopt 

a responsible approach towards the 

preservation of natural environment and 

historical heritage, if any, on and around 

the construction site. Furthermore, 

to ensure all persons with special 

needs are cared for, we have installed 

additional structures such as ramps, 

boarding bay and aided toilets. 

Having completed a multitude of 

projects, we have come to understand 

that large open spaces and lush 

natural greenery within a development 

enhances aesthetics and the wellbeing 

of our customers. We have thus 

incorporated these elements in all our 

residential and commercial properties 

(for sale, hospitality or held for rental 

purposes) to increase customer 

satisfaction levels. Yanlord Townhouse 

is an example of our “natural” 

properties which capitalises on the 

natural tranquillity of its surroundings 

coupled with proximity to the amenities 

of cosmopolitan living.

Another important element that 

customers look for in our residential 

and commercial properties (for sale, 

hospitality or held for rental purposes) 

is convenience. We have since 

ensured that all entry and exit points 

of our properties are located close to 

transport hubs such as bus stops and 

train stations. This proximity enables 

convenient commute and easy access 

to all amenities. One example is the 

Canjie project in Suzhou. Located in 

the redevelopment zone of Pingjiang 

Road and adjacent to the historical 

Couple's Retreat Garden, this project 

features architectural beauty, which 

combines the local historical aesthetic 

elements like garden compounds, and 

modern amenities. The shopping plaza 

of Cangjie was awarded the Silver Prize 

for the Best Futura Project (Architectural 

Design) by MIPIM Asia for its modern 

interpretation of traditional architectural 

elements and the innovative approach 

towards historic heritage preservation. 

Another of our project, Yanlord Phoenix 

Hill is located in the picturesque

Apart from leveraging on the good 

locational attributes of the prime sites  

to deliver value to our customers,  

we frequently engage our customers to 

keep us informed of their changing needs 

and evolving expectations. This approach 

provides us with a platform to listen to 

their feedback and capture value from 

them when we incorporate and actively 

respond to their concerns. This supports us 

in our commitment to providing our valued 

customers with prime properties  

coupled with the first-rate service. 

In FY2019, we re-engaged an acclaimed 

independent research agency to conduct 

a customer satisfaction survey on our 

customers in the PRC, consisting of the 

buyers of our residential and commercial 

properties, the tenants of our office 

buildings, service apartments and retails 

shops, and the guests of our service 

apartments and hotels. Upon analysis of 

the survey results, we were able to identify 

potential areas of improvement.

In FY2019, our overall satisfaction  

score for products and services from  

the customer survey report was 82%, 

above the industry average of 75%,  

as seen in Figure 14 in next page. We were 

also able to once again surpass our 2018 

performance and industry average in the 

service areas shown on the right. Looking 

forward, we will continue to take pride in 

our service quality and concentrate on 

improving our overall product and service 

satisfaction levels.

hot spring supply. By preserving the 

lush green area and enhancing the 

landscape with manicured trees and

most desirable living space featuring 

the view of mountain and hot spring

In FY2019, we have met the goals  

and targets set with zero incident of  

non-compliance concerning the health 

and safety issues on our properties. 

There were also zero case of  

non-compliance with voluntary codes

moving along with industry practice  

and aim to maintain the same result 

next year with our well-established 

customer health and safety practices.

2019 Project 

Highlight

Yanlord Marina Centre (Zhuhai)

Zhuhai InterContinental Hotel came 

into full operation in FY2019 following 

almost a decade of construction. 

Being part of the landmark Yanlord 

Marina Centre located at the center of 

Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater 

Bay Area, this high-end hotel is the 

final touch to the beautiful skyline and 

serves as a testament to our pledge to 

architectural aesthetics and operational 

excellence.

Yanlord Marina Centre, located 

along Qinglu South Road near the 

coast, is a key landmark in Zhuhai 

City. Lying adjacent to the Gongbei 

Customs Checkpoint to Macau, the 

project enjoys easy access to the 

recently opened Hong Kong-Zhuhai-

Macau Bridge as well as the transport 

interchange of the light rail connecting 

Zhuhai and Guangzhou. As a key 

highlight of Zhuhai’s city skyline, the 

approximately 229,000 square metre 

gross floor area Yanlord Marina Centre 

comprises a five-star hotel, high-grade  

residences, offices and retail shops. 

In conjunction with the grand opening 

of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau 

Bridge, Yanlord Marina Centre 

opened the doors to the brand new 

InterContinental Zhuhai, the five-star 

hotel is also outfitted with low-emissivity 

insulating glass and operates on a 

chiller heat recovery system in tackling 

environmental issues.

Standing at the gateway to  

Macau, through land connection,  

and to Hong Kong, through the  

Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, 

Yanlord Marina Centre enjoys excellent 

connectivity and visibility. Situated in 

the Zhuhai City Center and adjacent 

to the Zhuhai-Macau immigration 

checkpoint at Gongbei, Yanlord 

Marina Centre will benefit from the 

substantial economic developments in 

neighbouring Macau, Guangzhou and 

Hong Kong as well as key infrastructural 

investments in the city.

Caring for  

Our Community

We have always been focusing on 

finding a balance between meeting 

the high standards of our investors and 

being a good corporate citizen. Our 

operations not only impact our business 

performance but the local communities 

as well. It is thus our responsibility to 

minimise the negative impacts of our 

activities and execute environmental 

and socially responsible initiatives. 

As we continue to deliver high-quality 

residential and commercial properties 

(for sale, hospitality or held for rental 

purposes) to our customers, our 

commitment to ensuring environmental 

conservation through eco-friendly 

developments remains steadfast. We 

have also increased our involvement 

in special needs and underprivileged 

communities. Throughout the year, 

we organised student and youth 

engagement programmes, student 

enrichment programmes, and 

presented educational institutional 

grants and donations.

We respond to the PRC Central 

Government's call to contribute to the 

poverty alleviation in less developed 

areas in PRC. Apart from a RMB2 

million donation to the Xi'an Rural 

Development Charity Foundation 

by the Group, our subsidiaries also 

make generous contributions to this 

relief efforts, including the building of 

school dormitories in the mountainous 

Pengshui County of Chongqing 

Municipality, which initiative is also 

supported by the Singapore Embassy 

in PRC.
