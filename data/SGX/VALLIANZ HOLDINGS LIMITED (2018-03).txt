Message from the Board 

Dear Stakeholders,  

 

The Board of Vallianz Holdings Limited (the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, 

the “Group” or “Vallianz”) is pleased to present the Group’s inaugural sustainability report. 

This report has been prepared in alignment with the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading 

Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Rules – Sustainability Reporting Guide, for the Group’s financial 

year ended 31 March 2018 (“FY2018”). 

 

Having grown into an established provider of offshore support vessels and integrated offshore 

marine solutions to the global oil and gas industry, the Group recognises that its success over 

the long term is dependent not only on its financial performance, but also on other non-

financial factors such as the relationships it has forged with various stakeholders.  

 

As part of our strategic formulation process, the Board has carried out a materiality 

assessment and identified the material Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors 

that are of greatest relevance to the Group. These material factors have been strategically 

chosen as they are deemed to have the largest impact on our stakeholders, and in order for 

the Group to obtain optimal results from its sustainability efforts.  

 

The Board is committed to ensuring sustainable business practices in the Group as we believe 

that placing greater focus on these practices can create value for stakeholders by generating 

competitive advantage, improved financial returns and a positive societal impact in the long 

run. As such, the Board has assumed responsibility to oversee the management and 

monitoring of the relevant ESG factors, as well as the Group’s sustainability practices and the 

development of the sustainability report.  

 

While the past few years have been extremely challenging for the offshore support vessel 

industry due to the prolonged uncertainties afflicting the global oil and gas sector, Vallianz 

has been able to consistently deliver a creditable performance, as reflected in both its 

financial results and operational performance during this period. We believe that being 

adaptable in this ever changing and highly competitive market is paramount to sustaining the 

Group’s growth.  

 

The Board views sustainability as a continuous journey and believes that Vallianz has to 

continue to improve its sustainability efforts in order to achieve our aim of creating significant 

value add for the communities we serve.

philosophy, it gives us the confidence as Vallianz’s majority shareholder to 

put our full backing behind the Group.”

Vessel Ownership 

The Group currently owns and operates a young fleet of 62 offshore support vessels available 

for charter, with an average age of approximately 5.0 years. Our associate owns and operates 

another 20 offshore support vessels. 

The Group’s vessels are deployed in offshore oil and gas projects in the Middle East, Central 

Asia and Southeast Asia regions. To enhance its market competitiveness, the Group will 

continue to assess appropriate plans to expand its range of vessels and modernise the fleet. 

Chartering 

The Group charters its offshore support vessels to customers throughout various stages of 

their offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production projects. They are used 

in activities that include seismic surveys during the exploration phase, positioning of rigs 

during the development of the oil and gas fields, towing, mooring and handling of ship

anchors and transportation of supplies during the production period and the removal of rig 

structures at decommissioning. 

The Group’s customers typically employ longer term charters of up to 7 years (inclusive of 2 

years extension option) for their dedicated offshore oil field installations. 

Brokering 

The Group also provides brokering services that match customers’ requirements. This 

includes sourcing for vessels base, arranging for assist tugs and/or harbour movements, 

making initial contact with vessel owners or vessel buyers, acting as an intermediary between 

(a) the vessel owner and the charterer for towage, time and bareboat charters and (b) the 

seller and buyer of vessels, and assisting with the drafting of related agreements and 

negotiations. The Group utilises its asset base and network of brokers and owners to identify 

high quality vessels to match its customers’ needs, thus shortening the time required in the 

vessel acquisition process. 

Vessel Management 

The Group provides a suite of vessel management services for both owned vessels and third-

party vessels. The Group is able to manage and operate a diverse range of vessels deployed 

in different phases of offshore oil and gas operations. Its services include crewing, 

procurement, vessel repair and maintenance, and facilitating port and documentation 

clearance.

Supply Chain Management  

The Group has a dedicated Procurement Team to manage and ensure minimal disruptions to 

its supply chain. 

Vallianz has a wide range of suppliers which are extensively sourced to ensure they can meet 

specific guidelines that can achieve the aims and values of the Group.  

We also actively engage our suppliers to develop a supply chain that conforms to our 

sustainability practices.  In addition to determining their expertise, track record, quality, 

reliability and ability to comply with the Group’s planned schedules, we also assess our 

suppliers based on their compliance with relevant laws and regulations in the markets that 

we operate in.

Communities 

Entrenched in Vallianz’s corporate culture is the spirit of giving back to the community. For 

the 7th year running, Vallianz partnered with Care Corners Senior Services Ltd (“CCSS”) to 

celebrate the Lunar New Year in 2018.  

CCSS operates a total of six Senior Activity Centres (“SAC”) – five in Toa Payoh and one in 

Woodlands. In 2018, a total of 283 seniors and 17 staff from the various SACs joined the 

Vallianz family in the Lunar New Year Charity Dinner. Over the course of the last seven years, 

a bond of friendship and belonging has been created between the staff of Vallianz and the 

CCSS community. 

 

 

In addition to the annual Lunar New Year Charity Dinners, Vallianz also supports the Hot Meals 

programme by sponsoring hot and nutritious meals for the seniors at Toa Payoh Block 5 SAC.

Ethics and Integrity 

Whistleblowing  

In order to maintain our high ethical standards of accountability, reliability and honesty to our 

stakeholders at all times, Vallianz has implemented a whistle blowing policy which provides 

well-defined and accessible channels in the Group through which employees may raise 

concerns about improper conduct or inappropriate behaviour within the Group.  

Both employees and external parties can raise concerns and issues in good faith on possible 

corruption, suspected fraud and other non-compliance issues. A dedicated hotline and email 

address allow whistle blowers to contact the Audit Committee directly.   

Information received pertaining to whistle blowing will be treated with confidentiality and 

restricted to the designated persons-in-charge of the investigation to protect the identity and 

interest of whistleblowers. The Audit Committee’s objectives are to ensure that 

arrangements are in place for the independent investigation of such matters and for 

appropriate follow-up action.

Economic Performance   

The Group’s economic performance is managed as part of our business strategy. Our practices 

and performance have been detailed in our Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 

March 2018. The key financial indicators are presented below:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Group operates a business model that focuses primarily on securing long term vessel 

charters with national oil companies. We believe that our strategic focus on long term charter 

contracts will provide greater visibility of future revenue streams, and enable the Group to 

build a sustainable business that can better withstand slower market conditions.  

The resilience of our business model is validated by the Group’s ability to continue delivering 

operating profits since the oil and gas industry’s downturn in 2014. Notwithstanding the harsh 

market conditions afflicting the global offshore support vessel industry, the Group delivered 

a creditable financial performance in the 12 months ended 31 March 2018 with a net profit 

of US$16.7 million. Indeed, this performance can be attributed to our core vessel chartering 

business which is primarily anchored on our long-term charter contracts with a leading 

national oil company in the Middle East that is among the world’s largest oil producers. 

The Group’s sustainability is built upon our viable and sound business model, as well as our 

consistent efforts to streamline operations, optimise cost structure and restructure financial 

obligations to better align our operations to market conditions. The Group has also garnered 

stronger support for the future when our controlling shareholder and strategic partner, 

Rawabi Holding Company Limited (“Rawabi”) cemented its position as Vallianz’s majority 

shareholder in 2018. Rawabi is a conglomerate that has been operating in Saudi Arabia and 

the Middle East for almost 40 years as one of the leading industrial players in the region. 










VALLIANZ HOLDINGS LIMITED

As one of the largest OSV providers in Middle East, the Group’s strategy is to leverage its 

market position to capitalise on opportunities in the Middle East region which is among the 

world’s largest oil and gas producers. Besides participating actively in significant tenders for 

projects of the NOC customer, the Group is also pursuing opportunities to reach new markets 

in the Middle East region such as Egypt, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait.

Occupational Health and Safety   

The Group constantly strives to foster and reinforce a culture that places health and safety as 

first priority within the organisation. The safety and well-being of our people working on the 

ground and on-board vessels are of utmost importance to us and we are committed to 

creating and maintaining a safe work environment for our employees.  

Although the Group operates in the high risk offshore and marine industry, we have set out 

stringent Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) policies to create a healthy and safe work 

environment for our employees. We continually work on raising employee awareness, and 

stress the importance of adhering to the OHS standards in our day-to-day operations.  

The Group strives to conform to international recognised standards and codes such as ISM, 

OHSAS 18001:2007, ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015, as well as to comply with local 

legislation relating to health and safety standards.  

OHSAS refers to Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, which is a British 

Standard for occupational health and safety management systems; while International Safety 

Management (ISM) Code is an international standard for the safe operation of ships and for 

pollution prevention.  

In addition to ensuring comprehensive insurance scheme for employees, the Group has also 

adopted policies relating to fire protection, hygiene and sanitation in handling equipment, 

among others. In compliance with the ISM Code, the Group mandates the proper use of 

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) which has to be worn by staff at all times when they are 

handling heavy equipment or operating machinery, especially during ship repair and 

maintenance.  

We also place great importance on injury prevention through on time incident reporting and 

continual review of incidents to assess the suitability and requirements for additional safety 

measures. The Group has incorporated a comprehensive Quality, Health, Safety, Security and 

Environment (QHSSE) Manual for on-time incident reporting. Any injury suffered by 

employees, regardless of the level of severity, must be reported immediately to a manager or 

supervisor. The manager or supervisor will assess the severity of the accident and decide on 

the appropriate action(s) to be taken. It is compulsory for all incidents to be documented, 

reported and submitted to management.  

QHSSE performance forms part of the employees’ Key Performance Indicators (“KPI”). 

Employees will be recognised by management if they are able to minimise the rate of 

accidents and foster a safe and conducive work environment.  

For 2018, there were no reported work health safety incidents of work-related fatalities or 

high consequence work-related injuries. 


VALLIANZ HOLDINGS LIMITED

Talent Management 

Our employees are the most valuable assets in our Group. They contribute to the growth of 

our business by fulfilling our customers’ diverse needs and meeting our operational targets. 

As such, we believe in taking care of our people’s well-being, personal development 

opportunities and ensuring fair policies/system to create a conducive and positive work 

environment for all.  

 

Our Workforce 

We aim to be an employer of choice. The ability to continuously attract, motivate, grow and 

retain talent is key to our success. With more than 300 employees presently, the Group will 

expand our workforce in line with the requirements of our business.  

Our success would not have been possible without the efforts of our dedicated employees, 

and strong collaborative relationships between employees to achieve the Group’s business 

objectives. We recruit dynamic individuals from diverse backgrounds and provide employees 

with equal opportunities to discover their full potential. We believe that maintaining a culture 

of open, two-way communications in the workplace is essential for enhancing employee 

engagement, building effective teams, and fostering a better work environment for all. 

 

Appraisals and Evaluation 

The Group conducts a performance review with all employees on an annual basis. This process 

enables us to assess and evaluate every individual’s abilities, and recognise the contributions 

and efforts of employees. With a better understanding of the capabilities and progress of our 

employees, we are able to provide them with opportunities for personal development and 

career advancement through training and promotions.  

The Group believes in a robust and fair reward system to motivate our employees to achieve 

performance targets that are aligned to the Group’s business objectives. Employees are 

rewarded accordingly when the specific targets are met. The Group treasures talent, and aims 

to retain productive employees with the relevant skills and positive work attitude.  

 

Diversity and Fair Employment Practices/Equal Employment 

Opportunity 

The Group enforces a policy of hiring, employing, training and compensating employees in a 

non-discriminatory way, and without regard to race, gender, religion, age or nationality. The 

Group also hires based on merit and employs the best talent for the job. The Group has a 

fairly balanced mix of males and females in its workplace.
