VISION

 

A trusted global company 

building a sustainable future.

MISSION

 

We deliver solutions for 

sustainable urbanisation safely, 

responsibly and profitably.


Keppel is an eco-system of companies providing solutions for 

sustainable urbanisation, whether in terms of meeting energy and 

environmental needs, or providing various urban development, 

connectivity and asset management solutions. We are making 

sustainability our business, through creating diverse solutions 

which are good for the planet, for people and for Keppel. 

WE ARE BUILDING

A SUSTAINABLE 

FUTURE FOR ALL

OUR STAKEHOLDERS.






DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

A TEST OF RESILIENCE 

COVID-19 is having a significant impact 

on the lives of countless people around 

the world. Many governments have 

responded by taking unprecedented 

steps, including lockdowns and border 

controls, to flatten the infection curve. 

The pandemic has caused considerable 

hardship for affected communities, 

sharply slowed down global economic 

activity, and disrupted many aspects of 

modern life that we have come to take 

for granted. For companies, COVID-19 

has also underscored the importance 

of looking at long-term risks, having 

comprehensive business continuity plans, 

and ultimately of building sustainable 

businesses that remain resilient amidst 

adversity and can respond nimbly to 

unexpected developments.

While COVID-19 is currently the focus 

of media and public attention, climate 

change remains one of the most serious 

challenges facing the world today. 

Like COVID-19, it transcends borders 

and can fundamentally transform the 

world as we know it. Unlike COVID-19, 

its impact may be even greater, more 

devastating, and longer lasting. There is 

no quick fix or vaccine for climate change. 

Efforts to combat climate change require 

coordinated and sustained international 

effort, long-term commitments, and 

trade-offs that we must each be 

prepared to make.

COMMITTED TO CLIMATE ACTION

Over the past few years, there has been 

growing international consensus on the 

importance of sustainable development 

and climate action. At the United Nations 

Climate Action Summit last September, 

70 countries committed to deliver more 

ambitious national climate plans in 2020, 

in pursuit of the goal of net-zero emissions 

by 2050. Singapore has also enhanced 

its pledge under the Paris Agreement, 

with an aim to peak its emissions 

around 2030, half the emissions from

its 2030 peak by 2050, and achieve net

zero emissions as soon as viable. To 

incentivise industries to improve energy 

efficiency and reduce emissions, Singapore 

implemented a carbon tax in 2019, with

the intention of increasing it over the next

10 years, and is actively pursuing cleaner 

energy solutions. 

Keppel is committed to supporting the 

efforts of the international community 

and the Singapore government to advance 

climate action.

In 2019, the Board reviewed the

Company’s sustainability reporting 

framework and material environmental, 

social and governance (ESG) factors.

We have included Environmental 

Stewardship as a key strategic thrust,

and climate action as a material ESG factor 

that we should focus on.

Environmental sustainability is a key 

consideration in our business decisions, 

and has been woven into the performance 

appraisal of senior management across 

the Group. We will avoid highly pollutive 

businesses such as coal-fired plants, and 

focus more on renewables and cleaner 

energy such as gas. We will also include 

an internal carbon price in the evaluation 

of all major investment decisions. For our 

existing businesses and assets, we will 

focus on enhancing energy efficiency, 

including harnessing renewable energy 

where possible.

We will put our engineering capabilities 

to work on solutions to combat climate 

change, and in the process, also create

new business opportunities for the Group. 

Last year, we established a new business 

unit, Keppel Renewable Energy, to pursue 

opportunities for Keppel as a developer, 

owner and operator of renewable

energy infrastructure.

Our pivot towards renewables and 

cleaner fossil fuels can already be seen 

in some of our businesses such as Keppel 

Offshore &amp; Marine, with renewables and 

LNG-related solutions making up over 60% 

of new orders secured in 2019. 

On 1 January 2020, Keppel Bay Tower, 

where Keppel Corporation is headquartered,

became Singapore’s first commercial 

development to be fully powered by 

renewable energy. Through energy 

efficiency initiatives implemented across 

the Group in 2019, as well as energy savings 

from Keppel Land’s Green Mark-certified 

developments, we have saved an estimated 

862,264 GJ of energy in the past year, 

translating to an estimated $60 million 

in cost savings.

Since 2014, we have set ourselves a 

target to reduce carbon emissions 

intensity by 16% from 2020 business as 

usual levels. In 2018, we set a longer-term 

target to achieve a 28.8% reduction in 

carbon emissions intensity from 2010 

levels by 2030. Both targets are aligned 

with national goals set by the Singapore 

Government over the years. I am pleased 

to report that as at end-2019, we have 

achieved a more than 30% average 

reduction in carbon emissions intensity 

from our 2010 baseline, and are well 

on track to achieving our 2020 target. 

We will continue to explore how we can 

push ourselves to do even more for 

climate change. Starting from this year, 

we have expanded our tracking of carbon 

emissions from Scope 1 and 2 to include 

Scope 3 emissions, such as emissions 

from business travel. We have also 

set long-term targets to reduce water 

consumption and waste intensity, and 

increase renewable energy generation. 

STRONG FOUNDATIONS

Commitment to good corporate governance 

is essential to the sustainability of any 

business. In 2019, Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine 

became one of the first companies in 

Singapore to achieve global certification

for the ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery Management 

System. We are progressively implementing 

the same standard throughout the Group. 

We have also enhanced the Group’s 

whistle-blower policy with centralised 

procedures and whistle-blower reporting 

channels including email and local 

toll-free hotlines.

Our people are our most valuable resource. 

We respect and uphold fair employment 

practices, and human rights principles. 

In 2019, we formalised our corporate 

statement on diversity and inclusion, 

which is publicly available on our website. 

We are committed to investing in people 

development to grow the capabilities of 

our workforce to drive Keppel’s growth 

and continue creating value for our 

stakeholders. This year, in the Company’s 

Employee Engagement Survey, we achieved

KEPPEL IS COMMITTED TO 

SUPPORTING THE EFFORTS OF 

THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 

AND THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT

WE WILL PUT OUR ENGINEERING 

CAPABILITIES TO WORK ON

an overall employee engagement score 

of 86%, higher than the 82% and 80% 

achieved in 2017 and 2015 respectively, 

and significantly higher than the average 

of 76% among Singapore companies. 

We were also recognised in Forbes’ Global

2000 rankings as one of the World’s Best 

Regarded Companies 2019 and World's 

Best Employers 2019. 

Safety is a core value at Keppel, and

we are guided by a robust Health,

Safety and Environment policy which

all our employees and suppliers are 

required to adhere to. Amid COVID-19, 

the health and well-being of our employees, 

contractors and other stakeholders have 

been our top priority and we have put in 

place various measures to minimise the 

spreading of the virus, including working from 

home where possible and safe distancing 

measures at the workplace. I am also 

pleased to share that we achieved our 

goal of zero fatalities in 2019, for the first 

time in over 25 years. We will continue to 

innovate and improve our safety standards, 

to ensure that everyone goes home safe 

every day. 

Suppliers of the Keppel Group of 

companies are expected to abide by

support the planting of 10,000 trees over the 

next five years in parks and nature reserves 

in Singapore, reflecting our heightened 

commitment to environmental stewardship 

and climate action. NParks has announced 

that this is the single largest donation pledged 

for tree planting in Singapore to date. 

STRENGTHENING DISCLOSURES

Since 2018, Keppel has been a signatory 

of the United Nations Global Compact, 

the world’s largest corporate sustainability 

initiative promoting sustainable business 

practices. We affirm our support of the 

Global Compact’s 10 principles on 

human rights, labour, environment and 

anti-corruption, and this report serves

as our Communication on Progress. 

We also support the Taskforce on 

Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

and are working towards incorporating 

its recommendations on voluntary

climate-related disclosures in our 

reporting framework. 

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE 

Today, Keppel is an eco-system of companies 

providing solutions for sustainable 

urbanisation, whether in terms of meeting 

energy and environmental needs, or providing 

various urban development, connectivity 

and asset management solutions.

We are encouraged by the international 

recognition of our sustainability efforts. 

Keppel Corporation was upgraded to 

the highest triple-A rank in the Morgan 

Stanley Capital International (MSCI) 

ESG ratings in February 2020, and 

ranks among the top 11% of industrial 

conglomerates in the MSCI All Country 

World Index based on ESG criteria.

For the first time, Keppel also won the 

Singapore Environmental Achievement 

Award in the services category at the 

Singapore Environmental Council’s 

Environmental Achievement Awards 2019. 

As we seek to build a sustainable

future, we look forward to deepening 

collaboration with all our stakeholders 

to create diverse solutions which are 

good for the planet, for people and 

for Keppel.

CARING FOR THE COMMUNITY

Keppelites are making a positive impact 

in communities wherever we operate.

I am proud to share that Keppel Volunteers 

contributed more than 18,000 hours to 

serving the community, more than our 

target of 10,000 hours, and an increase 

of over 4,000 hours compared to 2018. 

Our volunteer outreach includes activities 

in Singapore such as packing and 

distributing food and household items 

to low-income households, as well as 

overseas programmes such as poverty 

alleviation efforts in Mabian County in 

Sichuan Province, China, and the Words 

on Wheels initiative in Ho Chi Minh City, 

Vietnam, to promote literacy. During the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we also committed 

more than $5 million to support international 

and local efforts to combat the coronavirus.

We are committed to care for the 

underprivileged and uplift lives. In 2019, 

Keppel pledged $500,000 over the next 

three years to support the sheltered 

workshop programme run by SPD, a local 

charity supporting persons with disabilities. 

The programme aims to help persons with 

disabilities improve their job prospects 

through providing vocational training, 

therapy and employment support services. 

Beyond financial support, Keppel will bring 

the Group’s capabilities in areas such as 

engineering, workplace safety, business 

development and marketing to help enhance 

the sheltered workshop programme through 

skills-based volunteerism.

More recently, in 2020, we have also pledged 

to donate $3 million to support NParks’ One 

Million Trees movement. The donation will 

As we seek to build a sustainable future,

we look forward to deepening collaboration 

with all our stakeholders to create diverse 

solutions which are good for the planet,

for people and for Keppel.

OUR STRATEGY

Keppel is an eco-system of companies, collaborating to provide solutions for 

a fast-urbanising world. We regard sustainable urbanisation both as a corporate 

responsibility and a source of business opportunities. We are harnessing the Group’s 

capabilities and proven track record in engineering, project development, operating 

and managing specialised assets, capital and asset management, and growing new 

businesses aligned with these competencies.

In 2019, Keppel Corporation’s sustainability reporting framework and material ESG factors 

were updated and refined, taking into account changes in the external environment as well as 

a comprehensive review of the Company’s material ESG factors which was conducted from 

December 2018 to April 2019. 

Reflecting our increased focus on environmental sustainability, the three strategic pillars 

under the framework have been updated to (1) Environmental Stewardship; (2) Responsible 

Business; and (3) People and Community. 

WE REGARD 

SUSTAINABLE 

URBANISATION

BOTH AS A 

CORPORATE 

RESPONSIBILITY

AND A SOURCE

OF BUSINESS 

OPPORTUNITIES. 

We will do our part to combat climate change, and are 

committed to resource efficiency and reducing our 

environmental impact. We will avoid highly pollutive businesses 

such as coal-fired plants, emphasise renewables and cleaner 

energy such as gas, and channel our engineering capabilities as 

a solutions provider to contribute to the fight against climate 

change. We have set targets to reduce waste, water and 

carbon emissions intensity, and to invest in renewable 

energy generation.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

People are the cornerstone of our businesses. We are 

committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace, as well as 

investing in training and developing our people to help them 

reach their full potential.

As a global citizen, Keppel believes that as communities 

thrive, we thrive. We are committed to uplifting communities 

wherever we operate, and supporting initiatives that protect 

the environment, promote education and care for the 

underprivileged, with the goal of building a sustainable 

future together.

PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY

The long-term sustainability of our business is driven at the 

highest level of the organisation through strong corporate 

governance and prudent risk management.

Through our integrated business model, we seek to improve 

both the magnitude and quality of our earnings with more 

recurring income, while enhancing returns through active capital 

recycling. We work closely with stakeholders in our value chain 

to enhance their sustainability performance, and continue to 

drive innovation and seize new opportunities.

GRI 102-46 | 102-47 | 102-49 

Our materiality assessments are based on 

Reporting Principles from the GRI Standards 

on Defining Report Content – stakeholder 

inclusiveness, sustainability context, 

materiality and completeness. 

Materiality with respect to sustainability 

reporting, as defined by GRI Standards, 

includes topics and indicators that reflect 

the organisation’s significant economic, 

environmental, and social impacts; 

and would substantively influence 

the assessments and decisions 

of stakeholders.

A comprehensive review of the Company’s 

material Environmental, Social and 

Governance (ESG) factors was conducted 

from December 2018 to April 2019. 

The process was supported by an 

independent consultant and involved 

surveys, workshops and interviews 

with around 170 internal and external 

stakeholders, an assessment of long-term 

global trends and an internal review of 

our businesses. The review resulted 

in a comprehensive matrix categorising 

factors according to their importance 

to internal and external stakeholders. 

Factors were prioritised according to

their importance to both internal and 

external stakeholders. 

Arising from the review, a revised 

sustainability reporting framework and 

an updated set of material ESG factors 

were presented to and approved by 

Keppel Corporation’s Board of Directors.

Support of human rights

Principle 2

Exclusion of human rights 

abuses

Keppel upholds and respects the fundamental 

principles set out in the UN universal declaration 

of human rights and the International Labour 

Organisation’s (ILO) declaration on fundamental 

principles and rights at work.

Our approach to human rights is informed and guided 

by general concepts from the UN Guiding Principles 

on Business and Human Rights.

We respect the values and cultures of the people 

and the communities in which we operate, and aim 

to serve as a positive influence.

Our stance on human rights is formalised in our 

corporate statement on human rights which is 

publicly available online.

Our suppliers are expected to abide by the 

Keppel supplier code of conduct, which sets our 

expectations for suppliers to respect and uphold 

fundamental human rights in their operations.

Where applicable, our business units conduct outreach 

programmes and briefings to subcontractor workers 

to inform them of their employment rights, and the 

available channels to report any violation of their rights.

In the broader community, we contribute towards 

providing educational opportunities to the 

disadvantaged through scholarships and bursaries, 

as well as offer skills development and job training 

opportunities at our workplaces.

our suppliers on pages 52 and 53.

the disadvantaged on pages 72 and 73.

LABOUR

Principle 3

Assurance of freedom

Principle 4

Elimination of all forms of 

forced and compulsory labour

Principle 5

Abolition of child labour

We have zero tolerance for unethical labour practices 

such as child labour, forced labour, slavery and 

human trafficking in any of our operations. Keppel 

also supports the elimination of exploitative labour.

Unions are our partners and we place great 

emphasis on maintaining a harmonious relationship. 

Approximately 19.3% of our global workforce 

are bargainable employees covered by 

collective agreements.

We adhere to national labour laws and regulations 

wherever we operate. In Singapore, both local and 

foreign workers receive protection under the Penal Code 

and employment legislation such as the Employment 

Act and Workplace Safety and Health Act. In addition, 

foreign workers, especially the lower-skilled and 

lower-income workers, are accorded additional 

protection under the Employment of Foreign 

Manpower Act and the Employment Agencies Act. 

The Keppel supplier code sets out the standards 

of conduct which our suppliers are expected to 

adhere to in relation to child labour, forced labour, 

freedom of association, equal opportunity and 

fair compensation. 

 Read more about our labour practices and supplier 

code of conduct on pages 64 to 70, and 52 and 53.

Principle 6

Elimination of discrimination

Our hiring policies ensure equal employment 

opportunities for all. New hires are considered 

based on individual competencies as well as 

organisational and job fit. Our employment 

statistics are reviewed regularly.

In Singapore, Keppel adheres to the tripartite 

guidelines on fair employment practices and 

endorses the employers’ pledge of fair employment 

practices. A key principle espoused in the guidelines 

is that the recruitment of employees should be on 

the basis of merit and regardless of race or other 

characteristics, such as age and gender. Keppel is 

also a signatory to the Singapore Business 

Federation’s Sustainable Employment Pledge 

to uplift employees and partners.

The Keppel Group Code of Conduct sets the tone in 

relation to the Group’s stance against discrimination 

on any basis.

We formalised a Corporate Statement on Diversity 

and Inclusion in 2019 to promote diversity and equal 

opportunity in the workplace, and have made this 

publicly available at our corporate website.

We adhere to provisions of national laws and 

regulations concerning discrimination wherever 

we operate. Our company policies and procedures 

make qualifications, skills and experience the basis for 

the recruitment, placement, training and advancement 

of staff at all levels. If any discrimination is identified, 

guidelines are in place for the appropriate handling of 

any grievance cases to address complaints, handle 

appeals and provide recourse for employees.

Development and

Sustainability is a key consideration in the Company’s 

investment decisions, and environmental sustainability 

has been woven into the performance appraisal of 

senior management across the Group.

The Group’s risk-based strategies are used to assess, 

avoid, reduce and mitigate environmental risks and 

impacts. Climate-related risks, including physical and 

transition risks, are incorporated in our Enterprise 

Risk Management framework. 

The proactive management of our environmental impact 

enables us to improve resource efficiency, reduce 

cost and support the global climate change agenda.

Our approach to environmental management covers 

the following aspects:

• fulfilling compliance obligations;

• protecting the environment by preventing or 

mitigating adverse environmental impacts;

• enhancing environmental performance;

• achieving financial and operational benefits that 

can result from implementing environmentally 

sound alternatives that strengthen Keppel’s 

market position; and

• communicating environmental information to 

relevant interested parties.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

Principle 10

Measures against corruption

Guided by our core values and the Keppel Group 

Code of Conduct, we are fully committed to ensuring 

that compliance is a central pillar of our management 

and an integral part of our corporate culture and 

business processes. We will do business the 

right way and comply with all applicable laws and 

regulations wherever we operate.

Our tone for regulatory compliance is clear and 

consistently reiterated from the top and throughout 

all levels of the Group. We have zero tolerance for 

fraud, bribery, corruption and violation of laws 

and regulations.

Our regulatory compliance governance structure is 

designed to strengthen our corporate governance. 

The board risk committee supports the Board in its 

oversight of regulatory compliance and is responsible 

for driving the Group’s implementation of effective 

compliance and governance systems.

We continue to improve our risk-based due diligence 

process for all third-party associates who represent 

the Keppel Group in business dealings, including our 

joint venture partners, to assess the compliance risk 

of the business partner. In addition to background 

checks, the due diligence process incorporates 

requirements for third-party associates to 

acknowledge understanding and compliance 

with our code of conduct.

Keppel’s Whistle-Blower Policy encourages 

the reporting of suspected bribery or misconduct 

through a clearly-defined process and reporting 

channel, by which reports can be made in confidence 

and without fear of reprisal.

We have a strict code of conduct that applies to all 

employees, who are required to acknowledge and 

comply with the code. The code covers areas from 

conduct in the workplace to business conduct, 

including clear provisions on prohibitions against 

bribery and corruption, and conflicts of interests, 

amongst others.

We ensure that our compliance policies and procedures 

are communicated effectively to all employees and 

directors. These include policies on anti-bribery, gifts 

and hospitality, agent fees, donations and sponsorships, 

solicitation and extortion, conflict of interest, and 

insider trading, amongst others.

The procedures and rules defined in the Group’s global 

anti-bribery policy encapsulate key points of the 

Group’s zero-tolerance approach towards bribery.

An e-training and assessment exercise covering all 

key policies, including the Keppel Group Code of Conduct, 

is carried out an annual basis, and targeted training focused 

on line manager responsibilities and employee obligations 

were conducted in 2019. All 16,544 directors and employees 

completed the e-training and toolbox training in 2019.

Enhancements were made to the Whistle-Blower Policy, 

with centralised procedures and whistle-blower reporting 

channels, including an email hotline, local toll-free 

whistle-blower hotlines for Singapore, Brazil, China, USA, 

Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, Australia, UK and Germany, 

and an online reporting portal. The manning of these 

reporting channels is outsourced to a third party (KPMG).

In 2019, Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine completed the 

ISO 37001 (Anti-Bribery Management System) 

certification for its global operations in USA, Brazil, 

Middle East, China, Philippines, India and Bulgaria, thus 

completing the attainment of ISO 37001 certification at 

all Keppel O&amp;M operating entities globally. We will work 

progressively towards ISO 37001 certification for all 

other Keppel business units.

OVERVIEW

GRI 103-1 

There is growing international recognition 

that climate change can fundamentally 

affect the way the world operates in the 

twenty-first century. 

Singapore has announced that it would 

be enhancing its nationally determined 

contribution under the Paris Agreement, 

with an aim to peak its emissions around 

2030, halve the emissions from its 2030 

peak by 2050, and achieve net zero 

emissions as soon as viable. In working 

towards this target, the Singapore 

government introduced a carbon tax, 

under the Carbon Pricing Act, which came 

into force in 2019. The tax is applied on the 

total direct emissions of facilities that emit 

25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 

(tCO2e) or more of emissions annually.

Keppel is committed to support efforts 

by the international community and the 

Singapore government to address climate 

change. Climate action has been identified 

as one of the material ESG factors for 

the Group. We have woven environmental 

considerations into our company strategy 

and set targets to reduce our carbon 

emissions, waste generation and water 

consumption intensities. Given Keppel’s 

capabilities and track record, we are 

also well positioned to tap on business 

opportunities that may arise from providing 

solutions that support international efforts 

to combat climate change. 

REPORT BOUNDARY

GRI 102-48 | 103-1 | 305-1 | 305-2 | 305-3 

The boundaries for the material topics 

of climate action and environmental 

performance report include the Group’s 

major subsidiaries in Singapore and 

overseas operations in which the Group 

has operational control. This includes 

Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M) 

and its significant subsidiaries – Keppel 

FELS and Keppel Shipyard, Keppel 

Land, Keppel Infrastructure, Keppel

Telecommunications &amp; Transportation

and Keppel Capital. We expanded the 

scope of our reporting in 2019 to include 

contributions by M1, following the 

acquisition of M1 in 1H2019.

Over the past year, we have strengthened 

our tracking of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 

emissions. We have reviewed and adjusted 

our approach, reporting boundaries 

and calculation methodology for closer 

alignment with the requirements of an 

operational control approach under the 

GHG Protocol. We will account for 100% 

of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from operations

over which we have operational control. 

However, for assets that are considered 

as investments1, we will report our equity 

share of emissions under Scope 3. As part 

of our tracking of Scope 3 emissions, 

we have also started tracking emissions 

from business travel2. Our three-year 

environmental performance data, as 

disclosed on page 29, has been restated 

to reflect the changes in our reporting 

boundaries and methodology.

GOVERNANCE

Governance around 

climate-related risks and 

opportunities.

The key material environmental, social and governance factors for Keppel Corporation, which 

include climate action and environmental management, have been identified and are regularly 

reviewed by Keppel Corporation’s Board of Directors and management. The Board oversees 

the management and monitoring of these factors and takes them into consideration in the 

determination of the Company’s strategic direction and policies. 

The Group Sustainability Steering Committee, chaired by Keppel Corporation’s Chief Executive 

Officer Loh Chin Hua and comprising senior management from across the Group, provides guidance 

on the Group’s sustainability strategy while the Group Sustainability Working Committee, comprising 

discipline-specific working groups, executes, monitors and reports on the Group’s efforts. 

Environmental sustainability has been woven into the performance appraisal of senior 

management across the Group.

47 to 49

STRATEGY

Actual and potential 

impacts of climate-related 

risks and opportunities.

Keppel's mission is to deliver solutions for sustainable urbanisation. Our suite of solutions for energy, 

urban living, clean environments and connectivity help cities urbanise in a sustainable manner. 

During the year, the Board reviewed the Company’s material ESG issues and strengthened its 

focus on climate action. 

As part of our environmental sustainability strategy, we have defined the kinds of pollutive sectors 

we will not go into, such as coal-fired plants, the businesses we will maintain, and those which we 

will work towards growing and expanding, such as renewables and circular economy solutions. We will 

also be introducing an internal carbon price in the evaluation of all major investment decisions. 

The Group considers environmental factors during the planning and design of our projects and assets, 

such as property and infrastructure developments, as well as during their operational phases.

We have established a new business unit, Keppel Renewable Energy, to pursue opportunities as a 

developer, owner and operator of renewable energy infrastructure. We have also been re-purposing our 

technology, such as in the offshore and marine business, to seize opportunities in renewables.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Processes used to identify, 

assess, and manage 

climate-related risks.

Risks and opportunities relating to climate change have been recognised as fundamental to 

the Group. These relate to physical and transitional risks stemming from climate change and 

environmental management, which present both risks and opportunities for the Group.

A Sustainability Risk Framework, aligned to the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 

Framework, guides the Group on the specific processes and methods applied in identifying, 

assessing and managing sustainability-related risks and opportunities. 

As part of an environmental sustainability strategy workshop, business units across the Group 

participated in a discussion by an external environmental consultant on opportunities and risks 

associated with climate change. The discussions were facilitated by the external environmental 

consultant, and covered risks specific to the industries in which Keppel operates.

Beyond managing climate-related risks and opportunities under the ERM framework, all our key 

business units are certified to the ISO 14001 environmental management system, which guides 

how we identify, manage, monitor and control environmental issues.

The Group is also actively pursuing opportunities to harness its capabilities to provide solutions 

for sustainable urbanisation, which can help to reduce climate-related risks.

47 to 49

METRICS AND 

TARGETS

Metrics and targets used 

to assess and manage 

climate-related risks and 

opportunities which are 

material to our business.

To support the climate change agenda, we have targets to reduce our carbon emissions intensity. 

We have also set new targets to reduce waste generation and water consumption, as well as 

invest in renewable energy generation. 

We have been tracking our Scopes 1 and 2 emissions since 2010, and will start tracking Scope 3 

emissions from 2020. 

In measuring and reporting our greenhouse gas emissions, we reference global standards including 

the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, and use the 

operational control approach in accounting for our emissions.

RENEWABLE ENERGY

The Group has a target to grow our 

portfolio of renewable energy to 7 GW by 

2030, and has also continued to promote 

the generation and usage of renewable 

energy. Keppel installed a total capacity 

of 8.8 megawatt peak (MWp) at its yards 

in 2019, and currently has a total capacity 

of 8.95 MWp. Keppel will continue to grow 

its renewables capacity with plans to install 

an additional capacity of 1.11 MWp in 2020. 

Keppel Bay Tower

On 1 January 2020, Keppel Bay Tower, where 

Keppel Corporation is headquartered, became 

Singapore’s first commercial development 

to use renewable energy to power all its 

operations, including the offices of tenants 

in the building.

Keppel Land, the owner and operator of 

Keppel Bay Tower, will be installing an 

assembly of photovoltaic (PV) panels 

spanning about 400 square metres (m2) 

on the roof of the 18-storey Keppel Bay 

Tower, as well as its six-storey podium 

block. When completed in 1H 2020, Keppel 

Bay Tower’s PV system is expected to 

generate an energy yield of about 100,000 kWh 

per annum. Keppel’s latest initiative to install 

PV panels at Keppel Bay Tower reduces the 

building’s reliance on grid power. 

SUSTAINABLE DESIGN 

In line with our mission of providing 

solutions for sustainable urbanisation, 

the Group considers environmental factors 

during the planning and design of our 

projects and assets such as property and 

infrastructure developments, as well as 

during their operational phases. 

A leading green developer, Keppel Land 

has garnered a total of 84 Building and 

Construction Authority of Singapore (BCA) 

Green Mark Awards, of which 16 are 

Platinum. The total estimated reduction 

in energy consumption from all of Keppel 

Land’s Green Mark-awarded projects 

when they are fully completed will be over 

220 million kilowatt hours (kWh) per annum, 

which is the equivalent amount of energy 

required to power more than 40,000 homes1 

in Singapore for one year. This translates 

to cost savings of about $45 million and 

a carbon emissions reduction of almost 

95,000 tonnes annually. In addition, a total 

annual water savings of about 2.5 million 

cubic metres is also achieved.

To recognise Keppel Corporation, 

Keppel Land and Keppel Capital for their 

commitment towards environmental 

protection and efforts in improving staff 

health and well-being, BCA and Health 

Promotion Board (HPB) awarded all three 

companies the BCA-HPB Green Mark 

Platinum certification for Healthier 

Workplaces in 2019. All three locations 

are fully powered by clean energy and are 

equipped with smart LED lighting systems 

and indoor air-quality monitors. 

In Singapore, The Garden Residences, 

a joint venture between Keppel Land and 

Wing Tai Asia, was certified to the BCA 

Green Mark Award GoldPlus standard for its 

green features, which includes the use of 

energy efficient air-conditioning units, LED 

light fittings and motion sensors, and rain 

water harvesting. 

In China, Park Avenue Central achieved 

the LEED Gold and WELL Gold certification 

for its environmentally friendly features and 

efforts to improve the health and well-being 

of its occupants. In Vietnam, Keppel Land’s 

Saigon Centre received the Green Mark Award 

for Buildings (Overseas) Gold standard for 

its well-insulated façade, highly efficient 

chiller plant, air distribution system and 

lightings, and efficient water fittings, among 

other green features. 

In 2019, the Keppel Marina East Desalination 

Plant in Singapore achieved the Public Utilities 

Board’s ABC Waters Certification (Gold), 

which is the highest accolade that can be 

attained by developers. With its integrated 

sustainable stormwater management 

system, stormwater run-off will flow from 

the plant’s green roof into a natural filtration 

system, known as a bio-retention basin. The 

run-off is later collected in rainwater 

harvesting ponds to be recycled. 



The Group obtained its first green loan 

facilities in 2019 to finance eligible green 

projects including Seasons City (pictured) 

in the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City.

Keppel Land, through its electricity retailer, 

Keppel Electric, is also purchasing Renewable 

Energy Certificates (RECs), which are 

generated from PV panels installed in 

Keppel O&amp;M’s yards in Singapore.

Together with the purchase of RECs, 

these initiatives will result in a reduction 

of over 2,400 tonnes of carbon emissions

per annum – an amount which would 

otherwise require about 12,000 trees to 

absorb over about 50 years.

Offshore Renewables

In 2019, Keppel O&amp;M made significant 

strides into the renewable energy sector, 

with gas and renewable solutions making 

up over 60% of the company's new orders. 

Significantly, the company secured new 

contracts worth about $720 million for 

offshore wind projects in the German 

sector of the North Sea and Taiwan.

In May 2019, Keppel O&amp;M, through a 

consortium with Aibel AS, secured a 

contract from TenneT Offshore for the

construction, installation and commissioning 

of a 900MW offshore high voltage direct 

current converter station and an onshore 

converter station. Scheduled to be 

completed in 2024, the two converter 

stations will be deployed in the German 

sector of the North Sea. Keppel O&amp;M 

also secured a contract from Ørsted for 

two offshore wind farm substations 

which will be deployed in Ørsted’s Greater 

Changhua offshore wind sites in Taiwan. 

The substations are scheduled to be 

completed in 2021.

Keppel O&amp;M will continue to seize 

opportunities in offshore renewables 

and gas, which is considered to be one 

of the safest and cleanest fossil fuels.

GREEN FINANCING

Reflecting the Group’s commitment to 

sustainability, Keppel business units, 

namely Keppel REIT and Keppel Land China, 

obtained their first green loan facilities in 

2019, amounting to a total of $825 million1. 



Renewables and gas solutions made up 

more than 60% of Keppel O&amp;M's new 

orders in 2019.

The loans are being used by Keppel REIT to 

finance or re-finance eligible green projects 

and by Keppel Land China to finance the 

development of Seasons City (Phase 1), 

a BCA Green Mark Platinum (Provisional) 

commercial project in the Sino-Singapore 

Tianjin Eco-City.

ENERGY 

GRI 302-1 | 302-4 

The Group’s energy demand comprises a 

mix of direct and indirect sources of energy. 

Direct energy refers to primary sources of 

energy consumed on site by our operations, 

whereas indirect energy is electricity 

purchased from external suppliers.

The Group’s primary energy sources are 

diesel, naphtha, piped natural gas, petrol, 

furnace oil and liquefied petroleum gas. 

In 2019, the Group consumed 291,539 

gigajoules (GJ) of direct energy and 

1,642,415 GJ of indirect energy or electricity, 

compared to 248,861 GJ of direct energy 

and 1,254,223 GJ of indirect energy in 2018. 

Our Singapore operations consumed 

184,513 GJ of direct energy and 1,215,727 GJ 

of indirect energy in 2019, compared to 

141,282 GJ of direct energy and 949,404 GJ 

of indirect energy in 2018. The data includes 

direct energy used in activities carried out 

by both employees and contractors at 

our worksites.

Improving Energy Efficiency 

The Group is estimated to have saved 

862,264 GJ2 of energy from its energy 

efficiency initiatives in 2019 and through 

green initiatives implemented at Keppel Land’s 

Green Mark-certified developments. The total 

energy saving is equivalent to about 44%

of the Group’s total energy consumption in 

2019, and translates to estimated cost savings 

of about $60 million3 and an avoidance of 

approximately 100,000 tCO2e in emissions4. 

These savings were achieved through the 

optimisation of operations and processes; 

technological improvements, including the 

adoption of more sustainable building designs 

and materials; and the use of energy-efficient 

equipment and devices. Examples of 

initiatives undertaken in 2019 include: 

• Optimisation of chilled water pump 

pressure system and removal of strainer 

mesh to reduce system pressure head 

at Keppel DHCS’ plants at Biopolis@

one-north, Changi Business Park and 

Woodlands Wafer Fab Park, which 

achieved energy savings of 813,500 kWh;

Cost savings from the reduced usage of fossil fuels, such as diesel, and a reduction in electricity consumed. The amount of savings in absolute terms is the difference in 

consumption before and after the implementation of an energy efficiency project.

The 862,264 GJ in savings comprise savings from the reduced usage of fossil fuels, such as diesel, and a reduction in electricity consumed. The amount of savings in 

absolute terms is the difference in consumption before and after the implementation of an energy efficiency project. The savings are converted to energy equivalent in GJ 

based on the corresponding energy conversion factors for fossil fuels and electricity published in the United Kingdom’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 

2015 (DEFRA 2015) Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, whereby 1 kWh = 0.0036 GJ and 1 tonne of diesel = 43.33 GJ. A significant proportion of 

the savings are achieved through green initiatives implemented at Keppel Land’s Green Mark certified developments.

3 

The electricity conversion factor used is based on DEFRA 2015 Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, whereby 1 kWh = 0.0036 GJ. Estimated 

monetary savings are calculated based on the average electricity tariff rates in 2019 as published by SP Group, whereby 1 kWh = $0.2522.

4 

The electricity savings in carbon dioxide equivalent was estimated by multiplying the energy savings in kWh with the Electricity Grid Emission Factors for 2018 from 

Singapore’s Energy Market Authority (EMA), whereby 1 kWh = 0.4188 kg CO2.

5 

The environmental performance data for 2017 and 2018 have been restated to reflect the changes in our reporting boundaries and methodology. Emissions from our 

investments that were previously reported under Scopes 1 or 2, are now accounted for under Scope 3 using the equity share approach. Scope 3 emissions in 2017 and 

2018 exclude data from Keppel Merlimau Cogen Plant's power generation operations, as this was not reported in previous years due to commercial sensitivity.

STRATEGIC PILLAR: ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP


• Installing Variable Speed Drives (VSDs) 

in three ballast pumps at our shipyards. 

Regulating the speeds of the VSDs with 

actual demand has yielded annual 

savings of 518,400 kWh; and

• Upgrading to LED lightings and 

replacement of chilled water system 

with WDX systems at our data centres 

which produced total annual energy 

savings of 7.4 million kWh.

In 2018, Keppel Land was awarded a 

grant of about $1.28 million by BCA to 

testbed new and emerging technologies 

which would reduce the building’s energy 

consumption significantly and improve its 

energy efficiency by 20% compared to other 

Green Mark Platinum buildings by June 2020. 

Keppel is currently on track to meet its goal 

of reducing the annual energy consumption 

of Keppel Bay Tower to 115 kWh/m2

per annum from its initial consumption 

of about 145 kWh/m2 per annum by June 

2020. Keppel Bay Tower is also working 

with tenants to adopt green leases and 

install energy-efficient LED lamps in their 

offices at no additional capital investments 

to the tenants, as well as helping them 

attain Green Mark certification. Moving 

ahead, Keppel Land is also actively seeking 

new solutions to further reduce the building’s 

energy consumption to below 100 kWh/m2 

per annum, which would result in Keppel 

Bay Tower being 50% more energy efficient 

compared to typical office buildings 

in Singapore.

WATER 

GRI 303-1 | 303-3 

Water is a precious resource. The Group 

continues to strengthen its water conservation 

efforts through initiatives such as promoting

water-saving practices, adopting water-efficient

technologies and equipment as well as 

implementing process improvements. 

The total water consumption of the Group 

consists of potable water (water from local 

catchment and imported water), NEWater 

(treated wastewater from sewage), recycled 

water and water drawn from rivers. The Group 

consumed 4,457,346 cubic metres (m3) of 

water in 2019, an increase of 23% compared 

to 3,610,996 m3 in 2018. The increase is 

mainly due to acquisitions by Keppel Land 

and increased water usage by Keppel FELS. 

Our operations in Singapore consumed 

3,007,895 m3 of water compared to 

2,188,902 m3 in 2018. 

Water consumption reduction efforts include 

the optimisation of cooling towers at Keppel DC 

Singapore 5, which results in water savings 

of 6,000 m3 per annum. Rainwater harvesting 

for gas hose testing is also practised at 

Keppel FELS yards, which reduces water 

consumption by 35,000 m3 per year.

In recognition of its efforts to reduce water 

consumption, two of Keppel Logistics’ 

warehouses in Singapore received the PUB

Water Efficient Building Certification in 2019. 

In land-scarce Singapore, refuse is 

incinerated at WTE plants to reduce the 

volume of waste and to remove harmful 

substances before disposal at the landfill. 

Heat from the incineration of waste is 

recovered to produce electricity. Incineration 

is also preferable to land filling in Singapore 

and many other countries, as the direct burial 

of waste produces significant amounts of 

methane, a GHG. A total 23,216 t of waste was 

sent for incineration in 2019, registering a 

29% increase compared to 17,932 t in 2018, 

mainly due to an increase in business 

activity at the yards.

As incineration of refuse is prohibited or 

unavailable in some countries where 

we operate, a total of 6,286 t of municipal 

waste was disposed at landfill sites

in 2019, an increase over 1,067 t in 2018. 

Incineration is banned in the Philippines, 

while waste disposal regulations in the 

state of Texas in the United States require 

plant waste to be landfilled.

GRI 305-1 | 305-2 | 305-3 l 305-4 l 305-5 | 305-7 

Emissions Intensity Targets

Keppel aims to achieve a 16% improvement 

in carbon emissions intensity from 2020 

business-as-usual levels. This is based on 

the national targets which the Singapore 

government had disclosed in 2009. 

In support of the Paris Agreement, Singapore 

announced its intended nationally determined 

contribution of reducing GHG emissions 

intensity by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030. 

In line with the government’s commitment, 

we have set a long-term target of a 28.8% 

reduction in carbon emissions intensity from 

2010 levels by 2030 for our global operations2. 

Our target was derived by adjusting the 

national target to a shorter timeframe, as 

data prior to 2010 is unavailable. 

As at end-2019, our operations in Singapore 

and overseas have achieved a 30.1% average 

reduction in carbon emissions intensity 

from our 2010 baseline and we are on 

track to achieve the 2020 target of a 16% 

improvement in carbon emissions intensity. 

Given the progress achieved with our existing 

commitments, we will be reviewing our 

targets to see if we can do even more to 

reduce emissions.

The Singapore government implemented 

a carbon tax in 2019. The carbon tax is set 

at a rate of $5 per tCO2e from 2019 to 2023. 

Singapore will review the carbon tax rate 

by 2023, with plans to increase it to between 

WASTE 

GRI 306-2 

The Group strives to minimise waste 

generation, increase opportunities for 

reusing and recycling, as well as treat and 

dispose waste responsibly where other 

options are not practicable. 

Waste is segregated at our offices, plants 

and yards to promote reuse and recycling. 

Used papers from our offices as well as 

scrap metals and damaged equipment 

recovered from our shipyards and

waste-to-energy (WTE) plants are sent for 

recycling. Hazardous waste generated is 

handled, stored and disposed in a manner 

that adheres to best practices and meets 

local regulatory requirements1. 

Waste recycled included ferrous scrap, grits, 

plastic stretch wrap, paper and other office 

consumables. In 2019, the Group recycled 

41,904 tonnes (t) of refuse, which is a 

decrease from 119,349 t of waste in 2018. 

In 2018, a reorganisation and clean-up of 

the AmFELS yard contributed towards a 

significantly higher volume of recycled 

waste generated when compared to 2019. 

Our Singapore operations recycled 32,072 t 

of waste in 2019, an increase from 19,082 t 

recycled in Singapore the previous year. 

As a Group, a total of 25,957 t of waste was 

sent for incineration in 2019, which is an 

approximately 45% increase compared to 

17,934 t in 2018.

We are working to provide data on hazardous 

waste disposal. 

2 

In calculating emissions intensity reductions, 

each business division first computes its base year

(i.e. 2010) emissions intensity using a normalising 

factor relevant to its business activity. The total 

emissions intensity reduction is the difference in 

the Group’s average emissions intensity between 

the base year and the current year in which the data 

is reported. The normalisation factors for our 

business divisions are based on their key activities 

and industry best practices. They are as follows: 

gross floor area in square metres for office and 

retail premises, million man-hours for Keppel O&amp;M 

and Keppel Logistics, refrigeration tonnes hour for 

our district heating and cooling plants; kilowatt 

hour of IT power for data centres, number of base 

stations for our mobile networks and number of 

subscribers for our fibre networks. The baseline 

year used in the intensity calculations of newly 

acquired assets is as per the earliest year that such 

data is available.

Incineration at WTE plants is an 

efficient option for land-scarce 

Singapore, which also reduces 

waste volume and removes harmful 

substances before landfill disposal. 

Incineration is also preferable to 

the direct burial of waste which 

generates significant amounts

of methane.

is applied upstream, for example, on power 

stations and other large direct emitters. 

The carbon tax would have an impact on 

the business cost, which would in turn 

impact project economics. To mitigate the 

impact of the carbon tax, the Group has 

continued to improve our energy efficiency 

and reduce our carbon footprint, particularly 

for businesses that are energy intensive.

Carbon Emissions1

In 2019, total direct (Scope 1) emissions 

from the use of fuels across the Group 

was 29,577 tCO2e, registering a 12% 

increase from 26,299 tCO2e in 2018, while 

indirect (Scope 2) emissions from electricity 

use was 200,759 tCO2, which is a 29% 

increase from 155,503 tCO2 in 2018. Direct 

emissions for Singapore operations was 

18,774 tCO2e, compared with 14,490 tCO2e 

in 2018. Indirect emissions from our 

Singapore operations was 141,430 tCO2, 

compared with 111,924 tCO2 in 2018. 

The Group’s total other indirect (Scope 3) 

emissions is 1,745,032 tCO2e in 2019, 

with 1,742,672 tCO2e from investments 

and 2,360 tCO2e from business travel.

Other Emissions &amp; Effluents 

Keppel Infrastructure continues to actively 

manage the emissions from its operations. 

Nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emitted 

from Keppel Merlimau Cogen Plant, Keppel 

Seghers Tuas WTE Plant and Senoko WTE 

Plant operated and maintained by Keppel 

Infrastructure remain far below the emission 

standards of 700 milligrams per normal 

cubic metre (mg/Nm3) and 500 mg/Nm3 

respectively, as stipulated by Singapore’s 

National Environment Agency (NEA) Code 

of Practice on Pollution Control. 

In 2019, dust or particulate matter emitted 

by Senoko WTE Plant and Keppel Seghers 

Tuas WTE Plant were 36 mg/Nm3 and 

71.45 mg/Nm3 respectively, which were well 

below the NEA emission standard of 

100 mg/Nm3. Variations in emissions are 

dependent on the type of municipal refuse 

incinerated by the plants. 

All trade effluent from our operations are 

treated and discharged to water courses 

or sewer systems in accordance with the 

environmental discharge limits and effluent 

standards in the countries of operation. 

COMPLIANCE 

GRI 306-3 | 307-1 

There were no records of spillages, 

no sanctions pertaining to spillages,

The GHG conversion factors for indirect (Scope 2) 

emissions are based on the Electricity Grid 

Emission Factors for 2018 from EMA. For other 

overseas regions, 2017 grid emission factors from 

the International Energy Agency were used. The 

GHG emission Scopes 1, 2 and 3 are as defined by 

the GHG Protocol, whereby Scope 1 refers to 

emissions from company owned and operated 

facilities, machines, vehicles, etc. The primary 

sources of energy consumed on site by our

naphtha, piped natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, 

compressed natural gas, acetylene, and refrigerants 

– R123, R134A, R22, R407C, R410A; Scope 2 refers 

to emissions from the generation of purchased 

electricity consumed by the company; Scope 3 

emissions are a consequence of the activities of 

the company, but occur from sources not owned 

or controlled by the company, including investments 

and business travel. Emissions from refrigerant 

leakage in the shipyards are excluded. We are 

working to track these emissions for 2020.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

STRATEGIC PILLAR: ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP


We are committed to minimising our 

environmental impact, focusing on enhancing 

energy efficiency, reducing carbon emissions 

in our operations, as well as reducing waste 

and water consumption intensity.

To support the climate change agenda, we 

have clearly defined the businesses that we 

will avoid, maintain and grow, considering 

their respective environmental impacts. We 

will include an internal carbon price in our 

evaluation of all major investment decisions. 

We also aim to increase the generation and 

usage of renewable energy in our operations.

In 2014, we set the goal of achieving

a 16% improvement in carbon emissions 

intensity from 2020 business-as-usual 

levels, and are well on track towards 

achieving the target. We are also 

working towards a longer term target

of a 28.8% reduction in carbon emissions 

intensity by 2030 from 2010 levels. 

As countries focus increasingly on

climate change, the demand for cleaner 

energy is growing too. Keppel's

businesses are also pivoting towards 

renewables and cleaner fossil fuels.

At Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine, for example, 

renewables and LNG-related solutions

made up over 60% of new orders secured 

in 2019.

We also contribute to cleaner

environments with waste and water 

treatment solutions, like waste-to-energy 

plants, which produce significantly less 

greenhouse gas emissions compared

to traditional direct landfilling and reduce

the volume of waste by up to 90%.

Keppel is also developing the Keppel

Marina East Desalination Plant,

Singapore's first large-scale dual-mode 

desalination plant which is scheduled

to commence operations in 2020.

Reflecting our commitment to green

urban development, Keppel Land has 

garnered a total of 84 Building and 

Construction Authority of Singapore

Green Mark Awards, of which 16 are 

Platinum. When all of Keppel Land's

Green Mark-awarded projects are fully 

completed, they will contribute to a 

reduction in carbon emissions of almost 

95,000 tonnes annually. 

In January 2020, Keppel Bay Tower became 

the first commercial development in 

Singapore to utilise renewable energy to 

power all its operations, including the offices 

of tenants in the building. The photovoltaic 

panel installation on the rooftop, together 

with the purchase of Renewable Energy 

Credits generated by PV panels at Keppel 

Offshore &amp; Marine's yards in Singapore, will 

result in a reduction of over 2,400 tonnes of 

carbon emissions per annum - an amount 

which would otherwise require about 12,000 

trees to absorb over about 50 years.

In terms of Keppel's connectivity business, 

our data centre facilities are certified with 

the Singapore Standard for Green Data 

Centres and utilise a host of energy-efficient 

solutions to improve power usage 

effectiveness. We are also pursuing 

innovative and greener solutions including 

high-rise green data centres and floating 

data centre parks. 

Keppel is committed to sustainability, both as a responsible corporate 

citizen and as a provider of solutions that help to build a more sustainable 

world. Across the Group, our businesses offer a suite of innovative 

solutions for sustainable urbanisation, to help meet the world's growing 

needs for energy, clean environments, urban developments, connectivity 

and more.

to estimates by the United Nations, urban 

areas are projected to house 68% of people 

globally by 20501. Urbanisation trends and 

a growing middle class, especially in Asia, 

continue to drive demand and provide 

opportunities for companies able to supply 

solutions to meet their needs. 

We harness the strengths of the Group 

to meet the world’s growing needs for 

sustainable urbanisation solutions. Our

The last few years have been transformative

for Keppel as we worked to build a more 

resilient and sustainable company, 

committed to delivering value and growth 

for the future. The Group’s corporate 

structure has been simplified with the 

privatisation of our operating entities, 

starting with Keppel Land, followed by 

Keppel Telecommunications &amp; 

Transportation (Keppel T&amp;T) and M1, thus 

allowing more efficient capital allocation.

We have also consolidated our asset 

management businesses under Keppel 

Capital, which serves both as a platform 

for capital recycling and tapping

third-party funds for growth. We have 

been deepening our presence in rapidly 

urbanising markets such as China and 

Vietnam, and expanding our products 

and offerings, with smart, urban projects, 

renewables, gas solutions, asset 

management and digital connectivity 

among our new growth engines.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2019

GRI 201-1

Group net profit was $707 million, 

with stronger contributions from Keppel 

Offshore &amp; Marine, Keppel Infrastructure 

and Keppel Capital. This was 25% lower as 

compared to 2018, when the Group had 

benefited from $584 million in gains through 

the en-bloc sales of development projects 

and property divestments. Group revenue 

grew 27% to $7,580 million in 2019 with 

higher recognition of ongoing offshore &amp; 

marine and infrastructure projects, 

improved sales in the power and gas 

segment, the consolidation of M1 

and higher asset management revenue.

Total cash dividend for 2019 will be 20.0 cents 

per share. This comprises a proposed final 

cash dividend of 12.0 cents per share as 

well as an interim cash dividend of 8.0 cents 

per share paid in the third quarter of 2019.

GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE &amp; 

TAXES PAID 

GRI 201-4 

In 2019, the Group received a total of 

$8.6 million in financial assistance from 

governments. Approximately 47% of 

financial assistance received was from 

the government of China for business 

development incentives, land subsidies and 

green building grants. Close to 40% relates 

to the Singapore government’s Research 

and Development grants, training grants as 

well as cash grants under its wage credit 

and employment credit schemes. The 

remaining 13% was from the governments 

of the United States and Belgium.

The Group has exposure to income taxes 

in many jurisdictions. Significant assumptions 

are required in determining the provision for 

income taxes. There are certain transactions 

and computations for which the ultimate 

tax determination is uncertain during the 

ordinary course of business. The Group 

recognises liabilities for expected tax issues 

based on estimates of whether additional 

taxes will be due.

Where the final tax outcome of these 

matters is different from the amounts that 

were initially recognised, such differences 

will impact the income tax and deferred 

tax provisions in the period in which such 

determination is made. The carrying 

amounts of taxation and deferred taxation 

are disclosed in the balance sheet in Keppel 

Corporation’s Report to Shareholders 2019.

The Group operates in more than 20 countries. 

In 2019, the Group contributed $191 million 

in taxes to the various countries and tax 

jurisdictions in which it operates.

ECONOMIC VALUE DELIVERED 

TO SOCIETY 

GRI 201-1 

Keppel’s business operations generate 

employment, opportunities for suppliers 

and tax revenues for governments. 

We are committed to positively impact 

the communities in which we operate, 

and contribute to worthy social causes 

through donations and sponsorships. 

In 2019, Keppel generated $8,208 million of 

economic value for our stakeholders, which 

was distributed through our business operations 

to suppliers, contractors, subcontractors, 

employees, investors, governments and 

community organisations, among others. 

The majority of the economic value retained 

by Keppel after this distribution is invested in 

capital expenditure and acquisitions, as we 

seek to sharpen our competitive edge and 

stand ready to seize growth opportunities.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 2019

OVERVIEW

GRI 103-1

The Board and management of Keppel 

Corporation Limited (“KCL”, “Keppel” or

the “Company”) firmly believe that a genuine

commitment to good corporate governance 

is essential to the sustainability of the 

Company’s businesses and performance, 

and are pleased to confirm that the Company 

has adhered to the principles of the Code

of Corporate Governance 2018 ("2018 CG 

Code"), with references to the accompanying

Practice Guidance. 

BOARD’S CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS

GRI 102-18 | 102-22 | 102-23 | 102-26 | 102-33 | 

103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3

Governance Framework

KCL’s governance structure is as above.

Dr Lee Boon Yang is the non-executive and 

independent Chairman of the Company. 

Mr Loh Chin Hua is the Chief Executive Officer 

(CEO) of the Company.

The Chairman, with the assistance of

the Company Secretaries, schedules 

meetings and prepares meeting agenda

to enable the Board to perform its duties 

responsibly having regard to the flow of

the Company’s operations. He sets 

guidelines on and monitors the flow of 

information from management to the

Board to ensure that all material information 

is provided in a timely manner to the Board 

for the Board to make good decisions.

He also encourages constructive relations 

between the Board and management, and 

between the executive and non-executive 

directors (NEDs). At board meetings,

the Chairman encourages a full and frank 

exchange of views, drawing out contributions 

from all directors so that the debate benefits 

from the full diversity of views, in a robust yet 

collegiate setting. At annual general meetings 

and other shareholders’ meetings, the 

Chairman ensures constructive dialogue 

between shareholders, the Board and 

management. The Chairman sets the right 

ethical and behavioural tone and takes a 

leading role in the Company’s drive to 

achieve and maintain a high standard of 

corporate governance with the full support 

of the directors, Company Secretaries 

and management.

To assist the Board in the discharge of

its oversight function, various board 

committees, namely the Audit, Board Risk, 

Nominating, Remuneration and Board 

Safety committees, have been constituted 

with clear written terms of reference. All the 

Compliance Training

&gt;16,000

Directors and employees 

received compliance e-training 

on key Group policies 

and requirements.

Independence of Directors

Out of 11 directors 

are independent.

Keppel Corporation Limited  

Sustainability Report 2019

board committees are actively engaged

and play an important role in ensuring good 

corporate governance in the Company and 

within the Group, and the Board is kept 

updated on discussions of the committees 

via circulation of minutes and regular updates 

by the respective chairmen of the committees 

at board meetings. 

The CEO, assisted by the management 

team, makes strategic proposals to the 

Board and after robust and constructive 

board discussion, executes the agreed 

strategy, manages and develops the

Group’s businesses and implements the 

Board’s decisions. He is supported by 

management committees that direct and 

guide management on operational policies 

and activities, which include: 

1. Investments &amp; Major Projects Action 

Committee (IMPAC), which guides the 

Group to exercise the spirit of enterprise 

as well as prudence to earn optimal 

risk-adjusted returns on invested

capital for its chosen lines of business, 

taking into consideration the relevant 

risks, in a controlled manner; 

2. Management Development Committee 

(MDC), which nominates candidates

as nominee directors to the boards

of each unlisted company or entity

that the Company is invested in 

(“Investee Company”) so as to safeguard 

the Company’s investment. In respect of 

Investee Companies that are (a) listed 

on a stock exchange, (b) managers or 

trustee-managers of any collective 

investment schemes, business trusts

or any other trusts which are listed on a 

stock exchange, or (c) parent companies 

of the Company’s core businesses, the

Committee recommends the candidates 

for the approval of the Nominating 

Committee (NC). The MDC also provides 

inputs, guidance and direction on 

operational policies and human 

resources/organisational matters;

3. Central Finance Committee, which reviews, 

guides and monitors financial policies 

and activities of Group companies; 

4. Group Regulatory Compliance Management 

Committee (Group RCMC), which articulates 

the Group’s commitment to regulatory 

compliance, directs and supports the 

development of over-arching compliance 

policies and guidelines, and facilitates 

the implementation and sharing of 

policies and procedures across the Group; 

5. Group Regulatory Compliance Working 

Team (Group RCWT), which supports 

the Group RCMC and oversees the 

development and review of over-arching 

compliance policies and guidelines for 

the Group, as well as review training and 

communication programmes;

6. Keppel IT Steering Committee, which 

provides strategic information 

technology (IT) leadership and ensures 

IT strategy alignment in achieving 

business strategies;

7. Group Sustainability Steering Committee, 

which sets the sustainability strategy and 

leads performance in key focus areas; and

8.  Technology and Data Risk Committee, 

which operationalises the Technology 

and Data Risk Management operating 

standards programme that enhances 

the Group’s safeguards, resilience and 

responses to cyber threats.

Board Strategic Review

The Board periodically reviews and approves 

the Group’s strategic plans. A two-day 

off-site board strategy meeting is organised 

annually for in-depth discussion on strategic 

issues and the direction of the Group, to 

give the non-executive directors a better 

understanding of the Group and its businesses, 

and to provide an opportunity for the 

non-executive directors to familiarise 

themselves with the management team

so as to facilitate the Board’s review of the 

Group’s succession planning and leadership 

development programme. In FY 2019,

the focus of the strategy meeting was to 

track the progress towards the Group’s 

Vision 2020 targets and to discuss the 

strategic direction towards Vision 2030,

with a view to grow Keppel as one integrated 

business providing solutions for sustainable 

urbanisation. To support the Board’s 

oversight of the implementation of the 

strategic plans, one business unit is

invited to each quarterly Board meeting

to present its plans and current challenges, 

and provide the Board an opportunity to 

perform an in-depth review into each of

the Group’s core businesses.

AN EFFECTIVE BOARD

GRI 102-25 | 102-27 | 102-28

The Board and management fully appreciate 

that fundamental to good corporate governance 

is an effective and robust Board whose 

members engage in open and constructive 

debate and challenge management on its 

assumptions and proposals. 

Independence of Directors

The NC determines on an annual basis 

whether or not a director is independent.

In January 2020, the NC carried out reviews 

on the independence of each director based 

on the respective directors’ self-declaration 

in the Directors’ Independence Checklist and 

their actual performance on the Board and 

board committees, taking into account the 

listing rules on the circumstances in which

a director will not be deemed independent

and guidance in the 2018 CG Code as

to the circumstances in which a director 

should not be deemed independent.

The assessment of the independence

the directors are set out on page 80

of our Report to Shareholders 2019.

Except for the Board Safety Committee,

all board committees comprise entirely 

independent directors.

Independent Judgment

All directors are expected to exercise 

independent judgment in the best

interests of the Company. This is one of

the performance criteria for the peer and 

self-assessment of the individual directors. 

Based on the results of the peer and 

self-assessment carried out by the directors 

for FY 2019, all directors have discharged 

this duty well. Mr Teo Siong Seng, 

Mr Tham Sai Choy and Mrs Penny Goh 

were not part of this assessment as they 

were only recently appointed.

Conflicts of Interest

Each director must promptly disclose 

conflicts of interest, whether direct or 

indirect, in relation to any transaction or 

proposed transaction. In this connection, 

the Company has in place a “Keppel Group 

– Directors’ Conflict of Interest Policy” to 

guide directors in identifying, disclosing and 

managing situations of actual or potential 

conflicts, as well as situations which may 

be perceived to be conflicts of interest. 

Every director is required to promptly 

disclose any conflict of interest, whether 

direct or indirect, in relation to a transaction 

or proposed transaction with the Company 

as soon as is practicable after the relevant 

facts have come to his/her knowledge, 

and recuse himself/herself when the 

conflict-related matter is discussed unless 

the Board is of the opinion that his/her 

presence and participation is necessary 

to enhance the efficacy of such discussions, 

and abstain from voting in relation to 

conflict-related matters. On an annual basis, 

each director is also required to submit 

details of his/her associates for the purpose 

of monitoring interested persons transactions.

Board Competency &amp; Diversity

The Company recognises that diversity 

in relation to composition of the Board 

provides a range of perspectives, insights 

and challenges needed to support good 

decision-making for the benefit of the Group, 

and is committed to ensuring that the Board 

comprises directors who, as a group, provide 

an appropriate balance and mix of skills, 

knowledge, experience and other aspects 

of diversity (such as gender and age) so 

as to promote the inclusion of different 

perspectives and ideas, mitigate against 

groupthink and ensure that the Company 

has the opportunity to benefit from all 

available talent. In identifying suitable 

candidates for new appointments to the 

Board, the NC would ensure that female 

candidates are included for consideration. 

The final decision on the appointment 

of directors would be based on and driven 

by merit against the objective criteria set 

by the Board from time to time on the 

recommendation of the NC, after having 

regards to the benefits of diversity and 

the needs of the Board.

The Company has in place a Board Diversity 

Policy that sets out the framework and 

approach for the Board to set its qualitative 

and measurable quantitative objectives for 

achieving diversity, and to annually assess 

the progress in achieving these objectives. 

The annual assessment is led by the NC as 

part of the process for appointment of new 

directors and Board succession planning. 

To help the NC identify gaps (if any) in skills, 

knowledge, experience and other aspects 

of diversity in the board composition in any 

given year of assessment, each member 

of the Board is required to complete a 

Board Diversity Matrix to indicate which 

of the list of skills, knowledge, experience 

and other aspects of diversity (identified by 

the NC, and set out in the Board Diversity 

Matrix, as being able to contribute to the 

Company’s strategy and business) the board

member possesses. The returns from the 

board members are then consolidated into 

a single Board Diversity Matrix to highlight 

the Board’s current mix of skills, knowledge, 

experience and other aspects of diversity 

and gaps therein, if any.

OBJECTIVES FOR FY 2019

Objectives

Progress

Appoint at least two additional independent 

directors with some of the core competencies 

already present on the Board by end-FY 2020 

for succession planning purposes.

Mr Tham Sai Choy was appointed as a non-executive and independent director with effect from 

1 November 2019. Mr Tham was Managing Partner of KPMG Singapore and then Chairman of 

KPMG Asia Pacific before he retired in 2017. He was a member of KPMG’s global board, and 

had served on its executive committee and risk committee, and chaired its compensation and 

nominations committee. As a member of the executive committee, Mr Tham was responsible for 

KPMG’s global strategies and planning, including developing the firm’s capabilities in cyber security, 

data analytics and digital transformation. Mr Tham also worked with many of Singapore’s listed 

companies in their audits and other consultancy work over his 36 years of practice. He was 

appointed as a board member with a view of being the successor to Mr Danny Teoh in the roles 

of Audit Committee Chairman and Board Risk Committee member.

Mrs Penny Goh was appointed as a non-executive and independent director with effect 

from 2 January 2020. Mrs Goh was Co-Chairman and Senior Partner of Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP, 

where she had, for many years, headed the firm’s corporate real estate practice. She advises listed 

corporations, private equity property funds, sovereign wealth funds and real estate investment 

trusts, and has extensive experience in a broad range of corporate real estate transactions for 

commercial, industrial and logistics projects in Singapore and the Asia Pacific, involving investment, 

joint development and profit participation structures. Mrs Goh was appointed with a view to 

succeeding Mr Alvin Yeo as a board member with legal expertise and to enhance the gender 

diversity of the Board.

Broaden the skillset of directors on the Board 

by appointing at least one director with the 

relevant expertise and experience that would 

complement those already on the Board and 

which would help drive the Group’s strategy. 

Mr Teo Siong Seng was appointed as a non-executive and independent director with effect 

from 1 November 2019. His strong background, knowledge and experience in the China market; 

experience in growing businesses in frontier countries such as East and West Africa, and his 

knowledge and experience from serving as Chairman of the Singapore Business Federation, 

Honorary President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry and as director of 

Business China, would enhance the balance and breadth of skills of the Board, and help drive the 

Group’s strategy.

Improve gender diversity over a three-year period 

by ensuring that at least 20% of the Board will 

comprise female directors by end-FY 2021.

With the recent appointment of Mrs Penny Goh, together with Ms Veronica Eng, the female 

representation on the Board is currently 18%. This objective will be met with the appointment of an 

additional female director by end-FY 2021.

The Board will, taking into consideration 

the recommendations of the NC, review 

and agree annually on the qualitative and 

measurable quantitative objectives for 

achieving diversity on the Board. The 

objectives identified in FY 2019, and the 

progress towards achieving such 

objectives, are set out below:

The NC conducted an assessment in January 

2020 and is satisfied that the Board and the 

board committees comprise directors who 

as a group provide an appropriate balance 

and mix of skills, knowledge, experience, and 

other aspects of diversity. The NC is also 

satisfied that the directors, as a group, possess 

core competencies including accounting or 

finance, business or management experience, 

human resource, risk management, technology, 

mergers and acquisitions, legal, international 

perspective, industry knowledge, strategic 

planning experience and customer-based 

experience or knowledge, required for the 

Board and the board committees to be 

effective, taking into account the Company’s 

strategy and business.

Keppel Corporation Limited  

Sustainability Report 2019

Board Information 

To effectively engage the management, 

the Board must be kept well informed of 

the Company’s businesses and affairs, and be 

knowledgeable about the industries in which 

the businesses operate. The Company has 

therefore adopted initiatives to put in place 

processes to ensure that the non-executive 

directors are well supported by accurate, 

complete and timely information, have 

unrestricted access to management, and 

have sufficient time and resources to 

discharge their oversight function 

effectively. Subject to the approval of 

the Chairman, the directors, whether as 

a group or individually, may seek and obtain 

independent professional advice to assist 

them in their duties, at the expense of 

the Company.

As a general rule, board papers are required 

to be distributed to the directors at least 

seven days before the board meeting so 

that the members may better understand 

the matters prior to the board meeting and 

discussions may be focused on questions 

that the directors may have. Directors are 

provided with tablet devices to facilitate 

their access to and review of board materials. 

However, sensitive matters may be tabled at 

the meeting itself and discussed. Managers 

who can provide additional insights into the 

matters at hand would be present at the 

relevant time during the board meeting. The 

directors are also provided with the names 

and contact details of the Company’s senior 

management and the Company Secretaries 

to facilitate direct access to senior 

management and the Company Secretaries. 

Regular informal meetings are conducted 

for management to brief the directors on 

prospective deals and potential developments

at an early stage before formal board approval 

is sought, and relevant information on business 

initiatives, industry developments and analyst 

and press commentaries on matters in relation 

to the Company or the industries in which it

operates is circulated to the directors from 

time to time. Management is also expected 

to provide the Board with accurate information 

in a timely manner concerning the Company’s 

progress or shortcomings in meeting its 

strategic business objectives or financial 

targets and other information relevant

to the strategic issues facing the Company.

The Board also reviews the budget on an 

annual basis, and any material variance 

between the projections and actual results 

would be disclosed and explained. Management 

also provides the Board members with 

management accounts monthly and as 

the Board may require from time to time, 

to keep the Board informed, on a balanced 

and understandable basis, of the Group’s 

performance, financial position and prospects.

Training 

Directors are provided with continuing 

education in areas such as directors’ duties 

and responsibilities, corporate governance, 

changes in financial reporting standards, 

changes in the Companies Act, continuing 

listing obligations and industry-related 

matters, so as to update and refresh them 

on matters that may affect or enhance 

their performance as board or board 

committee members. A training 

programme is also in place for directors 

in areas such as accounting, finance, 

corporate social responsibility, risk 

governance and management, the roles 

and responsibilities of a director of a listed 

company and industry-specific matters. 

In FY 2019, some KCL directors attended 

talks on topics relating to the digital economy, 

cyber security governance and macroeconomic 

trends. E-training was also conducted on 

the Group’s policies on anti-corruption, 

anti-money laundering, personal data 

protection, competition law, and cyber security. 

Site visits are also conducted periodically 

for directors to familiarise themselves with

the operations of the various businesses so

as to enhance their performance as board

or board committee members. All induction,

training and development costs are at 

the Company’s expense.

Board Evaluation

The Board has implemented formal 

processes for assessing the effectiveness 

of the Board as a whole, each of its 

board committees, the contribution

by the Chairman, as well as peer and 

self-assessment of the individual director

to the effectiveness of the Board.

To ensure that assessments are done 

promptly and fairly, the Board has appointed 

an independent third party (the “Independent 

Co-ordinator”) to assist in collating and 

analysing the returns of the board members. 

Mr Michael Lim, former Chairman of 

PricewaterhouseCoopers and Land Transport 

Authority, and currently Chairman of Nomura 

Singapore Limited, was appointed for this 

role. Mr Michael Lim does not have business 

relationships or any other connections with 

the Company or its directors which may 

affect his independent judgment.

BOARD COMPOSITION &amp; 

SUCCESSION PLANNING 

GRI 102-24

The Board believes that orderly succession 

and renewal are achieved as a result of 

careful planning, where the appropriate 

composition of the Board is continually 

under review. In this regard, the Board 

has put in place a formal process for 

the renewal of the Board and the selection 

of new directors so that the experience 

of longer serving directors can be 

drawn upon while tapping into the new 

external perspectives and insights 

which more recent appointees bring

to the Board’s deliberation.

The NC leads the process and 

makes recommendations to the 

Board as follows:

a. NC reviews annually the balance and 

mix of skills, knowledge, experience 

and other aspects of diversity such 

as gender and age, and the size of 

the Board which would facilitate 

decision-making. In this review, the NC 

would also take into account the needs 

of the Group, the collective skills and 

competencies of the Board and service 

tenure spread of the directors.

b. In the light of such reviews and in 

consultation with management, the NC 

assesses if there is any inadequate 

representation in respect of any of 

those attributes and if so, determines 

the role and the desirable competencies 

for a particular appointment. 

c. The NC will, in all cases, take into 

consideration the following objective 

criteria identified as necessary for 

the Board and board committees to 

be effective:

i. 

Integrity

ii. 

Independent mindedness

iii. Able to commit time and

effort to carry out duties 

and responsibilities effectively 

iv. Track record of making 

good decisions

v. 

Experience in 

high-performing companies

vi. Financial literacy

d. External help (for example, 

Singapore Institute of Directors

and search consultants) may

be used to source for potential

candidates if need be. Directors

and management may

also make recommendations. 

e. NC meets with the short-listed 

candidate(s) to assess suitability 

and to ensure that the candidate(s) 

is/are aware of the expectations and 

the level of commitment required.

f. 

NC makes recommendations to the 

Board for approval.

Re-nomination of Directors

The NC is also charged with the

responsibility of re-nomination having

regard to the director’s contribution and

performance (such as attendance, 

42      

Sustainability Report 2019  

Keppel Corporation Limited

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT

STRATEGIC PILLAR: RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS


preparedness, participation and candour), 

with reference to the results of the

assessment of the performance of 

the individual director by his/her peers.

The directors submit themselves for 

re-nomination and re-election at regular 

intervals of at least once every three years. 

Pursuant to the Company’s constitution, 

one-third of the directors retire from office 

at the Company’s annual general meeting, 

and a newly appointed director must submit 

him/herself for re-election at the annual 

general meeting immediately following

his/her appointment. 

REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK

GRI 102-35 | 102-36

The Remuneration Committee (RC) is 

responsible for ensuring a formal and 

transparent procedure for developing policy 

on executive remuneration and for determining 

the remuneration packages of individual 

directors and senior management. The RC 

assists the Board to ensure that remuneration 

policies and practices are sound in that they 

are able to attract, retain and motivate 

without being excessive, thereby maximising 

shareholder value. The remuneration 

framework is set out from pages 82 to 87

of our Report to Shareholders 2019.

The RC has access to expert advice from 

external remuneration consultants where 

required. In FY 2019, the RC sought views 

from external remuneration consultants, 

Aon Hewitt, on market practice and trends, 

and benchmarks against comparable 

organisations. The RC undertook a review 

of the independence and objectivity of the 

external remuneration consultants through 

discussions with the external remuneration 

consultants, and has confirmed that the external 

remuneration consultants had no relationships 

with the Company which would affect their 

independence and objectivity.

RISK MANAGEMENT &amp; 

INTERNAL CONTROLS

GRI 102-11 | 102-17 | 102-33 | 205-2

The Board, supported by the Audit Committee 

(“AC”) and Board Risk Committee (“BRC”), 

oversees the Group’s system of internal 

control and risk management.

The AC’s primary role is to assist the

Board with ensuring the integrity of

financial reporting and the adequacy and 

effectiveness of the system of internal 

controls and risk management. The AC 

has explicit authority to investigate any 

matter within its responsibilities, full access 

to and co-operation by management and 

full discretion to invite any director or 

executive officer to attend its meetings, 

and reasonable resources (including 

access to external consultants) to enable 

it to discharge its responsibilities properly. 

The BRC considers the nature and extent 

of the significant risks which the Company 

may take in achieving its strategic objectives 

and value creation; and reviews and guides 

management in the formulation of risk 

policies and processes to effectively 

identify, evaluate and manage significant 

risks to safeguard shareholders’ interests 

and the Group’s assets, and ensure 

corporate sustainability.

Keppel’s System of 

Management Controls Framework

The Group also has in place Keppel's 

System of Management Controls 

Framework (the "Framework") outlining 

the Group's internal controls and risk 

management processes and procedures. 

The Framework comprises three Lines of 

Defence towards ensuring the adequacy 

and effectiveness of the Group's system 

of internal controls and risk management. 

Under the first Line of Defence, management 

is required to ensure good corporate 

governance through the implementation

and management of policies and procedures 

relevant to the Group’s business scope and 

environment. Such policies and procedures 

govern financial, operational, IT and regulatory 

compliance matters and are reviewed and 

updated periodically. Compliance governance 

is governed by the respective regulatory 

compliance management committees 

and working teams. Employees are also 

guided by the Group’s core values and 

expected to comply strictly with Keppel’s 

Code of Conduct.

Under the second Line of Defence, 

significant business units are required 

to conduct a self-assessment exercise 

on an annual basis. This exercise requires 

such business units to assess the status 

of their respective internal controls

and risk management processes via 

self-assessment. Where required, action 

plans are developed to remedy identified 

control gaps. As described under the 

Group’s Enterprise Risk Management 

Framework, significant risk areas of 

the Group are also identified and assessed, 

with systems, policies and processes

put in place to manage and mitigate the 

identified risks beyond internal thresholds 

of appetite. It includes the reporting and 

oversight structure involving both boards 

and management of the Group and 

business divisions and seeks to embed 

sound risk management practices in 

business decisions and operations across 

Group entities. Regulatory Compliance 

supports and works alongside management 

to ensure that relevant policies, processes 

and controls are effectively designed, 

managed and implemented.

Under the third Line of Defence, to assist 

the Group to ascertain the adequacy 

and effectiveness of the Group’s internal 

controls, business units’ CEOs and Chief 

Financial Officers (CFOs) are required to 

provide the Group with written assurances 

as to the adequacy and effectiveness

of their system of internal controls and

risk management. Such assurances are

also sought from the Group’s internal 

and external auditors based on their 

independent assessments.

Enhancements to Compliance Programme 

in FY 2019

As our Code of Conduct states, “we care 

how results are achieved, not just that they 

are attained.” Implementing that core value 

by enhancing our regulatory compliance 

process and reminding every Keppelite of 

that value is a focus of attention for us, our 

boards, officers and line managers globally. 

Read more about the Group’s enhanced 

compliance programme on pages 90 to 91 

of our Report to Shareholders 2019.

Communication &amp; Training

The Group continuously ensures that its 

compliance policies and procedures are 

communicated effectively to all employees 

and directors. In 2019, an e-training and 

assessment exercise covering key policies, 

including Keppel’s Enhanced Code of Conduct, 

Conflict of Interest, Whistle-Blowing, Gifts 

and Hospitality, Donation and Sponsorship 

and Solicitation and Extortion, was carried out. 

16,544 directors and employees have 

completed the e-training and toolbox training. 

Targeted training focused on line managers’ 

responsibilities and employees’ obligations, 

under the re-branded K’ompass programme, 

was conducted in FY 2019. The K’ompass 

training aims to educate and entrench correct 

mindset, behaviours, and culture towards 

fostering risk awareness, ethical behaviour 

at work, importance of controls and focus on 

safety. Conflict of Interest trainings targeted 

at those with procurement, commercial, 

business development functions, were 

also conducted to heighten awareness 

of conflict situations and to train on 

declaration requirements.

Reporting &amp; Investigation

Keppel Whistle-Blower Policy took effect

on 1 September 2004 and was enhanced

on 15 February 2017 to encourage reporting 

in good faith of suspected reportable conduct 

by establishing clearly defined and centralised 

processes through which such reports may 

be made with confidence that employees 

and other persons making such reports will 

be treated fairly and, to the extent possible, 

protected from reprisal. Read more about 

our Risk Management &amp; Internal Controls 

framework on pages 106 to 112 of our 

Report to Shareholders 2019.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

GRI 102-15

We are guided by our core values and 

code of conduct. We will do business the 

right way and comply with all applicable 

laws and regulations wherever we operate. 

We strive to deliver outstanding 

performance, whilst maintaining the 

highest ethical standards. 

We are clear with our tone for regulatory 

compliance, which is consistently 

emphasised from the top and throughout 

all levels of the Group. We have zero 

tolerance for fraud, bribery, corruption 

and violation of laws and regulations. 

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

We have made significant progress 

in embedding a robust compliance 

framework and processes throughout 

the Group. With Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine 

having obtained ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery 

Management Systems certification for 

all units globally in 2019, we are 

progressively implementing the same 

standard throughout the Group. This will 

ensure consistency in application and 

operational effectiveness of the 

compliance programme.

We have a compliance framework 

that is commensurate with the size, role 

and activity of each business unit (BU), 

including appropriate compliance control 

systems, to be able to effectively detect 

and remedy gaps. We remain focused on 

rebuilding our credibility and reputation 

with our stakeholders and building a 

sustainable compliance framework that 

supports the Group’s growth.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

Our Regulatory Compliance Governance 

Structure is designed to strengthen 

our corporate governance. The Board 

Risk Committee (BRC) supports the

Board in its oversight of regulatory 

compliance and is responsible for 

driving the Group’s implementation of 

compliance and governance systems. 

Group Risk &amp; Compliance serves as a 

secretariat to the BRC, assessing and 

reporting on compliance risks, controls 

and mitigations.

The Group Regulatory Compliance 

Management Committee (Group RCMC) 

is chaired by Keppel Corporation’s Chief 

Executive Officer and its members include 

all BU heads. The role of the Group RCMC 

is to articulate the Group’s commitment 

to regulatory compliance, direct and 

support the development of over-arching 

compliance policies and guidelines and 

facilitate the effective implementation of 

policies and procedures.

The Group RCMC is supported by the

Group Regulatory Compliance Working 

Team (Group RCWT), which is chaired by 

the Head of Group Risk &amp; Compliance.

The Group RCWT oversees the development

and review of pertinent regulatory 

compliance matters, over-arching 

compliance policies and guidelines for the 

Group, as well as reviews training and 

communication programmes.

Each BU has a dedicated Compliance Lead. 

He/she is supported by the respective risk 

and compliance teams and is responsible 

for driving and administering the compliance 

function and agenda for the BU. This includes 

providing support to BU management with 

subject matter expertise, process excellence 

and regular reporting to ensure that 

compliance risks are effectively managed 

and mitigated. We continue to strengthen 

the Group’s Compliance teams with 

additional professional and 

experienced officers.

Under the direction of Group RCMC and 

Group RCWT, BUs are responsible for 

implementing the Group’s Code of Conduct 

and regulatory compliance policies and 

procedures. They are also responsible for 

ensuring that risk assessments of material 

regulatory compliance risks are conducted, 

and that control measures are adequate 

and effective.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 

FRAMEWORK

Our regulatory compliance framework focuses 

on critical pillars covering the areas of culture; 

policies and procedures; training and 

communication; key compliance processes; 

compliance risk assessment, reviews and 

monitoring; and compliance resources.

A key aspect of the framework is the 

structure of the compliance organisation. 

The Head of Group Risk &amp; Compliance 

reports directly to the Chairman of the BRC. 

Similarly, the Compliance Leads of the BUs 

have direct reporting lines to the respective 

BU Audit Committee or BRCs. Furthermore, 

BU Compliance Leads report directly to the 

Head of Group Risk &amp; Compliance. This 

reporting structure reinforces independence 

of the function and enables senior 

management, including members of the 

Board, to provide continuous, clear and 

explicit support, and credence to the Group’s 

compliance programme.

CULTURE

Culture and mindset are critical in

ensuring effectiveness and durability of 

our compliance programme. Management 

has a key role in setting the right tone and 

walking the talk. This helps to embed a 

strong and robust regulatory compliance 

programme and culture that permeates 

all levels.

Keppel Corporation Limited

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT

STRATEGIC PILLAR: RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS


Posters on anti-bribery, anti-corruption and 

reporting mechanisms are exhibited in our 

offices globally and we issue Group-wide 

bulletins on relevant topical issues to 

apprise, inform and reinforce compliance 

principles and messages. Key messages 

are also delivered periodically by BU 

heads to employees. We continue to

roll out initiatives to foster a positive 

compliance-centric culture.

POLICIES &amp; PROCEDURES

GRI 102-16 | 102-17

Employee Code of Conduct

We have a strict Code of Conduct (Code) 

that applies to all employees, and who 

are required to acknowledge and comply 

with the Code. The Code sets out important 

principles to guide employees in carrying 

out their duties and responsibilities to the 

highest standards of business integrity. 

It covers areas from conduct in the 

workplace to business conduct, including 

clear provisions on prohibitions against 

bribery and corruption, and conflicts of 

interest amongst others.

We continue to review and enhance our 

Code to ensure that it stays updated and 

properly instructive. Appropriate disciplinary 

action, including suspension or termination 

of employment, is taken if an employee is 

found to have violated the Code.

We have procedures to ensure that 

disciplinary actions are carried out 

consistently and fairly across all levels 

of employees. All third parties who 

represent Keppel in business dealings, 

including joint venture partners, are also 

required to comply with and follow the 

requirements of the Code. 

Supplier Code of Conduct

The acknowledgement to abide by our 

Supplier Code of Conduct is mandatory 

for all key suppliers across the Group. 

The areas covered within the Supplier Code 

of Conduct include proper business conduct, 

human rights, fair labour practices, stringent 

safety and health standards, and responsible 

environmental management.

Whistle-Blower Policy

Keppel’s Whistle-Blower Policy encourages 

the reporting of suspected bribery, violations 

or misconduct through a clearly-defined 

process and reporting channel, by which 

reports can be made in confidence and 

without fear of reprisal. The whistle-blower 

reporting channels are widely communicated 

and made accessible to all.

Personal Data Privacy Act

Guidance is provided to employees on the 

Personal Data Protection Commission’s 

advisory guidelines to ensure that the 

Group complies with the requirements 

of the Personal Data Privacy Act.

Compliance Policies

We maintain a comprehensive list of 

policies covering compliance-related 

matters including anti-bribery, gifts and 

hospitality, agent fees, donations and 

sponsorships, solicitation and extortion, 

conflict of interest and insider trading, 

amongst others. These policies are 

reviewed periodically to ensure that they 

are commensurate with the activities in 

the jurisdictions in which the Group 

operates. Group policies are applicable to 

all BUs and unless the jurisdictional regulatory 

requirements are more stringent, these 

policies represent the minimum standards 

for the Group. Concerted efforts were taken 

to ensure all compliance policies, including 

translated versions, are made available and 

accessible to employees.

TRAINING &amp; COMMUNICATION

GRI 205-2

Training is an essential component of 

Keppel’s regulatory compliance framework. 

Our programmes are tailored to specific 

audiences and we leverage Group-wide 

forums to reiterate key messages.

We have a comprehensive annual e-learning 

training programme which is mandatory 

for directors, officers and employees. The 

content of the training covers the Code and 

key principles underlying our compliance 

policies. Directors, officers and employees 

are required to complete assessments 

to successfully mark completion of the 

training. In addition, directors, officers and 

employees are also required to formally 

acknowledge their understanding of policies 

and declare any potential or actual conflicts 

of interest. Trainings on anti-bribery and the 

Code in multi-languages are also carried out 

for industrial/general workers.

We continue to refine our compliance 

training programmes and curriculum. 

We are also focused on developing and 

tailoring training content to varying target 

groups and training needs. 

In addition to policy-related training 

programmes, we conduct trainings 

focused on the line manager’s 

responsibilities in developing the desired 

culture and mindset regarding compliance. 

These responsibilities include the need 

to establish and maintain effective internal 

controls to ensure that processes are 

robust, and that potential gaps are identified 

and mitigated in a timely manner.

Our training aims to engender positive 

compliance mindsets and culture, and we 

see this guiding our employees in critical 

facets of their work. Training focused on 

building risk and compliance competencies 

are also organised to ensure that we are 

apprised on changes in approaches, best 

practices and tools.

Group Risk &amp; Compliance conducts 

periodic site visits, particularly to locations 

susceptible to higher corruption risks, to 

raise awareness of compliance risks. 

We also leverage opportunities at various 

management conferences and employee 

meetings to stress the importance 

of compliance.

KEY PROCESSES 

Due Diligence

We continue to improve our risk-based 

due diligence process for all third-party 

associates who represent the Group in 

business dealings, including our joint 

venture partners, to assess the compliance 

risk of the business partner. In addition to 

background checks, the due diligence 

process incorporates requirements for 

third-party associates to acknowledge 

understanding and compliance with 

the Code.

Other Processes

As part of our ongoing review of

policies and procedures, we ensure 

compliance oversight is embedded in

key processes including areas such as

gifts and hospitality, agent fees, donations 

and sponsorships, as well as conflicts 

of interest.

RISK ASSESSMENT, REVIEW &amp; 

MONITORING

GRI 102-30 

We continue to develop our compliance 

resources and framework. This will 

enable the Compliance team to conduct 

independent risk assessments to identify 

and mitigate key compliance risks. 

Regular discussions are held with all BUs, 

focusing on risk assessments including 

specific compliance risks identified for each 

BU. Separately, independent reviews of 

compliance risks are executed within the 

scope of internal audits including thematic 

reviews of the effectiveness of key aspects 

of our compliance programmes. These 

reviews provide valuable insights and 

opportunities for us to improve our 

processes and programmes. 

RESOURCES 

We recognise the need for an experienced 

compliance team to effectively support the 

business in compliance advisory, as well as 

to ensure that compliance programmes 

and controls are effectively implemented. 

Senior management and members of the 

Board are fully committed to ensuring that 

we sustain a strong compliance function.

Ownership &amp; 

Accountability

We advocate ownership 

and accountability 

of risks across all 

employees via the 

performance evaluation 

process. Surveys are 

regularly conducted 

across the Group to 

assess staff ownership 

and accountability 

towards a strong risk, 

compliance and control 

culture. The survey results 

have been encouraging, 

indicating a strong 

risk and control culture 

across the Group.

Process &amp; Methods

Risk management 

methodologies are applied 

alongside requisite domain 

knowledge and capabilities. 

An integral aspect of 

strategic and operational 

decision-making includes 

considering and managing 

risks at all levels of business. 

One part of the process 

is the identification and 

assessment of risks 

deploying the five-step 

method: (1) identifying; 

(2) assessing; (3) mitigating; 

(4) communicating; and 

(5) monitoring risks. 

Underlying the five-step method 

is a detailed risk definition 

and reporting framework 

and for risk oversight at 

senior management and 

Board levels.

Leadership &amp; Governance

Our management is fully committed 

to fostering a strong risk-centric 

culture and consistently supports the 

review and management of risks in 

all areas of business. Key messages 

encouraging prudent risk-taking 

in decision-making and business 

processes are interwoven into major 

meetings, speeches and publications. 

Transparency &amp; Competency

We promote transparency in 

information sharing and escalation 

of risk-related matters, incidents, 

near-misses or events of interest. 

Risk identification and assessment 

are embedded in key control 

processes. Group-wide surveys are 

conducted periodically to assess 

risk awareness amongst employees.

WE UNDERTAKE ONLY

ENTERPRISE RISK 

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

GRI 102-15 | 102-29 | 102-30 |102-31 |102-32 

Keppel’s Board is responsible for risk 

governance and ensures that management 

maintains a sound system of risk 

management and internal controls.

Through the Board Risk Committee (BRC), 

the Board advises management in 

formulating and implementing the risk 

management framework, policies and 

guidelines. Significant risk issues are 

surfaced for discussion with the BRC 

and the Board to keep them apprised in 

a timely manner.

The terms of reference for the BRC are 

disclosed on pages 95 and 96 of this report. 

The Board has defined three risk tolerance 

guiding principles for the Group which 

determines the nature and extent of the 

significant risks which the Board is willing 

to take in achieving strategic objectives.

These principles are:

1. Risk taken should be carefully evaluated, 

and commensurate with rewards and in 

line with the Group’s core strengths and 

strategic objectives;

2. No risk arising from a single area of 

operation, investment or undertaking 

should be so huge as to endanger the 

entire Group; and

3. The Group does not condone safety 

breaches or lapses, non-compliance 

with laws and regulations, as well as 

acts such as fraud, bribery 

and corruption.

RISK MANAGEMENT

GRI 102-11 | 102-15 | 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3

Keppel adopts a balanced approach to risk 

management, undertaking only appropriate 

and well-considered risks to optimise 

business returns while considering their 

holistic impact on corporate sustainability. 

This approach stems from the philosophy 

of seeking sustainable growth opportunities 

and creating economic value by ensuring 

only appropriate and well-considered risks 

are assumed.

Risk management is an integral part of 

the way in which we develop and execute 

our business strategies. It is grounded in 

our operating principles and belief that a 

balanced and holistic risk-reward approach 

is key to corporate sustainability, particularly 

our commitment to key material issues 

relating to environmental, social and 

governance, and to delivering long-term 

value for our stakeholders.

Our Risk-Centric Culture and Enterprise 

Risk Management (ERM) Framework 

enables the Group to continue to respond 

effectively to the dynamic business 

environment and shifting business demands 

to seize new value-added opportunities 

for stakeholders. As a Group, we prudently 

seek new opportunities, innovation and 

revenue streams to safeguard shareholders’ 

interests and the Group’s assets.

RISK-CENTRIC CULTURE

Mindsets and attitudes are key to effective 

risk management. The Group fosters a 

risk-centric culture through several aspects. 

Risk-Centric Culture

Framework &amp; Values

The Group’s management and staff 

are guided by our ERM framework; 

our core values of accountability, 

people-focus and safety, as well as 

our mission and vision, in all 

daily activities.

Training &amp; Communications

Training and communications are 

conducted regularly to enhance 

competency through various forums, 

in-house publications and sharing of 

lessons learnt. Risk management is 

regularly reinforced as a discipline 

and developed through awareness 

and practice.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT

STRATEGIC PILLAR: RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS


Our ERM framework is constantly refined to 

ensure it remains relevant in our operating 

environment and where required, is tailored to 

the requirements of each BU. The framework 

takes reference from the Singapore Code of 

Corporate Governance, the COSO Enterprise 

Risk Management – Integrated Framework, 

ISO 22313, ISO 31000 and the Guidebook 

for Board Risk Committees.

Our Risk and Compliance Committee, 

comprising risk leads across BUs, drives 

and coordinates Group-wide activities and 

initiatives. The Committee’s activities are 

facilitated by regular bilateral and BU-level 

meetings to ensure that pertinent risks are 

identified, assessed and mitigated in a 

timely manner.

We keep abreast of the latest developments 

and best practices through participation in 

industry seminars and interacting with peers 

and other subject-matter experts.

The table on pages 48 to 49 outlines what 

we have broadly identified as key risks 

for 2019. The period chosen follows our 

financial reporting year, and while we 

recognise that not all identified risks can 

be eliminated, we remain committed to 

addressing every risk as they arise 

Keppel’s risk governance framework, 

set out on pages 88 to 92 of our Report 

to Shareholders 2019 under Principle 9 

(Risk Management and Internal Controls), 

facilitates management and the BRC in 

determining the adequacy and effectiveness 

of the Group’s risk management system.

As a Group, we are cognisant of the dynamic 

environment in which we operate. We 

constantly enhance the framework and 

systems where necessary, to ensure risk 

management remains an integral part of 

decision-making and operations.

Keppel’s ERM framework, a component of 

Keppel’s System of Management Controls, 

provides the Group with a systematic 

approach to identifying, measuring and 

monitoring risks. It outlines the requirement 

for each business unit (BU) to recognise 

key risk areas affecting their operations 

and to classify the impact and likelihood 

of these risks in a register for prioritisation 

and management by both BU and 

the Group. The ERM framework also 

provides the reporting structure, monitoring 

mechanisms, processes and tools used,

and undertake only appropriate and 

well-considered risks to optimise returns 

in a balanced and holistic manner to deliver 

long-term value for our stakeholders. 

Proactive Risk Management

Effective risk management requires 

a dynamic approach. We recognise the 

need to continually evolve our framework 

and processes to ensure our risk 

identification, assessment, mitigation, 

communication and monitoring remains 

effective. However, much of these depend 

on our ability to remain vigilant against 

evolving or emerging threats that may 

affect our different businesses. Our BU 

risk teams identify, discuss and analyse 

emerging risks which may have an impact 

on the Group’s activities in meetings 

throughout the year. Where applicable, 

these are escalated for discussion and 

consideration at the various governance 

committees for review.

Through close collaboration with stakeholders 

and constant vigilance, the Group continues 

to proactively assess our risks so as to 

respond effectively. We constantly review 

our systems and processes to ensure 

that our ability to manage and respond to 

threats remains adequate and effective.

STRATEGIC RISKS

Market &amp; 

Competition

A large part of the Group’s strategic risks includes 

market driven forces, evolving competitive 

landscapes, changing customer demands and 

disruptive innovation. The Group remains vulnerable 

to other external factors including volatility in 

the global economy, implications of geopolitical 

developments, intense competition in core markets 

and disruptive technology. 

These risks receive constant high-level attention and strategy 

meetings are held across the Group to review business strategies, 

formulate responses and take pre-emptive action. 

The BRC guides the Group in formulating and reviewing risk policies 

and principles. These policies and principles are subject to periodic 

reviews to ensure that they continue to support business objectives 

and are aligned to our risk tolerance levels, taking into consideration 

the prevailing business climate.

Sustainability and 

Climate Change

Sustainability covers a broad range of material 

issues, many of which have been identified and 

managed according to the Group’s ERM framework. 

In addition, risks and opportunities relating to climate 

change have been recognised as fundamental to the 

Group. These relate to physical and transitional risks 

stemming from climate change and environmental 

management, which present both risks and 

opportunities for the Group. 

We support the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, 

and are working towards incorporating its recommendations in our 

reporting framework. 

A Sustainability Risk Framework (Figure 1), aligned to the ERM 

framework, guides the Group on the specific processes and methods 

applied in identifying, assessing and managing sustainability-related 

risks and opportunities. We are also committed to strengthening our 

organisational capabilities in responding to climate-related risks and 

opportunities.

Strategic Ventures, 

Investments &amp; 

Divestments

We have an established process for evaluating 

investment and divestment decisions including 

strategic ventures. These activities are monitored to 

ensure that they are on track to meet the Group’s 

strategic intent, investment objectives and returns, 

and where required, the need for timely recalibration 

of strategies in response to the changing business 

environment. These investment decisions are guided 

by Group-wide investment parameters.

Together with the Board, the Investment and Major Project Action 

Committee guides the Group in taking considered risks in a controlled 

manner, exercising the spirit of enterprise and prudence to earn the 

best risk-adjusted returns on invested capital across our businesses.

Investment risk assessment involves rigorous due diligence, feasibility 

studies and sensitivity analyses of key assumptions and variables. 

Some of the critical factors considered include alignment with Group 

strategy, financial viability, country-specific political and regulatory 

developments, contractual risk implications, as well as lessons learnt. 

We have defined the kinds of businesses that we will strictly avoid, 

those that we will maintain, and those which we will grow and expand, 

taking into account their respective environmental impacts. We will 

also be introducing an internal carbon price in the evaluation of all 

major investment decisions. The investment portfolio is constantly 

monitored to ensure that performance is on track to meet the Group’s 

strategic intent and investment returns.

Customer &amp; 

Stakeholder 

Experience

We recognise the increasing profile of consumer risks 

given the Group’s expansion into telecommunications 

and growing portfolios in the retail electricity, 

e-commerce and gas businesses. The key issues of 

consideration include areas such as brand trust and 

reputation, product/service quality/reliability, 

after-sales service/support, customer data privacy, 

product safety and other related matters such as 

customer responsiveness and the channel 

management across various platforms.

We regularly seek customer feedback and suggestions and track 

them to help us better understand our customers' needs in order to 

improve the quality of our products and services. Where relevant 

we conduct regular staff training, conduct surveys or align with 

industry best practices to enhance customer experience.

Human Resources

We continue to maintain a strong emphasis on 

attracting and building a deep talent pool. This 

includes nurturing employees, maintaining good 

industrial relations and fostering a conducive work 

environment. We are focused on strengthening 

succession planning and bench strength, as well as 

building new organisational capabilities to drive 

business growth, whilst maintaining our status as an 

employer of choice.

In talent development programmes, we emphasise the importance of 

having a risk-centric mindset to inculcate the ability to identify and 

assess risks, develop and implement mitigating actions, and monitor 

residual risks. Keppel Leadership Institute helps to inculcate this 

mindset by embedding risk management in its key leadership courses.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

Project 

Management

From project initiation through to completion, 

risk management processes are an integral part of

project management activities to facilitate early risk 

detection and proactive management. The Group 

adopts a systematic assessment and monitoring 

process to help manage key risks in projects. Attention 

is given to technically challenging and high-value 

projects, including greenfield developments and the 

deployment of new technology and/or operations in 

new geographies. Safety is incorporated into the design 

stage of projects to enhance worker safety. Projects 

are managed in accordance with the respective 

country’s environmental laws and labour practices.

During project execution, we conduct project reviews and quality 

and safety assurance programmes to address issues involving cost, 

schedule, quality and safety. Project Key Risk Indicators are used as 

early warning signals to determine if remedial actions are required. 

A Project Operational Set-up Guide detailing the key risk areas is also 

available for BUs. We also conduct knowledge-sharing workshops to 

share best practices and lessons learnt across the Group.

These processes help to ensure that projects are completed on 

time and within budget, without compromising on safety, quality 

and contract obligations.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

Health, Safety &amp; 

Environment

Maintaining a high level of HSE standard is of 

paramount importance to the Group. We constantly 

strive to raise awareness and maintain vigilance to 

foster a strong HSE-centric culture across the Group, 

particularly at the ground level where the risks 

are greatest.

Key initiatives include a Zero Fatality Strategy with a roadmap 

focused on aligning Hazard Identification Risk Assessment standards 

across our global operations, enhancing competency of employees 

performing safety-critical tasks, strengthening operational controls, 

deploying Root Cause Analysis investigation standards across 

the Group, as well as developing more proactive and leading risk 

indicators/matrices to monitor HSE performance standards. The Group 

achieved zero fatalities across our global operations in 2019. 

Environmental management is a major area of focus and key 

operating sites are closely monitored for compliance to environmental 

standards. In 2019, the Group clinched 18 awards at the Workplace 

Safety and Health (WSH) Awards for exemplary safety performances, 

implementation of strong WSH management systems, as well as 

efforts to create solutions that improve workplace safety. The Group 

also leverages technology to improve HSE processes and systems.

Business &amp; 

Operational 

Processes

We have established a common shared services 

platform which enables us to better manage costs 

while enhancing efficiency, productivity, compliance 

and controls.

Recognising the need to constantly harness technology, we have 

embarked on digitalisation initiatives and continue to take measured 

steps, applying a risk-based approach to optimise our processes.

We have adopted ISO standards and certifications in specific business 

areas to standardise our processes and keep up with best practices. 

In addition, procedures relating to defect management, operations, 

project control and supply chain management continue to be refined 

to improve quality of deliverables. We conduct regular reviews of 

policies and authority limits to ensure that they remain relevant in 

meeting business needs.

Business Continuity

We are committed to operational resilience with a 

robust Business Continuity Management (BCM) 

programme that seeks to equip us with the 

capability to respond effectively to business 

disruptions and to safeguard critical business 

functions from major risks. We are cognisant of the 

risks of natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism and 

cyber threats, as well as the failure of critical 

equipment/systems. We maintain a close watch and 

keep abreast of emerging threats.

The Group BCM Steering Committee provides sponsorship, direction 

and guidance to ensure that we maintain operational resilience and 

readiness against business disruptions to ensure that our business 

continuity plans remain current and relevant.

For coordinated escalation and management of major incidents, the 

Group Incident Reporting and Crisis Management operating standard 

was rolled out in 2019 to guide BUs on how they should evaluate and 

escalate major incidents to the Group, and how the Group Crisis 

Management team can effectively render assistance to affected BUs 

or manage/respond to major incidents directly. The Group Cyber 

Incident Response plan is also part of our crisis management approach 

which details response protocols to cyber incidents/threats. 

We continually evaluate our plans to gauge the effectiveness and 

timeliness of response. In 2019, we engaged an independent party 

to conduct a table-top exercise to validate the response plan. The 

post-exercise report indicated no significant gaps in Keppel’s incident 

responses and plan against industry practice.

During the year, the Group has also formalised the Business 

Psychological Readiness Programme, an initiative led by Temasek 

Foundation Cares. The initiative focuses on psychological support in 

the event of traumatic/adverse workplace events.

We continually extend and strengthen our capabilities in responding 

to major incidents/crises with the aim of safeguarding our people, 

assets and stakeholders’ interests.

The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is still unfolding. We have 

implemented business continuity plans to minimise disruptions to our 

operations and supply chain, especially in our key markets of China and 

Singapore. As we continue to assess and respond to the evolving situation, 

we are proactively implementing measures to mitigate the impact.

As we deal with the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, 

we are also focused on the well-being of our staff and stakeholders 

across our businesses. We have also taken a multi-pronged approach 

to assist those affected by COVID-19 in our communities.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

Cyber Security &amp; 

Data Protection

GRI 418-1

As Keppel moves into a more technology-focused 

and data-driven era, we recognise the integral 

importance and concerns of cyber threats globally. 

Technology and data security risks and the related 

processes/services in all forms are an integral part 

of the Group’s business risks. We have established 

a technology governance structure and security 

risk framework to address both general technology 

and data security controls, covering key areas such 

as cyber security, business disruption, theft/loss of 

confidential data and data integrity.

In 2019, we formalised and implemented a Technology and Data Risk 

Management standard which identifies, assesses and manages critical 

technology and data assets according to leading industry guidelines such 

as those given by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and the National 

Institute of Standards and Technology. The programme not only seeks to 

improve technology and data security standards but also to inculcate a 

culture of cyber hygiene in employees across the Group. The Group has 

also embarked on various initiatives to continually strengthen our technology 

security, governance and controls through the refinement and alignment 

of our policies, processes and systems, as well as the consolidation of 

servers and storages. We work closely with industry professionals and 

consultants to enhance our policies and practices on end-user computing, 

safeguarding information, as well as security self-assessments to identify 

critical gaps.

In terms of innovations and emerging threats, our pool of dedicated 

Information Technology (IT) experts enable us to keep abreast of IT 

matters. They are assisted by Keppel Technology and Innovation which 

drives the adoption of new technology and innovation across the Group. 

Extensive training and assessment exercises have been conducted to 

heighten overall awareness of technology and data threats.

We have also taken steps to safeguard corporate data assets against the 

loss of availability of critical systems to ensure resilience against disruptions.

As a provider of mobile and fixed communications services, M1 is 

committed to protecting customers' data privacy and subscribes to the 

principles and requirements of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012. 

In August 2019, M1 became the first telecommunications provider in 

Singapore to receive the Data Protection Trustmark Certification, 

administered by Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority.

In 2019, M1 reported six incidents of data loss and three customer complaints 

from Singapore's Personal Data Protection Commission relating to the usage 

of personal data. The incidents were addressed promptly. There were no other 

cases of identified leaks, thefts, or losses of customer data during the year.

COMPLIANCE RISKS

Laws, Regulations 

&amp; Compliance

GRI 205-1

Given the geographical diversity of our businesses, 

we closely monitor developments in laws and 

regulations of countries where the Group operates, 

to ensure that our businesses and operations 

comply with all relevant laws and regulations. We 

regularly engage with local government authorities 

and agencies to keep updated on changes to laws 

and regulations, ensuring that we can assess our 

exposures and risks effectively. We recognise that 

non-compliance with laws and regulations not only 

have significant financial impact but have potentially 

detrimental reputational impact on Keppel.

Significant risks issues, such as risks relating to corruption in all areas of 

operations within the Keppel Group where we have operational control, 

are surfaced by management and assessed by the Board. With respect 

to corruption, significant risks include areas where external agents are 

used for business development.

In 2019, we continued to make improvements to our regulatory 

compliance programme, ensuring that compliance awareness and 

principles are further entrenched in all our activities. More details can 

be found on page 44 of this report.

FINANCIAL RISKS

Fraud, 

Misstatement 

of Financial 

Statements &amp; 

Disclosures

We maintain a strong emphasis on ensuring that 

financial statements are accurate and presented 

fairly in accordance with applicable financial 

reporting standards and frameworks. 

Regular external and internal audits are conducted to provide assurance 

on the accuracy of financial statements and adequacy of the internal 

control framework supporting the statements. Where required, we leverage 

the expertise of engaged auditors in the interpretation of financial reporting 

standards and changes. We conduct regular training and education 

programmes to enhance competency of the Group’s finance managers. 

Keppel’s System of Management Controls framework outlines our internal 

control and risk management processes and procedures. For more details, 

please refer to page 43 of this report.

Financial 

Management

Financial risk management relates to our ability to 

meet financial obligations and mitigate credit, liquidity, 

currency and interest rate risks. Details can be found 

on pages 185 to 196 of our Report to Shareholders 

2019. Policies and financial authority limits are 

reviewed regularly to incorporate changes in the 

operating and control environment.

We are focused on financial discipline and seek 

to deploy our capital to earn the most optimal 

risk-adjusted returns for shareholders, while maintaining 

a strong balance sheet to seize new opportunities.

Our procedures include the evaluation of counterparties and other 

related risks against pre-established internal guidelines. We conduct 

impact assessments and stress tests to gauge the Group’s potential 

financial exposure to changing market situations, to enable informed 

decision-making and the implementation of prompt mitigating actions. 

We also regularly monitor our asset concentration exposure in countries 

where we have a presence to ensure that our portfolio of assets, 

investments and businesses are diversified against the systemic risks 

of operating in a specific geography.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

GRI 102-9 | 102-10

Division 

Description

Offshore &amp; Marine

Subcontractors work closely with Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine (Keppel O&amp;M) to construct, convert and repair offshore 

and marine vessels in our yards. 

Equipment manufacturers supply us with large-scale equipment such as thrusters, engines, winches, switchgear 

and variable control systems for installation on offshore and marine vessels that we build for clients; as well as

software and computer hardware products, as well as cable installation. Over 90% of these suppliers are based in 

Singapore, in line with our primary market.

on Keppel Corporation’s website. In 2019, 

99.97% of qualified suppliers endorsed the 

code or have their own codes which met 

Keppel’s requirements. The remaining 0.03% 

comprised one supplier, who was assessed 

by the business unit’s compliance team to 

be fit to be appointed, following further due 

diligence that was conducted.

Third-party associates of the Group that 

provide services on behalf of a Group 

company or engage in business activities on 

behalf of a Group company are required to 

abide by Keppel’s rules of business conduct. 

The rules specify the Group’s policy regarding 

ethical conduct and compliance with laws, 

anti-corruption, gifts and hospitality, and 

donations and contributions. 

The Group made progress in enhancing its

units are on board, with the remaining ones 

scheduled to come on board in 2020.

52      

Sustainability Report 2019  

Keppel Corporation Limited

SUPPLY CHAIN AND RESPONSIBLE PROCUREMENT

STRATEGIC PILLAR: RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS


In 2019, the Group established an ESG 

scorecard to consolidate key ESG data of 

our suppliers, which will allow us to assess 

and monitor their sustainability performance. 

Keppel O&amp;M, including its overseas entities, 

has included the ESG scorecard as part of 

its supplier qualification process. We are 

working to progressively implement the 

ESG scorecard across the rest of our 

business units. 

Due Diligence 

Keppel is committed to managing the inherent 

risks arising from our supply chains. The 

assessment of supplier risks and due diligence 

measures undertaken by the Group is an 

ongoing process which takes place throughout 

the lifecycle of a supplier relationship.

For example, Keppel O&amp;M conducts regular 

audits of resident subcontractors to ensure 

their adherence to the International Labour 

Organisation’s declaration on fundamental 

principles and rights at work and Singapore’s 

Ministry of Manpower marine sponsorship 

scheme requirements for the employment 

of local and foreign employees. 

The scope of these audits includes fair 

remuneration, living standards, workplace 

safety and abuse and harassment. Keppel 

O&amp;M ensures that monthly interviews are 

done directly with subcontract workers on 

a rotational basis to determine their levels 

of satisfaction pertaining to the above 

topics. The respective management of the 

subcontractor companies are then required 

to address any areas of concern, under a 

structured mechanism of monitoring and 

close out. For 2019, focus was given 

to about 10% of the total subcontractor 

companies registered with Keppel O&amp;M.

Keppel Land has in place a five-step supply 

chain management process that covers the 

whole lifecycle of its project from its initiation 

and design development stages to subsequent 

construction and operation stages. 

For all project sites covered under the scope of 

Keppel Land’s environmental management 

system, contractors are required to conduct 

an impact assessment based on activities 

at the project site prior to construction. 

The assessment covers potential negative 

environmental impacts, including depletion 

of resources, biodiversity disturbance as well as

air, water and noise pollution. Contractors 

are required to establish and implement 

appropriate measures to mitigate and/or 

prevent significant environmental impacts. 

Keppel Land also conducts regular site visits 

and internal audits as part of its supplier due 

diligence process. When lapses are identified, 

the company’s project team works closely 

with contractors to implement corrective 

action plans and preventive measures.

Identifying and auditing high ESG-risk critical 

suppliers enable us to allocate our resources 

to suppliers whom we can have the greatest 

impact on and support in improving their 

sustainability practices and performance. 

In 2019, we developed an audit framework 

to manage sustainability risks among our 

critical suppliers. Critical suppliers are 

determined by the following factors: 

cumulative order value, single order value 

and order volume, among other business 

criteria. ESG risks are assessed based on 

a country risk perspective in areas such as 

human rights, corruption, and the country’s 

environmental regulatory framework. 

Sustainability audits will be conducted for 

high ESG risk critical suppliers, and corrective 

action plans will be implemented where 

necessary. The critical suppliers audit 

framework will be progressively rolled out 

across the Keppel Group. 

BUILDING CAPABILITIES

GRI 403-7

We work closely with our suppliers 

and contractors to maintain high 

standards of conduct throughout our 

business engagements.

Forums and dialogue sessions with suppliers 

and contractors are held regularly to ensure 

alignment between Keppel’s supplier code 

of conduct and the respective codes of 

conduct of our suppliers and contractors, 

share experiences, and communicate our 

expectations regarding performance. Our 

business units have incentive programmes 

that reward and recognise contractors with 

exemplary HSE performance. 

Keppel O&amp;M conducts outreach programmes 

and briefings to subcontractor workers to 

inform them of their employment rights, 

and the available channels to report any 

violation of their rights. The company also 

collaborates with Singapore’s Ministry of 

Manpower to raise awareness among 

subcontractors on the common breaches 

in relation to the requirements under the 

Marine Sponsorship Scheme.

SUPPLIER SELECTION AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Customer Health &amp; Safety

Customer health and safety impacts are 

assessed for improvement in all our 

significant product and service categories, 

and throughout the products’ life cycles. 

We consider proper design, handling, storage 

and disposal of materials as early as the 

planning stage. At the project execution stage, 

we carry out project reviews and quality 

assurance programmes. In terms of product 

safety, we adhere to design for safety 

regulations for our construction projects 

and comply with work environment 

requirements for the rigs and vessels that 

we build. Our hazard identification and risk 

assessment methodologies are reviewed 

regularly to ensure effectiveness 

and relevance.

In our business units, functional divisions, 

including health, safety &amp; environment (HSE), 

commercial, engineering, and operations, 

as well as project and plant managers, are 

collectively responsible for the oversight of 

product and service safety.

All operational management and quality 

control systems at Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine 

(Keppel O&amp;M) are aligned based on the 

company’s business excellence roadmap 

and framework. Clients are briefed on the 

management systems in place to address 

project-specific HSE risks. This includes the 

development of HSE and emergency plans 

which detail how risks will be managed at 

each phase of the project. Regular site 

audits are conducted by the client and our 

project teams to ensure compliance to the 

client’s HSE standards.

Keppel Land has adopted the guidelines on 

design for safety in buildings and structure 

for all its new projects in Singapore since 

2008. The guidelines are in line with the 

Singapore Workplace Safety and Health 

Council’s design for safety regulations, 

which have been implemented since 2016. 

The guidelines require safety and health 

risks to be incorporated into the early 

conceptual and planning phases of a 

project, enabling designers and consultants 

to reduce these risks through good design 

and effective project planning.

Fostering Innovation 

The Keppel Technology Advisory Panel 

(KTAP) was established in 2004 as a 

key platform to advance the Group's 

technology leadership. Its members include 

eminent business leaders and industry 

experts from around the world. 

KTAP members provide Keppel with 

technology foresight, advice on strategic 

projects, and broaden Keppel’s networks. 

Collectively, members’ expertise covers 

a wide range of topics pertaining to 

sustainable urbanisation, including floating 

platforms, urban design and liveability, 

alternative energy and efficiency, as well as 

communication networks and digitalisation. 

KTAP convenes once a year with key 

members of Keppel Corporation’s board 

and senior management.

Keppel Technology and Innovation (KTI) 

is the Group’s platform to co-create and 

incubate ideas, and serves to sharpen the 

Group’s focus on innovation. Through KTI, 

we aim to transform how Keppel harnesses 

technology and innovation to create value 

for our stakeholders, including innovation 

in business models and the way we work,

as well as how we collaborate with third 

parties to accelerate change.

One of KTI’s key initiatives in 2019 was 

its collaboration with Keppel O&amp;M to drive 

the adoption of 3D printing. In partnership 

with Nanyang Technological University and 

the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing 

Technology, Keppel O&amp;M has been certified 

by Lloyd’s Register for its production of 

offshore-grade steel using Laser Aided 

Additive Manufacturing (LAAM) technology. 

This certification will support Keppel O&amp;M’s 

production of high-value components for 

offshore and marine structures. 

KTI also kicked off Venture INC which 

provided a platform for the acceleration 

and incubation of ideas from participating 

employees with guidance from innovation 

experts. The ideas shortlisted for further 

incubation include solutions for waste in

the marine environment, enhanced worker 

safety and smart homes.

In 2019, over 30% of the Group’s R&amp;D 

expenditure was invested in sustainability-

linked innovation, such as in renewable 

energy and high-rise green data centres.

COMPLIANCE

GRI 416-2

Keppel subscribes to best practices and 

complies with all applicable legislations 

and requirements.

Keppel is not aware of any violation of laws, 

regulations and voluntary codes pertaining 

to the provision, use, health and safety of 

its products and services in 2019.

Keppel’s business units abide by the

We focus on strengthening our 

frameworks and management systems 

as well as promoting a culture of safety 

ownership across our operations.

Board &amp; Management Oversight

Keppel Corporation was the first publicly 

listed company in Singapore to establish 

a Board Safety Committee (BSC) in 2006. 

The BSC, Chaired by Mr Tan Ek Kia,

a non-executive and independent

director of Keppel Corporation, adopts

a hands-on approach in setting the

strategic direction and establishing

a safety framework to ensure that 

consistently high safety standards are 

maintained across our business units.

Major incidents are also shared and 

discussed at quarterly BSC meetings. 

In 2019, we achieved zero workplace fatalities 

across our global operations, for the first time 

in more than 25 years.

The BSC leads efforts to implement 

initiatives and improve performance 

with the support of the Inter-Strategic 

Business Unit Safety Committee, which 

comprises representatives from all our 

business units. 

Many of our key business units also 

establish their own BSC to oversee safety 

strategy and practices. The latest business 

unit to establish its BSC in 2019 was M1. 

In 2019, Keppel Corporation’s BSC and the 

BSCs of our business units conducted five 

safety visits covering eight worksites in 

Singapore and China to engage staff.

STRATEGIC PILLAR: PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY


in China to strengthen the 

implementation of Group policies, 

strategies and standards across our 

business units in China;

 

• Completed global HIRA assessments 

at the Keppel Seghers Ulu Pandan 

NEWater Plant and Keppel Logistics 

sites in Singapore. There were no 

significant contraventions observed 

from these assessments;

• Incorporated the use of virtual 

reality technology at the Keppel 

Safety Training Centre and upgraded 

Keppel Telecommunications and 

Transportation’s safety sharing 

mobile application; 

• Conducted a survey among all 

Singapore yards on the company’s 

safety culture. Four safety culture 

taskforces have been established 

to address the possible areas of 

improvement identified through the 

survey, namely front line engagement, 

care culture, technical competency, 

and stop work authority; and

• Carried out quarterly reviews of 

potential safety risks for projects.

Strategy, Policy &amp; Management Systems 

Our approach to safety management is 

guided by the Keppel Zero Fatality Strategy 

(ZFS). Introduced in 2016, the strategy 

outlines actionable items to reduce 

workplace fatalities to zero through five 

strategic thrusts.

Every year, we aim to implement several 

key initiatives to strengthen our safety 

culture across the Group. In 2019, we:

• Introduced the Keppel Road Safety Policy 

in April, where all business units that 

provide their own transport or engage a 

third party for employee commute to/

from work or for other business purposes 

must ensure that vehicles are roadworthy 

and fitted with seat belts for the driver 

and all passengers. Drivers are also 

prohibited from using mobile phones 

while on the road;

• Held more than 30 safety leadership 

coaching programmes to train and 

empower over 3,300 frontline managers 

and supervisors, including those from 

our contract workforce;

• Established a health, safety and 

environment (HSE) steering committee 

The effectiveness of our management 

approach is reviewed regularly. During the 

annual HSE Roundtable, senior management 

from the Group’s business units share insights 

and best practices, and exchange ideas 

to improve safety performance. The action 

plan generated during the session is 

incorporated into the Group’s safety 

roadmap and strategies.

All employees and contractors at the 

worksites of the Group’s companies 

where Keppel has operational control are 

covered by our HSE management systems. 

All employees and third-party suppliers and 

contractors are also expected to abide by 

the Keppel Corporation HSE Policy, which 

places the highest priority on the health 

and safety of people and the protection of 

assets and the environment.

Our safety management system is routinely 

audited by independent certification bodies/

companies and internal audit teams. 

For example, Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine's 

(Keppel O&amp;M) cross-business unit audits 

and Keppel Infrastructure’s inspection for 

Safety Compliance Assurance (iSCA) 

ensure that policies and management 

systems are adhered to and that safety 

standards across operations are aligned. 

Our business units strive to achieve 

safety certifications in line with global best 

practices. Keppel O&amp;M’s yards in Singapore, 

Brazil, China, the Philippines and the 

United States, Keppel Infrastructure and its 

key subsidiaries, Keppel Land’s Singapore, 

China, and Vietnam divisions, as well as 

Keppel Logistics are certified to meet the 

OHSAS 18001 management system. 

In addition, Keppel Logistics is certified 

to meet the hazard analysis and critical 

control point management system. 

Our data centres Keppel DC Singapore

1 and 2 are also certified to meet the 

Singapore Standard for information and 

communications technology disaster 

recovery services.

As part of the Group’s continuous 

improvement efforts, we are working to 

meet the requirements under the new 

ISO 45001 occupational health and safety 

management system, which provides a 

robust set of processes for improving safety 

in global supply chains. To date, Keppel 

Shipyard, Keppel Subic Shipyard, Keppel 

Nantong Shipyard, Keppel Housing, Keppel 

Infrastructure and its key subsidiaries,

as well as Keppel Data Centres’ five data 

centres in Singapore have been certified to 

the new standards.

Hazard Identification &amp; Risk Management 

Across the Group, we establish and 

implement procedures to identify, assess 

and mitigate safety and health hazards 

related to our operations.

As part of hazard identification and risk 

management, our operational and safety 

teams conduct periodic workplace 

inspections and internal audits. Training 

is conducted to equip HSE personnel with 

the skills to effectively manage safety 

risks. Union workers and subcontractor 

representatives are invited to participate 

in meetings where the identification of 

hazards, assessment of risks and the 

application of control measures are 

discussed1. For business units whose 

workers do not belong to unions, worker 

representatives are nominated by the 

various departments to participate in 

monthly safety committee meetings.

Keppel’s operations are guided by five key 

safety principles, one of which is that 

everyone is empowered to stop any unsafe 

work. Workers are protected from reprisal 

when they report work-related hazards and 

hazardous situations.

Findings from our risk assessments are 

considered in the determination of facility 

requirements, training programmes and 

operational controls. For example,

management techniques incorporate 

the use of the bow-tie model and hazard 

and operability studies to identify and 

assess likely events that can result in 

critical failures.

We are also leveraging technology to 

drive improvements in our hazard and 

risk management, which is a key pillar of 

our ZFS. Group HSE is collaborating with 

Keppel Technology and Innovation to 

explore the use of various analytics and 

business intelligence tools to harness data 

from incidents, identify hazards, as well as 

conduct safety reporting, observations 

and inspections.

To protect workers from potential health 

hazards, hearing conservation and 

respiratory protection programmes 

are implemented at certain sites with 

higher risk levels. To protect against 

noise-induced hearing loss, employees 

with exposure to noise are required to

wear hearing protection gear and 

are screened at annual audiometric tests 

conducted by a mobile medical unit.

During the daily Take 5 toolbox meeting, 

workers are briefed on work-specific hazards 

including proper ergonomic practices in 

material handling. For example, at Keppel 

Shipyard, fit tests are conducted to ensure 

that respirators used are in good condition 

and correctly fit each user before usage.

Promotion of Worker Health

It is mandatory for all workers, including 

contract workers, to be covered by work 

injury compensation insurance prior 

to working at our worksites. In-house 

medical centres are also located in all 

our shipyards. Across the Group, our 

contractors partner with clinics to 

provide contract workers with access 

to medical care.

Keppel also promotes the wellness

of its workforce through programmes 

that address physical and mental

health-related risks. Voluntary health 

promotion programmes and services 

across the Group include a smoking 

cessation hotline, healthy snacks in 

pantries and canteens, as well as fitness 

classes. Regular health talks on stress 

management and diabetes prevention, 

among others, are organised at various 

work sites. Workers’ dormitories

are also equipped with gyms to promote 

healthy lifestyles.

Keppel O&amp;M conducts regular dormitory 

visits to engage workers on health and safety 

issues. Keppel Shipyard offers holistic health 

and medical services and is equipped

with a pharmacy, counselling rooms and 

designated rest areas. To provide workers 

with a conducive environment to rest during 

breaks, Keppel Shipyard built three 4-storey 

rest areas. Each rest area accommodates 

up to 2,000 workers.

The Keppel Wellness Gallery at Keppel 

Shipyard features interactive health 

exhibits to educate employees on the 

importance of having proper nutrition,

active lifestyles and good mental health.

Keppel Shipyard and Keppel Housing 

were recognised for their outstanding 

workplace health promotion practices at 

the biennial Singapore HEALTH (Helping 

Employees Achieve Life-Time Health) 

Awards in 2019.

Enhancing Skillsets

We empower and train our stakeholders 

to ensure that all personnel are updated 

on safety measures and best practices. 

In 2019, we invested approximately 

$21 million in enhancing safety-related 

infrastructure, upgrading systems and 

building knowledge and skillsets across 

the Group.

All personnel entering a Keppel-operated 

site must attend a site-specific safety 

induction to gain familiarity on the basic 

safety requirements and potentially 

hazardous on-site activities or situations. 

In addition, all workers must undergo 

HIRA training which covers high-risk 

activities specific to each work site.

The Keppel Safety Training Centre at Keppel 

Shipyard in Singapore offers a complete 

range of training and certification courses 

in both trade-specific and broad-based skills 

for all levels of the workforce. The centre 

is equipped with classrooms, an e-learning 

zone, and a hall with multimedia and 

interactive training stations. It also features 

a life-size replica of the mid-section of a 

tanker with various technical training areas. 

The centre offers key training modules 

such as core competency and leadership 

development programmes, and workforce 

skills qualification courses certified by the 

Singapore Workforce Development Agency, 

conducted by qualified, full-time instructors. 

This model has been replicated at our yards 

in Brazil, China, the Philippines and the 

United States.

At Keppel Land, the Safety Awareness 

Centres (SAC) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; 

Johor Bahru, Malaysia; Jakarta, Indonesia 

and Tianjin, China, provide mandatory 

training for contractors’ employees and 

foster a safety culture across Keppel Land’s 

supply chain. Keppel Land’s mobile SAC 

in Wuxi, China, is also deployed to Keppel’s 

various offices and worksites in Wuxi to 

enhance safety awareness.

Engaging Stakeholders

We work closely with all stakeholders, including 

our contractors, subcontractors, customers, 

suppliers, regulators and industry associations, 

to maintain high safety standards throughout 

our workforce. Our subcontract workers 

undergo the same training as direct employees.

To collectively raise industry standards 

and stay abreast of industry best practices, 

members of Keppel’s management and 

safety representatives are members of 

various councils and committees of the 

Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council,

such as the WSH (Marine Industries) committee, 

WSH (Construction and Landscape) committee, 

National Work at Height Taskforce, and related 

industrial associations such as the Association 

of Singapore Marine Industries and Real Estate 

Developers' Association of Singapore.

As a bizSAFE partner, Keppel O&amp;M actively 

encourages contractors to progress through the 

levels of the bizSAFE programme. Since 2018, 

Keppel O&amp;M has imposed a bizSAFE Level 4 

(second-highest) certification requirement 

for resident contractors before they are able 

to undertake work at our yards.

In accordance with the company’s HSE 

policy, business units are required to report 

and investigate all accidents, incidents and 

near misses, and ensure that lessons learnt 

are shared to prevent any recurrence. All 

Group companies where Keppel has operational 

control are required to report incidents, 

including those that involve third parties 

such as contractors, clients and visitors at 

our premises, as well as employees working 

at third-party sites or commuting for 

work-related purposes.

At worksites, stand-downs are conducted 

when incidents occur or when hazards are 

spotted. Reportable incidents and near 

misses are also promptly reported to 

senior management.

OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH

STRATEGIC PILLAR: PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY




The annual Keppel Group Safety Convention 

is a valuable platform for all stakeholders 

to reaffirm their commitment to safety. 

The Chairman's Safety Trophy Challenge 

for 2019 was awarded to Keppel O&amp;M's 

Conversions and Repairs Division.

The Group recorded no fatalities for its global 

operations in 2019, the first time the Group 

has achieved this target in over 25 years.

The Group reported a total of 17 safety 

incidents1 in 2019, of which five incidents 

involved our direct workforce and 12 

incidents our contractors. The reported 

incidents have been classified under the 

following types:

• Caught in between;

• Fall on same level;

• Fall from height;

• Struck by; and

• Sprain/strain.

Of the 17 reportable incidents, five were 

of high consequence2 which led to 

insurance payouts under the Work 

Injury Compensation Scheme.

All work-related incidents are jointly 

investigated by the operational and safety 

teams. Where appropriate, an independent 

team is set up to investigate fatal and high 

potential incidents. All incident investigations 

include an account of the events leading 

up to the incident, how it occurred and 

post-incident actions, as well as a root 

cause analysis and corrective action plan 

to prevent recurrence.

All of the Group’s operational entities monitor 

occurrences of occupational disease at their 

individual sites based on their region’s 

regulatory requirements. No occurrences of 

occupational disease were reported in 2019. 

During the year, the Group paid one 

significant3 fine of $200,000 relating

to a fatal accident involving a contractor

at one of Keppel O&amp;M's shipyards in 

Singapore in October 2013. Immediate 

rectification actions were taken and 

mitigation measures to prevent recurrence 

have been put in place since 2013.

RECOGNITION

The Group was conferred 18 WSH 

Awards in 2019 by Singapore’s Ministry 

of Manpower and the WSH Council. This 

is the highest number of awards won by 

a single organisation in the year.

Of the 18 awards, Keppel O&amp;M received 

12 awards under the Safety and Health 

Award Recognition for Projects (SHARP) 

category for exemplary project safety 

and health management systems. Keppel 

FELS, a subsidiary of Keppel O&amp;M, also 

clinched the WSH Performance (Silver) 

Award for outstanding safety performance. 

In addition, Keppel FELS was conferred 

two WSH Innovation Awards, while 

Keppel Logistics and Keppel Merlimau 

Cogen each scored one award in this 

category. This award serves to recognise 

the development of solutions which 

improve safety and enhance operations 

at the workplace.

ENHANCING COMMUNICATION 

Keppel’s five key safety principles 

are widely publicised to ingrain safety 

consciousness among all stakeholders. 

The Group HSE Alerts system was 

established to better disseminate 

lessons learnt globally and ensure that 

preventive measures are taken promptly.

At the 13th Keppel Group Safety 

Convention on 5 November 2019, 

close to 400 Keppelites, contractors, 

subcontractors and business associates 

came together to reaffirm their 

commitment to safety. The convention 

saw the continuation of the annual

Keppel Group Safety Awards and also 

recognised 28 safety innovation projects.

As a reminder of our common commitment 

to safety, the third annual Global Safety 

Time-out (GSTO) was held on 26 August 2019. 

During these timeouts, frontline managers 

reiterated safety messages and shared best 

practices with Keppelites.

1 

A workplace accident that results in the injury 

of an employee who is given more than three 

consecutive days of medical leave or hospitalised 

for at least 24 hours; or a workplace accident that 

results in the injury of a self-employed person or 

non-employee who receives treatment in hospital.

2 

A high-consequence incident is one from which 

the worker cannot, does not, or is not expected 

to recover fully to pre-injury health status within 

6 months (e.g. amputation of limb, fracture with 

complications). This definition is adopted across 

Keppel's global operations.

3 

A significant fine refers to a monetary sanction 

equal to or above $50,000 that was paid during 

the financial year.

OVERVIEW

GRI 103-1

People are our most valuable asset. We 

respect and uphold human rights principles, 

adhere to fair employment practices, and 

invest in developing and training our 

workforce. In doing so, we enhance our 

ability to attract and retain the best talent 

and grow the capabilities of our people.

REPORT BOUNDARY 

GRI 102-8 | 103-1

The data reported in this section takes 

into account significant subsidiaries and 

associated companies in which the Group 

has a stake equivalent to 51% or more. 

Our total workforce across more than 20 

countries was 21,049 as at end-2019. The 

figure comprises full and part-time 

permanent employees and excludes our

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

GRI 102-41 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 401-2 | 404-3 | 406-1 

Fair Employment

The ability to attract and retain talent is key 

to our business. We adopt fair employment 

practices and comply with local labour 

regulations across our global operations,

as well as minimum wage laws, where 

such laws exist. We endorse Singapore’s 

Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment 

Practices and the Employers’ Pledge of Fair 

Employment Practices. Keppel Corporation 

is also signatory of the Singapore Business

Federation’s Sustainable Employment Pledge. 

Globally, 5,072 people were hired in 2019. 

Overall voluntary turnover rate was 10.9%, 

a decrease from 12.7% in 2018. 

We believe that hiring from local communities 

enhances our ability to understand local 

needs, and strengthens our capabilities on 

the ground. We also develop talents locally 

to assume management positions. Across our 

business units, 69.8% of senior management1 

and 67.8% of our employees are citizens or 

permanent residents of the countries in 

which they work.

Keppel supports re-employability beyond 

the statutory retirement age. Eligible 

employees are offered post-retirement 

employment opportunities in Keppel, in line 

with the Singapore Tripartite Guidelines 

on the Re-employment of Older Employees. 

As at 31 December 2019, there were 

241 re-employed staff in the Group, 

of whom 67 were re-employed in 2019.

Compensation &amp; Benefits 

Keppel subscribes to a pay-for-performance 

philosophy. 

Opportunities for advancement, promotion, 

recognition, compensation, training and other 

conditions of employment are provided 

based on merit. Performance reviews are 

conducted for permanent employees. The 

process, undertaken jointly by the employee 

and supervisor, entails target setting and 

review on an annual basis. 

Our employees in Singapore and overseas 

are provided with a comprehensive range of

benefits that may include paid vacation leave,

medical benefits and group insurance plans. 

In Singapore, part-time employees are entitled 

to similar benefits on a pro-rata basis. 

Foreign workers are an important part of our 

workforce in Singapore, especially in Keppel 

Offshore &amp; Marine. Many of these workers 

have been with the company for many years 

and have risen to supervisory positions. 

Besides competitive wages and bonuses 

for eligible employees, foreign workers under 

direct employment in Singapore also enjoy 

other benefits such as subsidised housing.

Eligible female employees in Singapore 

are entitled to a maximum of 16 weeks of 

paid maternity leave, while eligible male 

employees in Singapore are entitled to a 

maximum of two weeks of paid paternity 

leave, in accordance with the Singapore 

Ministry of Manpower’s legislation. In 

Singapore, we had a 90.2% return to work 

rate for the 83 female employees who went 

on maternity leave. 

The Keppel Group adheres to the respective 

social security contribution or pension plan 

obligations of the countries in which we 

operate. In Singapore, the Central Provident 

Fund (CPF) is a comprehensive social security 

savings plan that enables salaried Singapore 

citizens and permanent residents to set aside 

funds to work towards a secure retirement. 

Under the CPF scheme, Keppel and its 

employees make monthly contributions to 

the employees’ CPF accounts in accordance 

with the prevailing regulations.

AND HUMAN RIGHTS

STRATEGIC PILLAR: PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY


Collective Bargaining 

Unions are our partners and we place 

great emphasis on maintaining a harmonious 

and collaborative relationship with them. 

Approximately 19.3% of our global workforce 

are bargainable employees covered by 

collective agreements. 

Guidelines are in place for the appropriate 

management of grievance cases. For 

unionised companies, employee grievances 

are resolved according to the grievance 

handling protocol spelt out in the 

respective agreements. 

All registered grievances are investigated 

and tracked through to final closure. In the 

case of a grievance, our management and 

the union will undertake every reasonable 

effort to resolve the grievance promptly. 

Across our businesses worldwide, there 

were 26 grievance cases1 reported in 2019, 

all of which have been resolved. 

Diversity &amp; Inclusion

We value and respect all employees 

regardless of ethnicity, gender, religious 

beliefs, nationality, age or any physical 

disability. Our stance on diversity and inclusion 

is articulated in our corporate statement on 

diversity and inclusion, which was formalised 

in early 2019, and is publicly available online.

Human Rights 

We uphold and respect the fundamental 

principles set out in the United Nations (UN) 

Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 

the International Labour Organisation’s 

declaration on fundamental principles and 

rights at work. Our approach to human 

rights is informed and guided by general 

concepts from the UN Guiding Principles 

on Business and Human Rights. 

Keppel Corporation is a signatory of the 

UN Global Compact and is committed to 

the Compact's 10 universal principles, 

which include principles on human rights 

and labour practices. 

We have zero tolerance for unethical labour 

practices such as child labour, forced 

labour, slavery and human trafficking in 

all of our operations. Our suppliers are 

expected to abide by the Keppel supplier 

code of conduct, which holds them 

accountable for responsible labour practices 

in their operations. 

Our commitment to human rights is 

supported by our Employee Code of 

Conduct, which sets the tone in relation to 

the Group’s stance against discrimination 

on any basis. Our stance on human rights 

is articulated in our corporate statement 

on human rights which is publicly 

available online. 



Keppel's hiring policies ensure equal 

employment opportunities for all, and 

our corporate statement on diversity and 

inclusion was formalised in early 2019.

1 

In Singapore, a "workplace grievance" is as defined 

by the Ministry of Manpower, i.e. "discontent or the 

feeling of being victimised at work". Our overseas 

business units reference the following in defining 

a workplace grievance - the Keppel Group code of 

conduct, the employment laws and regulations of 

the country of operation, and the collective agreement 

between the company and the employee union, 

where applicable. 

Our hiring policies ensure equal employment 

opportunities for all. Our employment 

statistics, reviewed regularly, illustrate 

the diversity of our workforce. As at 

31 December 2019, 20.3% of our employees 

are female, compared to 19.4% in 2018. 

We recognise that there are certain 

segments in our businesses, such as 

offshore and marine, which tend to attract 

larger proportions of male employees due 

to the nature of the jobs. At our corporate 

office and in certain parts of our businesses, 

such as Keppel Capital, more than half of 

our employees are female. 55.9% of the 

staff in Keppel Corporation’s Corporate 

Office and 42% of the Heads of Departments 

are females as of end-2019. 

There were no reported incidences of 

discrimination raised by our employees 

in 2019.

TRAINING &amp; TALENT DEVELOPMENT 

GRI 404-1 | 404-2

We empower employees through learning 

and development programmes and 

encourage them to reach their full potential. 

In 2019, employees at our key operations 

in Singapore received approximately 

34.8 hours of training on average. Globally, 

the overall average number of training hours 

per employee was approximately 27.6 hours, 

with an average of 24.7 hours for females 

and 28.4 hours for males1. 

Keppel Corporation’s Group Human 

Resources drives and coordinates 

efforts across the business units to

200 employees have participated in the 

institute’s leadership programmes 

since 2015.

About 200 employees are part of the

undertaken by Keppel Young Leaders in 

2019 include the Keppel Young Leaders 

Symposium, which centred on uncovering 

potential business opportunities brought 

about by a circular economy, a capacity 

building partnership with SPD to empower 

persons with disabilities (see page 80), 

as well as dialogue sessions with eminent 

external speakers. 

Separately, the Keppel Associate 

Programme offers young talents 

opportunities for leadership development

part of the NUS ‘All-You-Can-Learn’ initiative, 

enables Keppel O&amp;M employees to sign up 

for various NUS modules and executive 

programmes on topics such as data 

analytics, robotics and engineering,

as well as finance and business. In 2019, 

Keppel O&amp;M utilised over 1,000 training 

places under this initiative.

Keppel O&amp;M’s technical associate and 

assistant technical associate schemes are 

offered in collaboration with the Institute 

of Technical Education. The two-year 

work-and-study programme includes 

classroom learning, practical skills training, 

on-the-job training and soft skills training. 

In 2019, five students participated in 

the programme. 

In partnership with the Singapore government, 

the Group supports the Singapore-industry 

scholarship which sponsors Singapore 

citizens pursuing their undergraduate studies 

in areas related to Singapore’s strategic 

sectors. In 2019, the Group supported one 

student in the programme. 

In 2019, Keppel Shipyard signed an

MOU with Keppel Employees Union, 

Shipbuilding Marine Engineering Employees’ 

Union and the National Trades Union 

Congress’s e2i (Employment and 

Employability Institute) to underscore 

the company’s commitment to implement 

Company Training Committees (CTCs).

The CTCs will play a crucial role in driving 

worker-centric industry transformation – 

assessing skills development gaps, 

developing training roadmaps, and rolling 

out robust digital and the technological

skills training to develop a skilled workforce 

that is ready to take on Industry 4.0. 

In China, Keppel O&amp;M launched a 

collaboration between Keppel Nantong 

Shipyard and Nantong Shipping College 

for the Overseas Training and Attachment 

programme in 2019. The two-month 

programme will develop employees’ skills

in mechanical and electrical engineering, 

dimension control and piping. In 2019,

eight employees from Keppel O&amp;M’s 

Singapore business units participated

in this programme, while another eight 

employees from Keppel Nantong Shipyard 

attended training courses at Nantong 

Shipping College.

also took the opportunity to pose questions 

to a panel comprising senior management 

from across the Keppel Group. 

Employees are updated on company 

developments at regular staff dialogue 

sessions and through digital 

communication platforms.

Building Strong Teams 

We believe that cohesive teams are integral 

to a productive workforce. We continue 

to build camaraderie among employees 

through various platforms, such as Keppel 

Games, a series of sports competitions 

initiated by Keppelite Recreation Club,

as well as volunteer activities organised by 

Keppel Volunteers. 

SUPPORTING NATIONAL DEFENCE 

As a company headquartered in Singapore, 

we believe in contributing towards Singapore’s 

national security. National Service (NS)

is a vital component of national defence

and we support our employees’ NS 

commitments. Keppel Corporation was 

awarded the NS Advocate Award for Large 

Companies at the Total Defence Awards 

organised by Singapore’s Ministry of 

Defence in 2018. The Award, conferred 

for a period of three years, is the highest 

accolade acknowledging businesses for 

their exemplary support towards Total 

Defence and in particular, NS. 

WORKFORCE WELLNESS 

We are committed to the well-being of 

our entire workforce. This includes foreign 

workers who live and work away from their 

families. Keppel O&amp;M provides high-quality 

dormitories for foreign workers under its 

direct employment in Singapore.

The dormitories are managed by Keppel 

Housing, a subsidiary of Keppel O&amp;M, to 

ensure that our foreign workers are able 

to enjoy good living conditions. These 

dormitories offer a range of amenities and 

recreational facilities, including a minimart, 

free laundry services and sports facilities. 

Activities such as talent search contests 

and sports events are organised to promote 

harmonious living and bonding. Keppel 

Housing also provides counselling services, 

including a 24-hour emergency helpline, 

to look after our workers’ mental and 

emotional well-being. In 2019, there were 

no fines or non-monetary sanctions for 

non-compliance with laws and/or 

regulations imposed on Keppel Housing. 

Other welfare initiatives organised by

our business units include lunchtime

talks, health screening exercises, fitness

classes as well as emotional and mental 

wellbeing programmes.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT 

Employee Engagement Survey 

We conducted the Keppel Global Employee 

Engagement Survey in 2019, which has 

been conducted at Group-level since 2009. 

The survey achieved a strong response 

rate of 98% from a sample size of over 

5,000 employees. The Group achieved 

a high Employee Engagement Score of 

86% in 2019, an improvement over our 

score of 82% in 2017 and 80% in 2015, 

and significantly higher than the average 

of 76% among Singapore companies. 

In addition, 88% of employees surveyed 

indicated that they would “go beyond the 

norm” to contribute to Keppel’s success. 

Enhancing Communication 

Various staff engagement initiatives are 

organised throughout the year to enhance 

communication between management 

and staff. The sixth edition of the Global 

Keppelites Forum, a group-wide town hall 

meeting, was held in January 2019. 

The event, which was also broadcast online, 

reached out to over 2,700 employees 

across 72 locations globally. 

During the session, Mr Loh Chin Hua, Chief 

Executive Officer of Keppel Corporation, 

shared how the Group has been reinventing 

and repositioning itself for long-term growth, 

including exploring new businesses and 

future growth engines such as senior living

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT


OVERVIEW 

GRI 103-1

Keppel aims to deliver lasting social, 

economic and environmental benefits 

to the communities where we operate. 

In engaging and nurturing communities, 

we contribute to building a sustainable 

future together. 

We invest in worthy causes that resonate 

with the company’s values. These include 

caring for the underprivileged, empowering 

lives through education, protecting the 

environment, and nurturing creativity and 

an appreciation for the arts among children

and youths. 

As leaders in our businesses, we also support 

industry efforts that foster collaboration to 

promote sustainable development. 

REPORT BOUNDARY 

GRI 103-1 

The boundary for the material topic of 

community development includes the 

Group's major subsidiaries in Singapore,

and overseas operations in which the 

Group has management control.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

GRI 103-2 | 103-3 | 203-2 | 415-1 

We commit up to 1% of the Group’s net 

profit to worthy causes. These contributions 

are coordinated and disbursed by Keppel 

Care Foundation, the Group’s philanthropic 

arm in Singapore, which is governed by its 

own Board of Directors. The Foundation 

has disbursed over $44 million to worthy 

causes to date, since its launch in 2012. 

In 2019, the Group spent $9.6 million on 

social investments. 

Beyond philanthropic giving, Keppel encourages 

employees to be responsible citizens. Keppel 

Volunteers, the company’s volunteer movement, 

works closely with the foundation to drive 

volunteerism. To encourage volunteerism, 

Keppel grants employees two days of 

volunteer leave annually. In 2019, Keppel 

Volunteers around the world achieved over 

18,000 hours of community service, an 

increase of 4,000 hours over the 14,000 hours 

in 2018.

Keppel Volunteers organise roadshows 

and talks for employees across the 

group to recruit volunteers and raise 

awareness on volunteering opportunities. 

The company has also designated August 

as its Community Month to further promote 

and drive volunteerism. Volunteers who 

participate actively are recognised for their 

contributions at an annual appreciation day held 

in conjunction with International Volunteer Day.

In 2019, Keppel conducted a survey to 

better understand the causes which its 

employees most identify with. The survey 

results validated that our focus areas of 

care for the underprivileged, education 

and environmental protection are closely 

aligned with employees’ aspirations. 

We maximise our corporate giving outcomes 

by partnering businesses and the community. 

For example, charity sales, donation drives 

and environmental campaigns are held at 

the lobbies of our commercial buildings to 

engage tenants, employees and members 

of the public. Keppel Care Foundation also 

supports the dollar-for-dollar matching of 

employee donations at the company’s 

fund-raising events.

Inclusive, quality education can lift 

communities out of poverty by enabling 

children and youth to create brighter futures 

for themselves and their families. Since its 

inception in 2012, Keppel Care Foundation 

has disbursed over $21 million to educational 

causes, which include scholarships and 

bursaries for students of local universities 

and institutes of higher learning. 

“I feel very honoured to be 

awarded this scholarship. 

It is a recognition of my 

hard work. Coming from a 

humble family background, 

the scholarship will also 

enable me to have bigger 

dreams, and encourages 

me to strive to continue 

to do well.” 

TOH YI JING, Keppel Care Foundation

Our bursaries provide students from disadvantaged backgrounds 

with access to quality education. Recipients have reported that the 

bursaries help to ease the financial burden on their families, with some 

reporting that they no longer need to take on part-time jobs to cover 

their school fees and daily expenses. With this financial assistance, 

they are able to focus on their studies and benefit from a more holistic 

educational journey. 

Recipients of our scholarships and academic awards have also 

reported that the recognition has inspired them to continue to work 

hard and contribute to society.

Volunteers organised community events, such as a health 

education talk on malaria and dengue prevention at a school,

and rallied staff to donate non-perishable food items and pre-loved 

winter clothing to support the underprivileged in the community. 





THE PHILIPPINES 

In 2019, we awarded four out-of-school youths with full scholarships 

in technical trades such as flux-cored arc welding, shielded metal 

arc welding and structural fitting. Keppel Batangas Shipyard also 

conducted two training sessions for 20 out-of-school youths, and 

eventually employed 16 of the trainees. 

Over 100 volunteers participated in National Schools Maintenance 

Week and helped with maintenance work, the clean-up of public 

schools as well as the refurbishment of classrooms. A book 

reading session was also held at the SIBOL Learning Centre

at the Keppel-GK Eco Village, with the aim of inculcating reading 

habits in young children. 



SINGAPORE

Keppel has pledged $500,000 over the next three years to support 

the sheltered workshop programme run by SPD, a local charity 

supporting persons with disabilities. The “SPD sheltered workshop 

supported by Keppel” aims to help persons with disabilities improve 

their job prospects through providing vocational training, therapy 

and employment support services. Beyond financial support, Keppel 

will bring the Group’s capabilities in areas such as engineering, 

workplace safety, business development and marketing to help 

enhance the sheltered workshop programme through skills-based 

volunteerism. Keppel Volunteers will also organise activities to 

engage SPD's clients (see Special Focus). 

During the year, over 100 Keppel Volunteers packed and distributed 

900 goodie bags, comprising food and household items 

sponsored by Keppel, to low-income households.

Keppel Volunteers across the Group continued to organise 

and participate in activities for its adopted charities, including 

Thye Hua Kwan, Montfort Care, NKF and Muscular Dystrophy 

Association Singapore. 



CHINA

In 2018, Keppel committed RMB 5 million to the China Foundation 

for Poverty Alleviation. The collaboration began with a three-year 

programme focused on needy students from 10 schools in 

Mabian County, Sichuan Province. 

In conceiving its community outreach programme in Mabian, 

Keppel had consulted the local education bureau to ensure that 

the aid provided would be suitable and impactful. 

Through Keppel’s contribution, close to 2,000 needy students are 

provided with milk every school day. Over 1,300 students have 

also benefited from Kindles sponsored by Keppel, which are made 

available at school libraries, as well as the upgrade of school kitchens. 

During the year, Keppel Volunteers in China engaged 600 students 

from four schools through interactive story-telling sessions and 

educational games.



VIETNAM 

Keppel Land is a sponsor of the Words on Wheels (WOW) mobile 

library programme, which is organised by the Singapore International 

Foundation. The initiative promotes reading and learning by 

providing students with better access to educational materials 

including books, the internet and multimedia facilities via a mobile 

library which visits participating schools on a rotational basis. 

Since the launch of Phase Two of WOW Ho Chi Minh City in

March 2018, nine volunteer trips involving over 90 employees 

across the Keppel Group have been held to-date. About 7,000 

students from seven primary and secondary schools have benefited 

from the programme. In addition, the programme also saw the 

refurbishment of libraries in three schools in Ho Chi Minh City.

Separately, to encourage the public to reduce consumption of 

single-use plastics, Keppel Land collaborated with partners 

in March 2019 to showcase a plastic straw art installation, 

‘The Parting of the Plastic Sea’, at the Estella Place retail mall

in Ho Chi Minh City. Singapore's then-Deputy Prime Minister

Teo Chee Hean viewed the exhibit during his visit to Estella Place.

Tree planting, coastal 

clean-ups and other activities

In November 2019, 150 volunteers from across the Group planted 150 coastal forest trees at Labrador Nature Reserve, 

which are expected to sequester 21.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide over 10 years. This initiative by Keppel supports 

NParks’ Forest Restoration Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the resilience of Singapore’s forests to climate 

change and enhance biodiversity through the sustained planting of native forest species. 

Keppel Volunteers cleared over 1,600 kilogrammes of marine trash in Singapore and the Philippines.

In Ireland, Keppel Data Centres participated in the ‘DC’s for Bees’ initiative, which aims to reverse the rapid decline 

of the bee population in Ireland through the creation of safe habitats for bees. About 2,000 saplings were planted by 

volunteers from Keppel Data Centres, together with participants from 19 other companies in the data centre industry. 

Raising environmental 

awareness

In support of Earth Day 2019, Keppel organised a public screening of the world’s first feature-length documentary 

on the circular economy, ‘Closing the Loop’, to an audience of close to 1,000 people at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. 

The documentary showcases examples from around the world on innovative applications of technology, process 

improvements and labour solutions to reduce waste and pollution.

Keppel Land and Keppel REIT collaborated with PUB to organise eco-roadshows at Keppel’s commercial buildings, 

namely, Keppel Towers &amp; Keppel Towers 2, Keppel Bay Tower, Ocean Financial Centre and Bugis Junction Towers. 

Keppel staff and building tenants were provided useful water-saving tips during the roadshows.

To raise awareness on plastic pollution, Keppel Land and Keppel REIT Management jointly organised the display of an 

interactive microplastics artwork made from Singapore’s shore debris. Keppel Land’s community mall in Ho Chi Minh 

City, Vietnam, Estella Place also featured ‘The Parting of the Plastic Sea’ straw sculpture to raise awareness of the 

environmental damage caused by single-use plastics.

KEPPEL CENTRE FOR ART EDUCATION



Inputs

Established with a $12 million commitment from Keppel, the Keppel 

Centre for Art Education at National Gallery Singapore is the first art 

education facility of its kind in the region. The Centre has hosted over 

1.8 million visitors since its launch in 2015. 

Keppel Volunteers also serve as Art Ambassadors and participate regularly 

in the Centre’s ‘Book in a Nook’ reading programme and guided school tours.

Outputs

As part of the Singapore Ministry of Education’s museum-based learning 

programme, 78% of the country’s Primary 4 pupils visited National Gallery 

Singapore in 2019. The majority of students participating in the programme 

visited the Keppel Centre for Art Education. 

Over 79,800 families participated in the Centre’s programmes such as 

‘Book in the Nook’ and ‘Stories in Art’ in 2019. Alongside serving the local 

community and encouraging the young to embrace art from a young age, 

the Keppel Centre for Art Education was also recognised on the global 

stage, having won the prestigious Children in Museums Award in 2018. 

Impact

Educators have shared that the immersive spaces at the Centre encourage 

creativity and self-led exploration in children, and help to improve students’ 

visual inquiry skills. The programmes offered at the Centre also promote 

familial bonding.

KEPPEL NIGHTS



Inputs

Keppel Corporation committed $500,000, from 2018 to 2020, to Keppel 

Nights, a partnership with Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay to nurture a 

deeper appreciation of the arts among students in Singapore. 

Outputs

In 2019, 4,868 students attended shows at the Esplanade. Since 2013, 

the partnership has provided about 28,000 students from more than 

75 schools in the heartlands with access to arts and cultural shows 

presented by the Esplanade. Keppel Nights also includes an element 

of experiential learning, with dance and music activities that give 

students the chance to try out various art and cultural forms and the 

opportunity to enjoy a professionally-staged live performance. 

Impact

Students have reported an increased interest in the arts and improved 

confidence and self-esteem after participating in Keppel Nights 

programmes. The sensory-friendly performances also make arts 

and cultural shows accessible to students with special needs.

FOSTERING CREATIVITY &amp; APPRECIATION OF THE ARTS

We believe that the arts inspire, contribute towards civic engagement and social cohesion, and build bridges between cultures. 

Through supporting the arts, we aim to stimulate the cross-fertilisation of ideas, and foster creativity and expression. This will in turn 

contribute to the vibrancy of our communities.

will include improvements to its process 

efficiency and safety measures, developing 

an apprenticeship programme for trainees 

with higher work support needs, and a new 

product line to refresh the workshop’s 

offerings of gift products. 

Trainees like 27-year-old Mr Alvin Tey will

get a better chance at achieving more 

through the new apprenticeship programme. 

Alvin was diagnosed with Dandy Walker 

Syndrome, a congenital brain malformation, 

low vision and speech limitations. These 

conditions limit the speed and quality of 

his work at the workshop’s assembly lines. 

Under the apprenticeship programme, Alvin 

and a few other trainees are picking up skills 

like leather stitching that would allow 

them to be better engaged, while 

producing commercially-viable leather 

products for sale. “Learning sewing is 

not easy, but I enjoy learning new skills 

and making new things,” said Alvin. 

“Keppel Young Leaders will continue to 

refine the apprenticeship programme

with a view to scale up production over

the next two years. We will also work

with SPD on marketing and branding, 

process optimisation and distribution,”

said Mr Ivan Lim, President of Keppel Young 

Leaders and General Manager of Specialised 

Vessels at Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine. 

Keppel’s support also includes funding 

kerb-to-kerb transport for trainees

who have difficulty commuting between

the workshop and their homes due to

the severity of their conditions. Such 

specialised transport service will make 

it possible for the trainees to get out of 

their homes and participate in the 

workshop’s programmes.

STRONGER TOGETHER

In addition, Keppel Care Foundation 

had earlier made a $300,000 donation to 

The Courage Fund, while the Keppel Group, 

through Keppel Land China, had also made 

a RMB3 million donation to the Shanghai 

Charity Foundation, one of the largest 

charity foundations in China, to support 

the deployment of medical teams from 

Shanghai and the provision of medical and 

other supplies to Hubei Province and 

other affected regions in China.

In March and April 2020, Keppel Volunteers 

also stepped up to serve the community 

before the start of the Circuit Breaker period 

in Singapore. They partnered KidSTART 

officers from the Early Childhood Development 

Agency to pack and deliver “care packs” 

containing hygiene items such as hand 

sanitisers, and wet wipes to low-income 

families with young children living in rental 

blocks in Boon Lay and Taman Jurong, and 

engaged the children by teaching them 

proper hand washing techniques and 

how to effectively apply hand sanitiser. 

To help the community stay safe 

and healthy, Keppel Volunteers also 

participated in the #BYOBclean event, 

as part of Temasek Foundation’s Stay 

Prepared initiative that provided half a 

litre of free zero-alcohol hand sanitiser

to all Singaporean households, dispensing 

over 3,000 bottles over one week.

Keppel Volunteers, together 

with KidSTART officers from 

Early Childhood Development 

Agency, delivered care packs to 

families living in rental flats, and 

shared with them proper hand 

washing techniques.

As the world continues to fight the 

COVID-19 pandemic, Keppel is committed 

to supporting its stakeholders and the wider 

community in this challenging time, and 

has committed over $5 million to provide 

support to communities affected by the 

pandemic in Singapore and China. 

In March 2020, Keppel Corporation 

announced a comprehensive package 

worth more than $4.2 million to help the 

Singapore community weather COVID-19, 

funded by voluntary contributions from 

the Group’s directors, senior management 

and staff, with dollar-for-dollar matching 

contributions from Keppel Corporation. 

Dr Lee Boon Yang, Chairman of 

Keppel Corporation, said, “As one of 

the largest homegrown companies in 

Singapore, Keppel will do what we can 

to strengthen national resilience in the 

fight against COVID-19. Through this 

package, we will provide support to 

the communities most affected by the 

pandemic, including healthcare workers 

and patients, lower income families,

as well as Small and Medium-Sized 

Enterprises (SMEs).”

“Keppel has stood together with the 

community to overcome many challenges 

over the past five decades. I am confident 

that with unity and determination, we can 

effectively weather this difficult environment, 

and emerge stronger together.”

The CEO and CFO of Keppel Corporation, 

as well as CEOs of key Keppel business 

units, volunteered to give up one month 

of their salaries in April 2020 to support 

this effort, while Directors of Keppel 

business units would also contribute 

an equivalent amount of their annual fees. 

Other members of the Group’s senior 

management gave up half a month of 

their salaries, while other Keppel employees 

in Singapore were free to contribute any 

amount of their choice. 

About $3.5 million will go towards 

supporting lower income households 

in Singapore, through rebates given by 

Keppel Electric, M1 and City Gas to residents 

living in 1 and 2-room HDB flats. The rebates 

are expected to benefit more than 40,000 

households. In addition, $300,000 has 

also been donated to The Courage Fund 

to fund relief schemes for communities 

in Singapore affected by COVID-19. Up to 

$400,000 will be set aside to support 

Keppel’s frontline staff, such as cleaners 

and security personnel, in appreciation for 

their contributions and hard work during 

this difficult period, and also to provide 

personal protective equipment, hygiene 

items and other essentials to vulnerable 

communities in Singapore.

Sustainability Report 2019 

81      


This report focuses on the sustainability 

strategy and practices of Keppel Corporation 

and its subsidiaries, namely the material 

environmental, social and governance (ESG) 

aspects of our business operations.

This report provides an overview of our 

management approach, priorities, targets 

and performance reviews in key areas.

The content was defined by identifying and 

prioritising the Company’s material ESG factors 

through a comprehensive materiality review 

completed in 2019 (see pages 12 and 13). 

We printed limited copies of this report to 

minimise environmental impact. A PDF version 

is available at www.kepcorp.com.

Our stakeholders are advised to read

Keppel Corporation’s Report to Shareholders 

2019, available at www.kepcorp.com/

annualreport2019, for more information 

on the Group’s businesses, strategy, 

performance and prospects.

REPORTING PERIOD &amp; STANDARDS

GRI 102-50 | 102-51 | 102-52 | 102-54

This report is published annually and covers 

the same period as the financial year of 

the Company (January to December 2019), 

unless otherwise stated. Our last sustainability 

report was published in May 2019. Where 

possible, we shared three-year historical 

information to provide a meaningful basis 

for comparison.

This report has been prepared in accordance 

with the GRI Standards: Core Option and 

Singapore Exchange-ST Listing Rules Practice 

Note 7.6 Sustainability Reporting Guide. 

We support the Taskforce on Climate-related 

Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and are working 

towards incorporating its recommendations 

in our reporting framework.

We are a signatory to the United Nations (UN) 

Global Compact and are committed to the 

10 Principles. This report serves as our 

Communication on Progress. 

The report was submitted for the GRI 

Materiality Disclosures Service, and GRI 

confirmed the correctness of the locations 

of the materiality disclosures (GRI 102-40 

to 102-49). The GRI Materiality Disclosures 

Service organisational mark is located

on page 83.

We used standard units of measurement. 

Conversion factors may be found in the 

relevant sections. All dollar values 

expressed are Singapore dollars.

REPORT BOUNDARY

GRI 102-46 | 102-48 | 102-49

As a guide, this report covers global operations 

and all subsidiaries for which the Group has 

management control, unless otherwise 

indicated. The Group structure is provided 

on page 10. Significant subsidiaries 

include Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine, Keppel 

Land, Keppel Infrastructure, Keppel 

Telecommunications &amp; Transportation 

and Keppel Capital. We expanded the 

scope of our reporting in 2019 to include 

contributions by M1, following the acquisition 

of M1 in 1H2019. The reporting boundary 

for financial data is the same as that of 

Keppel Corporation’s Report to Shareholders 

2019. The reporting boundaries for our 

material topics may vary, due to differences 

in where the impacts occur most for each 

topic. The boundaries are specified in the 

respective sections on our material issues. 

To improve the monitoring and reporting 

of our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, 

in 2019, we reviewed our approach, reporting 

boundaries and calculation methodology 

for closer alignment with the GHG Protocol, 

based on an operational control approach. 

Our three-year environmental performance 

data on page 29 has been restated to reflect 

the changes in our reporting boundaries 

and methodology.

agreed on with Keppel. However, our

statement represents our independent 

opinion and is intended to inform the 

independent conclusion of our verification 

to Keppel’s stakeholders. DNV GL is 

responsible for planning and performing 

the engagement to obtain a limited level 

of assurance based on ISAE 3000 and 

VeriSustain, i.e. whether the reported 

disclosures are free from material 

misstatement and meets disclosure 

requirements of the GRI Standards (2016) 

and selected GRI Standards (2018) for 

identified material topics, in accordance 

with the Core option of reporting.

BASIS OF OUR OPINION

Our assurance opinion is based on a 

limited level of assurance engagement 

undertaken for the disclosures in this 

Report. A multi-disciplinary team of 

sustainability and assurance specialists 

performed the work at Keppel’s corporate 

headquarters and its subsidiaries in 

Singapore – Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine 

and Keppel Infrastructure, during March 

and April 2020 to verify the qualitative 

and quantitative disclosures such as 

the related management approach for 

identified material topics, and test the 

reliability of data and the robustness of 

the data aggregation processes.

As part of the verification, we planned and 

performed our work based on DNV GL’s

risk-based approach to obtain the evidence 

that we considered necessary to provide 

a basis for our assurance opinion. Within 

the framework of our verification, we 

performed the following procedures and 

other activities:

• Conducted interviews with key data owners

from Keppel Corporation and its subsidiaries 

including Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine and 

Keppel Infrastructure, to understand 

the key processes and controls for 

reporting subsidiary performance data;

• Assessed the robustness of the 

underlying data and information 

flow and controls;

• Performed sample data analysis using 

a risk-based approach and materiality;

• Challenged the sustainability-related 

disclosures, statements and claims;

• Performed limited testing on a sampling 

basis of the selected information at 

Keppel’s corporate headquarters and 

subsidiaries’ headquarters to check that 

the selected environmental and social 

data had been properly measured, 

gathered, recorded, collated and reported.

We also performed the following

activities to assess the adherence 

to reporting principles:

• Interviewed selected senior managers 

and representatives responsible for 

sustainability management and 

made enquiries to determine their 

understanding of stakeholder 

engagement and materiality;

• Reviewed the current sustainability 

issues that could affect Keppel and 

could be of interest to stakeholders.

CONCLUSION

We provided a limited level of assurance 

over non-financial disclosure presented 

in Keppel’s Report. Based on the work 

undertaken, nothing has come to our 

attention to suggest that the Report is

not a fair representation of Keppel’s

sustainability performance for the identified 

scope and boundary of reporting. Without 

affecting our assurance opinion, we also 

provide the following observations regarding 

the adherence to the Principles for Defining 

Report Content and Report Quality as 

defined in the GRI Standards:

STAKEHOLDER INCLUSIVENESS

The Report brings out the outcomes

of a stakeholder consultation exercise 

conducted by Keppel from December 2018 

to April 2019, covering various stakeholder 

groups i.e. six internal and external 

stakeholder groups such as customers, 

employees, governments, shareholders, 

local communities and suppliers. Further, 

the Report articulates Keppel’s stakeholder 

engagement activities occurred at the 

Group and business unit levels through 

various platforms. Nothing has come to 

our attention to suggest that the Report 

does not meet the requirements related 

to the Principle of Stakeholder Inclusiveness.

MATERIALITY

The Report brings out the materiality 

determination process adopted by Keppel 

and its outcomes based on the exercise 

of revisiting Keppel’s material topics through

the materiality review exercise conducted 

by Keppel during December 2018 and 

April 2019, covering both internal and 

external stakeholder groups. Further, 

the process included an assessment of 

long-term global trends and an internal 

review of the Group’s businesses. The review 

resulted in a matrix categorising and 

prioritising material topics based on 

their importance to internal and external 

stakeholders. The material topics identified 

INTRODUCTION

DNV GL Business Assurance Singapore Pte. Ltd. 

has been commissioned by the management 

of Keppel Corporation Ltd. (“Keppel”, Company 

Registration Number: 196800351N) to carry 

out an independent assurance engagement 

for the qualitative and quantitative information 

(“sustainability performance”) reported in 

the Keppel Corporation Sustainability Report 

2019 (the Report), which is available on 

Keppel’s website1 and in print, for the 

financial year ending 31 December 2019.

The assurance is in accordance with 

the International Standard on Assurance 

Engagements ISAE 3000 Assurance 

Engagements Revised2 and Reporting 

Principles from the GRI Standards on 

Defining Report Content and Quality, and 

was performed using DNV GL’s assurance 

methodology VeriSustainTM3 (Version 5.0).

SCOPE OF ASSURANCE

The scope of assurance included a review 

of sustainability disclosures and performance 

data from Keppel and its subsidiaries over 

which Keppel has operational control in 

and outside of Singapore. The boundary 

of the Report for identified material topics 

and topic-specific disclosures is defined 

within the Report and unless otherwise 

stated, includes those subsidiaries over 

which Keppel has management control.

We evaluated the Report for adherence 

to the reporting principles for defining the 

sustainability report content as set forth 

in the GRI Standards. We understand that 

the reported financial data and information 

are based on Keppel’s and respective 

subsidiaries’ financial statements, which 

are subject to a separate independent audit 

process. The review of financial data taken 

from these financial statements was not 

within the scope of our work.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE 

MANAGEMENT OF KEPPEL AND 

OF THE ASSURANCE PROVIDER

Keppel has sole responsibility for the integrity 

of the Report and the responsibility includes 

designing, implementing and maintaining 

internal controls over collection, analysis, 

aggregation, preparation and fair presentation 

of the disclosures within the Report, ensuring 

that the reported data is free from material 

misstatement, and maintaining integrity of 

the information on its website. In performing 

our assurance work, our responsibility is 

solely towards the management of Keppel 

in accordance with the terms of reference

were approved by Keppel Corporation’s 

Board of Directors. Nothing has come to 

our attention to suggest that the Report 

does not meet the requirements related 

to the Principle of Materiality.

RESPONSIVENESS

The Report provides an overview of the 

Keppel Group’s sustainability performance 

and the processes adopted to communicate 

with stakeholders on the corporate strategy, 

management approach, and achievements 

and performance in relation to identified material 

issues, considering the overall sustainability 

context and external environment of its business 

within the identified reporting boundary. In our 

opinion, the Report could further bring out 

the long and medium-term targets related 

to the identified material topics.

ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY

The Report brings out the systems that 

Keppel has implemented to compile and 

report information in a relatively consistent 

manner as per the GRI Standards applied 

for reporting the performance related 

to identified material topics. Any errors 

or misstatements identified during the 

assurance engagement were communicated 

for correction prior to the Report being 

published, and were corrected by Keppel. 

In our opinion, the level at which the Report 

adheres to the principle of accuracy 

and the reliability of the information 

on sustainability performance can be 

enhanced by implementing internal 

verification checks to improve consistency 

in data collection processes.

COMPLETENESS

The Report has covered the sustainability 

strategy, management approach and 

sustainability performances against the 

material topics identified based on GRI 

Standards. The boundary of the Report 

has been explained across sections in the 

Report and includes the sustainability 

performance from the global operations, 

subsidiaries and associated companies over 

which the Keppel Group has management 

control for the reporting period.

BALANCE AND NEUTRALITY

The Report and related linkages in Keppel’s

corporate website brings out both the positive

and the negative trends of Keppel’s sustainability 

performance in 2019, presenting a balanced 

account of the activities and results relevant 

to the reporting year. Nothing has come 

to our attention to suggest that the Report 

does not meet the requirements related to 

the Principles of Balance and Neutrality.

LIMITATION

Our assurance relies on the premise 

that the data and information provided 

by Keppel to us as part of our review 

procedures have been provided in good 

faith and free from misstatements. Because

of the selected nature (sampling) and 

other inherent limitation of both procedures 

and systems of internal control, there 

remains the unavoidable risk that errors 

or irregularities, possibly significant, may 

not have been detected. The engagement 

excludes the sustainability management, 

performance and reporting practices of 

Keppel’s associated companies, suppliers, 

contractors and any third parties mentioned 

in the Report. The position statements, the 

statements for the management approach, 

case studies and examples are excluded 

from the scope of our work. We did not 

interview external stakeholders as part 

of this assurance engagement.

The reported disclosures related to economic 

performance are based on the financial 

disclosures and data, which were cross-checked

with internal documents and the audited 

consolidated financial statements for 

transcription and aggregation errors. Limited 

depth of evidence gathering, including 

inquiry and analytical procedures and 

limited sampling at lower levels in Keppel 

were applied as per the agreed scope of 

engagement. The data for environmental 

and social performance is verified with 

random samples of data, and the aggregated 

data at the corporate level is used for the 

verification. The procedures performed 

in a limited level of assurance engagement 

vary in nature and timing and are less in 

extent than for a reasonable/high level 

of assurance engagement. We expressly 

disclaim any liability or co-responsibility 

for any decision a person or an entity may 

make based on this Assurance Statement.

STATEMENT OF COMPETENCE

AND INDEPENDENCE

DNV GL applies its own management 

standards and compliance policies for 

quality control, in accordance with

ISO/IEC 17021:2015 - Conformity 

Assessment Requirements for bodies 

providing audit and certification of 

management systems, and accordingly 

maintains a comprehensive system of 

quality control including documented 

policies and procedures regarding 

compliance with ethical requirements, 

professional standards and applicable 

legal and regulatory requirements. We 

have complied with the DNV GL Code of 

Conduct4 during the assurance engagement 

and maintain independence where required 

by relevant ethical requirements. This 

engagement work was carried out by 

an independent team of sustainability 

assurance professionals. DNV GL was not 

involved in the preparation of any statements 

or data included in the Report except for this 

Assurance Statement. DNV GL maintains 

complete impartiality towards stakeholders 

interviewed during the assurance process. 

DNV GL did not provide any services to 

Keppel during 2019 that could compromise 

the independence or impartiality of our work.

SCOPE, BOUNDARY AND 

LIMITATIONS OF VERIFICATION

The scope of work agreed upon with 

Keppel includes the following:

• Verification of the GHG emissions

(Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3) 

in accordance with the requirements 

of CDP:

 – The Scope 1 emissions arising from:

a) diesel consumption in the 

diesel generating (DG) sets 

owned or operated by Keppel;

b) diesel fuel consumption in 

owned and leased vehicles 

of Keppel;

c) liquefied petroleum 

gas consumption;

d) naphtha consumption;

e) piped natural gas consumption;

f) compressed natural 

gas consumption;

g) acetylene consumption; and

h) refrigerant consumption –

R123, R134A, R22, R407C, R410A.

 – The Scope 2 emissions arising from 

use of purchased electricity;

 – The Scope 3 emissions arising from 

a consequence of the activities of the 

Company but occurring from sources 

not owned or controlled by the 

Company, such as business travel2 

and equity investment companies3. 

For carbon emissions calculation 

under Scope 3 emissions, Keppel 

Corporation accounts for the 

proportional emissions of Scope 1 

and 2 emissions of its investments 

as its Scope 3 emissions.

• Site visits to the sampled Keppel 

facilities in Singapore; and

• Verification of the Company's 

protocols, processes, management 

approach and controls related to 

the collection and collation of the 

GHG emission data.

The organisational boundary as set 

out by Keppel covers facilities in 

Singapore, Australia, Brazil, Germany, 

Hong Kong, United States and the

Asia-Pacific region, where Keppel has 

operational control. During the process

of verification, we did not come across 

any limitations to the agreed scope

of work.

VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY

The verification was conducted by DNV GL 

in accordance with the requirements set out 

in DNV GL Verisustain, for a moderate level 

of verification. As part of the verification 

process, we obtained an understanding of 

the systems used to generate, aggregate 

and report GHG emission data, and the

GHG data management system of Keppel.

We also tested the Completeness, Accuracy 

and Reliability of the data.

During the verification engagement, 

we have taken a risk-based approach, and 

we have verified the GHG assertion made 

in the Report and assessed the robustness 

of the underlying data management system, 

information flow and controls.

We carried out the following activities:

• Desk review of Keppel’s reported 

emissions provided to us in

spreadsheets to select sample sites 

for onsite and offsite verification;

• Management interaction to review 

data management systems of Keppel 

including review of data completeness, 

emission factors used and

assumptions applied (data related to 

electricity from grid, DG), diesel 

consumption in DG sets owned or 

operated by Keppel and, diesel 

consumption in owned/leased vehicles, 

consumption of liquefied petroleum

gas, naphtha, piped natural gas, 

compressed natural gas and acetylene 

and refrigerant usage (R123, R134A,

R22, R407C, R410A) for its operations, 

and business travel;

• Onsite verification of data aggregation 

systems and related evidences related

to Scope 1 emissions, Scope 2

emissions reported for sample

locations at Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine 

(Keppel FELS Limited); Scope 3

emissions reported for sample location

at Keppel Infrastructure (Senoko 

Waste-to-Energy Plant);

• Desk review verification of emissions 

data for sample sites located at Keppel 

Telecommunications &amp; Transportation 

and Keppel Land; and

• Review of feedback from Keppel on 

reported observations arising from onsite 

and offsite verification.

INTRODUCTION

DNV GL Business Assurance Singapore Pte. Ltd.

(‘DNV GL’) has been commissioned by the 

management of Keppel Corporation Ltd. 

(“Keppel”, Company Registration Number:

196800351N) Singapore to carry out 

verification of Greenhouse Gases (“GHGs”) 

emissions assertions as part of its sustainability 

reporting and as part of the Company’s 

Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”) response. 

The verification exercise was carried out for 

the Company’s GHG assertions for the period 

from 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. 

This verification provides a moderate level 

of assurance as per DNV GL VerisustainTM1 

and applies a ±5% uncertainty threshold 

towards errors and omissions.

Keppel is responsible for the collection, 

analysis, aggregation and presentation of 

data and information based on an operational 

control approach under the GHG Protocol. 

The GHG conversion factors for direct (Scope 1) 

emissions, as well as Global Warming Potential 

values used are based on the United Kingdom’s 

DEFRA 2015 Government GHG Conversion 

Factors for Company Reporting (Scope 1). 

The GHG conversion factors for indirect 

(Scope 2) emissions are based on the 

Electricity Grid Emission Factor for 2018 

from Singapore’s Energy Market Authority 

and Grid Emission Factor for International 

Energy Agency 2017. Carbon emissions from 

the incineration of waste (Scope 3) are based 

on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 

GHG Inventories (Volume 5 – Waste) and 

emissions from business travel are 

calculated based on the International Civil 

Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s online 

Carbon Emissions Calculator.

Our responsibility of performing this work 

is to the management of Keppel only and 

in accordance with terms of reference 

agreed with the Company. The verification 

engagement is based on the assumption 

that the data and information provided 

to us is complete, sufficiently true and free 

from misstatements. DNV GL disclaims 

any liability or co-responsibility for any 

decision a person or entity would make 

based on this verification statement. 

The verification was carried out during 

March to April 2020 as part of verification 

of sustainability report disclosures.

CONCLUSION

On the basis of our verification methodology, 

nothing has come to our attention that 

would cause us not to believe that the GHG 

assertions below are not a fair representation 

of Keppel’s GHG Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 

emission assertions. Some data inaccuracies 

identified for the sampled sites during 

the verification process were found to be 

attributable to transcription, interpretation 

and aggregation errors, and the errors have 

been communicated for correction and 

were corrected by Keppel.

INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION STATEMENT


Corporate Citizenship is a global consulting firm which specialises in responsible and 

sustainable business and manages the LBG Framework. Corporate Citizenship has been 

commissioned by Keppel Corporation to perform independent external assurance on the 

company’s use of the LBG Framework to measure and report on its corporate community 

investment (CCI) activities, occurring between January 2019 and December 2019.

The LBG Framework helps businesses measure, manage and report their CCI activities. 

It moves beyond charitable donations to include the full range of contributions, or inputs, 

made to community causes (including time, in-kind and management costs, and cash 

donations). It also assesses the actual results for the community and for the business, 

also known as outputs and impacts. (See www.lbg-online.net for more information).

The purpose of our assurance engagement has been to assess whether or not the 

LBG Framework, and its principles, are correctly and consistently applied by Keppel 

Corporation in its reporting.

The scope of the LBG assurance covers the information presented in the Communities 

section of Keppel Corporation’s Sustainability Report for 2019, on pages 71 to 81. The scope 

of the assurance included the following data and KPIs:

• Inputs: e.g. Volunteer hours, number of volunteers, donations/sponsorships; and

• Outputs: e.g. Number of beneficiaries served.

The assurance engagement was undertaken at a limited level and involved the 

following activities:

• Management interviews with key persons responsible for community investment activities 

to understand the process for collecting, validating and consolidating the data;

• A site visit to verify the internal systems and procedures for collecting, validating and 

consolidating the data; and

• Checks on the accuracy and consistency of the data presented in this report on 

pages 71-81.

As a result of our work, we are satisfied, based on the limited scope described above, that 

Keppel Corporation has sufficiently applied the LBG Framework in its reporting. Our work 

has not extended to an independent audit of the data presented in this report.
