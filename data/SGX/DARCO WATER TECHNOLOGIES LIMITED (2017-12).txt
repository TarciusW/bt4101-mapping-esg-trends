CHAIRMAN’S 

STATEMENT 

 

 

 

 

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS, 

 

 

On behalf of our Board of Directors, it is my pleasure to present our 

Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 

(“FY2017”). 

 

Darco is always determined to make a positive impact to the environment by 

providing comprehensive solutions to our customers. As the economy 

developed, the Group diligently kept pace with the changing demands of 

different industries and strived to enhance its engineering capability in the 

environmental protection industry.  

 

Today, apart from designing, manufacturing and servicing water and 

wastewater systems for a wide range of industries, including electronics, 

petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and food and beverage, the Group has since 

evolved into an integrated environmental solutions provider. 

 

In this year’s report, we will focus on the sustainability aspects of Wuhan Kaidi, 

one of the largest contributors to the Group’s 2017 results. In view of huge 

business opportunities in the growing China market, the Group has acquired an 

additional 12% of the total equity interest in Wuhan Kaidi, bringing the Group’s 

shareholdings to 72%. 

 

Since incorporation, Wuhan Kaidi has always focused its corporate 

responsibility to ensure that wastewater is properly treated and clean drinking 

water is available to the people, by extending their business scope and 

investing in new technologies.

CHAIRMAN’S 

STATEMENT 

 

 

 

 

Faced with ever increasing world populations, rural areas are fast 

becoming urbanised and cities around the world are faced with mounting 

challenges to support the influx. Having access to clean and safe drinking 

water, as well as proper treatment of wastewater, is imperative for a stable 

society and economic development. 

 

To further this cause, Wuhan Kaidi has completed more than 600 water 

treatment projects in the power, municipal, steel metallurgy, petrochemical, 

coal chemical, paper, food, pharmaceutical and other industries, and holds 

more than 20 proprietary and patented technologies with independent 

intellectual property rights. 

 

Lastly, we wish to confirm that the Board has considered sustainability 

issues as part of its strategic formulation, determined the material 

environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors and overseen the 

management and monitoring of the material ESG factors. 

 

At Darco, we will continue to be committed to providing sustainable 

technologies and solutions to provide safeguard our water supply and 

environment for our future generations.

APPROACH TO 

SUSTAINABILITY 

 

 

 

 

Sustainability Materiality Matrix 

 

We recognise the need to continuously develop our responsible business approach in order to address growing 

stakeholder expectations around our impact on the environment, economy and society. As such, we periodically 

consult with our stakeholders to determine the issues that are most relevant to them and Darco. Some of our 

stakeholder’s comments can be found in Appendix B. 

 

Using a materiality index, we align our responsible business priorities with Darco’s principal business and 

operational risks. We have also developed metrics to help us measure our progress, as indicated in our 

sustainability scorecard in Appendix A. We will review and adjust the matrix each year, as the external and 

business context changes.

OUR 

PERFORMANCE 

 

 

 

 

How We Measure Our Performance 

 

Our sustainability strategy is embedded into the appropriate parts of our business, with dedicated teams for each 

focus area, and coordination by our relevant departmental managers. 

 

Progress will be tracked in two key ways: measuring performance against metrics, and evaluating how well the 

programs have advanced, through a series of ‘commitments’.  

 

Metrics and Targets 

 

We have established key performance indicators for each of the three focus areas outlined in our sustainability 

strategy. As this is our first year adopting sustainability reporting, we will be establishing targets within the next 

year to hold ourselves accountable and track how we are doing. 

 

Periodically, we plan to introduce new metrics and update targets to ensure alignment with our strategy. 

 

Commitments 

 

To ensure we have a robust sustainability program in place, we will also publish the key initiatives we plan to 

implement within the next year.

Case Studies: Water Treatment 

 

 

 

Seawater Desalination 

 

Completed in 2015, the China Resources Haifeng Power Plant Desalination EPC Project has 

an operational capability of 21,600 m3/day. 

 

This is the first seawater desalination project using the EPC model in China. The project uses 

multi-layer and multi-grid horizontal filters in the filtration process. 

 

 

 

Zero Discharge System 

 

Utilising the patented VCC One-Step!™ technology from the United States, the Tianjin 

Beijiang Power Plant Wastewater Desulphurisation Zero Discharge Project is designed to 

process sulphurised wastewater at a rate of 24 m3/hour. 

 

After undergoing a precipitation and filtration process, the treated sulphurised wastewater will 

be passed through the VACOM evaporative crystallisation system to produce the crystalline 

salt and water, which will be recycled. 

 

 

 

Municipal Wastewater 

 

Commencing construction in 2015, the Yinchuan Binhe New District Sewage Treatment Plant 

(Phase 1) has a total operational capacity of 50,000 tonnes/day. This operational capacity is 

expected to reach 150,000 tonnes/day in 2030.
