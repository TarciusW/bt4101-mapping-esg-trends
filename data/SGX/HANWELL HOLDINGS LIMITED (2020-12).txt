SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 4

BACK TO

It is a great privilege to have Mr Goi Seng Hui joined 

Hanwell Holdings Limited recently as our Non-

Executive Chairman. I wish to take this opportunity 

to welcome him as a board member and look forward 

to building a professional relationship with him. Mr 

Goi has a remarkable track record in both business, 

public as well as community services. We hope to 

learn and tap into his wealth of experience including 

his excellent business network to broaden and 

deepen the Company’s next phase of development.

This past fiscal year has been an eye opener on 

both the business and social fronts. Working closely 

with our suppliers, stakeholders and customers to 

achieve a safer and more sustainable environment in 

the midst of a pandemic, we saw more camaraderie 

that was intense and humbling. This report covers 

all the standard topics of our environmental impact 

and corporate governance, as well as our approach 

and conduct in operations as we fought against 

COVID-19.

As we build and strengthen our relationship with  each 

one of our internal and external stakeholders, we are  

constantly reminded of how we need to reflect and 

improve our corporate governance, environmental 

sustainability, 

social 

responsibility 

practices 

across all our CSR pillars. While shareholders 

understandably favour market presence  and 

economic growth, employees and customers, have 

increasing expectations of how our business affects 

society and even our planet.

 

Board Statement (102-14, 102-15)

OVERVIEW

While the circuit breaker (stay-at-home order) and 

nation-wide lockdown were implemented, we 

continued to offer and maintain job opportunities, as 

well as a comfortable and safe commute for our staff. 

We also offered opportunities for them to develop 

their digital technology skills so they may work more 

efficiently and be future-ready.

In the wider community where our farmers, 

employees and customers reside, we take a holistic 

approach to include initiatives such as volunteerism, 

pollution, and food waste  reduction, and donations 

(both monetary and in-kind). We saw more than 5,000 

hours put in by our volunteers at food distribution 

events and over $20,000 raised through such 

initiatives that also encouraged family togetherness 

and community service.

There is much more to be done in living up to our 

environmental, social and governance obligations. 

Addressing these aspects will take time, particularly 

in pandemic situations. We take your feedback 

and views seriously so we may safeguard both our 

ambitions for the earth and the communities. Thank 

you for your continuous support.

Dr John Chen Seow Phun

Deputy Chairman

Reporting Standards

GRI Standards (102-54)

This report has been prepared in accordance with 

the GRI Standards: Core option. It also complies 

with SGX-ST Listing Rules 711 (A) and (B).

We have chosen to report using the GRI standards 

as it is an internationally recognised reporting 

framework that covers a comprehensive range 

of sustainability disclosures. Furthermore, the 

structured framework promotes reporting a full and 

balanced picture of Hanwell’s material concerns and 

the management of its impact.

This Report has been prepared in accordance to the 

GRI Standards: Core Option.

External Assurance (102-56)

The disclosures in this report are not externally 

assured.

Reporting Boundaries (102-46, 103-1)

Following GRI Standards, we applied five main 

principles to determine reporting the Report content:

1. Stakeholder inclusiveness: stakeholders to be 

involved in the reporting process, starting from 

report contents

2. Determination: to collect feedback on published 

reports.

3. Materiality: report to contain material topics that 

are needed by stakeholders in making decisions.

4. Sustainability 

context: 

report 

to 

include 

sustainability issues that are relevant to the 

publisher of the report.

5. Completeness: report to be prepared with a clear 

scope of reporting period and supported by 

complete data that are relevant to the scope and 

reporting period.

last report in May 2020. This Report covers the sustainability performance of our headquarters in Singapore 

and our key subsidiaries, Topseller Pte Ltd (“Topseller”), Fortune Food Manufacturing Pte Ltd (“Fortune 

Food”) and Tipex Pte Ltd (“Tipex”) for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). 

No restatements have been made from the previous report and there were no significant changes to the 

organisation and our supply chain during this reporting cycle.

Reporting Scope

Reporting Approach and Framework

Disclosures revolve around the value chains in our 

key business segments including Topseller, Tipex 

and Fortune Food. We have prioritised our scope of 

reporting as follows:

1. Brands that have the greatest impact to the 

Group’s revenues.

2. Activities that contribute to our product brand 

equity.

3. Industry standards that are considered important 

by stakeholders such as customers, principals, 

suppliers and shareholders.

Responding to COVID-19

The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve and 

the Group is committed to stay resilient with our 

safety measures being promptly put in place as 

safeguards and for monitoring purposes. Protecting 

our employees during this COVID-19 pandemic is of 

utmost importance to us because at Hanwell, people 

are our greatest assets. 

Hanwell fully understands the obligations of 

workplace safety and health (“WSH”) and we want 

to put  the safety and health of our employees 

and visitors as our priority, especially during  this 

unprecedented time. We abide by the requirements 

imposed by authorities such as the Ministry of 

Manpower, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Trade 

and Industry to mitigate the risks of further outbreaks. 

While keeping a keen eye on our business 

objectives, we require everyone to comply with 

safe management measures including working from 

home if not involved in essential services. Moving 

forward, we continue to identify and evaluate areas 

for changes to people, process, and technology, 

striving to enhance sustainability in both our local 

community and the sustainability of our suppliers – 

the agricultural farmers.

Our Sustainability Framework (102-49)

Sustainability Commitment

As a leading FMCG company, our mission is to be 

sustainable in providing the best in daily essentials to 

our customers. Our sustainability framework focuses 

on four key pillars: Supply Chain Sustainability, 

Reducing Footprint, Our People, Our Assets and 

Commitment to Customers &amp; Community.

It is our responsibility to constantly review our 

sustainability strategy, identify and evaluate the 

risks, opportunities and challenges posed by the 

macro environment with care, caution and prudence.

In FY 2020, apart from the COVID-19 situation that 

is still evolving globally, on-going tensions between 

China and the United States of America, Japan 

and South Korea, as well as the effects of Brexit 

have resulted in subdued growth in the region. 

Notwithstanding these challenges, the Group will 

continue to look beyond its current markets, exercise 

vigilance on its financial and non-financial exposure, 

leverage more on automation and digital solutions 

to be manpower-smart and lean whilst focusing on 

our key pillars. This ensures that we stay resilient 

and agile in the face of a myriad of threats, including 

climate change, protectionism and the on-going 

COVID-19 outbreak.

SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

Pillar 1: 

Accountable to Society

Corporate Social Responsibility

Our studies have shown that consumers relate 

better to brands and companies that are socially 

responsible and active in contributing back to 

society, particularly in a pandemic crisis such as the 

on-going COVID-19 outbreak. In the second quarter 

of 2020, a joint effort between Singapore Press 

Holdings, MediaCorp and Topseller sponsored more 

than 10,000 packets of rice and oil items as part of 

our Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives.

When supply and demand altered in the face of 

coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, though our 

deliveries increased, so did our carbon emissions. 

Hanwell will be partnering Shell for Corporate Social 

Responsibility and Sustainability activities.

Sustainability

As awareness is raised on sustainability, consumers 

are more inclined to purchase from companies 

that are socially and environmentally responsible. 

Topseller strives to align to these values  and Royal 

Umbrella continues with its sustainability project 

with the rice farmers by actively transforming their 

packaging materials to be environmentally friendly 

and recyclable.

Our Vision:

To be a multi-faceted consumer essentials company with strategic investments in the region

Pillar 3: 

Adapting to Challenges

Employment

As border controls are tightened during this 

pandemic, we are working with the Food, Drinks and 

Allied Workers Union (“FDAWU”), Employment and 

Employability Institute (“e2i”), and the NTUC Job 

Securing Council to ensure that sufficient resources 

and job opportunities are made available to the 

locals rank-and-file (RnF) members.

Diversification

It is was essential for Fortune Food to diversify its 

business-to-business export market to reach out to 

new markets and segments during this pandemic. 

With more people turning to home cooking whilst 

COVID-19 was rampaging with no signs of easing. 

Fortune Food’s products saw an overwhelming 

surge in demand. Our focus thus shifted to optimally 

adding daily production capacity.

Socma Trading in Malaysia included more essential 

items, for example biscuits, cooking condiments and 

wet wipes, in addition to its confectionery and snack 

products. Tipex saw continuous online sales and 

expanded its offerings to include essential products 

like sanitisers and antibacterial wipes, lotions and 

antibacterial facial tissues.

Strengthen Supply Chain 

To better prepare ourselves in these challenging 

times, we sought better control of our supply 

chain to minimise potential disruptions and ensure 

reliability. Fortune Food is currently sourcing for local 

alternatives that can provide technical solutions to 

support our supply chain.

Tipex will conduct access risks with our key suppliers 

to identify possible indirect exposures. Tipex will 

take on proactive actions to address issues, e.g. 

alternative shipping plan via sea rather than land in 

the event of a lockdown in Malaysia.

As the pandemic unfolded, the demand for essential 

foods skyrocketed. We deeply appreciate our 

excellent relationships with Topseller’s Thai suppliers 

who ensured the fast supply of rice to meet the 

market demand. Topseller increased its supply from 

5 to 7 regions with  two or more suppliers in each 

region. This secures a continuous supply within 

the domestic market when a lockdown arises in a 

specific region.

Adjusting Buffer Capacities

In the event of a potential lockdown leading up to 

a surge in demand of essential food commodities, 

Socma and Fortune Food are working closely with 

their principals to increase buffer stock of raw 

materials, and packaging materials. Topseller has 

alternative supply channels from an additional two 

regions to ensure that demand in the domestic 

market can be met.

Embracing Technology

Over the years, Hanwell continues to embrace 

technological advancement to increase workplace 

safety and customer experience. Aside from using 

drones to ease stocktaking, Hanwell integrated an 

online platform for contactless interaction between 

our customers and sales staff. It featured live 

transactional information such as customer profile, 

orders and collection status made readily available  

with internet connections.

As the use of videotelephony and online chats 

increase, we aim to heighten the online experience 

with video and mobile video conference systems in 

meeting rooms, ultimately saving on International 

Direct Dial telephone costs.

Hanwell continues to refine its well-tested I.T. 

Infrastructure to support the technologies used 

during the Work-From-Home phase.     

Moving forward on e-Commerce, Topseller extended 

its distribution channels from RedMart and Amazon 

to Shopee, Qoo10 and Food Panda for the 

Singapore market. As the trend of online  shopping 

increases, Topseller has shifted more marketing 

and promotional efforts towards achieving greater 

online presence. At the same time, discussions on 

launching Topsellershop online are in progress. 

Tipex continues to strengthen its online business 

and improve its brand image to garner more leads 

by engaging consumers with loyalty discounts and 

contests.

Finances

At Hanwell, we make it paramount to develop realistic 

targets based on current and historical trading 

activities and trends to align and achieve budget 

results. We continue to monitor our key performance 

indicators to measure against actual results.

need to cater to specific situations and we inform the 

process owners accordingly.

To 

maintain 

a 

stable 

financial 

infrastructure, 

Hanwell established cross-training among process 

owners and initiated regular communications with 

management to monitor the impacts to the entity in 

upcoming financial reporting periods.

Cybersecurity

As our dependence on internet connectivity, software 

and 

hardware 

applications 

grows, 

managing 

cybersecurity risks continue to be our top priority. 

In bid to strengthen our cybersecurity practices 

and meet new threats arising from technologies 

we use. We implemented additional cybersecurity 

measures for employees working from home. One 

such measure was for the office to provide encrypted 

connections to all remote users who in turn were 

strongly advised to lock their screens or disconnect 

from the office’s internet when they do not need to 

access it. To reinforce the measures, remote access 

logs are checked and verified daily, and the support 

team remains on standby for any service disruption 

or possible breach of security barriers.

Business Ethics and Compliance

In 2020, Hanwell had no incident of non-compliance 

with socio-economic laws and regulations. These 

included those that applied to marketing and 

advertising practices where violation breaches would 

result in significant fines or non-monetary sanctions 

against the Company.

The Board and Senior Management are committed to 

conducting business that is ethical and in compliance 

with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. 

The Board consists of six directors with experience 

and in-depth knowledge of business management, 

banking and finance, IT, engineering, mathematics, 

economics and industry knowledge. These directors 

uphold the Nominating Committee’s (“NC”) criteria 

on appropriate good governance practices needed 

to support and guide the handling of our corporate 

affairs, independent of our Management, so as to 

ensure transparency, traceability and accountability.

The make-up of the Board reflects inclusivity of 

gender, age, skills and expertise, ensuring a range 

of perspectives and insights for a holistic approach. 

A graphic presentation of Board diversity by gender 

and age can be found in this Sustainability Report. 

The Board Diversity Policy was adopted on 9 

November  2018 to assist the NC and the Board in 

identifying prospective Directorship candidates. 

The Board comprises of at least one 

director each in the age group of his/her 

forties, fifties and sixties respectively

*One female Executive Director in 

recognition of the importance of gender 

diversity and positive impact on making 

balanced decisions.

SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

In the nomination and selection process of directors, 

the NC considers prospective candidates based 

on factors such as merit, character, competencies, 

track record, and background as well as integrity, 

commitment, relevant experience, qualifications 

and skills to carry out their duties effectively. We 

believe an effective board requires directors to 

come from diverse backgrounds so that we can 

cultivate an inclusive culture that welcomes different 

perspectives, free from bias and discrimination.

The NC is mindful of related regulatory requirements 

(including the Listing Rules issued by the Singapore 

Exchange Securities Trading Limited and the Code 

of Corporate Governance 2018), and gives due 

consideration to characteristics such as gender, age, 

ethnicity, disability and geographic representation, 

which contribute to board diversity.

In addition to conducting its own search and selection 

process, the NC may engage qualified independent 

advisors 

to 

assist 

in 

identifying 

prospective 

candidates for directorship who meet the criteria as 

determined by the NC and that support Hanwell’s 

diversity objectives. In this respect, at least 10% of 

the total number of board seats have been reserved 

for women and that the composition of the board 

shall comprise at least one director in their forties, 

fifties and sixties respectively. These objectives 

will be reviewed by the NC when necessary and 

changes to the policy will be recommended where 

appropriate.

*Following the cessation of Dr Allan Yap as the 

Executive Chairman of the Board, the NC, in 

consultation with the Board, will be taking steps to 

find either internally or externally someone qualified 

to fill the vacancy.

In implementing this policy, the NC will take into 

account the Company’s diversity objectives and the 

diverse nature of the business environment in which 

the Company operates whilst maintaining flexibility 

in addressing succession planning. This ensures the 

Company continues to attract and retain qualified 

individuals to serve on the board. Adherence to 

the Board Diversity Policy will form part of the 

annual performance of the board and/or the board 

committees of the Company and shall be read in 

conjunction with the prevailing terms of reference of 

the NC

Fair Employment Practices

Hanwell is a signatory of the Employers’ Pledge of 

Fair Employment Practices with the Tripartite Alliance 

for Fair Employment Practices (“TAFEP”). TAFEP 

works with companies, government and unions to 

adopt and implement fair employment practices. 

PDPA

In compliance with the Singapore Personal Data 

Protection Act (No. 26 of 2012), we have a Privacy 

Policy that outlines how Hanwell handles personal 

data. Customers and business partners can contact 

Hanwell’s Data Protection Officer by mail, email and 

phone on matters concerning their personal data 

with Hanwell.

Anti-Corruption

The Group’s Code of Conduct for its directors, 

management 

and 

employees 

strictly 

prohibit 

involvement in corruption activities such as the 

acceptance of or giving bribes.

Whistle Blowing Policy

At Hanwell, we are committed to a high standard 

of business ethics and compliance. We established 

a Whistle Blowing Policy to provide a platform for 

employees and external parties to raise concerns 

and confidential feedback while offering them 

reassurance that they will be protected from reprisals 

or victimisation for whistle blowing in good faith. For 

more information of our policy, please refer to: http://

Stakeholder Groups

Principle 13 of the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2018

The Board adopts an inclusive approach by 

considering and balancing the needs and interests 

of material stakeholders, as part of its overall 

responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the 

company are served.

The Company takes a strategic and pragmatic 

approach in managing stakeholders’ expectations 

to support its long-term strategy. A sustainability 

governance framework was put in place to identify, 

engage with, and manage the material environment, 

social 

and 

governance 

factors 

important 

to 

stakeholders and to the Group.

As a leading FMCG company listed on the Singapore 

Exchange, the Company prides itself in its ability to 

create sustainable value through numerous business 

activities with our stakeholders. Sustainability, in the 

manner to which the Company conducts its day-to-

day dealings with customers, suppliers, employees 

and society, has consistently been one of the key 

corporate values motivating and inspiring us to do 

our best. Accordingly, this Sustainability Report 

would be announced through SGXNet in May 2021.

The Corporate Governance Report 2020 alongside 

this Sustainability Report, together with the Annual 

Report 2020, aims to provide comprehensive 

and transparent reporting of the Group’s overall 

objectives and performance to the Company’s 

stakeholders. The Company welcomes feedback 

on this Sustainability Report and its sustainability 

performance. Please address all feedback to 

Investor Relations, which can be found at the 

Company corporate website at the URL http:// www.

hanwell.com.sg that is maintained to communicate 

and engage with stakeholders.

More information on the Company’s material 

stakeholders, sustainability efforts (including its 

strategy and key areas of focus), and performance 

can be found in the Company’s Sustainability Report 

uploaded at the Company’s corporate website.

The key stakeholders that we engage are the groups 

that our business has a significant impact on, and 

those with a vested interest in our operations. By 

assessing the significance and impact of their 

interest on our businesses, we have identified eight 

key stakeholder groups.

REGULATORS 

Beyond regulatory 

compliance, we partner 

with government agencies 

to jointly raise industry 

standards for food and 

product safety, food security 

and other sustainability 

practices, as well as 

workplace safety and health 

standards.

INDUSTRY BODIES 

(eg Forest Stewardship Council)

Our business activities have 

economic, environmental, 

and social impacts on the 

communities where we 

operate. Therefore, it is 

critical that we work with 

Industry bodies to promote 

sustainability in our value 

chain.

EMPLOYEES

Our employees’ performance 

is key to our success. 

Their health and safety, 

competencies, welfare, and 

professional development

performance. We aim to 

develop their potential to 

drive innovation, productivity 

and organisational excellence

SUPPLIERS

(eg rice mills and manufacturers)

We work closely with our 

suppliers in our value chain  

to ensure that our products 

conform with industry safety 

standards, to improve  

product range and to reduce 

risks related to sustainability 

issues.

CUSTOMERS

(hotels &amp; supermarkets) &amp; Civil 

Society (e.g. retail consumers)

are crucial to our business 

success. We strive to create

multitude of grass roots via 

events that help bring positive

Programmes for Upgrading 

Employee Skills, Transition 

Assistance Programmes and 

Performance Review (404-2, 404-3)

We conduct the Training Needs Analysis (“TNA”) to 

tighten the competency gaps for departments and 

plan for employee’s training programmes around 

relevant up-skilling opportunities. In doing so, it 

aligns employees’ competencies, job function and 

the company’s strategies.

Our trainings is generic with a focus on technical 

skills-based training which helps our staff develop 

holistically, attuning effortlessly to new job demands. 

Examples of the courses we provide include PDPA 

as well as the Workplace Safety &amp; Health.

To support scholastic upgrading, we sponsor fees 

for employees who wish to further their studies. 

Depending on the circumstance and their need, the 

sponsorships may be partial or full.

 

In the event of a company restructuring, we also 

provide our employees with transition assistance 

programmes. Other than the severance pay 

package, where the service length of the affected 

employee is taken into account, we engage the 

assistance of e2i to help our affected Singaporeans 

and  Singapore  Permanent  Resident  workers   on 

employment opportunities and their training needs. 

Affected employees can tap into the programmes 

and initiatives to better understand their career 

options and/or take up employability skills courses 

for upgrading.

Our employees receive regular feedback from their 

supervisors on their work performance and we have 

a 100% participant rate in our annual performance 

review for all employee categories.

COVID-19 

Our employees’ health and safety remain on the top 

of our priorities as we push to sustain our businesses 

during this pandemic.

Measures:

• 

Work-from-home arrangements and 

empowering staff with the necessary tools

• 

Social distancing and monitoring measures 

to ensure safety of employees such as 

temperature screenings throughout the day 

• 

Rigorous cleaning and disinfecting of the 

offices, manufacturing and warehousing 

facilities that are open

Technologies:

Replacement for Fingerprint Door Access Devices 

Our human resources team had activated employee 

cards for our employees to access our office space, 

replacing the former Fingerprint Door Access service 

to reduce contact points.

High Volume Low Speed (HVLS) fan

HVLS fans are efficient and cost-effective in ventilating 

warehouses. They maintain good air quality, making 

it more comfortable for our employees working at 

our warehouses. In Singapore, we installed 6 HLVS 

fans in our Rice Stockpile and 2 fans in our Dry 

Warehouse to combating the heat and humidity as 

employees don their masks throughout the day.

Hiring Special Needs (413-1)

Our corporate citizenship initiative saw a tie up 

with Association for Persons with Special Needs 

(“ASPN”) to provide employment opportunities for 

the less fortunate. Since joining Fortune Food back 

in 2014, two special needs employees have thrived 

and are currently part of our permanent staff count. 

ASPN conducted a sharing session for relevant 

Fortune Food Manufacturing staff to help them 

understand the working styles and needs of their 

colleagues from ASPN. We are glad to report that 

both of them have coped well with the work-from-

home arrangements.

Workplace Safety

The health and safety of our employees are our 

utmost priority and we continue to ramp up our 

efforts in workplace safety. To prevent workplace 

injuries, we invested in back 

support belts for employees 

who lift heavy items and 

blue 

safety 

lights 

were 

installed in our forklifts and 

reach trucks. At Fortune 

Foods, production staff now 

don steel toe gumboots for 

added protection

In 2019, our Singapore 

office’s pilot programme of 

using drones to conduct 

bi-annual stock check was 

operationally 

successful 

in reducing the duration of 

stock-taking, 

manpower 

costs 

and 

workplace 

injury. Improvements were 

implemented 

as 

drones 

were 

upgraded 

and 

monitored.

Reducing Carbon Footprint (302-1, 

302-2, 302-3, 303-4, 305-2, 305-5)

We continue to be mindful of our environmental 

footprint, actively monitoring and working towards 

reducing our carbon footprint. The Group diligently 

tracks our energy and water consumptions over the 

years to minimise wastage:

Environmentally Friendly Vehicles

In 2020, we replaced nine of our existing trucks with 

new Euro VI Emission Standard trucks – six chilled 

12-footer trucks under Topseller and one 10-footer 

truck under Tipex.

We have a total of 19 new Euro VI Emission Standard 

trucks with 13 chilled 12-footer trucks under 

Topseller, two 24-footer trucks, two 14-footer trucks 

and three 14-footer truck and one 10-footer truck 

under Tipex.

Ozone Friendly Aircon Condenser

We replaced our existing R22 aircon condenser to 

a more environmentally friendly R-410A condenser 

which is more energy-efficient. As the production of 

the R22 is being phased out, spare parts may become 

niched to being obsolete, posing a challenge for 

future sourcing and pricing. It would be more cost-

effective to have them replaced. 

Solar Panel (305-5)

To increase our use in renewable energy and 

reduce our dependency on fossil fuel consumption, 

Photovoltaic (“PV”) panels were installed on 

Singapore office rooftops, currently supplying 

electricity to three blocks on our premise. The 

installation of solar panels helps us offset an 

equivalent of 606’410 kg CO2 in one year* or an 

equivalent of 27,564 trees**.

*0.4313kg CO2/kWh x 1’406’000kWh = 606’410kg CO2

** assuming 22kg of CO2 per tree annually

Supply Chain (102-9)

Topseller’s distribution network covers supermarkets, 

grocery stores, caterers, institutions, ship chandlers, 

hotels, restaurants, food courts, hawker centres and 

online retailers in Singapore.

Our main rice supplier is Charoen Pokphand 

Intertrade (“CP Intertrade”) from Thailand.

The Importance of Good 

Agricultural Practices (103-1)

Rice is the Group’s top selling FMCG product 

category with Royal Umbrella being our best-selling 

rice brand.

Global food supply chains are ever evolving, and 

it becomes increasingly complicated to track the 

source of food, given the different layers of the supply 

chain. Food traceability has also become increasingly 

important, depicted by three main reasons. Firstly, 

where food safety is concerned, companies should 

be able to quickly trace through the supply chain to 

ascertain the source of a food product. With public 

health and lives at stake, we believe that it is critical 

to do so effectively because it directly affects the 

livelihoods of industries, companies and employees. 

Secondly, 

more 

consumers 

are 

demanding 

transparency and accountability of their food: from 

where their food is sourced, how its growth and 

manufacturing is made sustainable, how they are 

transported, and even down to the nutrition content. 

Ultimately, as we deep dive into our supply chain, we 

can mitigate risks better.

Our main rice supplier, CP Intertrade, has successfully 

invested and improved its supply chain performance 

through switching up its suppliers and processes, 

training employees, and setting up monitoring 

and reporting mechanisms. CP Intertrade works 

closely with rice-growing communities among many 

initiatives to ensure their rice is grown sustainably.  

Their production process is fully compliant with 

GAP+ (Good Agricultural Practices Plus). GAP+ 

helps farmers upgrade their knowledge and skills in 

rice production and raise their standards of living, 

ultimately improving the quality of rice.

Responsible Sourcing (103-2)

Our 12 rice suppliers span across the world, from 

USA to India, Thailand, Vietnam and Japan. Thailand 

supplies the bulk of our rice stock and we work 

with our Thai suppliers closely. We keep them up to 

date on consumer and governmental requirements 

so that they are prepared for the changing needs. 

For example, our Thai rice suppliers are looking into 

using biodegradable plastics for their packaging.

We screen new suppliers to ensure they abide by the 

necessary food safety requirements such as Hazard 

Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”), 

British Retail Consortium (“BRC”) Global Standards, 

ISO9000. Our procurement officers also do on-site 

visits to review the safety and cleanliness of the 

factories, understand how they maintain hygiene 

standards in the premises and do thorough checks 

on staff welfare. 

Hanwell has been working closely with our long- 

term main rice supplier CP Intertrade in Thailand in 

the topics of food traceability and good agriculture 

practices. The Nahkon Luang Factory is certified 

under Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) from 

SGS (Thailand), HACCP and ISO 9001: 2008.

CP Intertrade also embarked on the Royal Umbrella 

Sustainability Rice Cultivation Campaign. Improving 

the well-being and livelihood of Thai Hom Mali rice 

farmers. Since 2016, the project has helped their 

community’s sustainability by ensuring that all 

the agricultural products from the rice farmers are 

quality controlled, environment-friendly and sold 

at a fair market price. The project aims to promote 

Agriculture Practice under GAP PLUS (Good 

Agriculture Practice Plus). The system is certified by 

the Rice Department, the Ministry of Agriculture and 

Cooperative. It has also been recognised for Quality 

Control, Food Safety, and Greenhouse gas emission 

reduction. To date, we have worked with 6,279 

agriculturists in the project covering a total land area 

of 153,527 Rai.

KEY SUMMARY - FORTUNE FOOD MANUFACTURING PTE LTD (102-1)

Activities, Primary Brands, 

Products, Services (102-2)

Fortune Food Manufacturing Pte Ltd (“Fortune 

Food”) specialises in the production of an extensive 

range of tofu, ranging from Traditional Chinese Tofu, 

Japanese Silken Tofu, Egg Tofu to Tau Kwa. These 

tofu varieties are marketed under the brand name of 

Fortune.

Countries of Operation (102-4), 

Markets Served (102-6), 

Supply Chain (102-9)

Fortune Food uses the finest beans from North 

America and eggs from local farms to produce 

our soya bean-based products. Our Singapore 

manufacturing facility is FSSC22000 certified. Our 

products are sold in local supermarkets, F&amp;B retail 

outlets and general trade outlets like provision shops 

and minimarts.

Food Quality and Safety (416-1)

We recognise food safety as one of our customers’ 

primary concerns. With the ever-changing food 

habits, complex supply chain and globalisation of 

our food supply, it is critical to strengthen food safety 

systems between suppliers and manufacturers. The 

Group views any incident of food contamination 

very seriously. We are mindful that our reputation, 

customer’s confidence, and loyalty is at stake should 

a product be recalled. Our brands will take a hit 

which ultimately translates into financial losses.

Fortune Food adheres to stringent food safety 

standards and complies with relevant food safety 

regulations. From raw material management, to 

production and process control, and finished goods 

assurance, we apply our quality standards based on 

a set of best practices and industry standards. Our 

factory in Singapore has attained the certification 

for HACCP and Food Safety System Certification 

(“FSSC”) 22000.

To maintain food quality and safety, as well as the 

flexibility to improve our product recipes and formula, 

we set up an alternative manufacturing plant in 

Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Having full control of our 

manufacturing facility enable us to efficiently cater 

to the evolving demand and needs of our customers 

more effectively.

The quality of our food ingredients is key to food 

safety. Foods and the ingredients in food products 

are increasingly grown, processed and consumed 

in different locations around the globe. We place 

stringent measures in selecting and picking only 

the best ingredients. Our beans from farms in North 

America are non-GMO certified and our eggs are 

locally farmed in Singapore. Our procurement 

officers conduct regular visits to the chicken farms 

to inspect the health of the chicken and quality of 

chicken feeds.

Considering the ageing population and the continual 

fight against diabetes, the Singapore government 

has been actively encouraging healthy living. Over 

the years, the Health Promotion Board (“HPB”) 

has created numerous initiatives and schemes to 

encourage Singaporeans to eat healthily. One such 

initiative is the ‘Healthier Choice’ symbol on packaged 

food products. This symbol identifies the products 

are a healthier option so consumers may make a 

more informed choice about their diet. Many of our 

tofu products have been marked as healthier choice 

products and all our products are preservative- free. In 

view of rising consumer awareness of the importance 

of good health, improved standards of living, as well 

as our government’s increasing emphasis on healthy 

eating, Fortune Food introduced several healthier 

choice products. One such product is our cholesterol 

free tofu product with DHA from vegetarian sources.

Responsible Sourcing (204-1)

Local production is an important secondary strategy 

in ensuring food supply resilience for Singapore. 

Today, our local farms produce 10% of the fish, 13% 

of the vegetables and 27% of the eggs we consume 

in Singapore. The Singapore Food Agency (“SFA”) 

has set the target for local foods to meet 30% of 

Singapore’s nutritional needs by 2030. Fortune Food 

continues to support local farmers to help achieve 

the “30 by 30” vision.

The eggs for our egg tofu are locally produced. One of 

our suppliers received the Certified Humane label by 

the American non-profit organisation Humane Farm 

Animal Care (“HFAC”). The eggs are responsibly 

produced and ethically farmed.  All eggs produced 

from Singapore farms are free from antibiotics as 

Singapore disallows the use of antibiotics on hens.

We help to sustain the local farming community and 

reduce our carbon footprint by purchasing eggs from 

local farmers. This aids our food traceability which 

boosts our customers’ confidence and allows us to 

manage our supply chain.

KEY SUMMARY - TIPEX PTE LTD (102-1)

Activities, Primary Brands, 

Products, Services (102-2)

Tipex is one of the major distributors of consumer 

tissue paper products in Singapore.  We own the local 

leading tissue paper brand Beautex, manufactured 

by its subsidiary Tips Industry (M) Sdn Bhd in 

Malaysia. Three new products were introduced in 

2020: Beautex Lotion Tissues, Beautex Antibacterial 

Tissues and Beautex Disposable Cloth-Like Kitchen 

Towel. Besides Beautex, Tipex also owns tissue 

paper brands Ichiryu, Mood, Hibis, Comfy and Parity.

Countries of Operation (102-4), 

Markets Served (102-6), 

Supply Chain (102-9)

Tipex’s distribution network covers supermarkets 

and hypermarkets, general retail trade, pharmacies, 

medical halls and institutions in both Singapore and 

Malaysia. In addition, Tipex’s products are exported 

to New York in USA, Netherlands, New Zealand, 

Brunei, Australia, Vietnam, Maldives, India and 

Philippines.

We have a factory in Malaysia under Tips Industry (M) 

Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tipex. The 

factory procures paper rolls and converts them into 

packaged tissue paper products.

Responsible Sourcing and 

Caring for the Environment (103-2)

Over the years, the recurring haze has cast a spotlight 

on sustainable sourcing for paper companies. We 

are fully aware that the pulp and paper industry 

play a critical role in shaping forests worldwide, as 

pulpwood is grown in a vast range of landscapes 

and societies. Living up to our responsibilities as an 

environmentally sensitive company, we take steps 

to ensure that all our supplies are purchased from 

sustainable sources. We buy paper that comes either 

from well-managed forests or from recycled material. 

Most of our virgin pulp jumbo roll suppliers are ISO 

9001, ISO 14001 and FSC-COC certified.

Forest 

Stewardship 

Council 

(“FSC”) 

is 

an 

independent, non-profit organisation that promotes 

the responsible management of the world’s forests. 

It provides an assurance that products such as wood 

and paper have been harvested in a socially and 

environmentally responsible manner. FSC Chain-

of-Custody certification traces the path of products 

from the initial source, through the supply chain and 

up to the end user.

Sourcing our paper sustainably directly contributes to 

environmental sustainability while strengthening our 

supply chain and building trust among consumers. 

Being environmentally conscious throughout our 

supply chain demonstrates our commitment to help 

prevent the loss of biodiversity and climate change 

caused by deforestation and will not harm the forests 

in our sourcing process.

Tips Industry Malaysia currently works with eight FSC 

pulp paper suppliers from the Southeast Asia region. 

We also purchase recycled paper from suppliers in 

the region. To ensure the authenticity of their claims, 

we request that suppliers produce official documents 

(e.g. Product certificate of analysis).

We treat the disposal of waste seriously as improper 

disposable methods can harm the environment and 

health of the community. At our Malaysian factory, we 

identify and classify waste into different categories. 

For waste containing hazardous elements or 

compounds, we dispose them as per Malaysia’s 

DOE – Environmental Quality (Scheduled Wastes) 

Regulation 2005.

At Tips Industry Malaysia, we believe the best 

method for the environment is in controlling and 

minimising paper waste. We adhere strictly to the 

ISO14001 Environmental Management System &amp; 

local environmental rules and regulations.

Product Labeling (417-1)

Our logos on our packaging inform consumers 

about our forest management certification schemes. 

According to a survey done by YouGov in November 

2017, 56% of Singaporeans believe businesses have 

a responsibility to prevent environmental damage2. 

This research indicates a considerable proportion of 

consumers giving weight to a brand’s ethics when 

making purchasing decisions. To ensure that paper, 

our main raw material, is from a sustainable source, 

we only buy FSC certified pulp paper. Other than 

product descriptions and usage of products, the 

FSC certification logo is displayed on our packaging

Care for Local Communities 

(413-1)

Art Competition and Philanthropy (201-1)

Beautex’s 12th “Life is Beautiful” Art Competition 

was unfortunately cancelled due to COVID-19. 

To continue and encourage a participative and 

positive community spirit, Beautex launched a newly 

designed special edition of Charity Box tissues, 

“Together, we will fight for a healthier nation”. Our 

fundraising efforts will see 20 cents donated to 

BUSINESS SEGMENT - TIPEX

Community Chest Singapore for every pack of 5 

boxes sold at retail stores. 

The support goes towards empowering the lives 

of the vulnerable, including five causes – children 

with special needs and youth-at-risk, adults with 

disabilities, families, persons with mental health 

conditions and vulnerable seniors. The operating 

and fundraising costs of the Community Chest are 

sponsored by Tote Board so 100% of our donations 

go towards those in need. Beautex raised $15,000 

from this initiative. Since 2009, Beautex’s campaign 

has been growing in contribution value and to date, 

we have donated more than $250,000 to various 

charities.

New Production Facility in 

Malaysia

Our new factory in Malaysia complies with the 

following requirements/ standards: 

• 

ISO9001:2015 (Quality Management System)

• 

ISO14001:2015 (Environmental Management 

System)

• 

ISO22000:2005 (Food Safety Management 

System)

• 

HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control 

Points)

Product Responsibility

Sustainability Criteria in Supplier Selection ensures 

all of our pulp papers for tissue papers are from FSC 

certified sources.

Tipex will be able to increase our production 

output with this new facility to meet the increasing 

demands of the consumers. In addition to creating 

job opportunities, it will also provide better and 

safer working environment to our workers. At the 

same time, the new environment will help to improve 

product safety.

We also helped improve the road conditions for the 

community by extending road tarmac on routes 

leading to our new factory. This reinforces safer road 

conditions for users, especially at night.
