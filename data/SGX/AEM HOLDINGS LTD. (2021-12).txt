A Zero Failure World

Even as we accelerate our growth, we remain 

steadfast in our commitment to drive and 

implement 

sustainable 

practices 

into 

our 

business. Our vision, A Zero Failure World, is not 

confined	to	our	technology.	It	encapsulates	our	

commitment	 to	 our	 sustainability	 efforts	 and	

how we build meaningful relationships with all 

of our stakeholders.

ESG is more than just about generating a 

report and checking the boxes. At AEM, under 

the guardianship of our Chairman and board 

members, we align our decision-making with 

the RISE (Resilience, Innovation, Sustainability, 

Entrepreneurship) principles and ensure that 

ESG becomes an inherent part of our culture. 

These	 principles	 enable	 us	 to	 effectively	

create long-term value and respond to the 

growing importance of environmental, social, 

and governance issues for our customers, 

employees, investors, and partners.

In	 growing	 revenue	 and	 profit	 sustainably,	

we 

test 

the 

relevance 

of 

our 

business 

assumptions in an ethical manner. In FY2021, 

we had zero instances of non-compliance for 

both governance and environmental matters. 

We remain agile in adapting to challenges 

and adhere to the highest standards of 

professionalism and integrity. 

Through 

various 

leadership 

and 

people 

engagement	 platforms,	 such	 as	 Coffee	 with	

CEO and townhalls, we create an open two-

way dialogue for our teams to understand the 

Company's key drivers and success factors 

and provide opportunities to share ideas 

and suggestions. We encourage continuous 

processes, 

products, 

and 

technology 

improvements by empowering our employees 

to articulate and implement their ideas, paving 

the way for meaningful career growth and 

developing talent. 

We strive to identify and implement sustainable 

practices into our processes, from sustainable 

supplier management to waste management. 

In addition to AEM's conscious management 

of 

electricity 

and 

energy 

consumption, 

we 

purchased 

6,000 

Renewable 

Energy 

Certificates	 ("RECs")	 in	 FY2021,	 equivalent	 to	

6,000 megawatt-hours.

Environmental stewardship, robust and ethical 

business systems, best-in-class governance, 

and nurturing a long-term stakeholder value, 

trust, and enthusiasm are key factors of 

consideration for sustainability. Our approach 

to sustainability is built upon our commitment 

to creating sustainable long-term growth while 

developing our people and positively changing 

our environment. 

We develop the areas we are competent in, but 

we also take bold steps to remain relevant. We 

strive to provide consistency and transparency 

in	 our	 sustainability	 efforts,	 benchmark	 our	

performance against our peers in the industry, 

and progress towards achieving Leader MSCI 

ESG Rating.  

On behalf of the AEM Team, I wish you and your 

families the best of health! 

 

Chandran Nair 

Chief	Executive	Officer	

Dear Shareholders &amp; Readers,  

Many of you have witnessed our transformation to become a global leader 

in test innovation. Today, we are proud to be a part of the critical node of 

the global value chain to deliver resilient and leading-edge test solutions 

for an increasingly complex world. 

As technological advancements continue to help create a better 

world, we are committed to providing rigorous and agile testing of 

semiconductor devices, assuring reliability, enabling scalability, and 

accelerating progress.

our continued 

commitment to share 

our sustainability 

journey with all 

our stakeholders 

transparently and 

credibly. 

 

AEM is committed to sustainability reporting. 

As we continue to grow our operations, we 

are conscious of our business’ impact on 

the community and environment, and how 

sustainability	issues	may	affect	our	strategy	

and operations. The Board and the management 

pledge to incorporate sustainable practices into 

our processes and consider sustainability issues 

such as environmental, social, and governance 

(“ESG”) factors as part of our Group’s strategic 

formulation. To do so, we determine the material 

ESG factors and we will continue to manage and 

monitor	our	efforts	in	addressing	these	material	

factors.

AEM	acquired	CEI	Limited	("CEI")	in	1H2021.	CEI,	

having regional footprint and expertise in its 

field,	will	strengthen	AEM’s	resilience	and	allow	

us to be even more responsive to the needs of 

our global customer base. The acquisition would 

help to solidify our leadership position in serving 

semiconductor and electronics companies 

in	the	advanced	computing,	5G,	and	artificial	

intelligence space. 

Following the acquisition of CEI, there are changes 

in the trends from FY2020 to FY2021 for certain 

material ESG factors considered.

This Report outlines our short-term, long-term, 

and perpetual targets 1  concerning the material 

ESG factors linked to our business strategy and 

financial	performance.	We	want	to	take	this	

opportunity to acknowledge the ongoing support 

from our stakeholders and seek their support in 

our goal of sustainable growth and development. 

 1 In our business planning, we consider our perpetual targets 

as part of AEM’s ongoing initiatives to maintain operational 

excellence in sustainability.

Our Sustainability 

Governance

Our Board of Directors (“the Board”) determines the overall 

direction for the Company’s sustainability strategies. The 

Audit and Risk Management Committee (“ARC”) under 

the stewardship of the Board evaluates and incorporates 

sustainability issues as part of the Group’s strategic 

formulation, and to approve, manage, and monitor ESG 

factors material to the business.

To 

drive 

organisation-wide 

sustainability 

initiatives, 

we have established a Sustainability Team (“the Team”) 

consisting of employees from various departments 

with a diversity of experience and background. The 

Team is responsible for implementing and formalising 

sustainability policies and procedures, management 

processes, and sustainability development standards. It 

also supports and provides adequate resources to various 

functional units to perform the established sustainability 

processes and practices.

The Team works closely with AEM’s Sustainability Steering 

Committee (“SSC”), comprised of our senior management 

team.	 The	 SSC,	 set	 up	 to	 support	 the	 Company’s	 efforts	

in	 driving	 sustainability-related	 efforts,	 is	 responsible	

for implementing AEM’s sustainability objectives and 

strategy, managing and monitoring overall sustainability 

performance, and ensuring the Board is regularly updated 

on AEM’s sustainability progress. With the support of the 

Team, the SSC helps the ARC and the Board determine the 

Company’s material economic, environmental, and social 

aspects and set quantitative and qualitative targets for the 

forthcoming year.

Stakeholder Engagement

In FY2021, COVID-19 regulations and restrictions have 

made	 traditional	 in-person	 meetings	 difficult.	 However,	

AEM is committed to understanding and safeguarding 

our stakeholders’ interests. We continue to engage all our 

stakeholder groups by updating AEM developments and 

receiving feedback on digital platforms such as LinkedIn 

and our Corporate Website.

We identify our stakeholders as groups that 1) impact 

our business, 2) impacted by our business, and 3) 

provide expertise in material factors such as external 

organisations. Our stakeholders’ feedback helps us 

determine our material topics and identify our focus areas. 

AEM is committed to listening to our stakeholders, and we 

welcome their concerns and expectations via our webpage:

Corporate Governance 

and Anti-Corruption

(GRI 205-1)

AEM has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“the 

AEM Code”) as a testimony of our commitment to adhere to the 

highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and ethics. 

The AEM Code includes the Group’s commitment to non-

discrimination and proper conduct of business courtesies 

and relationships. The AEM Code is available on our corporate 

website.

All key operations at AEM, including operations in Singapore, 

Malaysia, China, United States, Finland, France, Vietnam, and 

Indonesia, have been assessed for risks related to corruption 

and	no	incidents	of	corruption	have	been	identified.	

AEM takes a strong stance against corruption and malpractice 

in the Group. To achieve the highest standards of integrity 

and accountability within our internal structure, the Group 

developed and circulated policies and procedures for 

reporting improprieties. Employees can voice out concerns 

about the Group’s activities and  operations directly to the 

Company’s Independent Directors.

All our employees regardless of employee category, including 

the management team and the Board, across AEM and AEM’s 

global subsidiaries, are required to read, understand, and 

comply with the provisions of the AEM Code. Employees who 

are	potentially	in	a	conflict-of-interest	situation	are	required	

to report the matter to the Group. With respect to whistle-

blowing practice, all employees are assured anonymity and 

confidentiality	to	protect	their	identity	and	interests.	Besides	

our employees, the AEM Code has been communicated to our 

customers through our agreements with them.

The Group has also established procedures to ensure that all 

transactions with interested persons are reported promptly 

to the Audit and Risk Management Committee (“ARC”) and 

that transactions are conducted on an arm’s length basis and 

are not prejudicial to the interests of the shareholders.

Our	 cost-effective	 and	 efficient	 testing	 solutions	 have	

contributed to another record-breaking year in FY2021. 

AEM delivered on the FY2021 revenue guidance (between 

S$525.0 million to S$550.0 million) with a 9.0% year-on-

year	increase	in	revenue	to	S$565.5	million.	Profit	after	

tax stood at S$92.1 million (FY2020: S$97.6 million) as we 

stepped up investment in R&amp;D activities and capabilities 

to address our customers' needs and stay ahead of the 

competition through innovation. In terms of economic 

value generated and distributed, FY2021 saw an increase 

of 3% to S$89.2 million from S$86.2 million a year ago.

In addition, the Group has 

adopted our own internal best 

practices and compliance code 

to	guide	our	officers	and	be	

compliant with SGX Listing Rule 

1207(19) with regards to dealing 

in the Company’s securities.

There has been no report on

AEM Holdings Ltd.

Sustainable Supplier Management

(GRI 308-1, 414-1)

AEM collaborates and regularly engages with our suppliers 

at all stages of our purchasing process. We select our 

suppliers based on their track record and assess their ability 

to complement our commitment to deliver high-quality 

products and services before inclusion as an approved vendor. 

Our assessments and reviews on our suppliers’ performance 

include labour, environmental, health, safety, and ethical 

standards and practices to ensure their alignment with AEM’s 

requirements.

AEM also has an internal screening process where suppliers 

are 

screened 

for 

negative 

environmental 

and 

social 

impacts resulting from their business operations. This 

includes, amongst others, pollution (land, air, water, and 

noise), biodiversity loss, global warming, land degradation, 

deforestation, incidents of child labour,  violation involving 

rights of indigenous people, breaches of customer privacy, 

and non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social 

and economic area. In FY2021, AEM onboarded a total of 238 

new	suppliers.	None	of	these	new	suppliers	was	identified	to	

have negative environmental or social impacts.



We believe that corporate growth and responsible environmental practices 

should	not	be	mutually	exclusive.	Our	goal	at	AEM	is	to	fulfil	international	

standards	for	environmental	efforts	in	the	semiconductor	industry	by	

minimising our operations' impact on the environment.

Towards	this	end,	we	integrate	energy	and	water-efficient	measures	into	

daily operations and carry out sustainable supplier management, energy 

management, water management, environmental compliance, and waste 

management through our business endeavours.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIENTIOUSNESS  



Energy

(GRI 302-1, 302-3, 302-4)

Energy is important to AEM as it is critical to our business 

activities. While energy-intensive equipment may result in 

higher utility costs, business operations would be disrupted 

without them. Therefore, it is important that we manage our 

electricity and energy consumption responsibly to help 

protect the environment in which the AEM entities operate. 

Diesel is used primarily by the commercial vehicles in 

CEI which the Group acquired in 1H2021. In FY2021, AEM 

started and will continue to track its diesel consumption. 

The total diesel consumption was 0.5% of the total energy 

consumption in FY2021.

Further, our total energy consumption increased as a result 

of increased production in FY2021 and with the addition 

of CEI. Nevertheless, AEM endeavours to reduce energy 

consumption	 in	 our	 business	 activities	 through	 efficient	

operations and minimisation of wastage. On this front, we 

have taken steps to reduce our energy consumption and 

wastage to contribute to environmental sustainability 

efforts.	

For instance, we have continuous energy-saving initiatives 

which include:

•	

the	replacement	of	fluorescent	lighting	with	LED

 

energy-saving lighting,

• 

the programming of air-conditioner and lights to 

 

switch	off	automatically	after	office	hours,

• 

the replacement of air-conditioning ducting from 

 

cassette to inverter type,

•	

the	replacement	of	old	inefficient	equipment	with	

 

energy-efficient	ones,	and

• 

introducing usage discipline through posters and

 

briefings	to	promote	awareness	of	electricity	

 

conservation among our employees.

AEM Holdings Ltd.



In addition to our conscious management of 

electricity and energy consumption, in FY2021, 

AEM purchased 6,000 Renewable Energy 

Certificates	to	offset	electricity	consumed	from	

conventional sources. This is equivalent to about 

49% of our total FY2021 electricity consumption 

using conventional sources.

 

Through this initiative, besides being committed 

to adopting renewable energy as an integral part 

of our energy portfolio, we hope that this would 

encourage more future investments in renewable 

energy projects globally.

Emissions

(GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4)

 

As we strive to reduce our emission footprint, AEM takes into 

consideration our Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emission levels 

in every stage of our manufacturing process. We understand 

the	 manufacturing	 operations	 of	 AEM	 entail	 significant	

energy	requirements,	therefore,	the	efficient	use	of	energy	is	

essential to reducing potential GHG emissions for AEM.

Initiatives to reduce waste and promote sustainable waste management play a 

vital	role	in	fulfilling	Singapore’s	ambition	of	becoming	a	Zero	Waste	Nation.	In	

support	of	Singapore’s	Zero	Waste	Masterplan,	we	have	accelerated	our	efforts	

to reduce waste by:

• 

converting several of our internal processes from paper-based to  

 

electronic records;

• 

engaging a third-party recycler to recycle waste generated from our  

 

manufacturing process and operations (e.g. metal leftovers generated  

 

from our manufacturing process); and

• 

reusing carton boxes and plastic pallets.

These	 efforts	 have	 yielded	 results	 and	 we	 will	 continue	 to	 promote	 waste	

reduction	efforts.



There are three main categories 

of waste at AEM, hazardous waste 

(which includes chemical waste), 

recycled waste (which includes 

leftover metals, paper and 

plastic), and general waste. About

SOLIDIFYING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS

As the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, 

AEM is committed to evolving our HR 

practices to stay relevant and create 

the best possible environment for our 

workforce. 

We have adapted recent HR 

technologies to our advantage to 

reinforce workforce abilities, ensure 

data security, improve candidate and 

employee experiences, and more.

Employment

(GRI 401-1)

Talent plays a key role in ensuring our Company’s success. 

Aside	 from	 efforts	 to	 maintain	 a	 low	 turnover	 rate,	 we	

continued to attract new talent globally. AEM practices non-

discrimination and equal opportunities. Our new hires are 

employed based on merits and experiences, and we seek to 

keep our turnover rates low by promoting employees’ loyalty 

through	benefits,	safety,	and	welfare.	As	of	31	December	2021,	

AEM’s workforce consists of 1,496 employees, an increase of 

851 employees compared to the previous year due mainly to 

the acquisition of CEI.

Due to the pandemic lockdowns, many foreign workers have 

resigned to return to their home countries. Despite the 

unfavourable environment to hire new foreign workers due to 

the travel restrictions, AEM is pleased to share that we were 

able to achieve 398 new hires, more than double the number of 

new hires in FY2020.

of an employee is determined based on individual 

expertise, job responsibility, performance, contributions 

to long-term goals, and the Company's operations and 

profitability.	

AEM believes in providing a strong variable component 

in employee remuneration. We are also expanding our 

performance share awards to incentivise more employees.

In	FY2021,	AEM	reviewed	and	enhanced	employee	benefits.	

We	 were	 mindful	 of	 the	 need	 to	 have	 sufficient	 life	 and	

medical insurance cover for all our employees, and added 

Group Term Life insurance for all our employees. With the 

increasing medical costs, we have increased the medical 

coverage for all our employees to give them peace of mind 

against substantial medical bills in the event of a major 

illness.	 We	 also	 ensured	 our	 employees	 have	 sufficient	

vacation leave to rest and spend time with their families 

by increasing the leave entitlement for our direct, indirect, 

and	managerial	staff.	

Our foreign workers have not traveled home to visit their 

family and friends over the last two years because of the

SOLIDIFYING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS

In FY2021, we started tracking work-related hazards that 

could potentially cause injury or ill health. We are pleased 

that with these measures in place, we maintained our 

record of having reported zero (0) cases of recordable 

work-related injuries or ill health, zero (0) cases of high-

consequence work-related injuries, zero (0) cases of 

fatalities resulting from a work-related injury or ill health, 

for all employees and workers.

 

AEM acknowledges that a good work-life balance is 

key	 to	 having	 good	 mental	 health	 and	 promoting	 staff	

wellbeing and satisfaction. Henceforth, we also provide 

team-building activities – most of it virtually - to keep our 

employees engaged and de-stressed. We recognised that 

the prolonged pandemic is causing much mental stress 

and in the coming year, we are introducing an Employee 

Assistance 

Programme 

that 

comes 

with 

proactive 

recreational and health-promoting activities as well as life 

coaching to individuals. By doing so, we hope to create a 

positive and inclusive work culture, which in turn would 

strengthen our employees’ positivity and commitment to 

the Company. 

In addition, we have a designated health and safety 

committee whose job is to provide a safe working 

environment 

through 

monthly 

safety 

inspection, 

scheduling	 of	 safety	 training,	 drills,	 and	 filing	 emergency	

and accident reports. Given the COVID-19 situation, all 

these were carried out with workplace safety management 

measures in place. We also host quarterly meetings with 

staff	to	encourage	them	to	speak	up,	raise	concerns,	and	

empower them to initiate improvements.

Training and Education

(GRI 404-1, 404-2, 404-3)

Our commitment is to help employees develop professionally 

and personally to advance their careers in AEM.  As we 

navigate our way through changes in modes of working 

due to COVID-19, we have prepared a wide range of training 

programmes that employees can attend physically and 

remotely. 

For example, we launched the Learning Management System 

(“LMS”) in June 2021. Employees are encouraged to take 

ownership of their professional development as they can enrol 

themselves for e-learning courses and on-site classroom 

training, and track and manage their training records. Two 

of our employees have also been awarded the Continuing 

Education Sponsorship, in support of their pursuit of further 

studies. As such, each employee has received an average of 

18.4 training hours in FY2021 compared to 7.8 training hours 

in FY2020. 

A	significant	achievement	in	FY2021	is	that	the	training	hours	

per female employee increased from 7.1 hours to 25.0 hours, 

70% higher than the training hours per male employee. The 

training	hours	per	direct	employee	also	increased	significantly	

from 12.7 hours in FY2020 to 34.4 hours in FY2021. 

AEM believes that our greatest assets 

are our people and that our staff’s 

technological and engineering skills 

and knowledge are the core of our 

success. Therefore, we invest in training, 

learning initiatives, and development 

programmes	to	expand	our	staff	

competencies. 

We have established guidelines for 

training	identification,	monitoring,	

and review. Besides technical skills, 

we also organise business, leadership, 

train-the-trainer,	finance,	operational	

management, and enterprise resource 

planning training for our management 

and	staff.

development 

goals 

and 

to ensure our employees are well 

equipped for the current and future

Diversity and Reduced Inequality

Diversity and reduced inequality are vital to AEM business 

success and are integral to all our people’s practices and 

culture. We are committed to creating a diverse environment 

and complying with all fair employment practices.

Diversity and Equal Opportunity 

(including management diversity)

(GRI 405-1)

AEM embraces diversity and has employees from diverse 

backgrounds.	

We	

have	

representation	

from	

different	

nationalities, races, and genders in our workplace. Embracing 

diversity allows AEM to be more vibrant and innovative, and 

each employee's experiences and background contribute to 

this. 

 

The gender diversity among AEM's employees has been 

improving	 over	 the	 years.	 In	 FY2021,	 we	 welcomed	 our	 first	

female board of director. 

Zooming into the employee level, the age group diversity has 

remained relatively stable across the three. As AEM strive to 

achieve gender diversity across employee categories, female 

employees in the direct category have increased by 31%.
