Dear Stakeholders,

The Del Monte Pacific Ltd (DMPL) 

Group continued operating as an 

essential industry to sustain people’s 

basic need for food, as the world 

locked down due to the coronavirus 

pandemic. We continue to address 

the nutritional needs of people 

who have been impacted by this 

global crisis. In this Sustainability 

Report, we highlight how our 

Group’s response to the pandemic 

has contributed to the Sustainable 

Development Goals of the United 

Nations.

As a leading global food company, 

sustainability is an important part 

of Del Monte Pacific’s vision, 

“Nourishing Families. Enriching 

Lives. Every Day.” Improving 

sustainability is one of our strategic 

pillars supporting this vision, 

while commitment to society and 

environment is one of our core 

values.

The Group has strived to operate 

a sustainable business throughout 

the long heritage of the Del Monte 

brand and the extensive history 

of our farms. We manage our 

plantations sustainably, produce 

healthy food, and generate 

livelihood, contributing to the 

economic, environmental and social 

well-being of the communities we

serve. Over a century of farmer 

know-how and environmental care 

have been handed down and honed 

across generations for healthier 

produce, healthier people and a 

healthier planet.

“Sustaining our Future” is our 

commitment to grow the business 

in a manner that sustains a healthy 

balance among diverse interests 

of all our stakeholders including 

our consumers, employees, host 

communities and shareholders. 

Our FY2020 Sustainability Report 

highlights the following six areas: 

1. Nourishing Consumers 

We provide consumers with 

nutritious food and beverage 

products that are sourced 

sustainably. Our more than 

130 years of brand heritage is a 

testament to consumers’ trust in 

our product quality and portfolio 

of brands, led by Del Monte. 

2. Nurturing Employees 

We nurture close to 6,000 

employees by building a culture 

of engagement, developing their 

capabilities and supporting a 

healthy work-life integration. Our 

employees attest to the well-

being of our people, including 

our labour service providers.

3. Developing Communities 

We improve the quality of 

life of communities through 

our business and corporate 

social responsibility. We 

uplift communities through 

local employment, livelihood 

programmes, community health 

and wellness, and education. 

Our long-term partnerships are 

a testimony to our care for our 

communities. 

4. Preserving Nature 

We protect the environment 

with sound agricultural and 

manufacturing practices. 

Our more than 100 years of 

experience is a testament 

to how we sustain the lands 

we cultivate or source from, 

and our production facilities. 

Our pineapple operations are 

carbon negative, which means 

we are net removers of carbon 

dioxide from the atmosphere. 

The success of our business 

is dependent on responsible 

stewardship of nature.

5. Strengthening Governance 

We promote corporate 

governance grounded on the 

principles of transparency, 

integrity and accountability. 

We have been listed on the 

Singapore Exchange since 

1999 and the Philippine Stock 

Exchange since 2013. The 

Management and Board of 

Directors are accountable to 

stakeholders and shareholders. 

6. Sustaining Growth 

We seek to generate growth in a 

sustainable way that will sustain 

our earnings, which is the lifeline 

of our business. Our policies and 

performance are geared towards 

addressing our stakeholders 

across geographies, and laying 

the foundation upon which we 

build value for our shareholders.

This Sustainability Report presents 

our initiatives towards a more 

holistic and balanced approach 

to our social, environmental and 

economic performance for our 

people, planet and performance - 

the Triple Bottom Line.

Sustainability is an integral part of 

Del Monte Pacific Group. Our Board 

of Directors and management 

team will continue to invest in the 

present to sustain our future. We 

thank you, our stakeholders, for your 

partnership in this journey.

The Del Monte Pacific Ltd (DMPL) Group continued 

operating as a food company, part of the essential 

industry to sustain people’s need for food, as the 

world was locking down economic activity due to 

the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory 

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), referred to 

as the coronavirus. Our Group activated our Business 

Continuity Plan with the following:

1. Continue operations to ensure that people have a 

steady supply of healthy food products to meet the 

surging demand for food, strengthen their immune 

system and help fight the spread of the disease

2. Safeguard the health and safety of our employees 

and labour force through various work schemes and 

safe work practices

We linked our pandemic response to the Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. The 

UN issued 17 SDGs in 2015, a 15-year agenda created by 

world leaders up to 2030. The SDGs are a call to action 

by all countries to promote prosperity while sustaining 

the planet and its people. The SDGs recognise that 

economic growth should also address social needs and 

environmental protection.

DMPL continued its operation as a food company, 

part of the essential industry, without disruption 

amidst the pandemic. 

Our employees and service providers continue 

to work amidst rising unemployment, impacting 

poor wage earners the most.

DMFI donated US$2 million worth of food 

to Feeding America during the lockdown. 

DMPI donated food products to about 100,000 

people through the Del Monte Foundation.



Majority of the 300 scholars of Del Monte 

Foundation resumed their education online 

amidst school closures.

The Foundation provided learning aids to  

19 schools and organised educational sessions 

on COVID-19 awareness for health workers.



Our donations include products that promote 

health and wellness and strengthen the immune 

system, especially in indigent communities.

We have supported medical frontliners in 

over 50 hospitals/healthcare facilities.

Given the pandemic, we looked at our corporate response and their relevance to 12 out of 17 Sustainable 

Development Goals.

DEL MONTE PACIFIC LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2020


Employees wash hands to prevent infection with 

COVID-19.

Alcohol-based hand rubs with 70% of Isopropyl 

Alcohol are stationed in entrances and key 

locations.

Commonly used areas such as elevators, doors, 

railings are disinfected everyday to ensure the 

facilities are virus-free.











E-commerce sales have also surged as consumers 

stay at home during lockdown, purchasing our 

products through online retail sites such as Amazon 

and Walmart in the US, Alibaba and JD in China, and 

Lazada and Shopee in the Philippines.

Employees leverage the use of videoconferencing 

technology while observing physical distancing.







Our company improved the lactation room 

for mothers during the pandemic.

We relocated the clinic and medical 

isolation room for suspected COVID-19 

cases away from the lactation room.

Various work arrangements included work from 

home under Enhanced Community Quarantine 

(ECQ). 

PPEs were provided to employees, with regular 

temperature checks and physical distancing.

A return-to-work plan was operationalised upon 

lifting of ECQ.

Retail sales of food did well during the quarantine.

DEL MONTE PACIFIC LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2020


From the Circuit Breaker in Singapore, 

Lockdown in China and India, Enhanced 

Community Quarantine in the Philippines, to 

Shelter in Place in the US, different parts of 

our Group implemented business continuity 

plans to ensure safety of people and mitigate 

risks, including operational disruption.

The marginalised low-income sector bore the 

brunt of the lockdown, losing employment. 

Donation of food and beverage products and, in 

some cases, fund-raising provided some relief.

Business continuity teams managed the crisis 

to ensure the Company can address consumer 

demand while keeping our organisation safe, 

following the directives of the World Health 

Organisation, Centre for Disease Control, 

Department of Health, Department of Labour and 

Employment, and Inter-Agency Task Force.

We partnered with over 220 NGOs, Local 

Government Units and hospitals to provide 

nutrition with our food products.

DMPL supported frontline workers, senior 

citizens, persons with disability and needy 

communities.









































The impact of the pandemic is also related to four other 

Sustainable Development Goals, SDG 12 to 15. The 

coronavirus is believed to have originated from animals, 

specifically bats. Similarly, African Swine Flu, Hoof and 

Mouth Disease, and Avian Flu all originated from animals 

and endanger both humans and animals alike (SDG 15). 

Hence, responsible consumption and production (SDG 

12) of food will mitigate the risk of viruses. The pandemic 

lockdowns around the world revealed the impact of 

reduced air pollution (SDG 13) and water pollution (SDG 

14), as most factories had to shut down and all forms of 

transport and travel were restricted, land, air and sea.

fruits are cut into spears then 

frozen. Individually packaged 

frozen Pineapple Stick and 

frozen chunks called Golden 

Pineapple are sold in 7-Eleven 

Japan as an on-the-go healthy 

snack. The revolutionary 

technology allows the frozen or 

newly thawed pineapple to have 

the same physical properties as 

fresh cut pineapple. These are 

also sold in Hong Kong, China 

and South Korea.

HEALTH AND NUTRITION

Del Monte is committed to health 

and nutrition. Consumers trust 

our brands and we ensure that our 

brands maintain this trust from one 

generation to the next.











We take a leadership role in 

meeting consumer preferences. 

We understand that consumers are 

becoming increasingly interested 

in learning about the ingredients 

in their food and are often looking 

for positive health properties 

such as low-fat or low-sugar. 

This emphasis on health benefits 

has ongoing implications for 

product design and sourcing.

TRACEABILITY

Part of our commitment to ensure 

that our products are safe is having 

a robust traceability programme 

in place. With globalisation, our 

products reach more consumers. In 

order to protect consumers’ health, 

the traceability programme allows 

us to quickly identify the origin of 

the product, should an event arise, 

from its source and production to 

retailer. With this knowledge, we 

are equipped to handle consumer 

questions with confidence and in 

a timely manner. Having a reliable 

traceability programme enables the 

Group to have an effective process 

to identify a defective product or 

component and to execute the 

recall process if warranted.

1. The Group conducts periodic 

quality audits with our co-

manufacturers to ensure 

compliance with our standards. 

2. In the US, DMFI conducted 

50 mock recalls covering Del 

Monte facilities, co-packers 

and distribution centres. 

We abide by the federal 

food safety requirements 

by maintaining a product 

traceability programme that 

allows us to track products 

shipped to our customers.

3. We have significantly enhanced 

this traceability programme to 

allow faster and more accurate 

traceability using electronic 

tracking of product movement. 

4. Del Monte conducts extensive Risk 

Assessment/Hazard Analysis and 

incorporates actions to assure that 

the products and ingredients meet 

the highest Del Monte standards 

prior to introduction in the 

marketplace. 

5. The system is tested frequently 

and test results are used to 

drive continuous process 

improvements. 

6. Del Monte also maintains records 

that allow the Company to 

determine the source of the 

ingredients used in its products. 

7. In the Philippines, our standards to 

trace products to their production 

date comply with the standards of 

the BRC. These standards apply to 

both our own facilities and our toll 

manufacturers.

8. A total of 43 Del Monte 

facilities and co-packers 

conducted mock-up traceability 

exercises in the Philippines, 

and within the standard 

traceability time of 4 hours.

9. Traceability assessment is 

conducted during certification and 

customer audits of our facility as 

well as our toll manufacturers.

PRODUCT PACKAGING

Our Group understands the 

need to have a packaging that 

attracts consumers and strives to 

make a positive influence on the 

environment. 

We believe more efforts need to be 

exerted to maintain the quality and 

safety of our products as well as 

regulate our environmental impact. 

It gives us double incentive to 

rework our product packaging in a 

more environment-friendly manner.

1. The Company provides a hotline 

in the DMFI website to enable 

customers to ask detailed 

questions and provide feedback 

on the products.

2. DMFI began labeling most 

vegetables, fruit cup snacks and 

many more tomato products as 

non-GMO.

3. In the US, Del Monte was the first 

manufacturer to work with the 

USDA for non-GMO verification 

for corn products for consumer 

assurance on sweet corn 

products.

4. We have converted 100% of our 

branded tomato products and 

nearly 100% of our branded fruit 

and vegetable products to non-

BPA lining in the US.

5. Polyester material is the 

alternative lining material for 

our vegetable and fruit products 

while vinyl is the alternative 

used for our tomato cans. The 

linings meet the requirements 

of California’s Prop. 65, ensuring 

that they do not contain 

phthalates or BPA and comply 

with all FDA and European Food 

Safety Authority standards. 

The coating components are 

also compliant with the United 

States Environmental Protection 

Agency and Regulation for 

Registration, Evaluation, 

Authorisation, and Restriction of 

Chemicals.  

6. Del Monte in the Philippines 

has 100% BPA-Non Intent for

Del Monte recognises the responsibility of business to 

respect human rights in all aspects of its operations. 

We expect our employees, suppliers and contractors to 

adhere to the same human rights principles. We do not 

tolerate human rights abuses and violations and shall 

enforce this zero tolerance policy for any human rights 

violations that our operations might come across.

Del Monte recognises an opportunity to promote 

human rights in the various areas where it makes 

positive contributions to society. Del Monte respects the 

legitimate role of civil society organisations and human 

rights defenders in promoting rights, and in working with 

businesses to prevent and mitigate human rights abuses.

POLICY STATEMENTS

We will develop and implement robust and effective 

policies and procedures for respecting and promoting 

human rights within the organisation and within the 

sphere of our influence, as follows:

1. Integration of Respect for Human Rights 

in the Company’s Processes and Culture. 

Respect for human rights within Del Monte 

and across our operations will be built into 

the existing policies, contractual obligations 

and the working culture of the company, 

including risk-assessment, reporting obligations, 

discipline and staff performance objectives.

2. Responsibility to Prevent or Mitigate Human Rights 

Impacts. Our responsibility to respect human rights 

shall include efforts to:

 

a.  Avoid causing or contributing to adverse human 

rights impacts through our own activities, and 

address such impacts when they occur;

 

b.  Prevent or mitigate adverse human rights 

impacts that are directly linked to our operations, 

products, services, or business relationships, even 

if we have not contributed to those impacts.

 

c.  Respect international human rights law, 

regardless of the capacity or willingness of the 

state to enforce it.

3. Due Diligence on Human Rights Impacts. We shall 

implement a comprehensive human rights due 

diligence process to proactively identify, prevent, 

mitigate and account for how we address our actual 

and potential impacts on human rights shall form 

part of our operations, products, services and our 

business relationships. This entails the following:

 

a. Being guided by the sphere of influence principle. 

We will identify and analyse stakeholders with 

political, contractual, economic and geographic 

proximity. We will conduct thorough contextual 

risk assessments before starting new, or 

expanding existing, projects or operations.

 

b. Engaging in meaningful consultation with 

potentially affected groups and other relevant 

stakeholders, respecting the right to self-

determination of indigenous peoples and the 

right to participation of the communities where 

we operate.

 

c. Setting up processes to enable remediation of 

any adverse human rights impacts we cause or to 

which we contribute. 

D E L  M O N T E  P A C I F I C  L I M I T E D  G R O U P 

H U M A N  R I G H T S  P O L I C Y

Inspired by its vision of Nourishing Families, Enriching Lives, Every Day, the Del Monte Pacific Limited Group (Del 

Monte), seeks to enrich the lives of its stakeholders through healthy food and sustainable practices. Del Monte 

believes that fulfilling its vision to enrich lives entails developing an organisational culture that protects, respects 

and promotes human rights.

In line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, our human rights policies are based 

on international law and guidance including the International Bill of Human Rights (including the Universal 

Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) as well as the 

International Labour Organisation Core Convention on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

Our policy conforms to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on Peace, Justice and Strong 

Institutions which promotes the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensures equal access to 

justice for all.

38

DEL MONTE PACIFIC LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2020


 

d. Ensuring that human rights due diligence 

processes are done prior, as well as on a regular 

and ongoing basis, recognising that the human 

rights risks may change over time as the business 

enterprise’s operations and operating context 

evolve.

 

e. Integrating the findings from our human rights 

impact assessments across relevant internal 

functions and processes, and taking appropriate 

action, as may be required.

 

f. Tracking the effectiveness of our responses and 

actions based on appropriate quantitative and 

qualitative indicators and by drawing feedback 

from both internal and external sources, including 

non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and 

affected stakeholders.

 

g. Communicating our human rights assessment 

externally, particularly when concerns are raised 

by or on behalf of affected stakeholders. When 

our operations pose risks of severe human rights 

impacts, we should report formally on how we 

address them.

4. Zero Tolerance. We shall not authorise, tolerate, or 

knowingly ignore human rights violations committed 

by our employees or any persons we have business 

relationship with nor shall we provide assistance or 

encouragement that has a substantial effect on the 

perpetration of human rights abuses.

5. Engagement with Communities. We will consult 

concerned stakeholders on matters affecting 

their rights and well-being, respecting the right of 

indigenous peoples to give or withhold their free, 

prior and informed consent regarding the use of 

their land and natural resources. We shall engage 

communities: respecting their cultures, developing 

courteous relationships, and honoring consent-

giving processes.

6. Promotion of Human Rights. We shall actively 

participate in collaborative initiatives nationally 

and locally in the promotion of business and 

human rights through education, advocacy and 

capacity development for our employees and the 

communities and stakeholders we work with. 

7. Adherence to the Rule of Law. We commit to the 

basic tenets of good governance and to the rule 

of law, informed by applicable domestic laws and, 

above all, international human rights laws.

8. Transparency. Transparency and honesty shall be 

our defining principles in monitoring, evaluating and 

reporting on our human rights and sustainability 

policies and practices (including mitigation and 

remediation measures), publically as well as to 

international, national and local auditing bodies.

9. Remediation Mechanism. We will provide access 

to remedy by implementing a safe, accessible and 

effective operational-level grievance mechanism for 

individuals and communities who may be adversely 

impacted by our operations. This mechanism will 

make it possible for grievances to be addressed, and 

adverse impacts remediated early and directly, thus 

preventing harms from compounding and grievances 

from escalating. Where reprisals against human rights 

defenders or project stakeholders are identified, 

we will respond effectively to protect the life and 

integrity of those at risk.

10. Respect for Civic Space. We shall not tolerate 

threats, harassment or attacks against human rights 

and environmental defenders. Stakeholders must 

be able to engage freely with us and our business 

partners, whether to provide feedback or to raise 

concerns. We will act to prevent and respond to 

any instance of reprisals, and expect our business 

partners to do the same.

Plastic is a popular packaging material: cheap, light and sturdy. However, its degradation takes centuries, leading to 

environmental problems. 

PLASTIC WASTE SOLUTIONS

This infographic shows the different solutions to managing plastic waste.

DMPL GROUP INITIATIVES

One of the five strategic pillars of 

the Del Monte Pacific Group is to 

improve sustainability, while one of 

its six core values is commitment to 

society and the environment.

The Group takes action to reduce 

plastic waste through the following 

initiatives:

A. Using less plastic material, i.e. 

lightweighting a package

B. Incorporating the recycling and 

tidyman disposal logos and QR 

code into product labels

C. Eliminating single-use plastic 

from company premises and 

encouraging use of reusable/

refillable containers and non-

plastic alternatives

D. Repurposing plastic waste into 

other uses

E. Exploring more sustainable plastic 

for PET bottles for beverage, 

stand-up pouches for culinary 

and fruit, and cups for fruit

F. Using alternative materials is 

the most sustainable long-

term solution, i.e. cans (e.g. 

fruits, vegetables, tomatoes, 

juices), cartons (e.g. juices, 

broth) and glass bottles (e.g. 

ketchup, olive oil). In the US 

and the Philippines, about 

93% and 73% of our products, 

respectively, are not in plastic.

REDUCING PLASTIC

Del Monte Philippines, Inc (DMPI) 

has been reducing the plastic in its 

PET bottles by decreasing its weight. 

From 2009 to 2019, the company 

has brought down its plastic usage 

by around 21% and targets to lower 

this by another 15% in the next 

five years. DMPI has also been 

decreasing the material for stand-up 

pouches by 16.5% during the same 

period and plans to reduce this by 

another 5% in the next five years.

Del Monte Foods, Inc (DMFI) has 

been decreasing plastic waste 

through downgauging which has 

resulted to a 35% decrease since 

2008. DMFI plans to downgauge 

their plastic fruit cups by another 

10% by 2021.

PROMOTING RECYCLING

These are examples of our new product labels incorporating the recycling 

and tidyman disposal logos and QR code.

ELIMINATING SINGLE-USE 

PLASTIC

In 2019, the Group encouraged 

employees to eliminate the use of 

single-use plastic in the company’s 

premises, including operating 

facilities - PET water bottles, plastic 

utensils, cups, lids, stirrers, straws, 

styrofoams and plates. Employees 

were encouraged to reuse and refill 

containers for multiple use or use 

non-plastic alternatives.

REPURPOSING PLASTIC

In FY2020, we embarked on a 

project called “Share-a-Chair” where 

we repurposed plastic waste to 

school chairs. 

Our objectives were to:

• 

Reduce plastic disposal in the 

environment by repurposing our 

plastic waste 

• 

Help address the shortage of 

chairs in public schools by 

converting plastic into chairs 

• 

Engage employees and business 

partners (suppliers, tollpackers) 

and raise awareness about plastic 

waste

Our target was to make 600 school 

chairs and 12 sets of teacher’s 

tables/chairs from single-use plastic 

waste coming from our Group’s 

products, including PET bottles, 

stand-up pouches, plastic pouches 

and Tetra cartons.

In FY2020, DMPI collected 19.3MT 

of plastic waste together with 

its affiliate NutriAsia up to mid-

March when the first community 

quarantine was imposed due 

to the pandemic. Through the 

Del Monte Foundation, we have 

identified deserving schools where 

we will distribute the school chairs 

in Bukidnon, Cagayan de Oro, 

Bulacan, Cabuyao and Taguig. We 

will organise the distribution once 

we receive the transport permit 

from the government given the 

community quarantine restrictions.

As a food company, our business 

depends on responsible stewardship 

of nature, the source of our 

produce that will sustain our future. 

We continuously improve our 

agricultural practices and oversight 

of growers and communicate 

our Environmental Policy to our 

stakeholders.

In the US, Del Monte connects 

consumers with our growers by 

providing detailed information on 

how vegetables are grown through 

a software and partnership with the 

Stewardship Index of Specialty Crops 

organisation and partnering with a 

third-party vendor CropTrak™ for 

their crop data management system.

Our dedicated agricultural Seed 

Operations Research Team in Del 

Monte Foods, Inc (DMFI) has a 

plant breeding programme which 

selects the best plant qualities to 

produce a new generation. Del 

Monte typically tests over 1,200 

genetically distinct and new varieties 

within a year. Moreover, our expert 

plant breeders and research farm 

staff work in tandem with our 

growers to introduce new crop 

varieties with improved yields. Over 

a period of time, our Blue Lake® 

green bean breeding programme 

and new growing practices have 

increased yields by nearly 200%.

Pineapple plantation in Bukidnon, Philippines

Pineapple harvest in Bukidnon

The first pineapple plantation in the world to 

be awarded by GLOBALGAP

We keep the viewpoints of our 

customers and growers in mind as 

we identify key characteristics of 

our plants. Their insights provide the 

direction for the next generation 

of our seeds and products. 

Ultimately, we test for taste, 

harvest cleanliness, yield, disease 

resistance, nutrient management 

and factory performance.

In Del Monte Philippines, Inc (DMPI), 

efficient land use is the foundation 

of our sustainable agriculture 

practices. Ecologically-minded land 

use management has been carried 

out since the time of our pioneers 

who started farming in 1926 and 

did not clear forests to give way 

to pineapple fields. Additional land 

acquired later by our pioneers was 

already cultivated with other crops.

Across over 90 years of operations, 

our land use practices have 

been mainly aimed at improving 

plantation yield through 

ecologically-friendly land 

preparation, use of sustainable 

planting materials, plant disease 

management, chemical application 

and efficient water sourcing and 

drainage. 

Our plantation in the Philippines is 

Global Good Agricultural Practices 

(GLOBALGAP) certified. We also 

have a Philippine Good Agricultural 

Practices certificate issued by 

the Department of Agriculture.

GLOBALGAP honoured us with 

the Good Agricultural Practices 

Award (2018) for demonstrating 

high standards and excellent 

implementation of GLOBALGAP 

principles on our farms.

Our plantation and pack house 

for fresh fruits have been certified 

ISO 9001:2015 by SGS United 

Kingdom Ltd Systems and Services.

We have undertaken initiatives 

to reduce process residues, 

strengthen energy conservation 

in worksites and explore more 

efficient energy sources.

FERTILISER AND PESTICIDE USE

We help growers apply the principles 

of Integrated Pest Management 

(IPM) to minimise the amount of 

pesticides. 

1. In the US, Del Monte partnered 

with a third-party vendor 

CropTrak™ to monitor cover 

crops which help increase 

organic matter, reduce wind and 

soil erosion, sequester carbon, 

filter water, control weeds and 

manage nutrients. 

2. DMFI field staff and growers 

closely monitor crop 

conditions through field 

scouting, pheromone traps 

and cultural tools to help 

avoid pest outbreaks.

3. By limiting pesticide use, we 

reduce the probability of 

contaminated runoff from 

fields, protect the health of 

farm workers, prevent the 

destruction of beneficial insects 

and other field organisms, and 

ultimately decrease the chance 

that any pesticide residue 

remains on the crop when it 

is harvested and processed.

Tomato harvest in California, USA

4. We have participated in a number 

of IPM-related partnerships and 

initiatives to share knowledge 

and best practice.

5. Our researchers investigate crop 

density as a way to increase 

yield per hectare while cutting 

pesticide and fertiliser use and 

explore the possibility of rolling 

out high-density techniques to 

other crops.

6. DMFI provides our growers with 

plants that are naturally resistant 

to diseases and insects, thus 

reducing fertiliser and chemical 

use in farms.

7. Our field staff educate and 

solicit feedback from our 

farmers on how to best grow 

these plants and implement 

pest control and crop disease 

mitigation strategies.

8. Due to these improvements 

over a period of time, we have 

reduced our spraying from an 

average of seven applications, 

with a total of two kilograms of 

active pesticide ingredient to 1.5 

applications and 90 grams of 

active ingredient.

9. DMFI reduced its application 

energy usage by over 85%.

10. We actively complete laboratory 

tests for pesticide residues for 

over 1,000 products each year 

and, if we find any pesticide, we 

remove it from our products and 

the fields where our growers 

cultivated them.

11. This feedback loop means 

we closely examine the 

impact that new pesticides 

might have on our products 

and that we develop higher 

standards of growing.

Irrigation on bean field, Texas, USA

WATER MANAGEMENT 

We implement the least water-

intensive cultivation methods 

possible and encourage the 

use of more water-efficient 

irrigation systems.

1. In the US, our growers use 

various irrigation systems to 

supplement natural rainfall and 

ensure a steady and reliable 

water supply for their crops. 

2. Del Monte in the US evaluates 

water risk based on local 

availability and quality in areas 

where our plants operate as well 

as at the farm level where we 

contract with growers. 

3. We show our concern for 

water scarcity through stronger 

regulations and more calls 

for water use monitoring 

and management. 

4. Nearly all Del Monte tomato 

growers utilise drip irrigation, a 

less water-intensive cultivation 

method, for targeted application 

of water and fertiliser.

5. Our facilities have high or 

extremely high-water stress, 

which is why we capture and 

reuse water at our facilities.

6. We recycle the cooling water 

from our cans and use it to run 

our cooling towers to reduce 

fresh water and energy usage.

7. In order to reduce fresh water 

usage and avoid water treatment 

costs, DMPI uses the water 

from steam and pineapple 

juice of our evaporators and 

water from mill juice from our 

Reverse Osmosis (RO) system 

for Ultrafiltration System 

Clean-in-place (CIP) and Ion 

Exchange Plants regeneration. 

8. Our bottling plant operations 

in the Philippines measure 

the Water Use Ratio (WUR), 

i.e. cost of water used per 

litre of beverage product. Our 

WUR in the Bottling Plant 

for FY2020 is 21% below 

our target cost per litre.

9. Some of the initiatives of the 

bottling plant to improve water 

management are:

 

• 

Installation of RO machine 

system.

 

• 

Backwashing activity was 

reduced from eight times a 

month to twice a month.

 

• 

Optimisation of rinsing time 

during CIP.

 

• 

Installation of soft water line 

control timer for shutdown 

operation.

 

• 

Training for awareness on 

water treatment from third 

party suppliers.

10. Our toll manufacturers 

have water conservation 

programmes to eliminate 

waste and reduce water usage. 

Wastewater discharges of all toll 

manufacturing lines are within 

regulatory standards. WUR 

in beverage and culinary toll 

manufacturers are monitored 

and reduced each year.

Using drones to map the pineapple plantation 

in Bukidnon

Since efficient management of 

soil directly impacts our long-

term productivity, we focus 

on regenerating topsoil and 

improving diversity on the ground 

and even below the ground.

1. To facilitate soil management, 

DMFI asks growers to:

 

a.  Conduct consistent soil 

sampling to manage soil 

fertility and health.

 

b.  Apply our model pesticide 

control programme.

 

c.  Use pest-resistant varieties 

where available.

 

d.  Rotate crops to minimise 

the effect of soil insects 

and diseases.

2. We encourage our farmers to 

work with qualified plant and 

soil scientists, or agronomists, 

to develop innovative farm 

practices and technologies 

which boost crop yields, control 

pests and weeds, and protect the 

environment. Understanding the 

agronomics of a new variety in 

a growing area is important for 

adaptation to the environment.

3. In the Philippines, the 

Company leases landholdings 

from landowners. 

4. For better soil and drainage 

management, the Crop 

Growing Units implement 

deepening of ditches, install 

auxiliary canals and silting 

basins specially designed for 

each field, and plant along 

river easement near pineapple 

fields to prevent soil erosion. 

5. DMPI implements a block 

layout system depending 

on topography and utilises 

drone image for topography 

maps and hydrology analysis 

for a more accurate design. 

The Company also installs 

catchment basins in strategic 

locations around the field.

6. We use precision instruments 

for better land preparation to 

avoid soil compaction, crusting 

and damage to soil structure.

7. The Company makes use of a 

soil and water assessment tool 

programme to monitor the 

health status of our resources.

8. We also reinforce technical 

competency through continuous 

training and education on soil 

management to reduce soil 

erosion in our plantation. 

9. Our Drone Programme allows 

us to monitor the condition of 

the 26,100-hectare pineapple 

field in Bukidnon, Philippines.

CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION 

AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY 

In DMFI, we mitigate greenhouse 

gas (GHG) emissions and adapt our 

operations and supply chain to the 

potential impact of climate change. 

We also minimise carbon footprint 

by locating processing plants close 

to the fields where crops are grown.

1. Since 2009, DMFI has installed 

6,400 solar panels covering 

over 37 square kilometres and 

producing 1.2 MW or more 

than 8% of total electricity 

requirements during non-pack 

season at our primary tomato 

production facility in Hanford, 

California. DMFI is a member of 

the Environmental Protection 

Agency (EPA) Green Power 

Programme.

2. Del Monte’s Modesto plant 

installed a combined heat and 

power system, selective catalytic 

reduction unit, condensing 

economiser and backpressure 

turbine generator in its boiler 

system which cut natural gas use 

by 20%.

3. At least 50% of our facilities 

utilise our company-

wide programme to install 

condensing economisers and 

improve heat recovery and 

steam system efficiency. 

4. In the US, our crops are locally 

sourced and travel less than an 

average of 160 kilometres from 

the field to the manufacturing 

gate and an average of 560 

kilometres from distribution 

centre to retailer.

5. Six facilities installed condensing 

boiler stack economisers to 

use hot exhaust gases from 

boilers to preheat water in a 

heat-exchanger system which 

improves the operating efficiency 

of the boilers by up to 12%, 

reducing the amount of natural 

gas needed to run the boilers by 

the same percentage.

6. We have eliminated 3.7 million 

kilometres, the equivalent 

of approximately 1,476,310 

litres of diesel fuel, from our 

distribution network through 

a variety of initiatives.

7. DMFI is a participant in the US 

EPA’s SmartWay public-private 

programme that benchmarks 

freight transportation efficiency 

in an effort to improve 

supply chain sustainability.

8. Our carbon footprint in 

the Philippines has a net 

sequestration of 516,100 MT CO2 

making DMPI carbon negative.

9. Del Monte’s waste-to-energy 

converts the cannery’s 

wastewater into renewable 

energy. The facility generates 

2.8 MW of electricity and 

cleanses water discharged at

WASTE MANAGEMENT

We aim to reduce the overall 

consumption of raw materials in 

our operation. In line with this, we 

encourage the reuse of materials 

and promote responsible disposal. 

1. In the US, we benchmark our 

waste management practices 

and compare landfilling to 

recycling rates to ensure that we 

manage our waste streams in the 

most efficient manner possible. 

2. We instituted a “Ner0 (Near Zero) 

Landfill” policy where we aim to 

divert up to 98% of waste from 

reaching the landfill based on 

EPA’s Waste Reduction Hierarchy.

3. Our Walnut Creek Research 

Centre (WCRC) in California 

received a “RecycleSmart” Award 

from the Contra Costa Solid 

Waste Authority for our food 

waste recovery efforts.

4. WCRC diverts the food and 

packaging materials of unused 

food through the manual 

opening of pallets of non-

donatable packaged food, 

recycles the container and sends 

the food to compost for energy 

as part of a Food Recycling 

Project. 

5. WCRC is also certified as a Bay 

Area Green Business due to its 

efforts to conserve water, energy 

and waste, implement eco-

friendly materials and engage 

employees in conservation 

behaviour best practices. Our 

Headquarters are Leadership 

in Energy and Environmental 

Design (LEED) certified. 

6. We are actively involved in the 

Food Waste Reduction Alliance 

which is a collaborative effort 

between the Consumer Brands 

Association (formerly Grocery 

Manufacturers Association), Food 

Marketing Institute and National 

Restaurant Association.



7. In 2019, we joined the 

Sustainable Packaging Coalition 

to partner with leading packaging 

suppliers and consumer 

packaged goods companies 

to work toward sustainable 

packaging solutions that deliver 

delicious shelf-stable food.

8. We treat wastewater discharged 

from our agro-industrial facilities 

through effluent treatment plants.

9. In the Philippines, our high-

filtration extraction system 

processes excess juice into 

pineapple concentrate and syrup, 

significantly reducing volume of 

wastewater.

P R E S E R V I N G  N A T U R E

DEL MONTE PACIFIC LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2020




10. We do soil ripping in lieu of 

plowing to retain more organic 

matter on the top layer of the soil 

profile and incorporate pineapple 

plant residues in the field to 

maintain soil organic matter at 

desirable levels.

11. In the last ten years, we have 

reduced 3,077 MT of packaging 

materials.

12. Plantation-based families 

segregate domestic solid waste 

in their own homes. Recyclable 

materials collected from 

households are sold to fund 

community projects.

13. The DMPL office in Manila is LEED 

Silver-certified as it provides a 

framework for a healthy, highly 

efficient, and cost-saving green 

building. This certification is a 

globally recognised symbol of 

sustainability achievement. 

14. Our bottling plant implements 

a solid waste segregation 

programme in order to capture 

recyclable wastes and sell them 

as scrap materials.

Joint Del Monte and DEARBC tree planting activity “Protect Nature, 

Sustain our Future”

Del Monte supports reforestation

Forests contribute immensely 

to the biodiversity of the land. 

Unfortunately, the Philippines’ 

urbanisation, logging activities and 

burning of forests at the onset of 

planting (“kaingin system“) have 

reduced the country’s forest cover 

over time. Such destruction has 

caused biodiversity loss and soil 

erosion which can lead to landslides 

and flooding.

At Del Monte, we are mindful of the 

forests, the biodiversity that thrives 

therein, and their importance to 

communities. We do our share to 

increase the country’s forest cover 

by planting endemic and indigenous 

species. The former grow only in 

the country, while the latter are also 

found in other countries. Through 

the Del Monte Foundation and 

our partner, Del Monte Employees 

Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries 

Cooperative (DEARBC), we have to 

date planted over 500,000 trees to 

increase the forest cover around the 

plantation where we operate.

1. The Foundation has planted 

approximately 120,000 

indigenous trees in an area close 

to 50 hectares.

 

a.  These species are Kalamagan, 

Lambilohan, Narra, Itom-itom 

and Bitaug.

 

b.  Together with employee 

volunteers and training 

beneficiaries, the Foundation 

planted 15,100 trees in 

FY2020.

2. Our partner DEARBC has planted 

about 300,000 trees consisting 

of Bamboo, Abaca, endemic and 

commercial trees, which comprise 

about 25% of their reforestation 

goal on non-arable land.

3. The Plantation Environment 

Section of Del Monte 

Philippines, Inc (DMPI) planted 

about 130,000 assorted trees 

on 126 hectares of land, 

including 100 hectares in 

Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon.

 

4. DMPI has partnered with 

the Labour Management 

Cooperation (LMC) in its 

reforestation initiatives.

5. The Foundation partnered with 

an indigenous people (IP) group, 

MAMACILA (Mat-i, Man-ibay, 

Civoleg, Langguyod Higaonon 

Tribal Community, Inc), to 

establish a nursery of endemic 

tree seedlings to be used for the 

Foundation’s reforestation of the 

area assigned to DMPI by the 

local government unit of Claveria.

 

 

a.  The Foundation will provide 

financial and material 

assistance to the group for 

the nursery establishment. 

 

b.  MAMACILA will repay with

6. MAMACILA is intercropping 

Arabica coffee and native trees. 

About two-thirds of the trees 

being planted are coffee so that 

the IP farmers have a future 

source of livelihood.

7. Since the native trees grow 

slowly, the coffee plants provide 

them shade until the roles are 

reversed over time which the 

association calls “rainforestation”.

8. The Foundation planted 5,600 

coffee and Bamboo trees in 

Mt. Kitanglad over an additional 

reforestation area of four 

hectares.

 

a.  This is under the care and 

maintenance of 24 IP families 

who are residing at the foot 

of the mountain.

 

b.  Seven hectares have been 

planted with Arabica coffee, 

three hectares of which are 

already fruit-bearing, helping 

the IP caretakers generate 

income.

country;

 

b.  Whether transactions are 

material or not; and

 

c.  The nature of the business 

partner relationship. 

8. Del Monte in the US has an

DATA PROTECTION AND CYBERSECURITY

Information Technology Planning with Cesar R Canlas, IT Head 

1. DMPL also strengthens 

governance through data 

protection, privacy and 

cybersecurity. The Group has 

adopted a Data Privacy Manual 

and organisational, physical 

and technological measures 

to ensure the protection of 

personal data. Additionally, the 

Group conducts continuous 

training to build its employees’ 

competency in the area of 

personal data privacy. 

2. Recognising that IT assets are 

vital to support tactical business 

functions, the Group is currently 

in the process of revising its 

existing Information Security 

Policy to ensure that effective 

protection of information is 

communicated in a clear and 

consistent manner.

3. The Group is likewise 

committed to protecting its 

confidential business data 

and privacy of individuals. The 

same applies to cybersecurity 

laws and regulations 

which have also become 

increasingly more complex. 

4. DMFI takes data security and 

privacy very seriously and 

employs workstation encryption, 

blocks non-encrypted USB 

devices and utilises multi-

factor authentication on 

most applications. 

5. To ensure data protection in an 

unsecured environment, more 

features have been added to 

our endpoint protection, such 

as Endpoint Detection and 

Response. The cybersecurity 

programme is also being aligned 

with ISO27001:2013.

6. DMFI programmes its firewall 

content protection to enhance 

the endpoint protection 

capabilities and protect users 

from malicious websites or 

programmes.

7. DMFI implemented a work-

from-home scheme for 

employees using a system that 

allows web-enabled applications 

on personal computers, such as 

Okta apps like Box, RingCentral 

and Outlook Web Access, as 

Company data can never be 

stored on a personal computer. 

Technical support was also made 

available to the employees for 

other network concerns.

8. To sustain the programme, DMPI 

has rolled out the cybersecurity 

awareness and training initiative 

which was attended mostly by 

employees from the Philippines. 

The feedback gathered from the 

sessions will be used to improve 

the existing Information Security 

Policy which will be issued to 

the entire organisation as soon 

as the balance work on the 

programme is completed.

9. The Company made significant 

progress in the roll-out of 

Advanced Persistent Threat 

protection for end point 

systems, Encryption and Data 

Loss Protection systems to 

key end user devices and pilot 

departments, respectively.

10. DMPI mitigates cybersecurity 

risks to address the vulnerabilities 

that were identified during 

the Vulnerability Assessment 

and Penetration Testing of key 

Company websites.

11. The IT team ensures access to 

DMPI network for employees 

who work-from-home by 

regularly checking on internet 

access, networks, servers 

and systems. Technical 

guidelines were also provided 

to employees regarding 

syncing of emails via outlook, 

conducting virtual meetings 

and accessing the SAP system.

12. Del Monte in the Philippines 

implements and rolls out policies 

that are deployed and enforced 

in Data Loss Prevention. 

These policies are now at the 

monitoring, notification and 

management phases. Regular 

management, monitoring 

and periodic maintenance are 

also being done to the other 

cybersecurity implementations 

on network access control, 

network segmentation, advanced 

persistent threat protection and 

encryption.

13. Ongoing audit and assessment, 

in collaboration with Group 

Internal Audit through third-party 

consultants, are conducted to 

assess the effectiveness of the 

design and implementation of 

network segmentation, advanced 

persistent threat protection 

and data loss prevention and 

encryption.

PRIVACY

1. DMFI has been holding a bi-

annual Privacy Task Force to 

address privacy concerns and 

review changes in privacy laws 

and compliance.

2. We have engaged a third party to 

audit our systems and mitigate 

risks relating to data privacy and 

cyberattacks.

3. An awareness initiative on Data 

Privacy was also started in the 

Company, whose head was 

assigned as the official Data 

Privacy Officer to the Legal 

Department.

4. A survey assessed the level 

of awareness of employees 

concerning data privacy 

regulations. Of all the 

respondents handling private 

data, 51% are familiar with the 

general idea of the regulations.

DEL MONTE PACIFIC LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2020


Aside from these priorities, 

we also included in our report 

some emerging issues – soil 

management, talent management 

and data protection, privacy and 

cybersecurity. Moreover, the Group 

provided a section in this report 

on climate change adaptation, 

energy efficiency, plant breeding, 

corporate social responsibility and 

philanthropy as these are essential 

to our operations. In addition, we 

highlighted our response to the 

coronavirus pandemic.

STAKEHOLDER INCLUSIVENESS

Our sustainability journey begins 

with our stakeholders. We nurture 

meaningful relationships with 

our stakeholders to provide a 

better understanding of the 

Group’s operations, strengthen 

collaboration and engagement, 

improve communication and 

transparency, and identify and 

resolve stakeholder concerns.

The following outlines our key 

stakeholders and the manner 

in which we engage them and 

how they impact our operations. 

These stakeholder groups were 

identified according to their 

level of influence, interest and 

impact to the organisation. 

The Group needs to engage 

to be more transparent, to 

respond directly to stakeholder 

concerns, to identify potential 

risks and improve performance. 

REPORTING STANDARDS

We follow best practices and 

international guidelines in reporting 

our sustainability performance. The 

Group uses the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Sustainability 

Reporting guidelines as reference. 

The Group has integrated the 

sustainability strategies and 

embedded them in the long-range 

plan. Our Quality Policy, Code of 

Conduct, Code of Business Ethics 

and Sustainability and Environmental 

Policies enable us to comply with 

the standards set by the GRI. This is 

closely monitored and reported, as 

illustrated throughout this report.

The Group’s companies are 

members of several sustainability-

related organisations. For example, 

Del Monte in the United States 

is affiliated with the Stewardship 

Index for Specialty Crops, the US 

Environmental Protection Agency’s 

Pesticide Environmental Stewardship 



How We Engage Our Stakeholders

S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y  F R A M E W O R K

80

DEL MONTE PACIFIC LIMITED | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY2020




Strategic Planning and Sustainability Team led by Ignacio C O Sison, Chief Corporate Officer

Programme, Food Waste Reduction 

Alliance and Sustainable Packaging 

Coalition. Both US and Philippine 

companies are members of the 

Supplier Ethical Data Exchange.

We focus on building the long-

term resiliency of our business as 

we deepen our understanding of 

the global business environment 

while remaining mindful of 

the impact of our activities on 

the future of our planet.

We are guided by our vision, values 

and goals to provide health and 

wellness, environmental stewardship 

and employee welfare.

SCOPE AND INCLUSIVE PERIOD

Fully acknowledging our 

responsibility towards the future, the 

corporate sustainability team leads 

our efforts to increase sustainability 

advocacy among our stakeholders. 

Key leaders have been oriented on 

sustainability. 

Each business unit has identified 

its material sustainability issues by 

location which may differ from the 

Group’s material issues given the 

business model employed by the 

business units. As an example, our 

company in the Philippines does the 

cultivation, planting and harvesting of 

pineapples, while our US subsidiary 

uses contract growers to source its 

fruits, tomatoes and vegetables.

This Sustainability Report covers 

our financial year FY2020, from 

May 2019 to April 2020. We have 

excluded our Indian joint venture 

business from this report since its 

contribution to the total business 

is not material. Any US locations 

closed during FY2020 were removed 

from our data. 

Our goal is to promote social responsibility,  

environmental stewardship and sustainable growth

REPUTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS

Enhance the Company’s reputation 

with stakeholders, including investors, 

credit institutions, customers, 

employees and business partners

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE

Improve business performance by 

generating operational efficiency 

and cost savings through a more 

sustainable business model

RISK MANAGEMENT AND 

COMPLIANCE 

Promote risk management and 

compliance to avoid penalties by 

catching risks early on and taking 

action to mitigate them

BRAND EQUITY 

Boost the brand equity of the 

Company through a more 

sustainable social, environmental 

and economic performance
