ABOUT

US

The	Group	had	its	beginnings	in	1976	when	Casa	(S)	Pte.	Ltd.	was	set	up	to	market	and	distribute	Faber	

Cooker hoods. Since then, the Group has forged partnerships with some exclusive brand names for home 

appliances,	 consumer	 electronics	 and	 bathroom	 fixtures	 from	 Europe.	 During	 the	 year,	 we	 brought	 in	

cookware products under the Westinghouse brand, and launched a new brand, Kith, as our part of our 

strategy to expand our product range and extend our reach to a different consumer segment. Rubine also 

added ceiling fan to its product line this year.

ABOUT THIS REPORT

This	 is	 the	 third	 Sustainability	 Report	 (“Report”)	 of	 Casa	 Holdings	 Limited	 (“The	 Group”).	 The	 Report	

addresses	 the	 Group’s	 distribution	 activities	 for	 the	 financial	 year	 from	 1	 October	 2019	 to	 30	 September	

2020 (“FY2020”), as property development and construction activities were minimal. Associated companies 

and joint venture activities were excluded from this Report as the operational controls are held by different 

management teams. 

The Report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core 

Option.  We chosen the GRI Standards as it provides a set of extensive framework that is largely accepted as 

a global standard for sustainability reporting. 

Information	contained	in	this	Report	has	not	been	verified	by	an	independent	third	party.				

The Group will continue to incorporate sustainability initiatives in its business process to enhance its 

sustainability journey in the areas of environmental, social and governance aspects. We will share more in 

our subsequent reports on an annually basis. 

An electronic edition of this Report is made available for download on our website at  

www.casaholdings.com.sg and the website of the SGX-ST at www.sgx.com. 

We welcome stakeholders to provide us with feedback and suggestions on this Report. You may contact us

MESSAGE FROM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

GOVERNANCE

STRUCTURE

Dear Stakeholders,

The	Board	of	Directors	(“Board”)	is	pleased	to	present	the	Group’s	Sustainability	Report	(“Report”)	for	the	financial	

year	ended	30	September	2020	(“FY2020”).		

This	year,	we	announced	a	successor	to	CEO	Mr	Lim	Soo	Kong:	Mr	Stefan	Lim	has	been	appointed	as	Deputy	

CEO of the Group on 15 January 2020 to assist the CEO in managing all aspects of the Group’s business. With Mr 

Stefan	Lim	we	found	an	excellent	successor	for	the	position	of	CEO	in	bringing	the	Group	to	the	next	level.		

FY2020	had	been	an	unprecedented	year	filled	with	many	unexpected	events.	The	COVID-19	pandemic	had	

created	many	unforeseen	challenges	around	the	world.	Lockdowns,	closed	borders,	safe	distancing	measures	

had caused demand and supply chain disruption to businesses. Many businesses, especially retail and tourism 

sectors, were unfavourably hit.  

Our businesses were affected during the April 2020 to June 2020 Circuit Breaker (“CB”) period when our dealers 

had to suspend operations of their physical stores. Fortunately for Casa, we are considered as one of the essential 

service	providers	during	CB	fulfilling	goods	delivery	for	online	retailers	and	providing	after	sales	repair	service	for	

our products.   

We would like to thank our valued shareholders, dealers, suppliers, service providers, bankers, business associates, 

as	well	as	our	staff,	for	their	continued	support	of	the	Group	in	the	challenging	times	of	COVID-19.	We	strive	to	

continue to enhance our sustainability efforts to emerging stronger in the new normal. 

Sustainability governance of the Group is led by the Board of Directors and supported by all levels in the 

Organisation. 

We believe that strong governance is vital to a sustainable business. We are committed to continuously 

strengthening our governance structure to deliver sustainable values to our stakeholders.

STAKEHOLDER

ENGAGEMENT

The	pandemic	has	redefined	how	the	Group	engage	with	our	stakeholders.	We	turn	to	technology	to	continue	

our operation of essential services during the Circuit Breaker period where we engage our employees using virtual 

meeting platforms and other telecommuting tools.   

The closed borders had made air travel almost impossible, as such we attended virtual trade shows and also used 

online portals to continue to engage with our suppliers. 

The	unexpected	emergence	and	development	of	COVID-19	had	impacted	consumers	buying	behaviour,	promoting	

online trade when physical stores were forced to shut down during Circuit Breaker. Recognising that online 

engagement is key to create a sustainable business, the Group conclude that we need to create touchpoints in the 

digital space to engage consumers directly. With that, we begin to conceive the setup of an online store and social 

media channel to reach out to consumers.   

Key	stakeholders	are	identified	based	on	their	dependence	and	influence	on	our	business.

The Group adopt both formal and informal channels of communication to understand the needs of our key 

stakeholders. We observed safe-distancing measures while engaging with our stakeholders. This year, we used 

more virtual tools to engage our stakeholders and the following table highlights our key stakeholders, their key 

concerns and mode of engagement:

POLICIES, PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE IN

RELATION TO THE MATERIAL ESG TOPICS

We promote healthy lifestyles among employees through 

organizing health screening and health talks for our workforce, 

circulating of  health tips, such as infection control and good 

personal hygiene, at conspicuous spaces in the office and 

regular	health	food	distribution	to	encourage	a	fit	and	healthy	

workforce. 

We procure masks, sanitizers and distribute health care packs 

to our staff to ensure their well-being are taken care of while 

performing	essential	tasks	during	these	difficult	times.	We	also	

bought masks for our employees’ young ones as our way to 

care for the welfare of the family of our employees during the 

COVID-19.	

The Company has set up alternate work teams of employees 

to make sure that staff of each team is physically separated to 

prevent risk of infection between teams. We also cross-train our 

workforce and have in place covering arrangement to reduce 

disruptions. The above is made possible by our IT department, 

who were swift to respond to ensure our workforce are 

equipped with the necessary hardwares and softwares to allow 

them to  perform their tasks while working from home.

We have developed procedures related to visitor and staff 

temperature screening and follow-up responses. The Company 

will	 monitor	 closely	 the	 COVID-19	 related	 developments	

and follow advisories on the Ministry of Health and other 

government agencies’ websites. 

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

To build a stronger working relationship across all levels, the 

Group ensure that ready channels, such as an employee 

feedback box, are available for employees to communicate with 

us. 

We recognise the importance of discussions in clearing up 

misunderstandings and preserving harmonious relations. We 

have procedure in place for the handling of any employee’s 

grievances. 

Our management team regularly engage with the staff through 

periodic meetings. This practice fosters communication, 

cooperation, mutual trust and respect among employees. 

We organise regular get-together sessions for our staff. This year 

we had a BBQ party for our December 2019 ‘Glow in the Dark’ 

year end dinner with our staff. We also handed out long service 

awards to our long serving employees as our appreciation of 

their support for the past years. We also had a ‘Welcome Year 

2020 Breakfast’ to reiterate CASACODE and our employee code 

REACHOUT to promote the culture of working together and 

keeping employee focused on the Group’s priority in putting our 

customers	first.		

With social distancing in place, we are unable to physically 

gather. However, the Group is committed to continue to engage 

our workforce through newsletters, our notice board, emails, 

and digital workspace that we have set up. We had a different 

National	Day	celebration	this	year	to	commemorate	Singapore’s	

55th Birthday. Food tarts and kuih bahulu were distributed to 

staff along with care packs containing hand sanitizers and 

masks.

SOCIAL – SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

ENGAGING OUR SUPPLIERS

Given the border closures, we are unable to visit our suppliers’ factories. However, we continue to engage 

with our suppliers by holding regular online meetings to give feedback and take on their feedback and 

formulate action plans where possible to enhance the sustainability of our partnership. 

Our	suppliers	are	expected	to	meet	our	required	specifications	and	reliably	and	safely	deliver	products	that	

are of consistent quality. 

Our major suppliers are selected based on track record, their ability to deliver quality products and services 

on time, competitive pricing, environmentally sustainable and high ethical standards that adhere to our 

sustainability practices. 

The Group is on constant lookout for new products to add to our product range. We attend relevant online 

trade shows to seek collaboration with new business partners to broaden our product offering to customers. 

CUSTOMERS SATISFACTION AND PRIVACY

Our future is dependent on our ability to maintain a strong customer relationship with our dealers and 

consumers. We strive to supply quality products and provide reliable services, both pre and after sales 

services to our customers. 

Our	 after-sales	 service	 centre	 is	 staffed	 with	 trained	 customer	 service	 officers	 and	 technicians	 to	 assist	

customers who require after-sales service. Customers can make inquiries through CASA’s Service Hotline 

and request service appointment via our website. 

We value feedback from our customers and customers can submit their feedback via our website. We 

follow up on customer feedback on a timely basis. The Group will continue to improve our service standards 

through customers’ feedback. 

The	Group	protects	the	privacy	of	our	customers’	information.	Our	Personal	Data	Protection	Policy	clearly	

defines our approach to personal data management. The privacy of our customers is of paramount 

importance. While we collect personal data in the furtherance of our business activities, we do not sell, 

rent, or give away personal data of our customers to third parties for commercial purposes. There were no 

instances	on	breaches	of	customer	confidential	information	during	the	reporting	period.	

During the period of circuit breaker, we recognised the importance of having a channel to directly engage 

with our consumers. We launched our CASA E-shop to create a new touchpoint to reach out to our 

consumers	 directly,	 where	 consumers	 can	 view	 the	 products	 and	 brands	 we	 offer,	 find	 relevant	 product	

information, and above all, get to know CASA.   

PRODUCT HEALTH MANAGEMENT

Product	safety	is	our	utmost	priority.	To	ensure	that	the	Group	remains	at	the	forefront	of	quality	assurance,	

we are committed to conform to well-recognised industry standards and regulatory requirements. 

We carry only home appliances that comply with mandatory requirements prescribed by the respective 

agencies. Furthermore, we take customers’ safety as a top priority; we act timely and responsibly when 

incidents are envisaged to happen to protect our customers from unnecessary harm. 

To ensure economic sustainability of the Group, we hold our suppliers liable for product defects whenever 

practicable whereby costs associated with defective product are claimed from suppliers to the extent 

possible. Furthermore, should there be cases of claims from customers pertaining to damage to properties 

owing to products defect, we are covered by product liability insurance.

We endeavour to strengthen the ethical environment and promote professional conduct within the Group. 

We have a Code of Conduct that is communicated to all employees. It provides detailed guidelines to ensure 

that	employees’	business	conduct	is	consistent	with	ethical	standards.	The	Policy	also	requires	all	employees	

to declare any direct or indirect interest in, or relationship with other businesses and organisations where 

potential	conflicts	of	interest	may	arise.	In	addition,	all	employees	are	required	to	return	a	nil	declaration	at	

least once a year.

In FY2020, there were no reported case of corruption.

Whistle Blowing Policy

A whistle blowing policy is in place to aid in the deterrence and reporting of corporate malpractice and 

misconducts. The policy provides the mechanisms where employees of the Group may, in good faith and 

in	confidence,	submit	incident	or	concern	about	possible	corporate	malpractices	and	misconducts	or	other	

matters directly to the Chairman of Audit Committee. 

Details	of	the	whistle	blowing	policy	have	been	made	available	to	all	employees.	Through	a	well-defined	

procedure, all reported incident or concern will be duly and independently investigated and handled with 

appropriate	 measures.	 The	 Chairman	 of	 Audit	 Committee	 will	 ensure	 the	 confidentiality	 and	 anonymity	

of the employee reporting the incident or concern to the fullest extent reasonably practicable within the 

requirements of the law. 

Due	to	confidentiality,	the	Chairman	of	Audit	Committee	shall	table	to	the	Audit	Committee	during	its	half	

yearly	meetings	only	the	number	of	reported	cases.	The	full	report	will	be	submitted	under	confidential	

cover to the Audit Committee. For serious reported incidents or concerns, the Chairman of Audit Committee 

shall	submit	its	report	under	confidential	cover	to	the	Audit	Committee	via	circulation	or	through	a	special	

Audit Committee meeting arranged as soon as possible. 

The Audit Committee shall review the report, advise, and authorise the Chairman of Audit Committee of an 

appropriate action to be taken against the investigated incident or concern. Where appropriate or required, 

we	will	file	a	formal	report	with	the	relevant	government	authorities	for	further	investigation	or	action.	

In	FY2020,	we	are	not	aware	of	any	incident	or	concern,	confirmed	or	suspected.
