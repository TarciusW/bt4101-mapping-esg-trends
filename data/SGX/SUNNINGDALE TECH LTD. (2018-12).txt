Statement

dEAR STAkEhOldERS,

On behalf of the Board of directors 

(“the Board”) of Sunningdale Tech 

ltd (“Sunningdale” or “the group”), 

i am pleased to present our second 

Sustainability Report. 

Sunningdale is a leading one-stop 

precision plastic engineering company 

that supplies to the global market and 

plays an integral role across several 

worldwide supply chains. The group’s 

global presence spans across nine 

countries with 20 manufacturing 

locations serving a diverse customer 

base and wide product offering.

Our emphasis has always been on 

the long-term sustainability of our 

operations, backed by continued 

innovation 

and 

investments 

into 

technology. in this regard, the group’s 

Sustainability Steering Committee 

strives to instil core values and a 

culture that reflects our commitment 

to 

social 

and 

environmental 

responsibility. 

in our second Sustainability Report, 

we expanded our scope from the 

previous year which detailed our 

policies, case studies and success 

rates over the period at our Singapore 

manufacturing site. in this report, we 

have included two other significant 

operations at our plants in Johor, 

Malaysia and Batam, indonesia. 

For 

FY2018, 

our 

materiality 

assessment re-evaluated material 

topics from the previous year. 

Together with key personnel from 

various departments in addition to 

internal and external feedback from 

stakeholders, we concluded that 

the five key material topics remain. 

Our list of eSg matters for reporting 

include Occupational Health and 

Safety, ethics, Bribery and Corruption, 

Waste Management, Health and 

Safety of our Customers, and Material 

use in our processes.  

PROTECTInG ThE EnvIROnMEnT

at Sunningdale, we view environmental 

sustainability as a top priority. We do 

our utmost in ensuring our supply 

chain processes are environmentally 

friendly while employing different 

strategies to minimise damage to 

the environment. during FY2018, we 

continued to maintain our track record 

of zero chemical spills and zero cases 

of improper waste disposal. 

Additionally, our proactive approach 

to reducing and reusing raw materials 

has translated to lower operating 

costs while allowing us to partake in 

conserving earth’s finite resources. 

Our four-pronged strategy which 

includes the monitoring and review 

of processes, control measures, 

generating awareness amongst staff 

and process optimisation continues to 

yield positive results in safeguarding 

the environment.

dEvElOPInG OuR huMAn CAPITAl

at Sunningdale, the key determinant 

of our success is the strength and 

depth of our talent pool. We remain 

committed to developing our human 

capital by attracting the right talent, 

developing 

our 

employees 

and 

retaining them for the long term. 

We firmly believe that a committed 

workforce and a positive workplace 

help to drive innovation and creativity. 

To deliver on our promise to be a fair 

and equal employer, we continue 

to ensure that we are providing our 

employees with a positive working 

environment that is among the best in 

our industry. 

Having 

operations 

in 

numerous 

countries, Sunningdale is committed 

to ensuring the health and safety 

of all our employees across all our 

operations around the world. as part 

of this commitment, we continue to 

invest in creating a safe and healthy 

working environment that adheres 

to the highest of industry standards 

by 

implementing 

comprehensive 

measures 

and 

policies 

to 

systematically ensure and enhance 

workplace safety and occupational 

health.

Sunningdale 

has 

established 

a 

Quality, environmental, Occupational 

Health &amp; Safety (“QeHS”) policy that 

is supported by various initiatives 

to ensure that employees work 

in optimum conditions. This year, 

Sunningdale included food safety in its 

QeHS policy by adopting the Hazard 

Analysis and Control Critical Points 

(“HaCCP”) and good Manufacturing 

Practice (“gMP”) as we understand 

the importance behind the quality of 

our products that comes into contact 

with food. 

Regular 

training 

sessions 

on 

environmental, Health and Safety 

(“eHS”) issues as well as training on 

the appropriate use of machinery are 

also scheduled for all our employees. 

For employee welfare, we also 

make certain that our employees 

are equipped with the appropriate 

protective equipment such as safety 

shoes, goggles and gloves along with 

periodic maintenance of equipment to 

ensure safety. 

BuSInESS EThICS undERPIn OuR 

ORGAnISATIOn

at Sunningdale, we believe that strong 

corporate governance is key to a 

sustainable business. Our adherence 

to the highest standards of corporate 

governance continues to translate to 

productive collaborations and has set 

us apart from our peers in terms of 

improving our competitiveness in the 

global market.

at Sunningdale, we do not tolerate 

corruption in any form. This has been 

made clear to our employees, our 

suppliers and our business partners. 

We maintain a Code of Business 

Ethics and Conduct which outlines 

clear expectations for every employee, 

guiding our decision making in all 

aspects of the business. dedicated 

whistle-blowing channels are setup 

so that employees are able to report 

wrongdoings within the organisation 

confidentially. all matters raised 

through this channel are looked into 

and addressed by an official whistle-

blowing committee. For FY2018, 

there were no cases of corruption nor 

whistle-blowing incidents. 

Sustainability will continue to be 

central to who we are and how we 

operate. We strive to put safety first 

in all we do. as a worldwide leader 

in precision plastic engineering, 

Sunningdale 

is 

committed 

to 

protecting our customers who we 

remain fortunate to serve. We will 

look to build upon our success in 

2018, while investing in doing what is 

right for our employees, customers, 

shareholders and the environment.

at Sunningdale, we strongly emphasise the need to address the eSg issues which are material to our business and 

stakeholders. in July 2017 last year, we conducted our first formal materiality assessment under the guidance of 

independent sustainability consultants. The materiality assessment was a four-step approach as outlined in Figure 5 

below. in order to ensure that our material topics remain relevant this year, the topics are reviewed and re-evaluated once 

again by the representatives from Sunningdale. By involving key personnel from various departments as well as taking 

into consideration both internal and external stakeholders’ feedback, we concluded that our material topics that were 

identified last year remain applicable and relevant in 2018, as shown in Figure 6 below.

an exhaustive list of potential environmental, Social, and governance 

(“eSg”) matters was identified by independent sustainability 

consultants through desktop research, benchmarking reviews and 

discussions with Sunningdale’s management. 

The matters identified in Step 1 were rated and prioritised in terms 

of importance by representatives from the various departments, 

taking into consideration both an internal and external stakeholders’ 

perspective. 

Material matters that were identified from Step 2 were presented to 

the Board for their validation and approval.

in the subsequent financial years, these identified material matters 

will be reviewed and reassessed for their continued relevance and 

importance to Sunningdale.

Sunningdale reaffirms the importance of strong business ethics to the success 

of the organisations. By upholding a high standard of corporate governance

The Code of Business ethics and Conduct is overseen by a committee comprising the CeO, Chief Financial Officer, 

Human Resource director, and internal audit manager. all anti-corruption policies and practices are communicated 

to and approved by the board.

To ensure the compliance of the relevant stakeholders to our policies on “ethics, bribery and corruption”, Sunningdale 

has instituted several practices and initiatives summarised in Figure 8 below. To evaluate the performance and 

improve our internal controls, internal audits are performed quarterly by the respective audit and risk committee for 

each operation site.

conducts regular internal compliance audits.

and online database 

We ensure that all vendors acknowledge and sign our Code of Business Ethics 

and Conduct form within our Vendor Survey Form, which is uploaded to an 

online database. We conduct due diligence to ensure that suppliers comply with 

all laws and regulations.

Owing to Sunningdale’s strong internal code of conduct, there were no cases of known corruption in both 2017 and 

2018. There were no whistle-blowing cases during this period. 

To evaluate the performance and improve our internal controls, we have implemented the practice of Control Self-

assessment (“CSa”) through completion of a questionnaire annually to track if there are significant material issues 

to be resolved. This acts as a supplement in the conduct of internal audits for which results are reported quarterly for 

review by the audit and risk committee.

SOCIAl

PROFIlE OF OuR wORkFORCE

Sunningdale understands that the key to any business lies in the management and nurturing of its staff. at the end of 

FY2018, we had 3510 employees1, a slight decrease compared to FY2017 where we had 3627 employees. The decrease 

was largely a result of natural attrition in Malaysia and there was no replacement of headcount in order to improve cost 

efficiency and productivity. The proportion of male to female employees for both years remained consistent at 53% male 

and 47% females. For our operations in Singapore and Malaysia, staffs were primarily on permanent contracts with only 

2 temporary staff hired in Malaysia in 2018. due to the nature of our business in Batam, most of our full-time staff are 

on temporary contract, in line with the labour law in indonesia. To meet the high business demand and to replace the 

employee turnovers at one of our facilities in Malaysia, we have hired a significant number of contract workers2. in FY 2018, 

our total number of contract workers across all three countries was 960, an increase from 939 in FY 2017.

1   an employee refers to an individual who is in an employment relationship with the organisation, according to national law or its application.

2 Contract workers carry out similar roles performed by employees such as operators, technicians, leaders, material and store handlers.

Though Sunningdale takes proactive efforts to reduce any risk of occupational health and safety, we have also 

established various channels of feedback for employees and stakeholders. Should employees or any stakeholders 

have any feedback or concerns with regards to our occupational health and safety practices, they can write in to csrs@

sdaletech.com, raise a case through the whistle-blowing mechanism, or approach the eHS Committee directly.

in addition to the QeHS policy, several initiatives have been introduced to ensure that workplace injuries, fatalities and 

diseases are kept at a minimum. These key initiatives are summarised in Figure 13 below.

in order to ensure that the health and safety of workers are taken care of, resources are allocated to manage the 

different aspects of Sunningdale’s operation, such as personnel chemical exposure monitoring, examination and 

testing of local exhaust ventilation, ambient air monitoring, boundary noise monitoring, employee audiometric test, 

medical surveillance program, eHS Promotion day, PPe and cranes and towers servicing. Figure 14 above shows the 

amount of resources allocated towards managing eHS. as there are three manufacturing sites in Malaysia, one in 

Singapore and one in indonesia, the amount of resources allocated in Malaysia was more than the other two countries. 

The significant increase in resources allocated in Malaysia was largely due to the inclusion in cost of PPe in FY 2018 at 

one of our sites (not included in FY 2017), and the increase in cost of waste water discharged was due to a breakdown 

of ink waste treatment machine at another site, which contributed to a large amount of ink waste disposed directly by 

licensed contractor without treatment.

annually, Sunningdale carries out a chemical spill drill refresher training to the 

Chemical Spill Team (“CST”) as shown in Figure 15 below. The aim of this drill 

is to allow the team to recap on the procedure of the containment of chemical 

spillage so that the team can respond swiftly and calmly should any spillage 

occur. The drill is conducted in the following sequence:

1) assess the risk: any staff who witness the spillage should inform the area 

supervisor who will alert the CST, while the rest of the employees should 

cordon off the spill area.

2) Spill response: CST follows the protocol on identifying the chemical, donning 

of the PPe, and take appropriate action to stop and confine the spillage.

3) incident reporting/investigation: CST will investigate the cause of spillage 

and the Manager or Supervisor should adopt the incident reporting and 

investigation procedure.

due to the nature of the work 

we do at Sunningdale, there is 

a risk of our staff developing 

operational 

diseases 

such 

as 

hearing and eyesight loss. While 

we have taken strict precautions to 

reduce risks through mechanical 

and administrative controls, we 

recognise that all employees at 

Sunningdale have an individual 

responsibility to ensure safety at 

the workplace. as such, we have 

extensive training programs for 

our staff to understand the role that 

they play in ensuring their safety. 

For individuals who have already 

developed operational diseases 

such as hearing loss, we have also 

implemented several programs to 

ensure that their diseases do not 

progress any further. The details 

of these programs are provided 

below:

1. EhS orientation for new 

employees

 

every new hire at Sunningdale 

is required to undergo eHS 

orientation to ensure that all 

employees are aware of our 

QeHS policy and practices. 

This is to reduce the likelihood 

of harm that a new individual 

might pose to himself and his 

fellow 

co-workers. 

during 

these trainings, topics such 

as the use of earplugs during 

instances 

where 

they 

are 

exposed to noise are covered.

2. Taking care of the well-being 

of our employees

 

For staff who has been identified 

to be suffering for hearing loss, 

additional measures have been 

put in place to ensure that their 

conditions do not worsen. 

These measures include:

• Conducting a yearly refresher 

course which reinforces best 

personal practices to reduce 

damage from noise

• Maintaining a register of 

individuals who are working 

in a high noise environment 

to monitor them

• engaging an external party to 

conduct a yearly audiometric 

test for selected employees 

who are exposed to excessive 

noise levels

in addition to taking care of hearing loss, Sunningdale 

also conducts yearly eye-checks for selected employees. 

This is an important procedure as poor eyesight can 

affect factors such as depth perception which can affect 

the operation of machinery and increase the likelihood of 

incidents to occur. 

at Sunningdale, we are constantly striving towards 

the goal of zero workplace injury rates within all our 

operations. For FY2018 performance, Figure 17 provides 

an overview to Sunningdale eHS performance, broken 

down at a regional and level. Overall, there was a 

decrease in the rate of workplace injuries5 between 

FY2017 (1048 injury rate) and FY2018 (741 injury rate) 

among employees, and zero injury rate among contract 

workers. details of the instance of injuries that occurred 

have been presented in Figure 18. in all instances, follow-

up investigations were conducted to identify the source 

of hazards at the workplace. Corrective action such as 

staff briefing and the introduction of new safety protocols 

were introduced to address the likelihood of such injuries 

from reoccurring at the workplace. The reduction in 

accident frequency and severity rates are a testament to 

Sunningdale’s commitment to safety at the workplace. 

although Sunningdale has yet to achieve its target of zero 

injury rate, we have made significant progress towards 

this goal.









5   Workplace injury Rate is calculated as the total number of fatal and non-fatal workplace injuries per 100,000 employees, as defined by the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”)

The health and safety of our customers remain a key 

concern to Sunningdale as an organisation. Breaches to 

health and safety of our customers can have a significant 

impact on the reputation of Sunningdale as a provider 

of quality products and negatively impact our business. 

Beyond the importance of customer health and safety 

towards building trust amongst our customers, we 

believe it is a moral imperative to ensure that no one is 

harmed during the use of our products. As Sunningdale 

manufactures products based on our customers’ 

specification, we are restricted in our ability to modify 

the product designs. however, Sunningdale takes 

necessary precautions to ensure that our operations 

comply with requirements from the relevant authorities 

and takes steps to safeguard the quality of our products 

wherever possible. 

For the reporting matter of health 

and safety of our customers, the 

overarching policy which governs 

it is the QeHS policy as detailed 

in the Occupational Health and 

Safety section of the report. in 

taking care of the interests of 

our customers, we do also have 

channels for their feedback.

To ensure the safety of our 

products, we have a well-defined 

process 

and 

procedure 

to 

manage the safety of the product 

from its inception to the end of 

the supply chain. Supporting 

these procedures are a team of 

Quality Assurance (“QA“) team 

who are tasked with investigating 

customer complaints and the 

implementation of product safety 

protocols. These processes and 

procedures are detailed in Figure

One of the most important cornerstones of our initiatives to ensure “health and safety of our customers” is the 

“i Care” program. This training program is conducted yearly for operational staff and biyearly for administrative 

staff by the operations manager and is primarily concerned with educated employees about health and safety 

risks as well as on observing all related practices. The aspects covered by the program are:

• ethics

• Key Operational Practices 

• Current good Manufacturing Practices 

• good documentation Practices 

The specific details of the training program are updated yearly to ensure that potential gaps in safety procedures 

are filled.

at Sunningdale, we take all customer complaints with respect to “health and safety of our customers” seriously. 

We make sure that all complaints are investigated and the appropriate steps are taken to rectify the problem. 

1) Prevention of pests

One of the products manufactured by Sunningdale 

are scoops for infant milk powder. We have received 

complaints from a client that a live lizard was likely 

introduced to their manufacturing room from bringing 

in our yellow tote (contain bags of scoops inside) into 

the room. additionally, a dead ant was found on the 

packaging of a scoop. To identify how the pest entered 

the yellow tote containing the products, a root cause 

analysis was carried out. From the analysis, these 

corrective actions were carried out:

• Placing layer pad on the pallet before palletising with 

yellow tote

• updating the packaging material used for our products

• issuance of a quality alert to all production and Qa 

personnel to create awareness of the issues 

Sunningdale takes complaints about the eHS aspects of 

our products to our clients seriously and will continue 

investigating until all potential eHS issues are eliminated 

from our products.

2) Rectification of safety lock issue

at Sunningdale, one of the products that we produce 

is that of safety locks for a major home appliance 

manufacturer. This lock is used as a safety mechanism 

to ensure that a clothes iron does not accidentally 

dismount when it is turned on but not in use. This safety 

mechanism ensures that accidental burns do not occur. 

One of the complaints we received about our safety 

mechanism was the jamming of the safety mechanism, 

preventing the clothes iron from dismounting when it 

was intended to be used. This problem was caused by an 

issue on the front lock release button. This resulted in 

the poor fit of the component, thus leading to problems 

in the final assembly of the safety mechanism. To resolve 

this issue, the following steps were taken:

• The contact areas of the components were analysed 

and measurement data were collected

• The data collected were analysed against the product 

specification and the dimensions of the specifications 

were corrected

• in Sunningdale’s in-process control criteria, an 

additional criterion regarding the dimension of the 

product was added to ensure that the product meets 

its specification

One of the most important steps in ensuring the high quality of our products to meet eHS requirements is in the Qa 

step. This step can be fairly labour intensive and there is a possibility for lapses to occur which can significantly affect 

the safety of our products. Recently, we have been investing in automation to improve the quality and efficiency of our 

manufacturing. Below provides two such examples of our automation program.

Case Study 5: Automation

SOCIAl









1) Online camera inspection system

Before automation, scoops were manually screened by 

trained staff to detect color variations and contamination 

after the moulding process. To improve the process, 

Sunningdale invested in an On-line Camera inspection 

machine (Figure 20). This system is able to detect 

discolored scoops by using a 5M pixel color camera 

which is far more accurate than using a camera 

operator. in addition, the system stores all the images in 

an archive which allows for greater accountability of our 

manufacturing process. 

2) Tip degating and tray insertion

Before the automation, the manual gate cut and 

insertion of tips into the tray occasionally damage the tip 

which has a thin wall. To improve the quality of the tip as 

well as reduce labour, the robot picks up the moulded 

tip and places them into the degating machine and 

subsequently inserts the degated tips into the tray with 

precision and accuracy, hence eliminating damaged tips 

due to mishandling.

For an island nation like Singapore, where land is 

a valuable resource and space constraints pose 

major challenges, appropriate waste management 

practices have been a constant concern for the small 

but economically strong city-state. Furthermore, 

increasing waste output acts as a threat to many 

preventive measures adopted today. At Sunningdale, 

we firmly believe that effective waste management, a 

result of thoughtful and rigorous planning, is not only 

beneficial for the environment but also for protecting 

the health of our community at large.

Sunningdale is committed to 

some of the most effective waste 

management practices in the 

industry. in 2017, we adopted the 

QeHS Policy, which we strictly 

adhere to always. a description 

of the policy is provided in Figure 

11 above. as a corporate seeking 

to manage our environmental 

responsibilities in a systematic 

manner, we have also put in 

place iSO14001 environmental 

Management System for all 

sites covered in this scope of 

reporting.

Adopting a four-pronged strategy (employee awareness, process optimisation, control measures and periodic review), 

supported by certain initiatives, Sunningdale effectively tackles an increase in waste production and integrate positive 

waste management practices as an integral part of our day-to-day operations. This strategy and its constituent initiatives 

have been detailed in Figure 24 below.

Majority of the waste produced in our facilities are plastic 

components such as runners and rejected parts. Other 

major sources of waste include paint sludge, wooden 

pallets leftover from supplier deliveries, and packaging 

material, all of which we ultimately send to recycling 

companies. For this endeavour, we engage a licensed 

contractor who is authorised to collect such items, get 

them recycled and finally, sell them across relevant 

industries.

Other indirect supplies that re-cycling are the files that 

we use to organise our printed documents. We will take 

documents that are filed, packed them and recycle our 

files for recent year documentations purpose.  

in addition, we implemented a wastewater treatment at 

one of our Malaysian operating sites, from which water 

is removed and the dry sludge (hazardous waste) is 

collected to dispose by a designated license contractor. 

We send the wastewater to our de-watering system 

(“dWS”) for treatment by adding chemical additives to 

separate wastewater and residual (dry sludge). With 

this initiative, we were able to treat all the wastewater 

generated by our industrial facilities, with 75 – 80% 

of the treated water being flushed into the drain after 

conducting verification, hence meeting all regulatory 

requirements and cost savings through reduction in the 

amount of waste transported by license contractor.





during the course of manufacturing, many of our product inputs come in plastic totes, plastic pallets, wooden pallets 

and cartons. These items are used as part of the packaging and delivery process to Sunningdale. Figure 25 below 

shows the amount of packaging waste recycled by Sunningdale.

One of the key costs involved in our operations results from the disposal 

of waste from our facilities. as the costs required for disposal is 

calculated based on the weight of the waste, there is a strong incentive 

for us to invest in ways to reduce the weight of waste being produced. 

The dewatering system allows us to extract water from our waste, 

thereby reducing the overall weight of the solid waste, in the form of 

dry sludge, produced in our operations. The introduction of this system 

resulted in a significant decrease in the cost of waste disposal, where 

we saw reductions to about 60% of waste by weight. This initiative 

demonstrates the strong business incentive to invest in technologies to 

reduce the amount of waste we produce.

From Figure 27 above, our total hazardous waste has 

increased from 710.9 tonnes in FY2017 to 1,419.2 tonnes 

in FY2018, while our non-hazardous waste has decreased 

from 1,434.3 tonnes in FY2017 to 1,428.1 tonnes in FY2018. 

in Figure 28, the significant increase in hazardous waste 

recovered resulted from an increase in plastic waste 

produced at one of our Malaysia site due to a change in 

customer’s requirement. The disposal of old lacquering 

fixture that utilises an old composition of re-palletising 

resin also contributes to the plastic waste. in addition, 

the significant increase in hazardous waste incinerated 

was due to a breakdown of ink waste treatment machine 

at one of our Malaysia site, which contributed to a large 

amount of ink waste disposed directly by licensed 

contractor without treatment.

in Figure 29, the increase in non-hazardous waste under 

“Recovery” was mainly due to the increase in paper and 

carton waste produced at one of our operating sites in 

Malaysia as there is   an increase in production lines for 

our new projects. The increase under “incineration” was 

due to an increase in general waste resulting from a 

renovation at Singapore’s production shop floor to cater 

for  the increase of activities and manpower. The increase 

in non-hazardous waste disposed through “landfill” was 

due to an increase in general waste disposed as there 

was an increase in daily cleaning activities within our 

Malaysia production premises to fulfil our new healthcare 

customer’s requirement.

At Sunningdale, we recognise the importance 

of employing raw materials in a manner 

that is coherent with the best sustainability 

practices. Moreover, the responsible use 

of raw materials genuinely contributes to 

lower operating costs for us and allows us 

to play a major role in conserving the earth’s 

increasingly finite resources. 

Our customers enjoy a great deal of

Figure 30 shows Sunningdale’s recycled 

input materials used during production, 

which are customer-driven, while Figure 

31 below shows our usage of customer-

approved engineering material that is 

produced from recycled sources. With 

this effort, we are also able to ensure 

that our production and supply chains 

are considerate to the environment and 

communities we operate in.

Material use Initiatives

use of recycled resin 

(customer- driven)

Casting and chroming 

of previously purchased 

components

Crushing and reusing 

plastic waste during 

production

Minimising paint-related 

material inputs

use of recycled resin 

(customer-driven)

For our operations in Malaysia, most 

of our recycled materials consists 

of 

packaging 

and 

pellets/resin. 

Specific to our operations with plastic 

materials, we partner with some 

of our customers to only produce 

materials 

manufactured 

from 

recycled plastics. 

Additionally, some of our customers 

do allow or specify the use of recycled 

engineering resins. The recycled 

material could be purchased by a 

recycled source or done internally. 

in such instances, the customer is 

required to state in the documents, 

test and approve the recycling 

process. 

With the unavoidable generation of 

plastic scraps and runners, plastic 

waste is sold to recycling companies 

for re-palletising which can be mixed 

with virgin material per customer 

defined ratio for manufacturing of 

their products. in the recycling as 

well as manufacturing processes, 

alternative plastic types are taken into 

consideration. Some of these types 

evaluated include Polyvinyl Chloride 

(“PVC”) 

and 

Model 

Acrylonitrile 

Butadiene Styrene (“aBS”) card.

Minimising paint-related material 

inputs

Paint-related solvents, hardeners 

and softeners are another set of 

materials produced in a rather 

waste-conscious 

manner. 

The 

manufacturing processes for these 

materials are purposefully designed 

to be efficient with an improved 

yield in output while minimising on 

paint material usage as the input. 

Other set of materials similarly 

purchased are packaging materials, 

constituting materials like paper, 

glass, carton boxes, corrugated box 

craft paper, polyethylene trays and 

polyethylene bags. in Singapore, 

plastic pallets left in our facilities by 

our suppliers are recycled. also, we 

pro-actively recycle film wrap cores, 

cling wrap cores and stretched film 

wrap plastic cores at our Singapore 

facility.

Casting and chroming of 

previously purchased components

To further assist our clients in 

speedily yet carefully manufacturing 

the entirety of their respective 

finished products, we aid in recycling 

certain 

previously 

purchased 

components of those products. 

We purchase parts and carry out 

casting and chroming activities on 

those relevant parts. also, we review 

possibilities on recycling any of our 

indirect supplies. 

Crushing and reusing plastic 

waste during production

Waste in a form of defective parts 

or runners can be recovered by 

regrinding and reprocessing it as 

fixtures to be used in the lacquering 

process. alternatively, it can be sold 

to scrap suppliers who will reprocess 

it into pallets to be used for lower 

end products such as toys.
