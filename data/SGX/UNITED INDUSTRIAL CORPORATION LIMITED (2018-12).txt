Sustainability Report 2018



Welcome to United Industrial Corporation Limited’s (UICL’s) 2nd annual Sustainability Report. This report has been prepared 

in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core option. The GRI Content Index can be found on 

page 31. Our inaugural Sustainability Report for FY2017 was published in May 2018.

This report covers selected performance measures from our commercial offices, retail properties, residential projects, 

information technology business and head office in Singapore for the period 1st January 2018 to 31st December 2018. This 

represents 75% of our revenue and 89% of our assets. For this report, we have not included overseas investments in China 

and the United Kingdom, as well as our hospitality business, which we do not exercise full management control. A detailed 

summary of data is provided in Appendix A. Definitions and source of data measurements are included in Appendix B. 

Explanations for restatements made to previously reported data are included in Appendix C.

For the first time this year, we have sought independent assurance in relation to the sustainability report. The independent 

assurance statement can be found on page 39 of this report.

We welcome your feedback to help us improve our performance on our Environmental, Social &amp; Governance (ESG) efforts. 

Please send your feedback to sustainability@uic.com.sg. As part of our efforts to promote environmental conservation, no 

hard copies of this report will be printed.

Sustainability Report 2018

We are pleased to present UICL’s second Sustainability 

Report. With the support of the UICL Management 

Sustainability Committee, the UICL Board has approved this 

report and our key sustainability issues. Through regular 

reporting of our progress, we will review our performance 

to ensure our approach remains relevant and effective and 

will strive to improve our performance in the coming years.

In a rapidly changing business environment, strong 

relationships with stakeholders and strategically focusing 

sustainability efforts to enhance our business operations 

and value. Focusing on sustainability factors from a risk 

management point of view and using innovative strategies 

will allow us to leverage on new business opportunities, 

minimise risk and overcome social and environmental 

challenges. For example, our program to make all our 

real estate investments BCA Green Mark certified provides 

operational benefits, and an improved experience for 

tenants and visitors.

In 2018, we began working towards compliance with the 

updated Code of Corporate Governance and accompanying 

Practice Guidance. We have also been working towards 

assessing our operations for risks relating to corruption.

Throughout 2018, we continued to implement robust 

systems and processes for tracking and monitoring our 

sustainability performance. We are therefore pleased 

to convey that, for the first time, the performance data 

included in this report has been independently verified by 

KPMG.

2018 was termed the ‘Year of Climate Action’ and 

UICL played its part by making a pledge to Ministry of 

Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) on our climate 

action goals including continuing to have recycling bins 

in all our investment real estate assets. Indeed, the green 

initiatives at our office and retail properties reduced energy 

consumption and carbon emissions between 2017 to 2018 

by 1.9% respectively.

Since conducting a thorough review of our risk management 

procedures three years ago, we have improved UICL’s 

safety practices. All main contractors require OHSAS 18001 

certification before appointment for our development 

projects. The Accident Frequency Rate (“AFR”) and Accident 

Severity Rate (“ASR”) at our development projects remain 

equal to or below the national average.

At UICL, we remain committed to caring and supporting 

our community. Our staff continue to volunteer their time 

to our target charities and we will continue to embed in our 

culture our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.

 

We look forward to building a sustainable and profitable 

future for our business.

United Industrial Corporation Limited

Sustainability Report 2018

With a wide range of matters, we prioritise and focus on 

the issues that matter most to our stakeholders. Material 

issues are matters that could potentially influence our 

ability to achieve our strategic objectives and create value 

for our stakeholders. Facilitated by an external sustainability 

consultant, we determined UICL’s key Environment, Social 

and Governance (“ESG”) issues by conducting a materiality 

assessment workshop in 2017.

Identification involved research in industrial expectations, 

peer reviews and benchmarking and input from senior 

management. Materiality screening was conducted for 

UICL as a whole, but for this report, only the practices 

and performance of our Singapore operations (including 

commercial offices, retail properties, residential projects, 

information technology business and head office but 

excluding the hotel business) are taken into account. This 

process ensures we cover the topics that are of the most 

importance with regard to UICL’s business environment, the 

nature of its projects and operations, as well as economic 

and ESG impacts. In other words, managing these issues is 

imperative to us.

The process of identifying our material ESG issues 

incorporated the AA1000 Accountability Principles and 

Standards and GRI’s steps for defining report content.

The Board has approved that this report covers the material 

issues and their performance indicators.

We will continue to keep abreast of the changes in our 

business environment and further review these material 

issues at an appropriate time. We hope to engage external 

stakeholders further in the process.

Please refer to the table below for our key material ESG 

issues mapped across our value chain and the boundary 

of each material issue. The ESG material issues apply to 

all operations of UICL business, except for Service Quality 

which applies to hotel operations only.

UICL complies with the Singapore Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012 and the corporate governance policies 

and practices therein. For details on these processes, please 

refer to our Annual Report 2018 which sets out our Board 

and Board committee composition and selection process, 

remuneration and compliance matters.

In August 2018, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) 

issued a revised Code of Corporate Governance 2018 

(“2018 Code”) and accompanying Practice Guidance. UICL 

is working towards compliance with the 2018 Code and 

the corporate governance policies and practices therein by 

31 December 2019.

As part of our sustainability reporting initiative, we set up a 

Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”). The SSC makes 

key decisions concerning sustainability and ESG practices 

for UICL. The SSC reports to our Risk Management 

Committee (“RMC”). Meetings between the SSC and RMC 

are held every quarter, or more often if required.

We have policies in place that help us provide a framework 

upon which we implement our principles. Some of these 

policies	 include	 the	 Anti-Bribery	 and	 anti-Corruption	

(“ABC”), Compliance with the Competition Act, Declaration 

of Conflict of Interest and UICL Employee Code of Conduct. 

UICL	has	a	whistle-blowing	policy	detailed	in	our	Employee	

Handbook. We also have a confidential information policy 

through which all employees must observe strict secrecy in 

all matters relating to the business.

Additionally, we have an Occupational Health and Safety 

(“OHS”) policy that sets out the objective and actions 

for maintaining health and safety standards within the 

organisation. All main contractors are required to be OHSAS 

18001 certified for our development projects.

rISK MANAgeMeNt

UICL aims to minimise natural and environmental risks by 

implementing a number of technical and organisational 

measures, such as raising awareness through sustainability 

reporting.

As part of risk management, UICL supports the precautionary 

principle by ramping up our efforts to avoid negative 

impacts such as pollution and attempting to mitigate our 

impacts on natural resources where possible.

Our risk register outlines the major OHS risks present in the 

organisation.	As	we	pursue	a	sustainable,	long-term	growth	

path,	 we	 strive	 to	 work	 towards	 a	 ‘risk-aware’	 culture	

having risk management programme for our businesses 

and operations.

If sustainability issues facing UICL are discussed by the 

SSC, proposed solutions will be presented to the senior 

management during Risk Management Committee (“RMC”) 

meetings. Please refer to our Annual Report for more details 

on UICL’s audit process.

eCONOMIC perfOrMANCe

We recognise that the lasting success of any organisation 

is based increasingly on acting responsibly and ensuring 

social acceptance by various stakeholders. UICL’s economic 

performance has a positive impact on the internal and 

external	environment	of	the	organisation.	Our	Singapore-

based business contribute to the economy of Singapore 

by creating homes, retail spaces, jobs during construction 

and use, through the taxes paid by UICL and overall 

contributions to the economy. UICL’s business growth and

As a property developer and manager, we understand that 

buildings contribute to global energy use and greenhouse 

gas emissions. We are committed to playing our part to 

address climate change through the reduction of our 

energy consumption and carbon emissions. 2018 was 

declared the “ Year of Climate Action”. UICL made the 

‘Singapore Climate Action Pledge’ with the Ministry of the 

Environment and Water Resources’. Where feasible, we 

will continue to work to improve energy efficiency and our 

environmental impact across our operations.

For example, by integrating energy efficiency considerations 

into the design and construction of our buildings as required 

by BCA Green Mark certifications, we can also help to 

reduce the electricity usage by our tenants and residents.

We have data monitoring systems in place to track and 

monitor our environmental performance across our 

investment properties and development projects. This 

includes recording our Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions, 

energy and water usage which enables us to drive 

performance improvements.

In Singapore, water is a precious resource. Therefore, 

minimising water consumption in our operations and 

activities is a business sustainability imperative. In 2018, we 

implemented a number of initiatives at our buildings to help 

reduce water consumption including: the replacement of 

all wash basin faucets with water efficient taps at Singapore 

Land Tower and upgrading of the washroom facilities at 

SGX Centre to include auto sensors and flush valves.

In 2018, water consumption at our retail properties 

decreased by 14.8%. Total building water consumption 

was 618,493 m3 in 2018. Building water intensity by GFA 

reduced by 5.4% compared to 2017 to 1.2 m3/m2.

Electricity and diesel fuel are our main energy consumption for development projects. In 2018, total energy consumption was 

4,907 MWh and energy intensity was 79.2 kWh/$’000. GHG emissions and GHG emission intensity was 1,386 tonnes of CO2e 

and 22.4 CO2e/$’000 respectively in 2018. Total GHG emissions decreased by 20.7% from 2017 to 2018. Alex Residences, 

UIC Building and V on Shenton were completed and received their Temporary Occupation Permit in 2017. This resulted in 

a significant decrease in the electricity and water consumption from our development projects in 2018 compared to 2017.

INfOrMAtION teCHNOLOgy BUSINeSS 

For the first time in 2018, we present the environmental 

data from our technology business, United Industrial 

Corporation Technologies Pte Ltd (“UICT”). In 2018, 

total energy consumption for UICT was 279 MWh, GHG 

emissions were 107.9 tonnes of CO2e and total water 

consumption was 93.7 m3.

 

UICT will continue to track its environmental performance 

and endeavour to reduce its energy and water consumption. 

We	intend	to	include	three-year	performance	trends	and	

relevant intensity metrics for UICT for our future reports.

eNergy CONSUMptION fOr UICL HeAd OffICe

This year, we started tracking energy consumption at our 

corporate office. In 2018, our corporate office consumed 

74.9 MWh of energy, and emitted 31.4 tonnes of CO2e.

We will endeavour to continue tracking and reducing our 

energy consumption at our head office. In 2019, we intend 

to	upgrade	all	lighting	in	our	corporate	office	to	energy-

saving LED luminaires.

We endeavour to continue contributing to green and 

environmentally friendly living. UIC has been awarded the 

Green Mark award from the Building and Construction 

Authority (“BCA”) for several residential and commercial 

properties. Energy use and efficiency have improved with 

the engagement of an energy audit expert in 2016. UIC 

supports green initiatives in our offices and encourages 

staff to be environmentally friendly by saving electricity 

and water, and recycling. We will strengthen our processes 

to review our environmental performance against these 

targets and for benchmarking, based on our quarterly data 

tracking.

Health and Safety is of paramount importance to UICL and 

a key business challenge in the real estate industry. Across 

UICL, we take all possible measures to focus on prevention 

and to ensure accidents do not occur whether to our 

employees, contractors, tenants, guests or visitors. We are 

committed to ensuring positive and proactive health and 

safety practices across all areas of our business. Safety 

issues at our development projects are assessed regularly 

at management meetings and controls are in place to 

minimise these exposures. Our target for FY2019 is to have 

zero recordable incidents.

wOrKpLACe HeALtH ANd SAfety 

The Company Emergency Response Team has been set up 

and implemented in various buildings to prepare employees 

in the event of an emergency. For example, regular fire drills 

are conducted. At our development projects, contracting 

partners present safety reports and address issues. Prior to 

any work activity, risk assessments are carried out to ensure 

that adequate control measures are implemented.

We track and review our Occupational Health and Safety 

(“OHS”) data on a regular basis. Information tracked includes 

incidents, near misses, occupational diseases, lost time 

due to injuries, AFR and ASR, and hazards for all directly 

employed	staff	and	contractors	working	on-site.	We	have	

an ‘Incident Investigation and Reporting’ procedures in 

place to record health and safety incidents. Each time an 

incident occurs, a report is generated, and the reasons 

are analysed in detail to ensure it is not repeated. For our 

customers, we also track and disclose the health and safety 

data, including injuries and fatalities.

Health and Safety incidents at our premises are reported to 

management. We carry out regular reviews and evaluations 

of our operations and processes, as well as conduct annual 

audits on our properties to ensure compliance with legal 

requirements.

deveLOpMeNt prOjeCtS

As	developers,	UICL	operates	in	a	high-risk	industry	prone	

to accidents. In 2018, the Accident Frequency Rate (“AFR”) 

was 1.5 and our Accident Severity Rate (“ASR”) was 24.3. 

These rates are equal to and below the national industry 

averages.

We work closely with our contracting partners to ensure 

a healthy and safe workplace for our projects under 

construction. Our contracting partners are required to 

present safety reports and address safety issues in weekly 

meetings and to take preventive actions where necessary. 

We encourage our contractors to report not only on 

accidents	but	also	near-misses	so	that	proactive	actions	can	

be taken to prevent accidents. Statutory regulations require 

safety audits to be conducted by external safety consultants 

twice a year to ensure a safe working environment.

We require all main contractors engaged to be OHSAS 

18001 certified or equivalent. Our OHS Policy procedure 

applies to all operations performed by UICL and the 

organisation’s project sites.

We regret to report one fatality involving a male employee 

at	our	Marina	Centre	Holdings	(“MCH”)	office	in	the	third-

quarter of 2018. The incident was investigated internally 

and found to be due to natural causes and not an onsite 

safety accident. The incident was reported to the Ministry 

of Manpower Singapore.

The number of injuries to tenants and visitors at our 

buildings was 5 in 2018 (9 in 2017).

We	 place	 a	 strong	 focus	 on	 employee	 health	 and	 well-

being. In 2018, the employee absentee rate of our property 

business was 3.0% (2017: 3.1%).

In	 2018,	 UICL	 had	 no	 incidents	 of	 non-compliance	 with	

regulations and voluntary codes concerning health and 

safety at buildings and development projects.

We	do	not	track	total	man-hours	worked	for	our	employees	

and contractors based at our buildings, and are therefore 

currently unable to disclose the AFR and ASR.

Attracting and retaining talent is crucial for our organisational 

development and building talent pipelines for leadership 

succession planning.

At UICL, employee engagement through meetings is a 

broad measure we use to evaluate staff commitment and 

motivation at work. These engagements are aimed to 

help retain talent, achieve our goals and objectives, and 

encourage employees to feel involved in matters that relate 

to them at work. This guides our human resource training 

programmes as well.

In 2018, voluntary turnover rate for the property business 

was 13.8% (2017:11.9%), which remained below the national 

industry average.

Annual performance appraisals are conducted for all 

employees in the UIC Group. The process, undertaken 

jointly by the employee and their respective supervisor, 

entails the setting of targets, measurable Key Performance 

Indicators and a career developmental roadmap detailing 

work and developmental plans.

UICL supports the local community through events for the 

young, elderly and others. The Group partners with local 

organisations to assist in community programmes.

In 2018, 31 employees contributed 71 volunteering hours to 

support the communities in which we operate. For example, 

in March 2018 we organised a fundraising cycling event, 

“Bike for a Cause”. The aim of this event was to engage our 

employees through physical activities such as cycling, and 

help to raise funds for the Children’s Charities Association 

of Singapore (“CCA”).

In conjunction with Mother’s Day celebration in May 

2018, seven UICL employees volunteered at Kwong Wai 

Shiu Hospital and Nursing Home. Organised by the Lions 

Befrienders Service Association of Singapore, the event 

brought	cheer	to	the	wheel-chair	bound	elderly	residents	

and interacted through fun activities such as karaoke and 

table games. We also sponsored gifts and prizes for the 

nursing home occupants.

The Company volunteered at a UOL Group Limited event 

for Care Corner Student Care Centre in September 2018. A 

blood donation drive was also organised with the Singapore 

Red Cross at the Singapore Land Tower in September 2018. 

We had 103 registered donors and donated 36.9 litres of 

blood.

The Group also donates to charities every year. In 2018, 

we donated to the Today Enable Fund and Edu Grow for 

Brighter Tomorrows.

For all investment properties, energy consumption, GHG emissions, and water consumption data excludes tenant use 

except water consumption from Clifford Centre which includes tenants’ consumption.

6. We adopt BCA’s definition for Gross Floor Area (GFA). All covered floor areas of a building, except otherwise exempted, 

uncovered areas for commercial uses, are deemed the gross floor area of the building. Generally, car parks are 

excluded from GFA computation.

7. Intensity calculations for all UICL investment properties use Gross Floor Area.

8. The electricity consumption figures for some investment properties have been rounded.

9.	 Scope	of	data	for	2014-2018	includes	seven	development	projects.	100%	of	the	GHG	emissions	from	the	seven

Out of the seven development projects, four are wholly owned by UICL and were completed as at December 2017. They 

are UIC Redevelopment (consisting of UIC Building and V on Shenton), Mon Jervois, Alex Residences, and Pollen and 

Bleu. For the other three development projects, namely Thomson Three, The Clement Canopy, and The Tre Ver, UICL 

owns 50% in a joint venture with UOL Group. Thomson Three was completed as at December 2016.

UICL owns 50% of another joint venture development with UOL Group, Archipelago, which is excluded from reporting.

10. Water used at all our properties is from municipal sources.

11. Energy consumption, GHG emissions, and water consumption intensities for development projects are derived using 

value of work as the denominator.

12. Greenhouse gas calculations are based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.

Greenhouse Gas Protocol Emission Factors from Cross Sector Tools, March 2017 were used to derive greenhouse gas 

equivalent emissions from diesel. The gases included in the conversion of diesel are CO2, CH4 and N2O.

Electricity consumption is converted to Greenhouse Gas equivalent (CO2e) emissions using the Singapore electricity grid 

emission factor, published by the Energy Market Authority in August 2018.

office was installed on 20 July 2018. Scope of reported energy consumption and GHG emissions for the Level 22 office 

in	2018	covers	the	period	of	20	Jul	2018	-	31	Dec	2018	only.

Water data is unavailable, as water is not separately metered.

BASIS fOr CONCLUSION

We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Singapore Standard on Assurance Engagement 3000 

Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (SSAE 3000). Our responsibilities 

are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities section of our report.

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory 

Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), 

which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality 

and professional behavior.

Our firm applies Singapore Standard on Quality Control 1 and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality 

control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 

standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

reSpONSIBILItIeS Of MANAgeMeNt

Management is responsible for:

– preparing and presenting the Report in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core Option and Rule 711B of the SGX 

Listing Manual, and the information and assertions contained within it;

– determining UICL’s objectives in respect of sustainability performance and reporting, including the identification of 

stakeholders and material issues;

– establishing and maintaining appropriate internal control systems that enable the preparation and presentation of the 

Report and the selected GRI disclosures that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;

– preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying and ensuring that UICL complies with laws and regulations applicable 

to its activities; and

– ensuring that staff involved with the preparation and presentation of the Report are properly trained, information 

systems are properly updated and that any changes in reporting encompass all significant reporting units.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing UICL’s sustainability reporting process.

United Industrial Corporation Limited

Sustainability Report 2018

AUdItOrS’ reSpONSIBILItIeS

Our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance engagement in accordance with SSAE 3000 and to express a conclusion 

based on the work performed. SSAE 3000 requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance 

about whether the Report is free from material misstatement. The extent of our work performed depends on our professional 

judgement and our assessment of the engagement risk.

A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of 

information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate. These 

procedures included:

– Interviews with relevant staff at the corporate and business unit level responsible for providing the information in the 

Report.

– Visits to offices and properties operating in Singapore selected on the basis of a risk analysis including the consideration 

of both quantitative and qualitative criteria.

– Enquires about the design and implementation of the systems and methods used to collect and report on the GRI 

Disclosures, including the aggregation of the reported information.

– Comparing the GRI Disclosures presented in the Report to corresponding information in the relevant underlying 

sources to determine whether all the relevant information contained in such underlying sources has been appropriately 

included in the GRI Disclosures.

– Reading the information presented in the Report to determine whether it is in line with our overall knowledge of, and 

experience with, the sustainability performance of the Group.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than 

for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement 

is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been 

performed.

Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure it is possible that errors or irregularities in the information 

presented in the Report may occur and not be detected. Our engagement is not designed to detect all weaknesses in 

the internal controls over the preparation and presentation of the Report, as the engagement has not been performed 

continuously throughout the period and the procedures performed were undertaken on a test basis.

reStrICtION ON USe

This report has been prepared for the Directors of UIC Limited for the purpose of providing an assurance conclusion on 

the Report and Selected GRI Disclosures and may not be suitable for another purpose. We disclaim any assumption of 

responsibility for any reliance on this report, to any person other than the Directors of UIC Limited, or for any other purpose 

than that for which it was prepared.
