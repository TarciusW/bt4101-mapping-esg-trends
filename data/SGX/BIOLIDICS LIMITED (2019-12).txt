Board Statement 

The board of directors (the “Board”) of Biolidics is pleased to present our inaugural sustainability 

report (the “Report”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”). 

Listed on the Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) on 19 

December 2018, Biolidics is a precision medicine medical technology company with a focus in 

developing a portfolio of innovative diagnostic solutions to lower healthcare costs and improve clinical 

outcomes.  

The Board recognises the importance of sustainability and considers environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) factors in its decision making, while focusing on areas which are most relevant to 

our business. We have formalised our sustainability approach by conducting our first materiality 

assessment to identify areas of focus in our sustainability efforts in FY2019 and developing 

performance indicators and targets for the current financial year ending 31 December 2020 

(“FY2020”).  

The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy and businesses, 

and it has inevitably brought more attention to the healthcare industry. Due to the rapidly evolving 

nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and as more information and discoveries from researches and 

studies conducted become available, companies involved in the development, supply and distribution 

of COVID-19 related products are required to keep pace with the latest developments and ensure that 

their products stay relevant. We are committed to grow sustainably as a forward-looking company 

covering our approach and performance in sustainability as we continue to actively explore 

collaborations and partnerships for the development and commercialisation of new technologies and 

products related to COVID-19 and our liquid biopsy business. 

This Report is prepared in accordance with the Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist of the SGX-

ST (“Catalist Rules”) and with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards. This 

Report serves as a platform for Biolidics to formally communicate our sustainability approach on our 

practices, performance and targets in relation to our sustainability efforts for FY2019 with our 

stakeholders.

Materiality Assessment 

Biolidics conducted a materiality assessment exercise, referencing the GRI Standards (2016) 

Materiality Principle. The objective of the exercise was to identify, prioritise and validate ESG factors 

that are significant to business operations and of interest to our key stakeholders. 

With the facilitation of an external consultant, we considered trends and current themes and areas of 

concern in the healthcare industry. Through peer benchmarking as well as taking into consideration 

the sustainability trends in Singapore and globally, we have shortlisted and identified 6 material 

factors. These factors were deemed material to Biolidics as they play an important role in our business 

operations.

Economic Performance 

For more information regarding our economic performance for FY2019, please refer to the Operations 

and Financial Review section (Pages 8 to 10) and Financial Statements section (Pages 48 to 96) of our 

FY2019 Annual Report.  

Social and Environmental 

Occupational Health and Safety (including Effluents and Waste) 

FY2019 Performance 

• 

In FY2019, there were no workplace injuries or fatalities.  

FY2020 Targets 

• 

Maintain zero fatalities and workplace injuries in FY2020 

 

Occupational Health and Safety 

Biolidics recognises that a workplace that fosters a safety and healthy environment is important in 

ensuring that employees are safe, healthy, satisfied and engaged at work. Committed employees are 

imperative for Biolidics to achieve our growth objectives; and hence, we engage with our workforce 

to continuously innovate and improve our technology.  

Safety is of utmost importance to Biolidics. Our activities currently require the controlled use of 

potentially harmful biological materials and chemicals such as cancer cell lines and formaldehyde. 

There is a risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the handling, 

use and disposal of these materials and chemicals. Therefore, having a strong safety culture in the 

workplace is key to protecting our people. The minimisation of safety-related issues will also translate 

to a reduction in business disruption and protect our reputation. 

Proper treatment and disposal of biological waste is also essential to Biolidics to prevent any potential 

contamination or injury to employees or third parties. Hence, we comply with the following policies 

and processes: 

• 

Guidelines from Ministry of Health (“MOH”), Singapore; 

• 

Workplace Safety and Health Act, Chapter 354A of Singapore (the "Workplace Safety and Health 

Act") and the regulations thereunder; 

• 

Environmental Public Health Act, Chapter 95 of Singapore (the “Environmental Public Health Act 

(Toxic Industrial Waste) Regulations”) and the regulations thereunder; 

• 

Guidelines from MOH: Biosafety and Biosecurity Manual, Housekeeping and General 

Maintenance, Decontamination and waste management; and  

• 

Workplace Safety and Health Act.  

Biolidics also provides regular training to educate our employees on the potential health and safety 

risks hazards in the work environment, and the proper precautions to take to prevent any accidents.  

In FY2019, Biolidics’ absenteeism rates for male and female employees were at an average of 5.7 days 

and 8.1 days per annum respectively, and the average absenteeism rate for all employees was at 6.8 

days per annum.

In FY2019, we are proud to report that there were no cases of work-related injury and fatalities for all 

employees. We aim to maintain zero fatalities and zero workplace injuries in FY2020.  

Effluents and Waste 

At Biolidics, we maintain our duty to dispose our waste responsibly, especially toxic waste as it can 

cause harm to the environment and the health and safety of people.  

We adhere to the Environmental Public Health Act (Toxic Industrial Waste) Regulations which require 

all our authorised waste collectors to be licensed. The license will be granted on the condition that: 

▪ 

The toxic waste treatment, storage and disposal facility owned by the collector is in a suitable 

industrial area outside water catchment; 

▪ 

The types and quantities of toxic wastes are commensurate with the treatment processes and 

disposal facilities; and  

▪ 

Adequate measures such as containment areas, leak detection and warning devices, proper 

emergency action plans, neutralising agents, handling gear, absorbent material, etc. are provided 

to prevent and mitigate any accidental release of the toxic wastes. 

Social 

Talent Retention (including Training and Education) 

FY2019 Performance  

• 

In FY2019, our employees achieved an average of 23 training hours. However, not all 

permanent employees completed at least 20 hours of training per year.1 

FY2020 Targets 

• 

All permanent employees to complete at least 20 hours of training per year, in order to 

achieve the adequate level of training for their scope of work.  

 

At Biolidics, we believe that technically skilled professionals are central and crucial for our business to 

remain relevant in today’s changing landscape. To achieve this, we aim to develop and retain 

competent employees and provide an inclusive and nurturing work culture to ensure the quality of 

our business operations. We have regular townhall meetings for our leadership team to provide 

updates to our employees as well as to understand our employees’ needs. 

Furthermore, we have the Biolidics Performance Share Plan (the “Plan”) where the primary objective 

of the Plan is to retain employees whose contributions are essential to the well-being and success of 

Biolidics, and to give recognition to outstanding employees who have contributed to the growth of 

our Company. Eligible participants under the Plan will have the opportunity to participate in the equity 

of Biolidics, therefore inculcating a stronger sense of identity with our long-term success. This will help 

in promoting organisational commitment, dedication and loyalty of these employees to Biolidics.

Training and Education 

Biolidics believes in investing and strengthening our employees’ technical, functional and behavioural 

competencies in line with their job requirements and career aspirations. This is done by providing 

learning and development opportunities to our employees. These opportunities can be in the form of 

on-the-job training, internal trainings and continuing education programmes.   

We have developed a standard operating procedure within the ISO 13485:20163 framework to identify 

training needs, execute training programs and maintain records of training to ensure proper 

assignment of job functions to our employees.  

Any additional training needs are identified and reviewed annually, and we encourage our employees 

to acquire new skills and keep abreast of developments in their respective fields. Employees are given 

opportunities to attend external courses or trainings that are relevant or will assist in their scope of 

work. Employees are also encouraged to further their studies and funding support may be provided 

to them on a case-by-case basis. We monitor training progress by maintaining training records for all 

our employees. 

Masterclass on Liquid Biopsy 

 

In July 2019, Biolidics held a 3-hour masterclass for our employees and other stakeholders to give 

an introduction and improve the technical knowledge on the basic terminologies, concepts and 

framework around cancer diagnostics liquid biopsy.  

 

Topics covered in the masterclass include: 

1. Cancer patient journey from a diagnostics perspective  

2. Introduction to liquid biopsy  

3. Clinical assay validations and regulatory frameworks 

 

We hope to conduct similar training programs in FY2020.
