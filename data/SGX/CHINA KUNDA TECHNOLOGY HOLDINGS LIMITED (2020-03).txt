ABOUT THE REPORT




It is our pleasure to present China Kunda’s third Sustainability Report for FY2020.  

Sustainability issues continue to be integral in our strategy formulation and we 

will uphold our commitment towards ensuring that our business practices are 

sustainable. China Kunda also maintains a clear and transparent manner of 

disclosing our business practices, ensuring that our stakeholders are not only kept 

abreast of emerging sustainability issues, but also what we do to adapt as we 

expand our business operations.  

After review, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) has decided that the four EESG 

matters across our business operations continue to be of relevance. These four 

material topics - Regulatory Compliance, Innovation and R&amp;D (research and 

development), Material Use, Training and Advancement – were chosen to ensure 

our resources are focused on identifying risks and opportunities across our value 

chain, and they continue to be relevant in effectively safeguarding the interests of 

our stakeholders this year.  

The unexpected advent of the novel coronavirus 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic 

resulted in delays in the resumption of our full-scale production after the Lunar 

New year holidays. China Kunda resumed full operations in March 2020, as well 

as its major customers and suppliers complying with all necessary precautionary 

and control measures as directed by relevant authorities. Currently, the COVID-19 

pandemic in China is largely under control, resulting in the gradual recovery of the 

domestic market demand and supply chains.  

Moving forward, as China Kunda aims to pioneer new innovations in engineering 

design and specialised medical equipment, we will simultaneously create long-

term value for our stakeholders and drive our business in a responsible and 

sustainable manner. We would like to take this opportunity to thank our people 

and stakeholders for their continued support in China Kunda’s sustainability 

journey.

BOARD STATEMENT




Overview of China Kunda 

China Kunda is headquartered in Shenzhen, China and listed on the Singapore Exchange as a limited 

liability company. We are a provider of plastic engineering and furniture solutions to a diversified 

customer base spread across a wide geographical region ever since our incorporation in 2007. 

Apart from the manufacture and sale of In-Mould-Decoration and other plastic components (the “IMD 

Business”) through its subsidiary Kunda Plastic Electronic (Shenzhen) Company Limited (“KPE”), China 

Kunda is also involved in the manufacture and distribution of furniture and other related activities 

(“Furniture Business”) through its subsidiary, Shenzhen Shi Er Ju Quan Wu Ding Zhi Company Limited 

(“SEJ”).  

In FY2019, SEJ commenced operations, however as it was still under the developmental phase with limited 

manufacturing activities conducted in its first year of operation, it only contributed to a small portion of 

our total revenue. In FY2020, SEJ had initiated its manufacturing activities for its cabinetry products and 

achieved a total output value of HK$3.3 million, 7.9% in total revenue.   

China Kunda has considered the impact from both KPE and SEJ operations when reviewing our EESG 

factors in FY2020 and concluded that in FY2020, we will continue to report the same EESG topics as in 

FY2019. For more details of our materiality assessment, please refer to the section: materiality assessment 

on pages 11 and 12. 

The operation sites covered in this report are listed as below in Figure 1.

Supply Chain

In China Kunda, we believe that selecting reliable, high-quality and cost-efficient suppliers can help us 

achieve long-term business value.  

Our raw materials are mainly sourced from local vendors in China. Our top 10 suppliers are mainly short 

production cycle manufacturers supplying materials and services ranging from electronic parts, sheets, 

plastic pellets and mould processing in FY2020. Please refer to section “Changes to the organisation and 

its supply chain” for the details regarding changes in our supply chain.

Changes to the organisation and its supply chain 

In FY2020, the Group engaged a new supply category compared to FY2019, which comprised suppliers of 

materials and accessories used for the production of thermometers. This was due to the increasing demand 

of thermometers in the market amidst the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Furthermore, as a result of our 

increase in IMD-related product productions and sales of raw materials to the customers, the procurement 

cost from the top 10 suppliers increased from HK$14.3 million in FY2019 to HK$16.5 million in FY2020.  

Arising from the above, there was a total number of 55 key suppliers1 engaged by China Kunda in FY2020, a 

27% increase in numbers compared to 43 key suppliers in FY2019.   

Our People 

The total number of our employees fell slightly from 133 in FY2019 to 130 in FY2020 as shown in Figure 5. 

All employees under China Kunda work full-time, with a lower percentage of female employees at 41% in 

FY2020 compared to 46% in FY2019. There were 18 and 22 permanent employees in FY2019 and FY2020, 

respectively, while the rest were under fixed-term contract. In FY2020, there were no significant changes in 

employee numbers throughout the year.

1 Key suppliers refer to those who offer goods and services valued more than RMB 100,000 or equivalent to HK$112,224 per annum  

  which was computed based on the average exchange rate RMB1.00:HK$1.12224  in FY2020 as compared to HK$116,950 per  

   annum based on the average exchange rate RMB1.00:HK$1.1695 in FY2019.

CORPORATE PROFILE




Overall, our Group adheres to sound corporate governance to safeguard shareholders’ interests and the 

Company’s assets.  

Risk Management 

China Kunda has in place an Enterprise Risk Management Framework (“ERM”), supported by the Audit 

Committee whose members are all Non-Executive Directors, that covers risk management and our 

internal control systems. This ERM mobilises our ability to manage EESG risks and seize opportunities 

that help achieve our Company’s objectives.  

China Kunda currently has two senior management teams that oversee our KPE and SEJ businesses, 

respectively. Each management team governs the process of risk assessment under the guidance of 

external advisors and monitors the Company’s daily operations and internal control procedures. 

Concerns highlighted by both management teams are reported to the Board during the quarterly risk 

assessment reviews. 

Sustainability Governance 

In China Kunda, our sustainability management team is responsible for overseeing sustainability policies, 

implementing sustainability initiatives and monitoring our sustainability performance. Details of roles 

and responsibility of our sustainability management team can be seen in Figure 8 below. 

Subsequently, any feedback brought to the management team’s attention may be escalated to the Board 

of Directors on a regular basis.

Materiality Assessment 

China Kunda first conducted a 3-steps materiality assessment in FY2018 and identified four key material 

matters that aligned with the Company’s EESG priorities. Regulatory Compliance, Innovation and R&amp;D 

Material Use, Employees Training and Advancement were chosen as critical to our business operations 

and disclosed in our inaugural sustainability report. 

In FY2019, the Board and management team re-assessed these matters, especially considering the 

addition of our new subsidiary SEJ in December 2018. It was determined that the current scale of this 

new operation contributes minimally to our materiality assessment results. 

In FY2020, although SEJ commenced its manufacturing activities during the year, the scale of SEJ’s operation 

remains relatively small as compared to other existing operations. Our new product – thermometer, 

utilised our existing technology in KPE hence there was no significant impact on our materiality 

assessment. As such, we concluded that the identified EESG matters continue to be of relevance to our 

business, including our SEJ operations in FY2020 and we continue to report on the same EESG matters 

in this report.  

We will continue to reassess the materiality matters in the subsequent reporting period to ensure that 

the relevant EESG matters are addressed in our sustainability report. 

The process of China Kunda’s materiality assessment is shown in Figure 10, and the results of the 

assessment are subsequently highlighted in Figure 11.

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY AND APPROACH 




Regulatory Compliance 

China Kunda is committed to maintaining good corporate governance and recognises the importance 

of its internal controls put in place to ensure operational efficiency and continued compliance with 

laws, regulations and policies. We strive to apply the highest regulatory standards across our business 

operations and take all compliance issues and concerns reported seriously. 

Reporting scope for this topic includes operations in both KPE and SEJ. 

Policies and Practices 

In FY2020, China Kunda continued our efforts in our compliance responsibilities by: 

• 

Setting up compliance cultures and sound compliance management systems to avoid risks on non-

compliance behaviours. 

• 

Communicating compliance regulations/standards to all employees and including compliance rules 

in our Employee handbook.  

• 

Utilising compliance management system to guide our senior management’s actions to minimise 

non-compliance risk. 

• 

Having the core team to review, monitor, and respond in real-time to any non-compliance issues. 

Whistle-blowing Policy 

Our Regulatory Compliance is facilitated by our Whistle-blowing policy which provides a formal grievance 

handling procedure as described in figure 12 that allows the Company to manage all our stakeholders 

to raise any issues they encounter. This Grievance Mechanism provides our employees with a safe 

environment and any other persons to raise their concerns, and we continue to encourage all our 

stakeholders to raise any issues they encounter in their relationship with the Company. Our Audit 

Committee will be responsible to review any potential conflicts of interests and if any, they will ensure 

procedures for resolving such conflicts are strictly adhered to.  

For more details of our Corporate Governance and Whistle-blowing Policy, please refer to our Corporate 

Governance Report and its section: Audit Committee and Whistle Blowing Policy in our annual report.

Targets and Performance  

In FY2020, KPE remained certified with Management System Standards ISO 9001, ISO 16949 and ISO 

140012. Both KPE and SEJ have zero reported cases of non-compliance, demonstrating China Kunda’s 

full compliance with the laws, regulations and standards with regards to economic, environmental and 

social areas. 

In FY2021, China Kunda aims to maintain full compliance through strict adherence to our internal 

corporate governance system and hope to continue providing confidence in our regulatory compliance 

to our stakeholders. 

Figure 13: FY2020 China Kunda regulatory compliance performance 

2 As our business in SEJ is focused more on trading rather than manufacturing, and the manufacturing activities of SEJ is relatively  

  small, we believe these standards are not relevant to our SEJ operations as of now. However, we would like to consider obtaining  

  such standards in the future when appropriate.

3 The reward per new client is only applicable in KPE and is not applicable in SEJ which commenced its manufacturing activities  

 of customised cabinetry products in FY2020, and its current manufacturing activities do not involve any innovation and  

  improvement in technology. The rewards in HK$ was computed based on the average exchange rate RMB1.00:HK$1.12224 in  

  FY2020 as compared to RMB1.00:HK$1.1695 in FY2019. 

Innovation and R&amp;D 

China Kunda is a strong advocate for continued innovation and improvements in technology to meet 

our long-term objectives of raising productivity and reducing capital costs. Furthermore, enhancing our 

capability in technology can place us in a good position to gain a competitive advantage and further our 

sustainable development goals, considering the relatively short product replacement cycles in our industry. 

Reporting scope for this topic includes operations in both KPE and SEJ. 

Management Team 

The Technology Development Department is responsible for reviewing innovation policy, overseeing the 

innovation practices and evaluating the results of our innovative projects in KPE.  

Our Executive Director and the core management team oversee our business in SEJ ranging from material 

sourcing, sales, manufacturing, finance, human resources as well as innovation and R&amp;D matters. 

Currently, the main function of research and development projects were outsourced to the external 

technology company in order to avoid high capital commitment.  Our Executive Director and the core 

management team is working closely with the external technology company for the progress and results 

of research and development projects. 

Policies 

In FY2020, we continued the Innovation Incentive Policy in Technology Development to reward innovative 

projects. Any project proposed is reviewed and approved by our core management team and Technical 

Director.  

With key decisive factors such as market influence, projected production level, final output and production 

location in mind, the policy has been reviewed in FY2020 and is summarised as follows (Figure 14):

Practices 

Our clients strictly evaluate and assess our new projects. We will only deliver the products to our 

customers when the products achieve certain testing requirements from clients. Our new patents will 

also be reviewed and certified by the authorised departments of the local government. Only when we 

have received the certificates from the government, will we then proceed to reward our employees for 

their contribution to the projects based on our Innovation Incentive Policy. China Kunda will proactively 

and continuously improve our quality accordingly to any feedback received from our clients.  

Targets and Performance  

China Kunda increased its investments for research and development projects in FY2020. However, we 

failed to meet our target of 50 projects completed in FY2020. This is mainly due to the complexity of the 

current projects and the long development cycle time. The Company also spent more time on considering 

and evaluating the quality of new projects which thus resulted in greater time costs incurred.

Case Studies  











Case Study #1: Non-contact Infrared Forehead  

                             Thermometers (“Thermometers”) 

China Kunda has always been on the lookout for the new application of existing technologies 

in other fields. In FY2020, the spread of COVID-19 globally largely changed people’s lifestyle 

and impacted the market worldwide. In China Kunda, we noticed an increasing demand 

for Thermometers under this situation. As such, we proposed a new project to produce 

Thermometers by applying our technologies of IMD and plastic injection in manufacturing of 

the thermometers.  

The success of this project helps our business expand into a new field of medical devices and 

will become an example for our continued innovation in other business area in the future.  

We have recorded Thermometers sales revenue in the subsequent quarter after FY2020.

Case Study #2: Garbage Processor 

Consumers looking into purchasing a garbage 

disposal unit are often wary of the power 

it operates at and the noise it produces. 

China Kunda provided our customers with a 

powerful garbage disposal unit that operates 

with minimal noise and has a lifespan of 

approximately 10 years.  The product features 

include our seven stages of grinding for the 

disposal of even hard or fibrous food waste 

without fearing clogs or jams and our self-

powered wireless touch switch giving more 

convenience to the final customers. The 

garbage processor is also equipped with the 

function of overload protection, waterproof 

and discharge protection and a high-speed 

copper permanent magnet DC motor with 

4200 r/min. Our user-friendly design utilises 

a three-point snap design, allowing our 

customers 

direct 

installation 

under 

the 

original water basin.

Material Use 

In light of the rising prices of industrial raw materials in recent years, careful operational management of 

the resources that we purchase and use in our production lines will go a long way in not only cost savings 

but also reducing the amount of waste we generate. China Kunda believes that our consistent monitoring 

of the raw materials we use will improve economic efficiency and contribute to the Company’s sustainable 

development goals.  

In FY2020, the scale of SEJ’s manufacturing activities was relatively small. Therefore, disclosure of material 

use mainly pertained to KPE’s manufacturing activities. 

Management Team 

There are two separate core management teams led by the respective general managers responsible for all 

business activities in KPE and SEJ respectively. The production managers and procurement managers within 

the core management teams are responsible for material utilization and procurement of raw materials 

respectively.  

Policy 

China Kunda has in place an incentive system to reward employees for their performance in managing the 

Company’s resources based on their ability to reduce overall material cost ratio. 

China Kunda’s annual KPI is set for each department which is linked to China Kunda’s bonus plan. Through 

the optimization of engineering accounting standard and the lower product defect rate, the material 

loss will be reduced. The reduction of material used will be reviewed at the end of the year to assess the 

distribution of department bonus.  

Practices 

With the overarching goal of optimizing its manufacturing processes, China Kunda consistently monitors 

its usage of both renewable and non-renewable materials. We adhere to international standards in our 

production lines, and in KPE, our management system is ISO14001 and ISO9001 certified. Not only does 

this translate to cost savings in waste, recycling and consumption in the long run, but it also builds a system 

that allows the Company to better manage its environmental risks while meeting customer and regulatory 

requirements simultaneously.

Target 

Our efforts in optimizing the efficiency of production have paid off by achieving KPE’s FY2020 target to 

maintain raw material cost ratio of 41% in FY2020, same as in FY2019 (Figure 16).  

 Figure 16: FY2020 China Kunda Material Use target 

Performance 

Despite the decrease in the usage of plastic sheets, paint and protective film from KPE, the total consumption 

of KPE’s non-renewable materials rose from 430,051kg in FY20195 to 539,937kg in FY2020 mainly due to 

the increase in the production volume of IMD related products which include our new homecare electronic 

products, Thermometers.  

Total renewable material consumption in KPE, mainly cardboard in our operations, increased significantly 

from 14,492 pieces in FY2019 to 19,374 pieces in FY2020, mainly due to the increasing number of existing 

clients’ orders and the non-recycling practice by our new clients who keep the cardboards for their own 

packing purposes. As such, our resources recycling practice achieved 16% (3,100 pieces) of cardboard 

recycled in FY2020, a decrease from 33.9% (4,910 pieces) in FY2019. 

Two renewable materials – multi-layer plywood and quartz were used solely in our SEJ operations since its 

initial manufacturing in FY2020, amounting to 8,340kg and 2,400kg respectively.

Training and Advancement 

China Kunda’s employees play a crucial role in the sustainable development of the Company, and we invest 

resources in providing them with necessary training and development. For each employee, such training 

opportunities allow them to acquire new skills, sharpen existing ones, and help them further their career 

growth; for the Company, investing in our employees will increase productivity and efficiency, allowing us 

to gain a competitive advantage. 

Reporting scope for this topic includes operations in both KPE and SEJ.  

Management Team 

Human Resources departments who are responsible for arranging the trainings and overseeing the 

employees’ performance review are set in both KPE and SEJ.  

Practices 

New hires are required to attend mandatory orientation workshops conducted by the Human Resources 

Department, which provide important information regarding production safety, mechanical operation, 

craftsmanship and product quality requirements. These orientation programs are also an avenue for 

employees to integrate into our Company culture seamlessly.  

China Kunda has also arranged external off-site trainings for our employees.  These training courses will 

enable our people to upgrade their skills. For example, in FY2020, a one-week training to Zhangjiajie in 

Hunan China was arranged for around 20 employees from KPE. Details can be found in case study 2 below. 

In addition to our commitment towards providing all employees with training, China Kunda also provides 

employees with tailored career planning sessions based on results from the regular employee performance 

assessments. This helps the Company better understands each employee’s career goals and enable us to 

align them with long-term Company objectives.  

Lastly, China Kunda provides subsidies to our employees who seek to further upgrade their education and 

skills. A training institution has been set up to regulate the management of training subsidies. An incentive 

system is also put in place to reward employees that have excellent performance in training sections.

To achieve our target of increasing total training hours in FY2020, more trainings are arranged for our 

employees. Examples of our trainings include trainings on communication skills for sales staff, trainings on 

Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system standard operations, front-line employees pre-job trainings, 

corporate culture trainings and specialised trainings arranged for managerial employees only, such as 

career planning and management skills trainings. As a result, the total training hours for our employees 

increased by 9.7% from 5,410 hours in FY20197 to 5,937 hours in FY2020. Average training hours also 

increased by 12.3% from 40.68 hours in FY2019 to 45.67 hours in FY2020.

Case Study #3: Internal development programs 

China Kunda believes in providing our employees with various opportunities to grow.  

In FY2020, multiple meetings, trainings and tea sessions were arranged. For example, our 

strategic meeting in KPE reviewed our overall work performances in FY2019 which included 

our achievements and weaknesses and how we can benefit from these experiences to do 

better in FY2020. 

The purpose of these meetings, trainings or tea session is to ensure that our employees are 

growing in the same direction with the Company as well as interacting with the employees.

Case Study #4: External field trips and learning journeys 

In FY2020, we also organised several out-of-office development programmes for our 

employees to participate in, which not only included field trips and learning components but 

also provided opportunities for the unity of the employees. These activities also provided 

an avenue for employees to form connections with people outside their own professional 

expertise and determine their individual career paths. 

For example, we arranged a birthday trip for our people to enhance communications across 

different departments, enrich people life and create a better working environment. This is 

in line with our corporate culture, showing care to our people and helping the whole group 

grow in a healthy way.  

In KPE, we have also arranged a trip to a well-known attraction in China, Zhangjiajie. We 

would like to take this as an opportunity to let our people share their experience, exchange 

their views as well as motivating the employees.
