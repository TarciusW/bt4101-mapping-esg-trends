2. About SIIC Environment 

2.1 Overview 

SIIC Environment is one of the leading investors and operators in the environment industry in 

the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). We engage in wastewater treatment, water supply, 

sludge treatment, solid waste incineration and other environmental related businesses. As at 

the date of this Report, the Company owns over 200 water treatment and supply projects, 8 

waste incineration power generation projects and 10 sludge treatment projects across 19 

provinces and municipalities. Our water business and sludge treatment services are offered 

and managed through the Central China, South China, North China, Northeast China, and East 

China business units. Our waste incineration power generation business is managed by Waste 

Incineration Division. Our Ranhill Water business unit offers industrial wastewater treatment 

and other public utility services.  

2.2 Business Outlook 

Wastewater treatment and water supply are two of the principal business lines of the 

Company. As we develop new high-quality water projects, the Company continuously 

upgrades existing wastewater treatment projects to meet the government’s more stringent 

discharge standards for urban wastewater treatment plants (“WWTPs”). In 2019, the 

Company acquired 8 new concessionary and O&amp;M projects and 5 WWTP expansion and 

upgrading projects with a total capacity of 720,000 tonnes/day, and approximately 1,600,000 

tonnes/day of newly constructed or upgraded projects commenced commercial operation, 

facilitating the high-quality and rapid development of the Chinese economy while preserving 

“lucid waters and lush mountains” for cities in China. 

To drive the development of the waste incineration business, the Company actively promotes 

cooperation with other leading enterprises in the environmental protection industry. In 2019, 

the Company’s waste incineration power generation capacity reached 8,800 tonnes/day with 

a year-over-year increase of 232%. 

By 2020, the last year addressed in the 13th Five-Year Plan, investments in the construction of 

urban wastewater treatment and water reclamation facilities are expected to reach 

approximately RMB 565.4 billion; the capacity of waste incineration power generation 

projects is expected to reach nearly 600,000 tonnes/day. The Company will continue to follow 

the national strategy, work closely with local governments, capture critical development 

opportunities for the environmental industry, and establish more quality water treatment and 


3 

 

waste incineration projects. In addition, the Company will enhance collaboration with other 

industries and improve technological innovation capabilities.  

The Company will step up efforts in research and development of technology, expand into the 

high-end environmental equipment manufacturing sector, extend its industrial value chain, 

and actively develop overseas market in response to China’s “Belt and Road Initiative”. 

Leveraging on the Company’s distinctive strategic positioning and business model, SIIC 

Environment will continue to expand its business in water treatment, solid waste treatment 

and sludge treatment and disposal, and explore opportunities in other environmental fields 

such as industrial wastewater treatment, seawater desalination, soil remediation, renewable 

energy, water treatment technology, and pollution prevention.  

2.3 Board Statement

At SIIC Environment, we are aware that good corporate governance ensures the protection of 

shareholders’ interests and enhances corporate performance and accountability. We are 

committed to establishing corporate governance practices in line with the principles, 

provisions and recommendations of the Code of Corporate Governance issued by Singapore’s 

Ministry of Finance in 2018 and the applicable provisions of the Corporate Governance Code 

set out in Appendix 14 to the Hong Kong Listing Rules. 

2.4.1 Sustainability Governance 

The Board is obliged to oversee the business and corporate affairs of the Company, including 

the consideration of ESG issues. The Board is responsible for evaluating and determining the 

Company’s ESG-related risks, ensuring appropriate and effective ESG risk management and 

internal control systems, setting management approach, strategies, priorities, and objectives 

of the Company, periodically reviewing the Company’s performance, and improving 

disclosures in the Company’s sustainability reports.  

The Company’s ESG working group (“ESG Working Group”) is comprised of senior 

management and employees from various departments who possess good understanding of 

both the ESG matters and the Company’s operations. The ESG Working Group is responsible 

for preparing the Company’s annual sustainability reports, including coordinating stakeholder 

engagement in materiality assessments of the ESG issues and liaising with the business units 

within the reporting scope to collect and validate ESG data within the Reporting Period. 

In preparing this Report, the Company used an online data collection system to gather ESG-

related information pertaining to the Reporting Period. Under the guidance of the ESG 

Working Group, representatives from each of the Company’s projects within the reporting 

scope reported sustainability performances in 2019 in the system through qualitative and 

quantitative key performance indicators. Before being incorporated into this Report, the 

reported information was reviewed and verified internally by representatives from our major 

business units (Central China, South China, North China, Northeast China, East China, Waste 

Incineration Division, and Ranhill Water) and the headquarter. The above work procedure 

helps us ensure the accuracy and reliability of the content of this Report. 

2.4.1.1 Stakeholder Engagement

2.4.1.2 Materiality Assessment 

The Company has reviewed the existing material ESG issues together with the Company’s 

business, strategy, business model, regulatory changes, and industry trends during the 

Reporting Period. We concluded that the 13 material ESG issues identified in the 2017 

Sustainability Report (as shown in the table on the next page) continue to apply to the 

Reporting Period and hence, this Report. The Board has reviewed and confirmed the identified 

material ESG issues for 2019 and the reporting scope of this Report.  

This Report focuses on addressing the 13 identified ESG issues that are considered material to 

SIIC Environment. We plan to expand the scope of materiality assessment in the future by 

engaging external stakeholders, in order to capture a broader range of perceptions towards 

ESG-related issues and respond to the concerns and expectations of different stakeholders in 

a timely manner.

In 2018, we initiated the process of setting long-term targets to the material ESG issues. During the Reporting Period, we took various actions towards fulfilling 

these targets, as summarized in the table below. These targets remain applicable for the forthcoming year. Building upon our efforts in 2019, we will continue 

to strive towards achieving these targets in the future and present our progress qualitatively and quantitatively in future reports.  

In addition, in 2019 we developed short- and medium-term targets related to environmental, social and governance aspects, based on the material ESG issues 

and the Company’s actual operation and business growth. These targets include providing customers with high-quality municipal services related to water 

supply and treatment, sludge treatment and waste incineration under the premise of meeting relevant laws and regulations, and further enhancing 

cooperation with local governments.

2.4.2 Anti-Corruption 

The Company places a strong emphasis on corporate integrity and honesty. We abide by laws 

and regulations related to bribery, extortion, fraud, and money laundering such as the 

Criminal Law of the PRC, Anti-Money Laundering Law of the PRC, Anti-Unfair Competition Law 

of the PRC, and Prevention of Corruption Act of Singapore. 

The Company has implemented the internal Fraud and Whistleblowing Policy to facilitate the 

development of controls that aid in the detection and prevention of fraud, and to provide a 

protocol for employees to express concerns about wrongdoing, malpractice or possible 

irregularities within the Company. The policy applies to all directors, officers and employees 

of the Company, its subsidiaries, and associated companies.  

If employees notice acts of wrongdoing, they can report in writing to the Chairman of the 

Audit Committee of the Company and deliver the report in person, by mail or by email. Upon 

receiving a report, the Chairman of the Audit Committee determines whether the reported 

matter falls within the scope of the Fraud and Whistleblowing Policy and whether an 

investigation is appropriate. The Chairman then conducts the initial investigation if 

appropriate and refers the matter to the management and the Audit Committee for further 

investigation. We take proper measures to protect whistleblowers from reprisals; harassment 

or victimization of the whistleblowers in retaliation for raising concerns over alleged wrongful 

act will not be tolerated.  

Our business units have also implemented policies and measures to prevent and handle 

corrupt practices. Some business units regard employee integrity as one of the key evaluation 

criteria when designating essential personnel and specify penalties for corrupt practices, while 

the others conduct regular internal and external audits, as well as audits targeted at key 

management personnel. 

During the Reporting Period, there were no legal cases regarding corrupt practices brought 

against the Company or its employees, and no cases of non-compliance with laws and 

regulations related to bribery, extortion, fraud, and money laundering. 

For more details on corporate governance, please refer to the Corporate Governance Report 

in the Company’s 2019 Annual Report. 

 

3. Environment 

3.1 Environmental Management Overview  

In 2019, the Company has improved its performance in environmental emissions compared 

to the previous years, demonstrated by the better effluent quality and greater reductions on 

levels of chemical oxygen demand (“COD”), biochemical oxygen demand (“BOD”) and 

ammonia nitrogen in our water treatment business. At the same time, the Company enhanced 

non-hazardous waste recycling and reuse, significantly increasing the amount of sludge and 

slag recycled and reused. With respect to carbon reduction, the Company adopted measures 

such as increasing the use of renewable energy and tree planting to reduce greenhouse gas 

(“GHG”) emissions. Moving forward, the Company will seek to further improve its 

environmental performance and fulfil its mission of protecting the planet, conserving the 


11 

 

environment and preserving natural resources. 

As a leading investor and operator in the environmental industry in China, SIIC Environment 

is committed to protecting the planet, conserving the environment and preserving natural 

resources. We have developed and implemented relevant internal policies to properly 

manage the potential impacts of our operational activities on the environment, in accordance 

with the Environmental Protection Law of the PRC, Atmospheric Pollution Prevention and 

Control Law of the PRC, Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law of the PRC, Law of the 

PRC on the Prevention and Control of Environment Pollution Caused by Solid Wastes, and other 

laws and regulations related to air emissions such as waste gas and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 

emissions, wastewater discharge, and hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste disposal.  

Our business units and their project companies have respectively adopted measures for 

environmental impact prevention and mitigation, to avoid the potential negative impacts of 

the Company’s four major business lines (wastewater treatment, water supply, sludge 

treatment, and waste incineration) on the wellbeing of the environment and the community 

caused by mismanagement.  

The business units have established internal policies such as the Environmental Protection 

Management System in Project Operation and the Management System for Environmental 

Factor Identification and Evaluation. The Environmental Protection Management System in 

Project Operation specifies the management and control of the consumption of water, 

electricity, fuel, and other resources; it also stipulates that the project companies should have 

emergency response plans in place for potential environmental incidents such as equipment 

malfunction and hazardous materials incident. The Management System for Environmental 

Factor Identification and Evaluation outlines procedures to identify environmental factors 

relevant to business operations such as wastewater discharge and resource consumption, and 

develop corresponding management and control measures; each project company is required 

to update the environmental factor list at the beginning of each year.   

The project companies under each business unit have also taken active steps to minimize 

impacts on the environment and natural resources in daily operations. Through advancement 

in treatment techniques, equipment maintenance and upgrade, regular environmental 

sampling and testing, resource recycling, and other measures, the project companies strive to 

achieve full compliance with national and local emission standards and go above and beyond.  

The following sections delve into the details of how each of our four major business lines 

manages air emissions and wastewater discharge, how each business line disposes of 

hazardous and non-hazardous waste during business activities, as well as our efforts in 

improving resource use efficiency. 

3.2 Air Emissions and Wastewater Management 

When managing air emissions and wastewater discharge during business operations, our 

project companies strictly follow relevant discharge standards such as the Emission Standards 

for Odour Pollutants (GB14554-1993), Discharge Standard of Pollutants for Municipal 

Wastewater Treatment Plants (GB18918-2002), Environment Quality Standards for Surface 

Water (GB3838-2002), and Standard for Pollution Control on the Municipal Solid Waste 

Incineration (GB18485-2014) to safeguard environmental health and sanitation.   


12 

 

3.2.1 Wastewater Treatment Business Line  

Main pollutants generated from the wastewater treatment process include COD, BOD, 

ammonia nitrogen, and suspended solids in the discharged wastewater, as well as hydrogen 

sulphide and ammonia in gas phase.   

To guarantee the effluent of the WWTPs meets the discharge standards, we sample and test 

water quality at each treatment stage on each day and appropriately calibrate the treatment 

process based on the test results. To effectively reduce pollutants concentrations in the 

effluent, we maximize the removal efficiency at each treatment stage, such as increasing the 

removal rate of inorganics during pre-treatment, and enhancing microbial treatment 

efficiency to increase the removal rate of organics during biochemical treatment. At the 

Yongxin County Industry Development Zone Comprehensive WWTP Project 1st Phase, through 

adding a hydrolysis acidification unit to the treatment process, we significantly enhanced COD 

removal, achieving a 92.6% increase in COD reduction compared to 2018. As a result, in 2019 

our wastewater treatment projects have collectively reduced the concentration of COD, 

ammonia nitrogen and total suspended solids in the wastewater discharged compared to the 

2018 level, by 13%, 25% and 18%, respectively. 

 

Figure 1. Shanghai Qingpu Second WWTP Project. 

To reduce air emissions and mitigate the impact of odorous gas on the environment, a project 

of our East China business unit uses fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) to cover and seal the 

influent inlets and the sludge treatment facilities, where odorous gas tends to concentrate. 

Biofilters are then used to remove odour before the gas in the facility is released into the 

atmosphere; the estimated odour removal efficiency is 95%. We also plant black bamboo, 

sweet viburnum and other air-purifying plants around the facilities to mitigate impacts of 

odorous gas on the surrounding community.

Wastewater discharge is one of the major by-products of the water supply business. Project 

companies such as the Qianchuan Water Plant Project (Expansion) and the Qianchuan Water 

Plant O&amp;M Project are in the process of building wastewater collection and treatment systems, 

which could help reduce wastewater discharge.  

GHG emissions are the major air emissions generated from the water supply business. In 

addition, projects using liquid chlorine as the disinfectant face bear risks of chlorine leak 

incidents. To mitigate GHG emissions, as will be discussed in detail towards the end of Section 

3.2, the water supply projects plant trees at the project sites to help offset indirect carbon 

emissions from purchased electricity consumption. In addition, water supply projects that 

apply disinfectants such as liquid chlorine, hydrochloric acid, sodium hypochlorite, and other 

chemicals to purify the raw water are faced with potential risks as chlorine gas may leak and 

pose threats on the surrounding environment and human health if not managed properly, 

project companies using liquid chlorine have taken specific measures to prevent chlorine gas 

from leaking.  For example, a water treatment plant from our Central China business unit has 

installed alarm systems for leak detection at the chlorination room and conducts weekly tests 

to ensure the proper functioning of the alarms. The project company has also installed 

chlorine gas absorption devices to mitigate impacts of a leak incident, as shown in the picture 

below. In 2019, no water supply projects have experienced chlorine gas leak incident.

treatment plant from our Central China business unit. 

3.2.3 Sludge Treatment Business Line 

During the Reporting Period, the two major types of waste gas generated from sludge 

treatment process, hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas, have both met the Emission 

Standards for Odour Pollutants (GB14554-1993) and other relevant standards. In particular, 

Jiamusi City WWTP Sludge Disposal Project has achieved zero hydrogen sulphide emission 

through desulphurization and zero ammonia gas emission by means of ferric oxide and 

chemical and biological deodorization processes, respectively. Wastewater generated from 








16 

 

the sludge treatment process is treated in-house at the sludge treatment plant or discharged 

to the WWTPs that belong to the same project company for further treatment.

3.2.4 Waste Incineration Business Line 

Major air emissions emitted from the waste incineration process include sulphur oxides, 

nitrogen oxides, dioxins, carbon monoxide, and smoke. To ensure full compliance with 

emission standards in the Standard for Pollution Control on the Municipal Solid Waste 

Incineration (GB18485-2014), we treat flue gas with a combination of techniques including 

semi-dry desulphurization, activated carbon adsorption for heavy metal and organics removal, 

bag filtration for dust removal, and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) denitration.  

 

We treat wastewater generated during waste incineration by means of pre-treatment for 

large debris removal, anaerobic digestion, external membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment, 

ultrafiltration, and nanofiltration to effectively remove COD, ammonia nitrogen, and other 

pollutants from the wastewater. During the Reporting Period, all treated water met the 

Discharge Standard of Pollutants for Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants (GB18918-2002).

3.2.5 GHG Emission Management 

Our business operations also emit GHG and we have taken relevant measures to reduce the 

Company’s carbon footprint. The direct (scope 1) emissions are mainly generated from waste 

incineration, and indirect (scope 2) emissions primarily result from purchased electricity 

consumption. We installed solar panels and planted trees at the project sites in order to offset 

our GHG emissions. During the Reporting Period, we used 1,816,575 kWh of electricity 

produced from the solar panels, reducing CO2 emission by 1,528 tonnes compared to coal-

fired power generation2. We have also planted a total of 23,064 trees at the project sites, 

which helps offset 530.47 tonnes of CO2 per year3.

3.3 Hazardous and Non-hazardous Waste Management 

With respect to managing and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, our project 

companies strictly follow the requirements of the Disposal of Sludge from Municipal 

Wastewater Treatment Plant - Quality of Sludge Used in Land Improvement (GB/T 24600-

2009), Disposal of Sludge from Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant - Quality of Sludge 

Used in Gardens or Parks (GB/T 23486-2009), Control Standards of Pollutants in Sludge for 

Agricultural Use (GB 4284-2018), Disposal of Sludge from Municipal Wastewater Treatment 

Plant - Quality of Sludge Used in Separate Incineration (GB/T 24602-2009) and other applicable 

standards. 

3.3.1 Wastewater Treatment Business Line 

Regular sludge4 is the main non-hazardous waste generated in the wastewater treatment 

process and is disposed at local landfills or collected by third-party companies and repurposed 

into fertilizers and construction materials. Other non-hazardous waste such as domestic waste, 

screening waste, grits, and packaging materials are mainly collected and handled by local 

environmental sanitation departments. To effectively reduce the amount of regular sludge 

produced, we add chemicals such as polyacrylamide (PAM) in the sludge dewatering process 

to facilitate the separation of solids from water, reducing the water content and volume of 

the sludge. To further lower the water content of the sludge to meet more stringent local 

requirements, our project companies engage additional processes after the dewatering 

process such as sludge desiccation. For example, the Huangqiao Industrial Park WWTP Project 

1st Phase achieved a sludge water content of 80% after dewatering, and was able to reduce 

sludge water content from 80% to as low as 30% through desiccation, achieving approximately 

a two-third reduction in the quantity of the sludge generated.  

 

Department and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department. 

4 In this Report, regular sludge is defined as the sludge that is not listed in the Directory of National 

Hazardous Wastes (2016 Revision) published by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the PRC, 

the National Development and Reform Commission of the PRC and the Ministry of Public Security of 

the PRC.

Domestic waste is another type of non-hazardous waste produced in the sludge treatment 

business. In daily work activities, we promote the efficient use of office supplies and reduce 

food waste at dining halls to decrease the amount of domestic waste produced. 

A small amount of hazardous waste is also generated during wastewater treatment, mainly 

including hazardous sludge, laboratory waste liquids, waste motor oil, empty reagent 

container, and used activated carbon. All hazardous waste is collected and handled by 

certified third-party waste handlers. To reduce hazardous waste generation, the wastewater 

treatment projects strictly follow standard laboratory procedures to minimize waste liquid 

generation. We also recycle and reuse hazardous waste; for example, project companies such 

as Suizhou City Cheng Nan WWTP 1st Phase apply waste motor oil as lubricant to valves, nuts 

and bolts and other parts.  

3.3.2 Water Supply Business Line 

The water supply business line does not involve hazardous waste generation. Non-hazardous 

waste produced including regular sludge and small quantities of domestic waste and 

packaging materials is collected and handled by local environmental sanitation departments. 

A portion of our project companies from the Central China business unit have been recycling 

regular sludge for landscaping purposes, while other projects were able to reduce sludge 

discharge through equipment upgrades such as replacing the filter cells.

Water Plant 1st Phase. 

3.3.3 Sludge Treatment Business Line 

We adopt typical sludge treatment processes such as high-temperature aerobic fermentation 

and a combination of thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion to repurpose sludge into 

organic fertilizers, reducing the quantity of sludge discharge. Hazardous waste generated 

during sludge treatment include small quantities of laboratory waste liquids and waste motor 

oil, both collected and handled by certified third-party waste handlers. Regular sludge is the 

main non-hazardous waste generated, and is reused for clinker production, landscaping and 

mining pit restoration, or disposed at the disposal facilities designated by the local 

government. Small quantities of domestic waste are also generated and are disposed at local 

landfills.  

In 2019, 82% of the total regular sludge generated was reused by our sludge treatment 

projects, a significant increase from the 2018 level of 26%.

3.3.4 Waste Incineration Business Line 

Fly ash and activated carbon waste are two main types of hazardous waste generated during 

waste incineration power generation. Fly ash produced from domestic waste incineration is 

solidified with cement and chelating agents before being transported to landfills for disposal. 

Waste gas generated from the incineration process is treated with activated carbon. Used 

activated carbon is handled by certified waste handlers or fed back into the waste incinerators 

for processing in accordance with local environmental regulations. In addition, other 

hazardous waste generated from the waste incineration business such as small quantities of 

laboratory waste liquids and waste liquids from online monitoring instrument are collected 

and handled by certified third-party waste handlers. Through replacing outdated monitoring 

instrument and other measures, the project companies were able to reduce hazardous waste 

generation.   

The main non-hazardous waste produced during waste incineration is slag. To reduce quantity 

generated, slag is first processed for metal recovery and then used to produce construction 

materials such as bricks. In 2019, a total of 77,335 tonnes of slag was reused by our waste 

incineration projects, 2.6 times the reuse amount in 2018. 

3.4 Resource Consumption Management 

In daily office activities, we follow the principles of green office and encourage employees to 

save paper and electricity, reuse or recycle packaging materials and use environmentally 

friendly office supplies. Through these actions, we hope to reduce energy consumption and 

carbon footprint resulted from daily office activities while decreasing office operating costs. 

To further promote the efficient use of energy, water, chemicals, and other resources during 

our operation, the Company has adopted various management and control measures to help 

the project companies improve resource efficiency. At our South China business unit, we 

require project companies to establish production resource management systems to enhance 

energy consumption control and monitoring of key production processes and energy-

intensive equipment. At our North China business unit, we have developed the Evaluation 

Management System for Wastewater Operation Units which incentivizes project companies 




24 

 

to improve resource efficiency: without affecting normal operations, companies with lower 

unit electricity and chemical cost would receive higher scores in seasonal and annual 

evaluations and would be rewarded. Guided and motivated by the Company’s internal policies, 

the project companies have come up with a variety of ways to increase resource efficiency 

during day-to-day operations.  

3.4.1 Chemical and Energy Consumption 

To improve chemical use efficiency, our wastewater treatment and water supply projects 

closely monitor the operating parameters such as influent and effluent quality to adjust 

chemical addition accordingly. For example, we control the amount of polyaluminum chloride 

(PAC) addition based on the total phosphorous content and suspended solids concentration 

in the effluent. We also seek to enhance chemical use efficiency by adjusting chemical use. In 

2019, the Jingjiang City Xingang Park WWTP Project 1st Phase replaced chlorine dioxide with 

sodium hypochlorite as the disinfectant, which helped reduce chemical consumption and cost 

and facilitated turbidity removal from the wastewater. Other measures we have adopted to 

increase resource use efficiency include using electronic balance to accurately weigh the 

chemicals and refining the chemical feed system. Through these actions, wastewater 

treatment projects reported significant decrease in chemical consumption in 2019. In 

particular, the Yongfeng County Industrial Park WWTP Project 1st Phase achieved a 41% 

reduction in unit chemical consumption compared to the 2018 level. 

The project companies improve energy use efficiency by adjusting equipment operation. For 

example, the Yongxin County Industry Development Zone Comprehensive WWTP Project 1st 

Phase promptly adjusts equipment operating schedule according to water quality monitoring 

results, and was able to achieve a 45% reduction in unit electricity consumption in 2019 

compared to the 2018 level. In addition, by installing more energy-efficient lighting systems, 

our Mudanjiang City WWTP Sludge Disposal Project reported a 10% reduction in electricity 

consumption in 2019 compared to 2018. In 2019, the Jiamusi City Municipal Water Supply 

TOT Project (Jiangbei Water Plant) replaced 13 water pumps that reached their life span, 

which improved efficiency of the water pumps and saved 0.4% of the project’s annual 

electricity consumption. Other energy-saving measures the project companies have 

implemented include adding frequency converters to equipment such as water pumps and 

promptly replacing the filters of the air blowers to ensure equipment efficiency.  

 

 

Figure 22.  Energy efficiency lighting system at the Mudanjiang City WWTP Sludge Disposal Project. 

We also promote the use of renewable energy among our project companies. While some 

projects engage solar power generation as mentioned earlier, our Jiamusi City WWTP Sludge 






25 

 

Disposal Project and Mudanjiang City WWTP Sludge Disposal Project use biogas produced 

from anaerobic digestion during the sludge treatment process to supply energy for daily 

operations, helping conserve non-renewable energy resources. A total of 2,248,032 m3 of 

biogas was used during the Reporting Period. In addition, we convert waste into energy 

through household waste incineration power generation, an integrated resource utilization 

method encouraged by the state. A portion of the electricity generated by incineration 

supplements our Waste Incineration Division’s daily energy consumption, and the rest is 

exported to the power grid. During the Reporting Period, we used 21,525,487 kWh of 

electricity produced from waste incineration.  

3.4.2 Water Consumption  

Project companies in the Company’s all four major business lines have made great efforts in 

decreasing freshwater consumption through water reuse programs and improving water 

efficiency through equipment maintenance and upgrades. Used water from plant operations 

and effluent from the wastewater treatment process are mainly reused for landscaping, 

cooling, cleaning, and chemical preparation purposes. In 2019, the Mudanjiang City WWTP 

Sludge Disposal Project remodelled its pipelines to pump water from the disinfecting tank of 

the WWTP for reuse with an annual reuse amount of approximately 73,000 tonnes, 

significantly reducing tap water usage. A WWTP from our South China business unit uses 

recycled treated wastewater instead of tap water to prepare for the chemical wastewater 

treatment process after remodelling the pipelines.  During the Reporting Period, our project 

companies recycled and reused a total of 30,113,491.8 tonnes of water, effectively reducing 

dependence on purchased freshwater. We further enhance water efficiency by inspecting 

pipelines regularly for water leakage, adopting water-saving faucets and other equipment 

upgrades, installing flow meters on main pipelines to better manage water use, and through 

employee education.

Considering that the water supply projects may experience fluctuations in water supply due 

to seasonal variations and drought-related issues, the Company has adopted various policies 

and measures based on the actual operation and local conditions to stabilize the quantity and 

quality of water supply. For example, projects that source water from nearby rivers relocate 

the water inlet from the riverbank to the middle of the channel cross section during dry 

seasons; for water supply projects that source water from groundwater wells, we enhance 

well maintenance and increase well cleaning depth to satisfy demands of water supply from 

our clients during drought seasons. For projects located in water source protection zones, we 

strictly abide by the Management Rules for Pollution Prevention and Control at Drinking Water 

Source Protection Zones, prohibiting activities such as farming and waste disposal to 

guarantee the quality and quantity of water supply.

1 Due to the characteristics of the Company’s business operations, air pollutant emissions and direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1) are not material to the wastewater 

treatment, sludge treatment and water supply business lines. Therefore, these emissions are only disclosed for the waste incineration business line.   

2 In order to better reflect the environmental performance of different business lines of the Company and improve the comparability of data over the years, starting from 

the reporting period of 2018, we revised the calculation method for the intensity of environmental performance data. The denominator of intensity calculations was changed 

from the revenue of each business line, which was used in 2017, to the total daily design capacity of the projects disclosed by each business line. Therefore, the intensity 

data from 2017 is reported as “Not Applicable” in this Report. 

3 In order to optimize disclosed environmental performance data management, during the Reporting Period, we refined the collection scope and method for a portion of the 

performance data. To match this adjustment and to ensure comparability of data collected over the years, we adjusted a portion of the 2017 and 2018 data, and the adjusted 

data are denoted by “*”.  

4 Data collection scope of the number of trees is adjusted from "the number of trees owned that are above 5 metres" used in 2018 to "the number of trees planted after 

the factory was built and those can reach at least 5 metres in height". Future reports will adopt the adjusted scope. 

5 Scope 2 emissions were calculated using the 2011–2012 Regional Power Grid Average CO2 Emission Factors in China guideline published by the National Development and 

Reform Commission of the PRC. Scope 2 emissions were from purchased electricity consumption during the Reporting Period.

4.1 Service Quality and Standards 

SIIC Environment strives to deliver high-quality services to our customers. Our business 

activities strictly comply with relevant laws, regulations and standards related to product and 

service health and safety, such as the Discharge Standard of Pollutants for Municipal 

Wastewater Treatment Plant (GB 18918-2002) and the Standard for Pollution Control on the 

Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (GB 18485-2014). We also abide by the Advertising Law of 

the PRC, the Trademark Law of the PRC, the Patent Law of the PRC, and other laws and 

regulations on advertising, labelling and privacy matters related to our products and services. 

During the Reporting Period, there were no non-compliance cases regarding the above laws 

and regulations. Projects of our business units have implemented or are in the process of 

adopting the Quality Management System (ISO 9001). 

4.1.1 Maintaining Service Quality  

The Company’s Audit Committee and Risk and Investment Management Committee oversee 

regular inspections, evaluate and manage risks arising from our operations, and ensure the 

effectiveness of key internal controls. The two committees report findings to the Board for 

review. Through these procedures, we ensure full implementation of our policies and 

compliance with regulatory requirements or applicable laws. 

SIIC Environment maintains a project management system and operational management 

procedures applicable to the Company as a whole. We hold quarterly meetings where our 

business operations report their operational performance, significant fluctuations of water 

input and water supply, and material incidents to our headquarter. Interactions at these 

meetings help us identify opportunities to improve our service quality.  

Our business units have developed management systems and standard operating procedures 

to continuously improve the project companies’ operation processes and guarantee safe and 

quality production activities. For example, project companies from the water supply business 

abide by internal policies such as the Management System for Production and Operation 

Processes to meet internal operation, maintenance and safety standards; in the event of water 

quality exceedances, the project companies take actions in accordance with the emergency 

response plans outlined in the internal policies. For sludge treatment projects, we designate 

relevant personnel to conduct regular inspections and surveys with our customers on sludge 

treated by our sludge treatment plants to ensure the treated sludge meets relevant standards. 

The Dazhou City Municipal Household Waste Incineration Power Generation Project 1st Phase 

from our Waste Incineration Division has developed the Environmental Monitoring Plan, 

which specifies the monitoring location, parameter, frequency, and method for waste gas, 

wastewater, noise, groundwater, soil, solidified fly ash, and slag, guaranteeing that the 

emissions meet the relevant environmental standards. 

To guarantee the quality of drinking water provided to our customers and protect public 

health, the water supply projects have developed quality assurance procedures based on the 

Standards for Drinking Water Quality (GB 5749-2006) and other industry standards. By 

increasing testing frequency of raw water quality, enhancing water quality early warning 

systems, optimizing chemical composition for treatment, and other measures, the project 


39 

 

companies make great efforts to ensure that the quality of water supply meets the industry 

standards.  

4.1.2 Improving Customer Satisfaction 

Feedback from customers is crucial in helping the Company improve service quality. At our 

Central China business unit, in the event that a customer files a complaint related to our 

products or services, we first categorize the complaint and identify the personnel responsible 

for the issue, and subsequently carry out investigations and promptly resolve the issue. We 

then review the complaint case, and if necessary, modify the existing management systems 

or develop new ones to prevent recurrence of the issue. During the Reporting Period, we 

received 10 service-related customer complaints, mainly on water quality, water pressure and 

water meter. For water quality-related complaints, we sampled the water at the customer’s 

site and provided testing results to the customers in a timely manner (all testing results met 

the relevant water quality standards); for complaints regarding water pressure or water meter 

issues, we conducted prompt site visits to check water pressure or calibrated water meters at 

the customers’ site, and provided timely feedbacks and solutions to the problems proposed 

by the customer. As a result of our prompt response and professional problem-handling 

process, the customers expressed satisfaction towards the handling results. 

Case study:  

In recent years, employees from our water supply project companies continue to engage in 

neighbourhood and community service programs to educate residents on water use and 

water saving tips, collect customers’ feedbacks and promptly respond to their concerns to 

help improve our service quality. On 28 August 2019, employees of Yiyang City Tap Water Co., 

Ltd. visited a local community and met with representatives from three nearby 

neighbourhoods, who provided feedback on water supply and usage. To address the issues 

raised by the representatives during the meeting, our employees subsequently conducted site 

visits and developed prompt solutions to the problems.  

 

 

Figure 26. Employees of Yiyang City Tap Water Co., Ltd. met with representatives from local 

communities to gather customers’ feedback, and conducted site visits to effectively solve the issues 

raised during the meeting. 

Regarding customer privacy, at our Central China business unit, we strengthen customer 

information protection by enhancing employee education, standardizing information 

management and reinforcing data protection technology. We provide training to staff in 

contact with customer information, such as sales, management and maintenance personnel, 

to increase their awareness of customer data protection and information security. At the same 






40 

 

time, we standardize management procedures for the uploading, transfer and search of 

customer data, and utilize password protection and data backup to further enhance 

information security. In addition, we strengthen maintenance of the hardware and software 

critical to the safe operation of our information system and reinforce data breach prevention 

technologies.  

4.1.3 Supply Chain Management 

During the procurement stage, the Company manages the bidding process through a fair and 

transparent supplier evaluation system to facilitate efficient procurement and guarantee the 

quality of purchased products and services. These activities are also performed in accordance 

with the Bidding Law of the PRC, the Regulation on the Implementation of the Bidding Law of 

the PRC and other relevant laws and regulations. 

The Company regularly reviews and updates the list of contracted suppliers in accordance 

with procedures set out in the Material Supplier Review and Management System, the Project 

Company On-site Procurement Management System and other policies. These policies include 

the use of routine and spontaneous on-site inspections, ratings and evaluations of suppliers’ 

performance. Our Waste Incineration Division has developed a scoring system to quantify 

suppliers’ performance during procurement and on product and service quality and user 

experience, and categorize suppliers into A, B and C levels based on the final score. For A-level 

suppliers, we would increase procurement quantity as a reward; for B-level suppliers, we 

maintain the current procurement quantity; for C-level suppliers, we would suspend 

procurement and propose supplier improvement plans, and resume procurement once the 

supplier has rectified the issues.   

To better manage the environmental and social risks of the supply chain and the overall quality 

of products and services provided by the suppliers, our business units have implemented 

policies such as the Supplier Management System. One of the basic supplier entry criteria 

listed in the Supplier Management System is the supplier’s ability to fulfil its environmental 

and social responsibilities. In the implementation of supplier management policies at our 

Northeast China business unit, if the supplier was found to practice bribery, have product or 

service quality problems that have caused major accidents, or other issues specified in the 

Supplier Management System, we would immediately terminate partnership with the supplier 

and in cases of severe violations, not consider the supplier for any future business cooperation 

opportunities.

4.2 Research and Development 

At SIIC Environment, we believe technological development and innovation will help improve 

our operational efficiency and service quality, increasing our competitiveness in the 

environmental industry. During the Reporting Period, we continued to explore opportunities 

for technological development and our expenditure on research activities amounted to 

approximately RMB 2.85 million. The business units actively engaged in cross-unit technical 

exchange meetings, developed internal reward systems to encourage research and 

technological innovation, participated in provincial and national research programs, and 

adopted other measures to create a favourable environment for research and development. 

As will be discussed in the next section, we also actively seek opportunities to partner with 

educational and research institutions to enhance our research capabilities, and explore new 

development paths that combine production, research and education. During research and 

development activities, we register, maintain and protect our patents and will seek legal 

assistance in cases of violations of our intellectual property rights. 

Case study:  

In 2019, our Central China business unit organized three cross-business unit technical 

exchange meetings. The meetings covered topics ranging from wastewater treatment 

technologies to operation management. Information gathered during the meetings was 

compiled into technical essays to facilitate information sharing and technological 

improvement. To create an environment favourable for technological development and 

putting theory into practice, in May 2019, the Central China business unit formulated a reward 

system that provides financial rewards to employees who publish journal articles in national 

industry journals, academic journal collections, and other external publications. 

 

Figure 28. In February 2019, our Central China, South China business and Ranhill Water units 

participated in a technical exchange meeting. 

Case study: 

In October 2019, our Northeast China business unit successfully registered as a high-tech 

enterprise in Heilongjian Province, demonstrating the business unit’s high level of awareness 

in innovation and strong capabilities in market development and operational management. In 

addition, construction of the second phase of the business unit’s Research and Development 

Centre is close to completion and will soon be in operation. The second phase of the Research 

and Development Centre aims to construct the nation’s most established enterprise cold-




42 

 

climate aquatic microorganisms centre and provide technical support for the application of 

cold-climate water treatment technologies.   

The Northeast China business unit also made technological breakthroughs in sludge treatment 

in 2019. After approximately one year of testing and trialling, the business unit completed the 

remodelling of the sludge advanced dewatering system at the Harbin City WWTP and Sludge 

Disposal Project, marking another milestone in the business unit’s research and application of 

sludge treatment technologies. The upgraded dewatering technology can achieve advanced 

dewatering of sludge, and helped increase sludge treatment capacity at the Harbin City WWTP 

and Sludge Disposal Project by 33% in November 2019 compared to the level in November 

2018, with estimated annual cost savings of approximately RMB 5 million.  

4.3 Communication and Partnerships Within the Industry 

Maintaining communication with other sectors in the environmental industry is crucial in 

bringing new ideas and directions for our business growth and keeping ourselves updated on 

market and industry trends. We actively seek opportunities to collaborate with peer 

companies, educational institutions and other sectors, hoping to better contribute to the 

environmental protection and sustainable development in China, and help the public better 

understand wastewater treatment, waste incineration and other businesses in the 

environmental industry.  

Case study:  

In April 2019, the Company participated in the 20th IE expo China in Shanghai. More than 2,000 

companies from China and around the world brought over 30,000 cutting-edge environmental 

technologies to the expo, ranging from water treatment technologies to noise mitigation 

technologies. Apart from presenting our strengths and accomplishments in the environmental 

sector at the expo, we actively interacted with peer companies from China and overseas to 

exchange information and ideas, and with companies from up and down the value chain for 

potential collaboration opportunities. We look forward to engaging in different types of 

events that facilitate environmental protection in various ways in the future to maintain 

communication with peer companies and other sectors in the environmental industry.  


43 

 

 

Figure 29. SIIC Environment participated in the 20th IE expo China held in Shanghai in April 2019. 

Case study:  

In 2019, we signed a strategic cooperation framework agreement with Baowu Environment 

and Canvest Environment, and will utilize our respective strengths and resources to 

collaborate in the field of environmental technology to ensure that the Shanghai Baoshan 

Renewable Energy Utilization Centre Project, currently under construction, will follow 

international environmental standards and serve as an exemplary waste incineration power 

generation project in China. Through the strategic cooperation framework agreement, we 

plan to actively explore opportunities arising from the transformation of steel industrial parks 

in major cities along the Yangtze River such as Nanjing, Wuhan, Ma’anshan, and Chongqing, 

establish more high-standard and modern environmental projects, and contribute to 

ecological protection and development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. We will work 

together with our partners to vigorously strengthen research and development of 

technologies, enter the field of high-end manufacturing of environmental protection 

equipment in due course, extend value chains, respond to the Belt and Road Initiative, and 

actively expand into overseas markets.

Case study:  

On 19 November 2019, our Northeast China business unit signed a strategic cooperation 

framework agreement with East University of Heilongjiang. School-enterprise collaboration is 

a powerful way to serve local community and boost local economy. We look forward to 

working with East University of Heilongjiang on cultivating talents, research and development 

and other areas to improve our corporate core competency. We hope the partnership will 

also benefit the university and its students with our resources such as job and internship 

opportunities, therefore achieving a win-win outcome through school-enterprise cooperation.

4.4 Employment Management and Employee Welfare 

4.4.1 Employment and Labour Practices 

The Company is committed to talent management and adheres to a “people-oriented” spirit. 

We strongly believe that our employees are the most important asset to the Company, as 

their work influences our corporate culture and business growth. We strictly comply with the 

Labour Law of the PRC, Labour Contract Law of the PRC, Regulation on the Implementation of 

the Labour Contract Law of the PRC, Employment Act of Singapore, Employment of Foreign 

Manpower Act of Singapore, and other laws and regulations related to compensation and 

dismissal, recruitment and promotion, working hours, rest periods, equal opportunity, 

diversity, anti-discrimination, and other benefits and welfare. During the Reporting Period, 

there were no non-compliance cases regarding the above laws and regulations. 

As described in the Recruitment Management Measures, Employee Relations Management 

Measures and other internal policies, we provide open and equal employment opportunities 

to attract talent, and bear no discriminations toward gender, age, race, or religion of the 

applicants. The termination of employment contracts and dismissal of employees are carried 

out in strict compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and we fully protect the rights and 

obligations of both the employees and the Company. 

We have also established the Attendance Management System and implement a work 

schedule of 8 hours per day in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. Each project 

company arranges its own working hours according to the actual work requirements and 

reports the work schedule to the human resource, administrative and legal departments for 

record keeping. The arrangement of employees’ working hours needs to ensure the total 

amount of working hours and the normal operations. In the case that there is a need for 

employees to work overtime, the concerned department needs to prepare an overtime work 

plan beforehand and submit for the management’s approval; employees can take 

compensatory time off after the overtime work concludes.  

The Company adopts a zero-tolerance approach toward child labour and forced labour, and 

we abide by relevant laws and regulations such as the Labour Law of the PRC and Provisions 

on the Prohibition of Using Child Labour. During the recruitment process, we verify applicants’ 

identity and employment eligibility to prevent hiring underage candidates. We establish 

labour relations with employees based on equality and mutual benefit and do not retain 

employees’ identity documents or sign unlawful agreement or contract with employees. If 

forced labour was identified, employees can report directly to local labour supervision groups. 

When cases of child labour or forced labour are found, we take immediate action to eliminate 

such practices, identify and penalize staff members responsible for the violations, and review 

and improve our employment management systems to prevent future violations.  

The Company had a total workforce of 6,140 full-time employees and zero part-time 

employees by the end of 2019. We continue to improve our recruitment strategies and 

employee recognition and reward systems to attract and retain the best talents. A breakdown 

of our employees by gender, age group, and geographical region is shown below:

4.4.2 Employee Benefits 

We ensure that employees are fairly compensated by assessing individual skills and 

contributions, corporate performance, market trends, and other factors stipulated in the 

Compensation Management System and other internal policies. In addition to offering 

competitive remuneration and bonuses in accordance with the requirements outlined in the 

Employee Benefits Management System, Holiday Management System and other internal 

policies, we also provide employees with medical allowances, regular physical examinations, 

paternity and maternity leave, marriage leave, personal accident insurance as well as 

retirement benefits. At Ranhill Water, we also provide additional compensation for nightshift 

employees and distribute employee allowances in summer for coping with the hot weather. 

Our employee manuals set out clear policies and codes of conduct for office procedures, 

reporting duty, attendance, performance appraisals, rewards and penalties, compensation 

and benefits as well as training and employee rights. 

To enrich employees’ life after work and strengthen team cohesion, our business units and 

project companies organized a variety of recreational activities during the Reporting Period.

4.4.3 Training and Development 

SIIC Environment views professional development and training of its employees as a way to 

broaden employees’ horizons and assist them in realizing their own value and potential. The 

business units within the Company have established relevant internal policies such as the 

Production Training Management System based on their actual operation. At Ranhill Water, 

we provide a range of internal and external training programs such as new employee training, 

position-specific training, and external training opportunities for management personal and 

professional staff. Without affecting work performances, we encourage employees to attend 

different kinds of education and training programs, and grant time off for employees who 

need to prepare for professional examinations. Our training programs take on various forms 

to enhance their effectiveness, such as inter-departmental exchange programs, position 

rotations, lectures, and skillset competitions. When an employee completes a training 

program, we conduct evaluations to assess the effectiveness of the training and take the 

evaluation results into consideration in the yearend assessment of the employee 

performances. During the Reporting Period, a total of 4,943 employees received 

approximately 54,166 hours of training, as shown in the graphs below. The average training 

hours per employee were approximately 8.8 hours.

4.4.4 Occupational Health and Safety   

Safety is our top priority at SIIC Environment. We strictly comply with the Law of the PRC on 

Work Safety, Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Control of Occupational Diseases and other 

laws and regulations related to providing a safe working environment and protecting 

employees from occupational hazards. During the Reporting Period, there were no cases of 

non-compliance regarding the above laws and regulations; a total of 240 days was lost due to 

work injury and there was no work-related fatality. Projects of our business units have 

implemented or are in the process of adopting the Occupational Health and Safety 

Assessment Series (OHSAS 18001).   

From a supervisory perspective, the Company adheres to national standards such as the 

Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Employers’ Occupational Health 

Surveillance and Regulations on the Reporting, Investigation and Disposition of Work Safety 

Accidents. We have standardized our safety accident reporting procedures to ensure that 

accidents are reported to supervisory personnel and regulatory authorities in a timely manner. 

We submit reports to regulatory authorities on a regular basis to disclose results of our self-

assessments on occupational and health safety (“OHS”) hazards. Recommendations provided 

by regulatory authorities lay a foundation for us to further improve our safety standards. 

The mechanisms of production safety in our workplace are based on three main aspects: 

strengthening safety management systems, enhancing employee safety education, and 

improving employees’ emergency preparedness. Our business units have incorporated these 

mechanisms when developing production safety management systems to ensure safe 

operation at the project companies.  

To strengthen safety management systems, the Company has established specialist teams, 

which are responsible for coordinating, planning, organizing, developing, and promoting 

health and safety matters. Our Ranhill Water business unit has formed a safety committee at 

the business unit level and requires each project company to establish safety teams. Ranhill 

Water conducts semi-annual comprehensive safety assessments of the project companies in 

accordance with its Safe Production Management System, which also specifies work 

procedures for safety management of production activities and equipment, management of 

safety briefings and meetings, rules on safety inspection, and the handling of safety incidents. 

Our East China business unit has developed a set of rules and policies on managing safety-

related issues during production and office activities, and on managing safety risks of suppliers, 

construction teams and other external parties. The other business units have also developed 

and implemented similar policies to streamline safety management at the project companies.  

In addition, in accordance with the requirements specified in the safety management systems, 

we provide personal protective equipment to employees in specialist and technical positions 

and conduct regular quality check on the equipment. The equipment is required to meet 

applicable national or industrial standards with respect to their design, manufacturing, 

installation, and usage. 

To enhance employee safety education, we organize employees to participate in regular 

safety trainings. Our business units have developed safety training management systems, 

which specify training requirements for different employee types including the management, 

safety personnel, new employees, and employees in special positions such as those working 

with hazardous chemicals. Before commencing work activities, new employees are required 

to pass a three-level safety training given by representatives from the business unit, 


52 

 

department and project team levels. Topics covered at the training include OHS laws and 

regulations and the Company’s policies, knowledge on using safety equipment, emergency 

response measures, and other relevant information.  

To improve employees’ emergency preparedness, every year we organize emergency drills to 

help employees better respond to fire, water quality incidents and other emergencies. For 

employees whose work may pose potential health threats, we provide annual occupational 

health checkups in addition to the general checkups.

4.5 Community Investment 

SIIC Environment has a strong presence in the society and we actively engage in public welfare 

activities related to environmental protection, education, labour needs, and other areas. 

During community engagement events, we follow the principles of legality, voluntariness and 

honesty, and with particular focus on ecological and environmental protection, aiming to 

promote industry-related knowledge among the public and contribute more to environmental 

protection. In 2019, we contributed a total of 3,906 hours and approximately RMB 5.8 million 

to community engagement activities. 

4.5.1 Cultivating Environmental Awareness 

The Company has a corporate mission of remaining committed to protecting the planet, 

conserving the environment and preserving natural resources along with pursuing business 

growth. We recognize the importance of passing on these concepts to our internal and 

external stakeholders. Internally, these concepts are communicated via corporate culture 

training, talks, environmental knowledge competitions, newsletters, and other platforms. 










54 

 

Externally, we convey our corporate mission via social media, public reports (including 

sustainability reports), exhibitions, conferences, site visits, and business open houses. During 

the Reporting Period, we hosted and participated in a variety of activities aimed at raising 

environmental awareness of the public. 

Case study:  

On 5 June 2019, the annual Environment Day, the Company participated in activities themed 

“Beautiful Shanghai, I am a Participant” in Shanghai, echoing the national Environment Day 

theme “Beautiful China, I am a Participant”. We participated in educating the public on waste 

sorting and presenting community engagement in green development.  

 

Figure 47. The Company participated in the 2019 Environment Day activities in Shanghai. 

Case study:  

In October 2019, our Northeast China business unit hosted open houses in Harbin City, 

Heilongjiang Province for students from local primary schools. Students visited wastewater 

treatment facilities and learned how turbid water is turned clear. Students also developed a 

better understanding of water shortages in China and the importance of establishing good 

water saving habits.

hosted the “Drinking Danjiang Water, Protecting Mother River” plastic waste cleanup event. 

During the event, employees distributed flyers to the public, urging them to protect the 

Mudanjiang River watershed and the riparian environment. The event was well received by 

the public, who voluntarily joined our employees in the cleanup. 

 

Figure 49. Plastic waste cleanup event at the Mudanjiang River. 

4.5.2 Giving Back to the Community 

SIIC Environment’s business activities are closely linked to people’s everyday life and we strive 

to build a rapport with local communities where we operate our business. To this end, 

employees are encouraged to participate in community services and utilize available 

corporate resources to help those in need.  

Case study:  

On 8 July 2019, approximately 50 employees from our Northeast China business unit 

participated in a book distributing volunteer event organized by local governments and 

associations in Harbin City. The event aimed to educate the public on public health and safety 

emergency response measures. Our volunteers will continue to serve the community and the 

environment under the service motto of “Helping Others, Improving Ourselves”.

Case study:  








56 

 

Our Xinxiang City Sludge Treatment and Disposal Project, located in Tangzhuang County, 

Weihui City in Henan Province, donated approximately 10,000 tonnes of soil produced to local 

communities for restoration of abandoned mine pits. In addition, when choosing suppliers 

during business activities, the project prioritizes local suppliers to help boost local economy. 

Currently 50% of the project’s raw material suppliers and 75% of the project’s labour force are 

local.  

At the beginning of 2019, the project provided the end product, nutrient soil, to a local peach 

orchard owner for free trial use and offered complimentary soil testing services. Testing 

results showed that our soil product complies with the risk screening values for soil 

contamination of agricultural land listed in the Soil Environmental Quality Risk Control 

Standard for Soil Contamination of Agricultural Land (Trial) (GB 15618-2018). The orchard 

owner later commented that peaches grew better on the soil we provided compared to 

previous years, and recommended our soil product to nearby orchards.

5. Combatting COVID-19 

The COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 has promoted awareness of the government and the 

public on the importance of pollution prevention and control, which is a significant component 

of the utility industry and an essential part of public safety management systems. Public 

services closely related to the residents, such as ensuring safe water supply, complying with 

wastewater treatment standards, turning waste into resources, and properly disposing 

medical waste are vital to the overall interests of the community and the society. As a leading 

enterprise in the environmental protection industry, SIIC Environment shoulders corporate 

social responsibility and values social benefits along with developing corporate economy. We 

actively respond to national policies on disease prevention and control, integrate corporate 

growth with needs of the country, and devote every effort to the battle against COVID-19. 

Once the outbreak occurred, the Company instantly established a disease prevention and 

control command center (‘Command Center’). Business units and project companies 

assembled multi-level disease prevention and control groups to guarantee normal and steady 

operation of all projects, guarantee safe water supply, and protect urban ecological 

environment. 

5.1 Fighting tirelessly to serve the public 

SIIC Environment maintained normal operation with a focus on preventing disease, which 

actively responded to the call of the government. Employees of the Company adhere to the 

spirits of maintaining high-quality services and hold their positions in the frontlines to ensure 

the normal operation of wastewater treatment, water supply and other businesses. 

Remaining true to our original aspiration and keeping our mission firmly in mind, SIIC 

Environment will contribute wherever there is need in the environmental sector. 

During the pandemic, the Company made overall arrangements for production and operation 

activities. Under the coordination of Command Center, the internal disease prevention and 

control groups surveyed project companies on problems encountered in disease control and 

operation activities, assisted staff in tackling the relevant problems, and ensured the ample 

inventory of disease control equipment, chemicals used for operation activities and the other 

necessities for our business. The groups also established feasible and effective temporary 

management measures to guarantee the normal operation of each project. 

In order to maintain people’s life quality and promptly solve customers’ problems, during the 

pandemic, our water supply customer service hotline was accessible 24/7 and the pipeline 

network maintenance staff were on standby at all times; we also opened online services. 

Project companies involved in disease prevention and control managed the regional health 

and medical facilities and treatment centers in accordance with the requirements and 

designated responsible persons to ensure stable water supply at the medical facilities and 

treatment centers. All projects of the Company comprehensively strengthened management 

and control measures, increased the frequency of water quality testing, closely monitored the 

quality of influent water, and promptly adjusted process parameters and chemical addition, 

in order to ensure that the effluent meets relevant discharge standards and prevent the 

spread of coronavirus through aerosols, wastewater and sludge. Most of our projects, 

especially those in affected areas adopted various measures to guarantee that effluent meet 

relevant discharge standards in order to safeguard the aquatic environment. These measures 

included increasing the dosage of sodium hypochlorite and conducting daily testing for 


59 

 

residual chlorine and fecal coliform in the effluent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We exhibited our corporate responsibility through coordinated development and mutual 

assistance. While maintaining our normal operations and fulfilling own duties, we actively 

mobilized resources to help residents in the surrounding communities. Upon learning the 

shortage in disinfectant supply in the local communities, the Pinghu City Eastern WWTP 

Project from the East China business unit took immediate actions. Under the premise of 











Figure 53. We maintained normal operations of water supply during the pandemic. Our water supply 

customer service hotline was accessible 24/7 during the pandemic. 

Figure 54. During the pandemic, all projects closely monitored water quality to ensure water use safety 

and prevent disease outspreading.

ensuring stable operation, the project provided disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite to 

local companies and residents free of charge, and educated them on preparing disinfecting 

solution, which received compliments from the local residents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Case study: Constructing "water of life" module hospital  

On February 7, 2020, Wuhan City Huangpi District 

Xinwuhu Water Plant 1st Phase was informed that the 

water supply project of the second mobile cabin 

hospital in Wuhan City needs to be completed within 24 

hours. Upon receiving the task, the water plant 

immediately 

organized 

staff 

to 

conduct 

field 

investigation of the site. We worked days and nignts to 

successfully complete the task. The water supply 

pipeline of the mobile cabin hospital was fully 

connected and the "water of life" of the module hospital 

was ready in time. 

 





Figure 56. The normal operation of water supply, waste treatment, 

wastewater treatment, and other public utilities and public services played 

an indispensable role in fighting against COVID-19.

5.2 Coordinating resources, Protecting employees 

SIIC Environment always puts the lives, health and safety of employees first. In the early stage 

of the pandemic, the Company purchased and deployed disease prevention materials through 

multiple channels, in order to secure the first line of defense and provide a favourable working 

environment for employees and to build a safety fortress for employees who are fighting in 

the frontline in Hubei Province, especially in affected areas such as Wuhan City. We have 

equipped our employees with protective equipment such as masks, disinfectants, protective 

clothing, and goggles. Through reasonable deployment of operating personnel, closed 

production and operation management, and the transfer of employees to and from work by 

dedicated vehicles, we have effectively reduced the risk of cross-contamination. Other 

measures including strict body temperature measurements for personnel entering the factory 

area, reducing nonessential on-site work shifts, cleaning and disinfecting production areas and 

public areas at regular intervals every day have also been adopted. 

During the pandemic, we were moved by the cohesion and solidarity of the Chinese people. 

We pay high tribute to the medical staff and the People’s Liberation Army soldiers who fought 

unreservedly regardless of the danger. We also noted down the bits and pieces that occurred 

around us as an environmental professional during the pandemic, which are the encouraging 

stories of mutual encouragement and striving forward hand-in-hand. We have collected a 

number of colorful anti-pandemic works by organizing employees to solicit articles, poems, 

calligraphy and paintings, paper-cut and other ways to help employees stay motivated, and 

engage in pandemic prevention and control and work safety with full fighting spirits.
