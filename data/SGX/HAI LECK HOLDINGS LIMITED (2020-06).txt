2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 

EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN 

AND CEO’S STATEMENT 

 

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS, 

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Hai Leck 

Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), 

I am pleased to present our sustainability report 

for the financial year ended 30 June 2020 

(“FY2020”). 

 

FY2020 has been a particularly challenging year. 

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to leave its 

adverse impact on not just the Group, but also the 

Singapore and global economies. 

 

The current situation brings to the forefront the 

importance of being able to sustain the viability 

and profitability of the Group for the long-term: we 

continue to be mindful of the importance of 

environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

factors that are key to the sustainability of the 

Group’s operations in this difficult environment. 

 

Health and safety of our personnel are of 

paramount importance amidst this pandemic. We 

continue to focus on this key sustainability factor, 

beyond 

the 

occupational 

perspective 

to 

encompass personal aspects as well. 

 

We are comforted to hear of reports that global 

warming effects have slowed down in the recent 

months: a silver lining as the world struggles with 

the effects of the pandemic. We continue to share 

in the global community’s concerns over climate 

change and actively play our part to ensure that 

our operations do not bring harm to the 

environment and personnel involved. 

 

The circuit breaker, safe distancing measures and 

even the phased resumption of activities have 

added to the concerns and challenges faced by 

our people. I am heartened by the unity and 

resilience that they have shown and thank them 

for their flexibility, dedication and hard work. 

 

 

 

 

“Flexibility in our operations 

will be key to navigate the 

uncertainties and 

challenges ahead.” 

 

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank 

all our stakeholders: customers, shareholders,  

employees, suppliers, bankers and business 

partners for the support given through the years. 

The Group looks forward to being able to 

contribute to the well-being of all stakeholders for 

many years to come.

2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 

We have zero tolerance where workplace safety 

is concerned, and this is a culture that we actively 

cultivate within the Group. 

 

We have a target of a zero accident workplace. To 

that end, we have implemented a robust 

workplace safety and health management system 

that is BS OHSAS 18001 compliant. We have also 

been certified to have attained bizSAFE Level Star 

which is the highest certification level accorded by 

the Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) Council. 

 

In line with our culture of zero tolerance where 

safety is concerned, we believe that everyone is 

responsible for their own safety and the safety of 

others. To inculcate this culture right from the start, 

each new hire is required to attend the necessary 

safety 

induction 

courses 

tailored 

to 

their 

respective scope of work, during which workplace 

hazards and at-risk areas are highlighted. They 

are also issued with standard personal protective 

equipment 

as 

well 

as 

specialised 

safety 

equipment suited to their nature of work. In the 

current global health situation, masks are also 

supplied to further protect their health. External 

training courses and all medical examinations 

required under the Workplace Safety and Health 

Act are carried out by qualified service providers. 

 

We regularly share best safety practices in order 

to continuously improve on our safety standards. 

Recent accidents in the industry or near misses 

are periodically shared as learning points and to 

serve as reminder of the importance of safety at 

our workplace. To further reinforce the importance 

of workplace safety, we regularly conduct safety 

campaigns or actively participate in campaigns 

organised by our customers. 

 

In fact, safety is so deeply ingrained into our 

corporate culture that compliance with the Group’s 

safety requirements and safety awareness form 

part of our performance appraisal. 

 

Our safety performance record for FY2020 and 

the financial year ended 30 June 2020 (“FY2020”) 

are as shown below:

* Fatality was due to personal medical condition which was 

non-work related. 

 

In recognition of our safety efforts, we received 

various accolades from industry associations and 

our customers. Amongst the accolades received 

in FY2020 are: 

▪ 

Excellent Safety Performance Award 

▪ 

Safety Performance for an Injury Free 2019 

▪ 

Zero Lost Time Incident in 2019 

▪ 

CultureSAFE Certificate of Commendation 

 

Beyond occupational health and safety, we also 

prioritised personal health and safety. Since news 

of COVID-19 first surfaced, we have actively 

sought to protect our personnel by equipping them 

with face masks and advised them to avoid 

crowded areas. We increased frequency of 

cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched 

surfaces and made hand sanitisers readily 

available even before official guidelines were 

issued by the authorities. 

 

Unfortunately, notwithstanding our best efforts, we 

were not able to keep the infection at bay. While 

our workers have since been cleared to resume 

work, we continue to be mindful of the need to 

remain vigilant and work closely with our 

personnel to ensure necessary precautions 

continue to be taken.

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

 

We 

dispose 

of 

waste 

in 

a 

safe 

and 

environmentally sound manner in accordance with 

local regulations. 

 

The waste generated by our operations are 

categorised into hazardous and non-hazardous 

waste. Due to its potential impact on the 

environment and persons who come into contact 

with them, waste disposal, particularly hazardous 

waste, is taken seriously. All wastes are collected 

by licensed waste collector to ensure proper 

transportation and disposal. 

 

The amount of waste generated is a function of 

the level of activities during the year. Nonetheless, 

the Group is careful not to procure excess raw 

materials with limited shelf life that may eventually 

end up as waste. 

 

The quantities of hazardous and non-hazardous 

waste disposed in FY2020 and FY2019 are as 

shown below: 

 

 

 

 

 

Our target is to have no violation of local 

regulations. There were no violations in FY2020. 

 

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

 

We are committed to creating wealth for our 

stakeholders. Therefore, we constantly seek 

opportunities 

for 

operational 

and 

financial 

improvements.
