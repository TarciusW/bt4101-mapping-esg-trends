As a key player in the global palm oil industry, Wilmar International Limited strives to 

lead by example and set new benchmarks in our endeavours. Across every aspect of 

our organisation, we seek to uphold the right practices and policies that govern the 

way we operate our business, the way we engage our community and the way we 

protect our environment.

“Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean.” 

– Ryunosuke Satoro, Japanese poet

Inspired by this meaningful quote, the design for this Sustainability Report references 

the strength of synergy. It illustrates Wilmar’s ability to build on a strong network of 

partnerships and friendships that enable us to pave the way forward and achieve our 

Sustainable Development Goals in today’s evolving global landscape.

Our progress and growth story is not founded on one person but propelled by the 

concerted efforts of all stakeholder groups. By optimising our collective strengths and 

Moving Forward Together, we will overcome new challenges and make greater strides 

towards the sustainable transformation of the agri-commodity industry.

SCOPE AND BOUNDARY

Wilmar International Limited (‘Wilmar’ or ‘the Group’) has 

applied the guidance of Global Reporting Index (GRI) 

Sustainability Standards as well as the Singapore Exchange 

(SGX) Sustainability Reporting Guide, on setting the 

boundaries and identifying the most significant aspects for 

disclosure in this report. As such, this report will present 

updates and metrics on Wilmar’s performance in relation 

to our sustainability commitments, placing particular focus 

on our No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation 

(NDPE) policy and our contributions to the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs - see page 7 for 

more information).

In line with our efforts to meet the expectations of our 

stakeholders, we have also taken further steps to increase 

the transparency and accountability of our operations by 

significantly expanding the scope of our annual sustainability 

reports. The data presented in the report now covers Wilmar’s 

global palm oil and sugarcane operations. This includes both 

upstream and downstream business where we have a major 

presence and over 50% shareholding and operational control. 

The primary focus of the report is the performance of our 

own plantations, mills and refineries in Indonesia, Malaysia, 

Ghana and Nigeria for palm, and Myanmar, Australia, 

New Zealand and Indonesia for sugarcane. For our palm 

oil operations, this includes our crude palm and lauric oil 

suppliers as well as fresh fruit bunch (FFB) suppliers. While 

we now have better insight into the performance of our 

key suppliers, we have not included these in our metrics as 

such information is subject to confidentiality agreements. 

The performance data disclosed does not cover:

•	

Downstream	and	upstream	operations	in	which	

Wilmar has 50% ownership or less, or operations over 

which the Group does not have management control.

•	

Other	downstream	and	upstream	activities	outside	

the Group's palm oil and sugarcane operations (i.e. 

does not process exclusively palm oil and cane sugar).

•	

Environmental	figures	for	unplanted	areas	inside	

Group plantations, although data on conservation 

areas and fire incidents are included.

REPORTING PERIOD

This report covers performance data for the calendar year 

2017 (unless otherwise stated) as well as five-year historical 

figures, where available. Due to the fast-moving nature of 

the issues described, we have also included information on 

our progress in 2018 as well as on our planned activities 

and targets for 2019.

IDENTIFICATION AND PRIORITISATION

We have reviewed the major topics discussed in this report 

through various forums and engagements, including email 

correspondence and phone interviews with key stakeholder 

groups. The interviews were conducted with representatives 

from the finance sector, the non-governmental organisations 

(NGOs) sector, as well as from our customer base and 

third-party suppliers. In addition, we reviewed the aspects 

covered by other palm and sugar-related initiatives, such 

as the High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach Steering Group, 

the Zoological Society of London’s (ZSL) Sustainable Palm 

Oil Transparency Initiative (SPOTT), CDP (formerly known 

as Carbon Disclosure Project), Ceres Reporting Guidance 

for Responsible Palm, the Fair and Free Labour Principles 

for Palm Oil Production and KnowTheChain. 

We also held an internal workshop in November 2017, 

where we undertook a thorough review of our materiality 

matrix for our palm oil operations and developed a specific 

matrix for our sugar business. For palm oil, new major 

themes have emerged that have been evaluated to have 

significant importance for both Wilmar’s business and our 

external stakeholders. Especially noteworthy are jurisdictional 

approaches and/or certifications, which also ranked as the 

highest-priority topic in 2017.

For existing themes, the relative impact on Wilmar’s business 

and the interests of stakeholders have also shifted somewhat 

over the past 12 months. For example, labour conditions 

and transparency appear to be of higher concern in 2017, 

whereas discussions around smallholder inclusiveness have 

been less prominent.

VALIDATION AND REVIEW

We validate our material aspects and ensure balance in our 

reporting through the following key processes:

•	

Through	the	reporting	process,	continuously	

monitoring stakeholder concerns to ensure that these 

are covered by the report. 

•	

Through	advice	from	our	reporting	consultant,	

Helikonia, based on their in-depth knowledge of the 

palm oil industry and its stakeholders.

•	

Through	reviews	and	commentaries	from	various	

stakeholders and experts on critical aspects of our 

disclosure.

The third process has been expanded from our approach 

in previous years, from one overall commentary provided 

by an expert in the sustainable palm oil field, to multiple 

commentaries by identified key stakeholders and experts 

on critical topics.

ASSURANCE

We have engaged Ernst &amp; Young LLP (EY) to perform assurance 

work on selected information disclosed in this report. The 

assurance provided by EY is for use by the Management 

of Wilmar only. Any use or reliance by a third party on the 

said assurance is at the third party’s own risk. Please refer 

to the section “Independent Limited Assurance Statement" 

on page 101 of the report for details. As sustainability 

reporting is an ongoing process, we have chosen to disclose 

and to discuss some of the most pertinent material issues 

for Wilmar and its stakeholders within the boundaries of 

the report. Due to the inherent limitations of the internal 

control structure, it is possible that errors or irregularities in 

the information presented in this report may occur and not 

be detected. We endeavour to increase our efforts on the 

reporting process and to present information in the most 

complete and accurate manner possible. 

SUGAR OPERATIONS

Our sugar operations are subject to significantly less public 

attention than our palm oil operations and receive very few 

enquiries from commercial or civil society stakeholders. Our 

initial materiality matrix is therefore based primarily on our 

perception of general global themes, sector-specific impacts, 

and risks linked to the areas in which we operate.

Statement From The Board

Welcome to Wilmar's Sustainability Report 2017. The following 

sections present an overview of our performance, which we 

measure against both our long-held sustainability objectives 

and the targets we set based on key material Environmental, 

Social &amp; Governance (ESG) factors identified in the last 

reporting period. Assessing the various sustainability issues as 

part of Wilmar's strategic planning process, we have also set 

out our priorities for the next reporting period and beyond.

We strive to provide the most accurate and transparent 

account of our activities and challenges in managing the 

material ESG factors, which we believe this document has 

achieved reasonably. In doing so, we have followed and 

remain fully supportive of the "comply or explain" approach 

to sustainability reporting adopted by SGX, in line with 

increasing investor demand for sustainable returns. The report 

is also prepared in accordance with the GRI Sustainability 

Reporting Standards.

Since 2009, when we published our first Sustainability Report, 

we have worked consistently to ensure our disclosures 

meet the expectations of all our stakeholder groups. For 

this, our sixth Sustainability Report, we have raised the bar 

further by significantly expanding our reporting scope. 

Having previously focused only on our upstream palm oil 

operations, we will now report on all palm oil and sugar 

operations where Wilmar has more than 50% shareholding 

and operational control. This covers all upstream plantation 

and mill operations, including those of our growing sugar 

cane business as well as downstream operations such as 

palm oil-only processing and sugar refining. Our expanded 

scope encompasses Wilmar operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, 

Ghana, Nigeria, Australia, Myanmar and New Zealand. This 

progress in our reporting is fitting, as this is the first year 

that SGX has made sustainability reporting mandatory for 

all listed companies in Singapore.

F

or this, our sixth Sustainability 

Report, we have raised the 

bar further by significantly 

expanding our reporting scope. 

Having previously focused only on 

our upstream palm oil operations,  

we will now report on all palm oil 

and sugar operations where Wilmar 

has more than 50% shareholding 

and operational control. This covers 

all upstream plantation and mill 

operations, including those of our 

growing sugar cane business, as 

well as downstream operations such 

as palm oil-only processing and 

sugar refining.

To maintain our continuing success, as well as our ability to 

deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders, we must also 

create value for society. We are confident that our business 

can play a vital role in building a better and more sustainable 

world, and have therefore committed to contributing towards 

the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)*. 

For this report, we have incorporated the five SDGs that 

are most relevant to our operations in order to showcase 

our contributions in these areas. These are:

•	SDG	4	

-	Quality	education	

•	SDG	8	

-	Decent	work	&amp;	economic	growth

•	SDG	12	 -	Responsible	production	and	consumption	

•	SDG	15	 -	Life	on	land

•	SDG	17	 -	Partnerships	for	the	goals.

These five SDGs are closely aligned to our identified material 

ESG factors (see page 7 for more information on these SDGs).

The theme of this Sustainability Report is "Moving Forward 

Together". This reflects the fact that collective, concerted 

effort from all stakeholder groups will be required to 

achieve progress towards the SDGs, as well as toward our 

overall sustainability objectives. Our world is changing fast, 

with consumer expectations, competitive landscape and 

society all evolving at an unprecedented pace. Wilmar is 

anticipating and adapting to these changes while focusing 

on our commitment to the sustainable transformation of 

the agri-commodity industry.

Support for young people is key to shaping a better future. In 

2017, we embarked on school redevelopment programmes 

in Indonesia and Africa, and these are already enabling our 

workers' children and children in rural communities to access 

quality education. Such programmes will now be expanded 

across our global operations. Wilmar further supports lifelong 

learning and community growth through our broad range of 

smallholder and small grower empowerment programmes 

around the world.

Our efforts to cement Wilmar's position as a leading producer 

and trader of sustainable palm oil continued throughout 

2017, with particular focus on the implementation of our 

NDPE Policy and our close engagement with suppliers. In 

line with the Policy, we have set aside 13.3% of our oil palm 

planted area for conservation since 2009. We have also 

invested in technologies that will enable us to progressively 

reduce the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions footprint of 

our global operations.

Our employees remained as always top of mind as we 

worked hard to strengthen labour practices in our upstream 

operations over the past year. We published a progress report 

in December 2017 detailing the extensive range of actions 

we have taken in areas such as wages and employment, 

health and safety, and labour relations. One of the most 

significant activities has been the launch of our new Child 

Protection Policy, which aims to enhance the welfare of 

children living in and around the oil palm plantations where 

their parents work. Despite a number of challenges, we have 

made meaningful progress with support from a number of 

stakeholder groups, in particular our employees.

Looking forward, Wilmar's Board of Directors is firmly 

committed to building on our 2017 achievements and 

advancing our long-term sustainability agenda for the 

benefit of our company, our industries, our shareholders, 

our communities and our planet. We look forward to the 

continued engagement and support of our stakeholders as 

we work towards our commitments and goals.

In September 2015, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda 

for Sustainable Development which comprises 17 Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets that 

address the world’s most pressing economic, social and 

environmental challenges. Recognising that the private 

sector plays an important role in this global mobilisation, 

we have identified five SDGs that are particularly relevant 

to our business, and to which we are contributing.

The highlighted SDGs are: 

• SDG 4 - 

Quality Education: Ensure inclusive and 

equitable quality education and promote 

lifelong learning opportunities for all

• SDG 8 - 

Decent Work and Economic Growth: 

Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable 

economic growth, full and productive 

employment and decent work for all

• SDG 12 - Responsible Production and Consumption: 

Ensure sustainable consumption and 

production patterns

• SDG 15 - Life on Land: Protect, restore and promote 

sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, 

sustainably manage forests, combat 

desertification, and halt and reverse land 

degradation and halt biodiversity loss

• SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals: Strengthen the 

means of implementation and revitalize 

the global partnership for sustainable 

development

Aligning our targets around these SDGs, the progress we 

have made to-date towards these five goals are mapped 

out below:







To complete construction of 15 methane capture facilities at 

CPO mills.

Timeline

Progress as at 31 Dec 2017

2017

Behind schedule

With five more plants completed in 2017, we are one 

short of meeting the 2015 target due to unforeseen 

soil conditions at one site. It is now expected to be 

done by 2018 with another two in various stages of 

construction. When all 25 sites are in full operation, 

we estimate that we can achieve an annual emissions 

reduction of more than 500,0002 tonnes of carbon 

dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). 

























To complete Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) 

certification audits for 10 stand-alone mills3 in Indonesia.

Timeline

Progress as at 31 Dec 2017

2017

Target updated to 2025

New regulations introduced in 2017 have revised 

the previous directive on which the initial target was 

based. As ISPO certification for independent mills is 

only possible if at least one group of their suppliers 

has been certified, we are liaising with independent 

FFB supply groups to work towards certification.

SUGAR PLANTATIONS, MILLS AND 

REFINERIES

In 2010, Wilmar expanded into the sugar business through 

the acquisition of Sucrogen Limited (known today as Wilmar 

Sugar Australia Limited) in Australia, and we are now one of 

the world's top 10 raw sugar producers, employing around 

4,700	people	globally.	We	are	the	largest	raw	sugar	producer	

and refiner in Australia, the leading sugar refiner in Indonesia, 

and the top consumer pack sugar manufacturer in Australia 

and New Zealand.

In	April	2014,	we	established	a	55/45	joint	venture	with	Great	

Wall Food Stuff Industry Company Limited in Myanmar. The 

joint venture consists of the partners’ existing sugar-related 

businesses, two sugar mills, a bioethanol plant and an organic 

compound fertiliser plant. The Great Wall-Wilmar Sugar Mill 

in Maung Kong, Sagaing Division, is the biggest sugar mill 

in Myanmar with a market share of nearly 30%.

 

Our plantations are located in Northern Myanmar and in 

Queensland, Australia. In 20172, our total planted area 

for sugarcane was 5,862 hectares, producing a combined 

520,485	tonnes	of	sugarcane.	Approximately	89%	of	this	

area is in Australia, with the remaining 11% in Myanmar.

We operate 10 mills: two in Myanmar and eight in Australia. 

In	2017,	our	Australian	plantations	recorded	yields	of	94	

tonnes of sugarcane per planted hectare, while Myanmar’s 

yields	were	64.8	tonnes	of	cane	per	hectare	due	to	different	

climatic conditions and lower levels of mechanisation. One 

of our Australian mills is currently certified to the Bonsucro 

Production Standard and Bonsucro Chain of Custody 

Standard (see page 30 for more details), and another two 

mills and their supply bases in Australia have completed 

their certification audits in 2017.

Through a joint venture with Mackay Sugar, we operate one 

refinery in New Zealand and two refineries in Australia – 

one at Yarraville in Melbourne, Victoria, and another at the 

Racecourse Mill in Mackay, Queensland. We also operate two 

refineries in Indonesia. All of our refineries and warehouse 

operations in Australia and New Zealand as well as one sugar 

refinery in Indonesia have been certified to the Bonsucro 

Chain of Custody Standard.

Our total planted area managed by third-parties in Australia, 

including	lessees	and	independent	producers,	is	161,664	

hectares. Third-party supply accounted for 15,255,008 tonnes 

of sugarcane delivered to our mills in Australia in 2017. In 

Myanmar, 28,131 hectares was managed by schemed and 

contracted smallholders during the 2017-2018 season, 

supplying the mill under our joint venture, Great Wall-Wilmar 

Sugar, with 987,050 tonnes of sugarcane.

Harvesting season in Myanmar takes place during November to April, therefore Myanmar's financial year runs from 1 April to 31 March each 

year (not based on calendar year). As a result, planted area, production and yield data for Myanmar has been taken as at 31 March 2018, and 

Australia data taken as at 31 December 2017.

OVERVIEW OF SUGAR PRODUCTION AND 

PROCESSING 

Sugarcane is one of the world's major agricultural commodities, 

accounting for 80% of sugar produced globally. Sugarcane 

is cultivated in the tropics and subtropics in areas that have 

a plentiful supply of water for a continuous period of more 

than six to seven months each year, either from natural 

rainfall or through irrigation. Although more than 120 

countries produce sugarcane, ten countries dominate global 

raw sugar exports: Brazil, Thailand, Australia, Guatemala, 

Mexico, India, Cuba, Swaziland, Argentina and El Salvador 

accounted for 92% of the trade in 2016 (International Sugar 

Organization 2016). India is currently the world's biggest 

consumer of sugar, followed by the European Union, China, 

Brazil, the USA and Indonesia.

Sugarcane is grown under highly diverse climatic conditions 

and optimum planting and harvesting periods vary across 

different countries. In Australia, sugarcane grows for 12 to 16 

months before being harvested between June and December 

each year. In Myanmar, by contrast, the harvesting season 

takes place between November and April.

Planting

The most common reproduction method is modern stem 

cutting. Billets – cane stalk sections cut by a mechanical 

harvester – are planted by a machine that opens and recloses 

the ground. This is known as billet planting and is common 

in the USA and Australia.

Harvesting

Sugarcane is harvested either manually or mechanically. Our 

Australian operations adopt the mechanical method which 

uses a sugarcane harvester machine to cut the cane at the 

base of the stalk, chops the cane into consistent lengths, 

removes the cane trash and deposits it into a transporter 

following alongside. The separated cane trash is returned 

to the field and acts as mulch for the next round of planting.

 

In our Myanmar operations, harvesting is done by hand when 

the cane stands two to four metres high, cutting the cane 

just above ground-level using cane knives or machetes. For 

the 2017-2018 season, we have started to use sugarcane 

harvesters at one of our farms (Tone Lone).

After each harvest, the cane sends up new stalks. The crop 

from these new stalks are known as "ratoons". Between 

two and ten harvests are usually made depending on the 

agricultural practices employed. In countries with mechanical 

agriculture, sugarcanes are replanted after several harvests 

(up to five) to avoid a lowering in yields. In countries where 

more traditional types of agriculture are used, with smaller 

fields and hand harvesting, sugarcanes are often harvested 

up to ten years before replanting.

Milling

The harvested cane is delivered to the mill with minimal 

delay to avoid deterioration in sugar content levels. The 

sugarcane is crushed by large rollers, and the extracted juice 

is clarified to remove soil and other impurities. This juice is 

concentrated into a syrup by boiling off excess water, seeded 

with raw sugar crystals in a vacuum pan, and then boiled until 

sugar crystals have formed and grown. The boiled mixture 

is centrifuged to separate the molasses from the crystals, 

which are then tumble dried and placed in large storage 

bins for transport to bulk sugar terminals or refineries. Raw 

sugar still contains molasses, which gives it more colour 

(and impurities) than the white sugar that will be produced 

in the refining phase. Molasses is one of the by-products of 

sugar milling, and it is used to produce ethanol and also as 

an additive in livestock feed. The remaining fibrous solids 

from the milling process, called "bagasse", are burned as 

fuel for the mill's steam boilers.

Sugar Refining

Raw sugar is processed into white refined sugar in local 

refineries and then sold to local industries and consumers, 

or it is exported and refined in the country of destination. 

Sugar refining can take place at a back-end refinery attached 

to a raw sugar factory, or at a completely separate facility. 

Whereas most sugar mills only operate during the harvesting 

period, many refineries operate all year round.

STAKEHOLDER COMMENTARY BY PROFOREST

By Erin Logan - Deputy Director, Responsible Sourcing

Whilst there has been significantly less public attention 

and scrutiny given to sugar cane production than 

other commodities, such as palm oil, many of the risks 

associated with its production are intrinsically linked to key 

commitments made by Wilmar and other agro-industrial 

companies. These commitments include implementing 

and complying with the UN Guiding Principles on Business 

and Human Rights, International Labour Organization’s 

conventions and company-own policies on child labour 

and occupational health and safety.

Many companies have also made public commitments to 

the responsible or sustainable sourcing of key ingredients, 

including sugar (in some cases, specifically cane sugar) 

by 2020. The definitions behind what is meant by 

‘sustainable’ or ‘responsible’ are not always clear and 

this can lead to confusion and misinterpretation. Indeed, 

relatively few are disclosing significant details on how 

they define what they mean or how these objectives 

will be met, nor on their progress against these targets. 

It is a positive sign, however, that Wilmar is including 

sugar in their sustainability report this year. The report 

highlights that Wilmar is involved in Bonsucro certification, 

both at production level and through their supply 

chains. Involvement with sustainability schemes such 

as Bonsucro is one of the important elements towards 

meeting sustainability commitments. However, moving 

forward it is important for Wilmar to increase their 

transparency on traceability back to origin through their 

refinery operations and to build on their support for 

continuous improvement in production practices across 

their supply base. This is particularly true where there 

are potential risk factors such as manual harvesting and 

use of migratory labour. Wilmar’s most direct link to this 

type of scenario is in their operations in Myanmar, but 

through their refinery processes they are also potentially 

exposed to many other supply bases where this could 

be the situation.

Regarding traceability, Wilmar has a wealth of experience 

in this area through their work on palm and should 

capitalise on the learnings from working in this sector. 

It will also be important for Wilmar to be transparent on 

where they have joint ventures, stakes in companies or 

are strategic industrial partners. Although Wilmar may 

not be in a position to support a change in practices in 

all locations, it is important for them to be cognisant of 

where they may be exposed to risks.

Wilmar have rightly identified issues such as human 

rights, child and forced labour and water management 

as key priorities for their external stakeholders. But in 

order to have a real and positive impact in the production 

supply bases, it will be paramount to consider the wider, 

systemic issues and root causes of these issues, as well 

as how to address them in a collaborative manner with 

other significant supply chain actors. For instance, 

supporting best agricultural practices, such as access 

to high yielding varieties, mechanisation and improved 

irrigation techniques, could help to mitigate the effects 

of climate instability and improve livelihoods; which 

in turn could potentially go on to reduce the use and 

exploitation of child labour and vulnerable groups.

Being open to a holistic and transparent approach to 

support continuous improvement in sugar cane supply 

bases into the future will put Wilmar at the forefront of a 

positive and necessary movement. Wilmar should aim to 

build on what they are already doing in their more direct 

supply chains and to identify where they can support 

interventions and activities in their wider supply bases 

that reflect their own values and commitments.

ABOUT PROFOREST

Proforest is a unique non-profit group that works through 

a combination of consultancy services and programmes. 

Through their consultancy services they work directly

OUR POLICIES AND 

PRACTICES TO 

SUSTAINABILITY

Working in synergy to work 

responsibly




OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

Sustainability is firmly embedded in our core business 

strategy and operations, and we continue to demonstrate 

our commitment to advancing sustainable agriculture and 

spearheading collective action to expedite supply chain 

transformation. In 2013, we were the first player in the palm 

oil industry to launch an integrated No Deforestation, No 

Peat and No Exploitation (NDPE) Policy that extended to all 

third-party suppliers, which has set the overall direction in our 

journey towards sustainability. Together with international 

standards and our multi-stakeholder partnerships, our NDPE 

Policy guides our efforts to mitigate deforestation, peat 

development and exploitation, both in our own operations 

and in our supply chain. 

In recognition of the private sector’s responsibility to support 

and build on sustainability efforts being undertaken on a 

global scale, we have now identified and are contributing 

towards five of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

set by the United Nations (see page 7). The SDGs have been 

adopted by countries all around the world as part of a new 

sustainable development agenda to end poverty, protect the 

planet and ensure prosperity for all. Each goal has specific 

targets to be achieved over the next 15 years.

From now on, these five SDGs will be incorporated in our 

approach to sustainability. We will frame and measure our 

progress against each goal and its underlying targets where 

applicable. While specific reference to individual targets will 

not always be made, we will highlight where our actions align 

with or contribute to the five identified SDGs on a broader 

level throughout this report.

NDPE POLICY IMPLEMENTATION 

PROGRESS AND EXPANSION

We maintain our focus on the impact of our oil palm operations 

and drive compliance with our NDPE Policy at multiple levels. 

For Wilmar’s own operations and our scheme smallholders, 

we pursue continuous improvement by strengthening 

standard operating procedures and participating in relevant 

certification schemes. In our wider supply chain, we use our 

refineries as a central point for engaging, assessing and 

enhancing supplier performance. 

Wilmar International Limited

Sustainability Report 2017

Moving Forward Together

25


The aim of our NDPE Policy has always been to achieve 

genuine transformation in the palm oil industry towards the 

mitigation of deforestation, peat development and exploitation. 

During the course of our policy implementation process, we 

realised that the scope of the challenges extends beyond 

the palm oil industry: they need to be addressed holistically 

through the collaborative effort of governments, civil society 

organisations, smallholders, suppliers and industry players. 

We therefore invest significant resources to support multi-

stakeholder partnerships and jurisdictional and landscape 

approaches as part of our sustainability strategies. 

Our sustainability programme, including our NDPE Policy, 

was initially developed with palm oil in mind. Not only does 

palm oil constitute a much bigger proportion of Wilmar’s 

business compared to sugar, it also presents a higher risk 

profile. Nevertheless, our approach to sustainability in our 

sugar operations will follow the successful precedent set 

with palm oil: first ensuring that the best management 

practices adopted at our own mills are workable, and only 

then partnering with grower organisations to encourage 

change in practices.

To reflect the increased focus on our sugar operations, and to 

ensure that our NDPE Policy remains relevant to the current 

stakeholder landscape and latest scientific consensus, we 

will be refreshing our NDPE Policy in 2018. Although our 

existing NDPE Policy already extends to our sugar operations, 

this refresh will include a specific section that outlines and 

clarifies this applicability.

SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and 

Production

SDG 12 is concerned with the promotion of sustainable 

consumption and production patterns. It is therefore one 

of the most relevant sustainable development goals for our 

business and broader sustainability efforts. As a leading 

agribusiness group, most of the targets set under SDG 12 

are applicable to our business in some form. However, the 

key relevant targets relate to:

 

•	

Achieving	sustainable	management	and	efficient	use	

of natural resources.

•	

Achieving	environmentally	sound	management	of	

chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle 

in accordance with agreed international frameworks, 

and to significantly reduce their release to air, water 

and soil in order to minimise adverse impacts on 

human health and the environment.

•	

Encouraging	companies,	especially	large	and	

transnational companies, to adopt sustainable 

practices and to integrate sustainability information 

into their reporting cycle.

•	

Promoting	public	procurement	practices	that	are	

sustainable, in accordance with national policies and 

priorities.

•	

Supporting	developing	countries	to	strengthen	

their scientific and technological capacities to move 

towards more sustainable patterns of consumption 

and production.

As our NDPE framework and overarching strategies greatly 

overlap with these topics, many of our existing activities – 

and much of what we currently report – already demonstrate 

our progress towards achieving this goal.

United Nations Development Programme

The SDGs provide a comprehensive framework for 

economic, environmental, and social goals for countries 

to achieve. Businesses are increasingly expected to 

contribute toward these goals through their core business 

practices. Over the past several years, we are witnessing 

a shift, where businesses have become more sensitive 

to environmental and human rights issues. The business 

case for SDGs has been highlighted in several flagship 

reports, both by the development community and the 

private sector.

Having said that, there is still a need to develop clear 

benchmarks and metrics to further cement the business 

case. Some companies are developing a textual analytics 

framework to use data and metrics that can advance 

the business case for the SDGs. This framework would 

help a company transform their SDG practices from 

their corporate social responsibility and public relations 

departments into an instrumental aspect of their business 

practices. However, the impediment to getting businesses 

on board with meaningful action on sustainability has 

been that it requires a shift in focus from short-term 

goals like quarterly shareholder returns to longer-term 

corporate responsibility objectives. This shift often 

presents trade-offs as well.

As an agribusiness company, Wilmar is primarily reporting 

on SDGs linked to Land Use and Biodiversity, and Human 

Rights (at plantations and in the supply chain). Going 

beyond compliance will be key in ensuring a net positive 

contribution toward the relevant SDGs.

Sustainability Management 

and Governance Structure

Wilmar’s Chairman and CEO is responsible for the oversight 

of our NDPE Policy while being supported by the Risk 

Management Committee for management of sustainability 

risks. The implementation of Wilmar's sustainability 

strategies (including the NDPE Policy, the principles of the 

United Nations Global Compact, certifications, stakeholder 

engagement, corporate governance and reporting) is 

delegated to the Sustainability Department. This department 

is staffed by more than 60 employees globally, combining a 

wide range of relevant local and technical expertise across 

Malaysia, Indonesia, Europe, Africa and Singapore. Wilmar’s 

Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) spearheads the overall 

strategy of the Group’s global sustainability agenda. The 

Group Sustainability General Manager is responsible for 

the implementation of these policies and strategies in our 

supply chain, as well as reviewing the progress of execution.

To support NDPE Policy implementation, Wilmar also has 

operations teams working on site and at regional levels, 

a communications team, and a Technical Advisory Group 

comprising NGOs and sustainability partners that advise on 

specific issues where broader perspectives are needed. These 

teams provide input to the Joint Steering Committee (JSC) 

to deliberate and decide on the more complex NDPE Policy 

implementation matters. The JSC handles major strategic 

issues related to the execution of the NDPE Policy. It also 

evaluates our progress against NDPE Policy targets. For 

suppliers who fail to comply with Wilmar’s NDPE Policy, a 

Suspension Committee has been appointed to review the 

trading relationship. Additionally, we have established teams 

in Malaysia and Indonesia to provide support to suppliers 

to ensure compliance with our NDPE Policy.

In addition to this formal structure, we are also engaged in 

strategic agreements with various implementation partners 

like The Forest Trust (TFT), Proforest and Daemeter of the 

Consortium of Resource Experts (CORE), as well as Verité 

Southeast Asia in 2017, to support our ongoing NDPE Policy 

implementation and supply chain compliance work.

At the level of operational management, Wilmar’s Technical 

Managers have been assessed against the Environment, 

Health &amp; Safety (EHS) performance of the operations under 

their charge, and EHS assessments have been incorporated 

into their performance appraisals. In addition, a factory-level 

key performance indicator (KPI) scorecard for EHS will be 

introduced for factory managers. Our Human Resources 

(HR) department is also in the process of reviewing how a 

broader range of staff could have sustainability metrics built 

into their performance appraisals.

NB: The governance structure also covers sugar operations, with the exception of involvement 

by The Forest Trust and the Suspension Committee.

ROUNDTABLE ON SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL 

(RSPO)

As at year-end 2017, we have achieved RSPO certification for 

28 mills and about 80% of our planted area across Malaysia, 

Indonesia and Ghana#. In total, we produced about 880,000 

tonnes of certified sustainable crude palm oil and 190,000 

tonnes of certified sustainable palm kernel in 2017. On the 

plasma smallholder front, production of certified sustainable 

palm oil and palm kernels in 2017 was 23,752 tonnes and 

5,701 tonnes respectively.

Around 5% of all palm oil products handled, traded and 

processed by Wilmar globally is RSPO certified. For midstream 

and downstream operations, 56 sites are now certified 

against the RSPO Supply Chain Certification Standard. These 

sites are capable of delivering palm oil products under the 

Segregated and Mass Balance supply chain models.

Timebound plan for outstanding mill 

certifications

We are making some headway on our target to achieve 

RSPO certification for all of our mills and their supply 

bases. In 2017, we achieved certification for two additional 

mills, both in Kalimantan, Indonesia. We had targeted to 

complete all mill certifications by year-end 2018. However, 

four mills are still in the process of finalising their operations 

permits (HGU – Hak Guna Usaha) and are unlikely to achieve 

certification by year-end. Likewise, a small area in Jambi is 

undergoing preparations for certification and may not meet 

the 2018 target.

NATIONAL PALM OIL CERTIFICATION 

SCHEMES

The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification 

system is implemented by Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture 

and is a national requirement for companies since 2011. At 

year-end 2017, eight of our mills and their supply bases had 

been certified against the ISPO standard#. Our smallholder 

development team in Indonesia has also embarked on a 

programme to support ISPO compliance among smallholders 

(See page 80).

We began implementing the Malaysian Sustainable Palm 

Oil (MSPO) certification programme in our East Malaysia 

operations in 2016. As at 31 December 2017, two mills and 

their supply bases have been certified, and the remaining 

are scheduled for completion in 2018#. We are also working 

with suppliers to ensure that they are ready to achieve MSPO 

certification when this becomes a legal requirement.

INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY AND 

CARBON CERTIFICATION (ISCC)

 

Wilmar is a member of the ISCC Association, which seeks 

to establish an international, practical and transparent 

system for the certification of biomass and bioenergy. The 

certification is oriented towards the reduction of GHG 

emissions, sustainable use of land, protection of natural 

biospheres and social sustainability.

As at year-end 2017, we have 35 sites across the biodiesel 

supply chain certified against the ISCC standard.

BONSUCRO

Formerly known as the Better Sugarcane Initiative (BSI), 

Bonsucro is a global standard intended to create lasting 

value for people, communities, businesses, economies and 

ecosystems in all cane-growing areas. Established in 2008 

as a private sustainability certification scheme by sugarcane 

industry stakeholders, today Bonsucro is a global multi-

stakeholder not-for-profit initiative dedicated to reducing the 

environmental and social impacts of sugarcane production 

while recognising the need for economic viability.

Sustainability Report 2017


The Bonsucro Production Standard applies worldwide to 

any sugarcane mill (and its supplying area) that wishes to 

sell Bonsucro certified sugarcane-derived products and 

make related claims. The Standard evaluates the outcome 

of practices implemented at mill and farm levels, and audits 

are based on assessments of the mill and cane supply area.

The Bonsucro Production Standard uses six principles to 

achieve sustainability in the production of sugarcane and 

the products derived from it:

1. Obey the law

2. Respect human rights and labour standards

3. Manage efficiency to improve sustainability

4.	 Manage	biodiversity	and	ecosystem

5. Continuously improve

6. Adhere to EU directives

The Bonsucro Chain of Custody Standard is concerned with 

the traceability of a product and adheres to five fundamental 

principles to ensure high performance and consistency. As 

such, all companies beyond mill level handling certified 

products for the purpose of making a final sustainability 

claim must be certified to the Chain of Custody Standard 

(e.g. traders, refineries, supermarkets).

As	of	2017,	54%	of	our	sugarcane	plantation	area	and	one	

raw sugar mill in Australia are certified against the Bonsucro 

Production Standard and Bonsucro Chain of Custody Standard#. 

Another two mills and their supply bases in Australia had 

completed the certification audit at year-end 2017 and have 

been certified in early 2018. Further downstream, we have 

also obtained the Bonsucro Chain of Custody certification 

for all sugar refineries and warehouse operations in Australia 

and New Zealand, as well as for the Jawamanis sugar refinery 

in Indonesia and the sugar trading office in Singapore.

As a financial one-off incentive, we offer a rate of 10 cents 

(AUD) per tonne of cane to growers who are certified to 

the Bonsucro process.

SMARTCANE BMP

Smartcane BMP is a world-class best practice system for 

sugarcane growing in Australia. The standard has been 

developed by industry researchers and sugarcane farmers 

based on productivity, profitability and sustainability. 

Smartcane BMP consists of seven modules covering key 

aspects of sugarcane cultivation.

Our sugarcane farming operations have been working 

progressively to achieve Smartcane BMP accreditation. As 

at end 2017, over 80% of our sugarcane operations are 

accredited for the three core modules.

To encourage early Smartcane BMP uptake by our suppliers, 

we offer growers a one-off financial incentive of 15 cents 

(AUD) per tonne of cane when they obtain Smartcane BMP 

accreditation for all core modules.

Supply Chain and Traceability

We recognise that a large part of our footprint lies beyond 

our own operations. Our suppliers therefore have a critical 

role to play in forging a path towards sustainable palm oil 

production.

We trace supply flows from ports and refineries back to 

palm oil sources to map our supply base, evaluate suppliers’ 

performance against our NDPE Policy, and engage with our 

suppliers to make improvements where needed. We believe 

that this is an integral part of providing greater transparency 

in the supply chain, including supplier locations and the 

practices being used on the ground.

TRACEABILITY STATUS IN 2017

Traceability analyses and summary data continued to be 

collected across Wilmar’s global operations throughout the 

year. As at 31 December 2017, we have achieved around 

97.2% and 99.6% traceability to mills for our operations in 

Indonesia and Malaysia respectively#.

In	Indonesia,	about	8.54	million	tonnes	of	crude	palm	oil	

(CPO) and 1.16 million tonnes of palm kernel oil (PKO) 

processed by our refineries were traceable at least to mills. 

About 5.68 million tonnes of CPO and 0.53 million tonnes 

of PKO from our Malaysian refineries were also traceable 

at least to mills#.

The original goal we set in 2013 was for all palm oil physically 

handled by Wilmar refineries to be traceable to the mill where 

it was processed. However, achieving full traceability has not 

been possible due to the ongoing challenges of commodity 

transportation and trading. In palm oil procurement and 

trading, the supply network to refineries is not limited to 

direct purchase of CPO and/or palm kernels (PK) from mills. 

Refineries may also procure bulk and/or redistributed oil 

from third-party refiners or traders, in which case the details 

of the originating mill may be unavailable.

Among Wilmar’s third-party suppliers, there is still a low 

level of willingness from many refiners to share information 

on their supplying mills, despite general support on the 

notion of traceability. Anti-competition regulations are often 

cited, and this can be an issue. We believe that this position 

is slowly changing, and we are diligently working with our 

suppliers to obtain information where possible.

We have been requesting for traceability information from our 

third-party suppliers on a quarterly basis which we consider 

as a self-declaration document. Wilmar's Sustainability team 

continually monitors the lists obtained from suppliers to 

ensure there is no breach in relation to our NDPE Policy.

 

DEFINING AND CALCULATING 

TRACEABILITY: WILMAR’S APPROACH

We focus on traceability in terms of the quantity of oil from 

traceable sources, by identifying the parent company name, 

mill name, address and global positioning system (GPS) co-

ordinates of mills supplying CPO and PK to our downstream 

facilities. In addition, certification status of the mill is also 

recorded, where possible. 

We have so far identified over 800 mills supplying each 

of our refineries in Indonesia and Malaysia. Each refinery 

typically has 50–100 mills in its supply network, although 

not all mills supply products in every quarter.

Wilmar International Limited

Sustainability Report 2017


Our annual traceability values are calculated on volumes 

supplied during the previous four quarters on a rolling basis 

for origin and destination refineries. As mill lists are updated 

on a quarterly basis, and each update covers four calendar 

quarters, it can therefore take up to four rolling quarters for 

changes at mill-level to be reflected on the mill list.

The traceability data for refineries at origin (Malaysia and 

Indonesia) is calculated using volumes received from individual 

mills, Wilmar-owned and third-party refinery transfers, 

traders and bulking installations. The traceability data for 

the refineries at destination (all other countries), also known 

as "second refiners", is calculated from shipment volumes 

received at the respective destinations.

FOCUS ON TRACEABILITY TO MILL

We focus on traceability to mill because the mill is a good 

indicator of the approximate location of its suppliers. Pursuing 

traceability further upstream is extremely difficult due to the 

multi-tiered nature of the supply chain. A typical palm oil 

mill may be supplied by hundreds of growers, and also by 

dealers that source from many more. Refineries are in turn 

likely to be supplied by thousands of FFB suppliers as they 

source from multiple mills. Mills that do not have integrated 

plantations (typical in Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia) 

must also contend with a constantly changing supplier 

base as farmers move from mill to mill for various reasons, 

which is often associated with commercial incentives. This 

revolving supply situation is further intensified where there 

is an increase of milling capacity in a given area (e.g. with 

the addition or upgrading of palm oil mills) resulting in a 

sudden boost in demand for FFB.

Obtaining traceability to farm or plantation level is therefore 

resource intensive while offering little return, as traceability 

information, by itself, does not address environmental and 

social issues. We believe resources are more effectively utilised 

in supporting the transformation of mills and their supply 

bases towards responsible practices through initiatives such 

as the Aggregator Refinery Transformation (ART) programme. 

Such initiatives take into account the fact that issues linked 

to sustainability (or NDPE compliance) will be similar within 

a mill’s supply base (i.e. within a radius of approximately 50 

km), such as extensive peat areas, proximity to national parks 

and populations of endangered species, and can address 

these issues as part of mill assessments.

Traceability to plantation primarily serves the purpose of 

delivering 100% segregated sustainable supply – which 

can also mean the exclusion of vulnerable producers, such 

as smallholders. We believe it makes more sense to invest 

resources to raise the floor for sustainability and good practice 

for all suppliers within a mill's supply base. Nevertheless, we 

have completed maps of all our own mills in Malaysia and 

Indonesia, showing all estate boundaries and the location 

of each smallholder and dealer.

sustainability/progress/traceability/.

TRACEABILITY FOR SUGAR OPERATIONS

About 80% of Wilmar’s raw sugar is sourced from third-

party suppliers. Our NDPE Policy extends across our entire 

operations, including sugar. We will be updating the Policy 

to include a specific section that outlines and clarifies the 

NDPE Policy's applicability to our sugar operations, which 

will be implemented across our entire supply chain, including 

joint-ventures and third-party suppliers.

Traceability has become an increasingly high profile issue 

as forced labour issues have emerged in several major 

commodity markets. In August 2017, KnowTheChain (a 

resource developed by Humanity United, the Business &amp; 

Human Rights Resource Centre, Sustainalytics, and Verité) 

published a case study examining how 10 food and beverage 

companies are addressing forced labour in their sugarcane 

supply chains. The study came on the heels of their 2016 

food and beverage benchmark, which revealed a lack of 

transparency and action on forced labour across commodity 

supply chains in general.

In their 2017 findings, KnowTheChain reported that Wilmar 

has disclosed the names and addresses of its owned mills, 

and is also the only company to have disclosed the names 

and addresses of its sugar suppliers.

STAKEHOLDER COMMENTARY BY PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE (P&amp;G)

Wilmar supplies P&amp;G with palm oil and palm oil derivatives, 

and we value their collaboration and transparency as we 

work to ensure our palm products are sourced responsibly. 

P&amp;G particularly values the supply chain transparency 

that Wilmar provides specifically in the traceability data 

and the actions that they are undertaking to tackle the 

challenges in their plantation operations. We appreciate 

their investment in their third-party supplier engagement 

programme and also value the deep dive that Verité 

is providing in creating change in Wilmar’s internal 

management system.

Going forward, P&amp;G would like to see Wilmar take a 

continued leadership role in tackling the human and labour 

rights issues in the industry and increasing awareness 

and best practices in working wages, gender equality 

and third-party supply chain verification.

Wilmar has been taking actions to ensure it is operating 

responsibly, and P&amp;G wants to continue to see advances 

in palm sustainability and how their action plans will 

become reality in the next 12 months.

SDG 17 - PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS

The drivers of deforestation are complex and require collective 

action by the different actors at different levels of society 

to effect real and enduring change. Wilmar therefore works 

actively to contribute to partnerships to achieve transformation 

at the landscape level.

Our position and activities on this front align with SDG 17, 

which relates to the revitalisation of global partnerships for 

sustainable development. SDG 17 is based on the rationale 

that successful and sustainable global development requires 

inclusive partnerships between different stakeholders at 

international, regional, national and local levels. These 

partnerships should include governments, the private sector 

and civil society, and should be built upon shared principles 

and values, a common vision, and aligned goals that place 

people and the planet at the forefront. 

We continue to play an increasingly active role in certification 

and assessment organisations, including the RSPO and the HCS 

Approach Steering Group, where we are involved in numerous 

working groups and governance bodies. In 2017, Wilmar 

took the role of Co-Chair within the Executive Committee 

of the HCS Approach Steering Group. We have also joined 

the RSPO’s Board of Governors and are participating as a 

member of the RSPO’s Principle &amp; Criteria Taskforce during 

this critical period of the standard’s review. Wilmar actively 

participates in a variety of other multi-stakeholder platforms 

that support the production of sustainable commodities 

and eliminate deforestation from commodity supply chains.

We are expanding our support for communities all along 

our sugar and palm oil supply chains. Training programmes 

have been conducted in Myanmar for smallholder farmers 

who supply our joint venture, the Great Wall-Wilmar Sugar 

Mill. We also piloted a training programme in 2017 to help 

smallholders in Riau achieve ISPO certification (see page 80 

for more information). 

Transparency 

For broader audiences, including our financial stakeholders, 

we produce annual reports, quarterly updates and an annual 

Sustainability Report. We also organise regular market 

update sessions that cover key sustainability topics relating 

to our business. In previous years, we had only conducted 

single session briefings to all our stakeholders. Last year, we 

decided on a different approach and had a few meetings 

with different stakeholders. This enabled us to provide 

more in-depth quality of discussions with each stakeholder.

We have maintained an online Sustainability Dashboard 

on the Wilmar corporate website since 2015. To ensure 

we are responsive to stakeholder concerns, the Dashboard 

carries updates on grievances, traceability, certification, 

policies and statements on issues raised by stakeholders 

or in the media. The Dashboard can be accessed at www.

wilmar-international.com/sustainability/. The Dashboard is 

in the process of being refreshed to provide a better user 

experience. The new Dashboard will be available by Q3 2018.

Looking forward, our sustainability reports now comply with 

the requirements set out by the Singapore Stock Exchange 

(SGX). Effective as of 2018, all publicly listed companies 

are required to prepare an annual sustainability report that 

describes their practices with reference to a set of primary 

components on a “comply or explain” basis. Having aligned 

with the SGX rules and guidelines, we will publish reports 

annually in May on both the SGX and Wilmar websites. 

Wilmar submits an Annual Communication of Progress 

(ACOP) to the RSPO. We also provide disclosures in 

support of various benchmarking and ranking initiatives, 

including the Forest, Climate Change, Water and Supply 

Chain programmes coordinated by CDP (formerly the 

Carbon Disclosure Project). Our most notable efforts to 

improve transparency in our sugar operations have been 

the KnowTheChain disclosures (see page 33). 

Our efforts to increase transparency and accountability 

continue to be recognised, in particular by the Zoological 

Society of London's (ZSL) Sustainable Palm Oil Transparency 

Initiative (SPOTT) and the Forest Heroes’ Green Cats Index 

Rankings for Palm Oil and Soy Companies on Forest Policies 

and Transparency. According to SPOTT, our Group score 

has	improved	from	57%	in	2014	to	84.5%	at	year-end	2017,	

which placed Wilmar as the top scorer among our peers in 

Indonesia and Malaysia. SPOTT ranks palm oil companies 

based on a number of indicators relating to policy, scope, 

certification progress, improvement targets and transparency. 

In the Green Cats Index Ranking for palm oil companies, we 

achieved	a	score	of	74.5	placing	us	third	highest	among	21	

companies. Being the only company that was transparent with 

the names/addresses of our sugar suppliers, KnowTheChain 

reported Wilmar's disclosure as a good practice example 

for sugar supply chain transparency.



Linking finance and sustainability

In a first for the palm oil industry, we announced 

on 27th November 2017 our collaboration with 

ING Bank on a banking programme that pegs the 

interest rate on the financing of existing facilities 

to our sustainability performance. We believe that 

incorporating sustainability metrics into various 

aspects of our business, from daily operations to 

corporate financing, is key to creating value for our 

stakeholders

ART is a programme built to strengthen every actor in 

the supply chain to promote transformation, providing a 

collaborative framework for refiners, millers and growers 

with an opportunity to work closely to overcome challenges 

faced on the ground. Through ART, our refineries provide a 

central point for growers and millers to progress on HCV; HCS 

and peat protection; environmental impact management; 

labour standards; Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC); 

and traceability.

Typically, 50 to 200 mills supply one refinery and it is impossible 

to carry out assessments at every mill. With over 20 palm 

refineries in Indonesia and Malaysia, and many hundreds 

of mills in our supply shed¹, we have adopted a risk-based 

approach to due diligence. Focus is first placed on identifying 

and creating transformation in areas with commercial 

importance, as well as higher risk in terms of environmental 

and social impact, before progressing to medium and low 

risk areas. Based on these initial criteria, we have chosen 

nine key refineries covering six key landscapes in Malaysia 

and Indonesia#. In addition, we are also implementing parts 

of the programme with selected suppliers in Latin America 

and West Africa.

At year-end 2017, we have conducted 69 assessments in these 

areas*. These assessments are compiled into anonymised 

overarching reports by landscape, and each report summarises 

representative issues that may be prevalent in that landscape. 

Through Broad-Level Engagement (BLE) workshops, we 

socialise the common issues to all suppliers operating in 

that region and share learnings and recommendations on 

improvement.

Topics include findings from mill assessments, guidance on 

land-use planning, and respecting the rights of workers and 

indigenous and local communities.

Mills supplying to our refineries, as well as their respective FFB sources are commonly referred to as a ‘supply shed’.

MILL MAPPING AND TRACEABILITY

ART is dependent on mapping all the mills supplying 

the refinery, as well as their FFB sources where possible. 

Currently, the ART programme only focuses on Wilmar's own 

refineries and all direct mills supplying our refineries. This 

programme is being implemented across key landscapes at 

origin, encompassing three Wilmar refineries in Sabah, two 

refineries in Riau, and one in Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, 

North Sumatra and East Java respectively#.

For a mill to be considered traceable, we need to be able 

to record all critical information, including parent company 

name, mill name, address, GPS coordinates, and volumes 

supplied to Wilmar refineries#. A minority of mills are 

categorised as untraceable. Untraceable does not imply we 

do not know who we buy from; it means the supplier does 

not fully meet our traceability criteria, for example where full 

data is not available (e.g. parent company/group affiliation 

or GPS coordinates).

MILL PRIORITISATION PROCESS (MPP)

The ART programme does not seek to equally engage all 

mills in the supply shed simultaneously. Instead it adopts 

a Mill Prioritisation Process using spatial and non-spatial 

information to prioritise and target higher risk mills in a vast 

supply shed for deep engagement#.

Spatial data is captured using GIS data overlaid with information 

from Global Forest Watch and Forest Monitoring for Action 

(FORMA) alerts and include:

Dataset

Details

Legally protected areas

Includes all national and 

international protected areas 

such as national parks, forest 

reserves, protected wetlands, 

etc. 

Key biodiversity areas

Includes sites identified as a 

conservation priority for a variety 

of species based on quantitative 

criteria pulled from global data 

sets

Peat

Peat soil areas as documented 

by an international body

Non-spatial factors focus on the known sustainability policy 

and performance of the mills, and include:

No Deforestation, No Peat, No 

Exploitation (NDPE) policy

Companies that have their 

own NDPE Policy and 

implementation plan

RSPO certification

While certification is not on its 

own enough, it does provide 

some indication for better 

practices in a number of areas

Volumes

A mill that is identified as higher 

priority from the spatial and non-

spatial process and provides a 

significant volume to the refinery 

is considered a mill of highest 

priority

Publicly reported information

Review of international NGO 

campaign reports, local NGO 

reports in local languages, and

TFT’s assessment register

If a mill has previously been 

assessed by TFT, and the 

assessment team is confident 

that the mill and FFB sources are 

acting on the action plan from 

the assessment, then the mill is 

considered lower priority

Based on the above factors, supplying mills are ranked 

and 10% of the high priority mills for each refinery will be 

selected for further engagement. More details on the MPP

DEEP ENGAGEMENT AND MILL VISITS

Following the mill prioritisation process, field visits are 

undertaken and practices are assessed against Wilmar’s 

NDPE Policy requirements. Importantly, these field visits 

are not driven by a certification agenda or an audit, rather 

the visits seek to build trust and engagement for mills by 

providing practical recommendations for the mill and their FFB 

suppliers to improve practices. The site visits are supported 

by Wilmar’s consultants together with our internal teams.

 An initial discussion at headquarter level with key management 

is followed up by an assessment, which includes samples 

of the mill’s third-party FFB suppliers such as commercial 

plantations, smallholders, as well as fruit collection centres. A 

typical visit will take three to five days, and prior to finalising 

the assessment report, the assessment team will meet with 

the mill to discuss findings. At year-end 2017, Wilmar had 

completed a total of 69 visits, including two in Africa and 

five in Latin America*.

Following these three steps, an overarching report is 

developed, summarising issues and recommendations without 

identifying particular mills or growers. This report serves as 

a medium to provide important information about trends of 

issues that require attention across the region/landscape#. 

BROAD LEVEL ENGAGEMENT AND 

SHARING OF FINDINGS

Wilmar wants to reach out as broadly as possible to ensure 

that our entire supply chain is included in the ART process 

and can find support for ongoing improvement. This is done 

through broad-level engagement workshops and training 

which all the suppliers of a particular refinery are invited 

to attend#. 

Workshops share the work that has been done in that 

landscape and provide an overview of what common issues 

were found, as well as recommendations for addressing the 

issues. The workshops seek to build capacity and create a 

forum where common issues can be addressed. 

The workshop is also complemented by a series of training 

sessions open to all our suppliers, as well as to their FFB 

suppliers#. Key stakeholders, including industry experts, 

government agencies and our customers have actively 

participated in the workshop and training sessions to directly 

engage with our suppliers.

Training sessions are issue-specific and include conservation, 

labour rights, environmental impact management and 

health and safety. Training is conducted in the form of panel 

discussions, classroom lectures and interactive discussions. 

Sessions also provide space for the discussion of issues and 

examples of best practice, and serve as a forum for dialogue 

with government representatives, such as those from the 

labour and environment departments#. Two training sessions 

were conducted in Malaysia in 2016 that were attended 

by 50 participants. Six training sessions were conducted 

in Indonesia in 2017 for close to 200 participants from the 

palm milling and plantation industry. The workshops and 

training sessions are documented in public reports, and are 

available on Wilmar’s website.

As part of our progress towards covering a larger part of 

our supply shed, in 2017 Wilmar began a process to also 

cover additional medium and low risk mills, beyond those 

identified as the 10% high priority mills. Known as the 

Supplier Reporting Tool (SRT), the tool is designed to aid 

and align supplier operations along NDPE commitments of 

producers and consumers. The outcome of the questionnaire 

may result in a visit to specific suppliers#.

ONGOING MONITORING PROGRAMME 

AND VERIFICATION

Through the mill assessment, Wilmar has developed a 

timebound action plan together with the mills and we 

follow up on progress through repeat visits and/or ongoing 

contact. As part of this follow-up, Wilmar also seeks to 

provide assistance where the suppliers are finding barriers 

to progress#. As of end 2017, we have conducted nine 

follow-up visits in Malaysia and six in Indonesia respectively.

NEXT STEPS AND FUTURE PRIORITIES FOR 

ART

It is a key priority for Wilmar that the wider market is engaged 

in the mapping, assessment and monitoring of the palm oil 

supply chain. We have been encouraged by the significant 

support we have received from our customers, who have 

assisted in funding assessments, and taken an active interest 

and role in our mill engagements. It is critical to the message 

that the market is behind the transformation, and that the 

requirements in the NDPE Policy are not Wilmar-specific.

In addition, we are pleased to see that some of our peers 

in the industry are developing programmes parallel to ART, 

and are starting to publish information on their assessments 

and findings publicly. Together, we can reach much wider 

parts of the supply chains and stretch our resources further, 

and at the same time avoid the onset of assessment fatigue 

among mills, which is likely to occur if separate refineries 

require assessments of the same mills.

SUPPORT FOR TRANSFORMATION OF 

LABOUR PRACTICES AT PT ABDI BUDI 

MULIA

In December 2016, Amnesty International published a 

report highlighting labour rights violations in Indonesia’s 

palm oil industry relating to child labour, minimum 

wage, health and safety, gender discrimination and 

high production targets. One of the companies 

named in the report, PT Abdi Budi Mulia (ABM), is 

a Wilmar supplier.

After the release of the report, our implementation 

partner TFT undertook an assessment visit in December 

2016 to assess labour practices at PT ABM.

This initial engagement with PT ABM led to a longer-

term project to support PT ABM in improving their 

practices, referred to as the Support For Transformation 

(SFT) project.

The SFT project involved a six to 12-month process of 

on-site engagement to ensure a mutual understanding 

of the project objectives and establish ownership of 

the process. By working intensively with the company 

on-site, TFT aims to facilitate solutions to their labour 

practice challenges through an understanding of the 

specific conditions.

With support from RB (Reckitt Benckiser Group 

PLC), a TFT brand member, the project was formally 

launched in April 2017 at a pre-engagement meeting 

with TFT, PT ABM and Wilmar. TFT and Wilmar visited 

PT ABM on three separate occasions in 2017 to 

undertake workers’ consultations, build the capacity 

of management to improve practices, and verify 

changes on the ground. PT ABM worked to improve 

its practices through the creation of appropriate 

policies and implementation of agreed action plans.

These steps taken are positive developments on the 

longer journey of transformation that PT ABM has 

committed to implement. Through further support 

to PT ABM, Wilmar can ensure that these promising 

initial efforts towards transformation will be carried 

forward. Wilmar and TFT will continue to support PT 

ABM in a technical and advisory capacity through 

2018 to this end.

TFT has provided an update on our joint work with 

PT ABM which can be accessed at www.tft-earth.

In 2017, Wilmar's Board of Directors approved a revised and 

enhanced ethical policy framework. This expands on our 

ethics commitments through the publication of our Code 

of Ethics, our Anti-Fraud Policy, our Privacy Policy and our 

updated Code of Conduct. The policies address a range of 

ethical concerns, and include the prohibition of giving and 

receiving of any type of bribe. Bribes may be defined as 

gifts, entertainment, or other benefits that may affect our 

employees’ ability to carry out their duties legally and/or 

in line with company interests.

Our Whistleblowing Policy sets out guarantees for confidentiality 

and freedom from reprisals. It also identifies several contact 

points for reporting fraud, corruption and non-compliance with 

legal requirements and company policies. The Policy ensures 

that a process is in place for independent investigations of 

alleged improprieties and for appropriate follow-up actions, 

including providing assurance that the complainant will be 

protected from reprisals for whistleblowing in good faith 

and without malice. The Policy provides assurance that 

any employee who raises a genuine concern and makes a 

disclosure in good faith will not be at risk of losing his or her 

job, nor suffer adverse treatment or harassment for doing 

so. We strictly adhere to the spirit of the Policy, and do 

not penalise employees for raising concerns to ensure that 

Wilmar’s business conduct meets its policies on compliance. 

This includes when they choose to raise the issues through 

third parties. The implementation of the Policy has been 

communicated to employees and the Policy is posted on 

the Group’s website.

Wilmar has an established Grievance Procedure for our 

management and staff to refer to when handling any grievance 

from external parties concerning the implementation of 

Wilmar’s policies. Our operating sites have a standard 

operating procedure (SOP) in place for handling external 

stakeholder’s concerns, and this is directly coordinated by 

the local HR Department. Such grievances raised at a local 

level which are handled directly by local teams are generally 

not registered in the grievance list published on Wilmar’s 

Sustainability Dashboard, unless the complainant submits 

their grievance officially through our Grievance Procedure, 

or the grievance is published by an NGO and is in the 

public domain.

Nevertheless, the complainant is free to submit the 

grievance through our Grievance Procedure. For external 

stakeholders who utilise the Grievance Procedure, we will 

evaluate the case following the decision tree stipulated in 

the SOP. Grievance cases that lack supporting information, 

or are undergoing legal procedure, will not be registered 

or investigated concurrently.

There were 35 grievance cases related to our supply chain 

in 2017, compared to 30 in 2016.

EY has performed limited audit procedures on this figure.

We understand that input from our stakeholders is valuable 

because it helps to enhance transparency in our supply chain. 

The Grievance Procedure is useful in this respect because 

it favours open and inclusive dialogue with stakeholders.

Wilmar has conducted a preliminary feedback round with 

a range of stakeholders on the Grievance Procedure. We 

recognise that the Procedure will need to be further adapted 

as it gets operationalised and that not all feedback provided 

has yet been incorporated. As such it represents a base 

on which we plan to build a stronger Grievance Procedure 

over time.

The Grievance Procedure can be accessed at 

www.wilmar-international.com/sustainability/grievance-

procedure/

PROACTIVE SUPPLY CHAIN MONITORING 

Besides having a grievance mechanism in place, which allows 

us to respond to complaints and issues raised, we also firmly 

believe in taking a proactive approach towards identifying 

and addressing non-compliances that could potentially be 

linked to our supply chain. This proactive monitoring of palm 

oil mills and plantation company groups is undertaken each 

month by an international NGO on the ground. We also have 

access to a direct repository of monitoring maps and data 

that support these efforts. As of 2017, we are monitoring 60 

supplier groups covering just over eight million hectares of 

oil palm plantations. We have initiated engagements with 

companies where issues were identified, and recommended 

the necessary corrective actions or improvements, where 

relevant.

NO DEFORESTATION AND FOREST CONSERVATION

One of our primary focuses for our business over the last four 

years has been to ensure that neither our own operations nor 

those in our supply chain are contributing to deforestation. 

Our NDPE Policy commits us to the use of the HCS Approach 

and the HCV framework as primary tools for identifying areas 

suitable or unsuitable for planting – both for our own palm 

oil operations and our suppliers' operations. 

Since the launch of the HCV Assessor Licencing Scheme in 

2015, we have exclusively appointed licensed HCV assessors 

to undertake HCV assessments. Prior to 2015, we have also 

appointed RSPO-Approved Assessors to undertake HCV 

assessments in our own operations. Following the release of 

the HCV-HCS Assessment Manual in November 2017, which 

requires all HCS Approach assessments to be conducted as 

integrated HCV-HCS Assessments, we will also only appoint 

licensed HCV assessors and HCS registered assessors for 

future joint assessments.

 

For our sugar operations in Australia, we have identified 

and manage 675 hectares of conservation area, covering 

the vegetation classes "Not of Concern", "Of Concern" and 

"Endangered". These are based on criteria provided under 

the Vegetation Management Act 1999 of the Queensland 

Government.

Through HCS and HCV assessments, Wilmar has identified 

29,742	hectares	in	Indonesia,	Malaysia	and	Africa	to	be	set	

aside and managed for conservation within our oil palm 

plantation operations#.

The HCS Approach was launched in 2013 to categorise 

forests and define a better landscape-level methodology 

for	preventing	deforestation.	In	2014,	a	broad	group	of	

stakeholders established the HCS Approach Steering 

Group to strengthen and evolve the methodology, as well 

as to provide a governance body for its use. We have to 

date undertaken one such HCS process in our Nigerian 

operations. The assessment was completed in 2015, and in 

2016 we were among the first oil palm companies to submit 

an assessment to the HCS Approach Peer Review Process. 

This HCS Assessment summary report is available for 

downloading at highcarbonstock.org/registered-hcs-

JURISDICTIONAL APPROACHES TO NO 

DEFORESTATION

Wilmar is part of the Sabah Jurisdictional Approach Steering 

Committee, which works to support the Sabah Government in 

achieving its vision of 100% RSPO-certified sustainable palm 

oil in the state by 2025. The Steering Committee has enlisted 

the support of the HCS Approach Executive Committee in 

funding a pilot project to assist in the development of an 

HCS assessment at the jurisdictional level. This will in turn 

support the jurisdictional certification initiative.

The HCS assessment will seek to provide a revised approach 

that fulfils the HCS decision tree (a tool for identifying and 

prioritising forest areas for conservation or development 

within a landscape), and which can then be applied at the 

state level. The funds will also allow for some involvement 

from the HCV Resource Network (HCVRN) to help guide 

the Sabah jurisdictional process. An important output of this 

process will be a state-level HCV and HCS map that can be 

used to inform sustainable development and conservation 

strategies at a jurisdictional level.

SDG 15 - LIFE ON LAND

SDG 15 is concerned with the sustainable management of 

forests, combating desertification, halting and reversing land 

degradation, and halting biodiversity loss. Forests cover 

approximately 30% of the Earth’s surface and provide food 

security and shelter to a host of important species. These 

species in turn contribute to the survival of ecosystems that 

play a crucial role in the fight against climate change. For 

this reason, there are specific components under SDG 15 

that target the protection of biodiversity and wildlife.

In accordance with these targets, and as part of our 

commitment to our NDPE Policy, we place special emphasis 

on the protection of threatened and endangered species and 

wildlife conservation. We do not operate in internationally or 

nationally designated protected areas. If high conservation 

values are present on our operational sites, we implement 

a number of measures, including:

•	

Formulating	conservation	management	plans	to	

protect endemic and endangered species or habitats.

•	

Avoiding	damage	and	deterioration	of	applicable	

areas.

•	

Protecting	these	areas	from	potential	illegal	or	

inappropriate threats such as poaching.

•	

Enhancing	the	identified	natural	and	biological	values.

Wilmar's conservation areas are managed by a group of 

regional conservation specialists who are overseen by our 

global Conservation Lead. Specialists in Sabah, Sarawak, 

Indonesia and Africa work in partnership with plantation 

managers to ensure that conservation areas are monitored 

and protected, and Conservation Management Plans are 

implemented. We appoint biodiversity and conservation 

managers to develop and implement these plans, which 

serve to maintain and enhance the biodiversity values of

THE CHALLENGES OF PROTECTING 

FOREST AREAS FROM DEVELOPMENT

As of 2017, more than 6 million hectares of forest 

is estimated to have been spared from oil palm 

development in Indonesia1. This is largely attributed 

to the individual NDPE commitments of key 

companies within the sector, alongside government 

policies. However, ensuring that these areas are 

not converted in the future remains a challenge. 

The pressure for further land use change by other 

producers and sectors that have not subscribed to 

global sustainability standards continues to grow. 

Companies with NDPE commitments currently account 

for	only	74%2 of the combined refining capacities of 

Indonesia and Malaysia, which still leaves a leakage 

market of approximately 19 million tonnes annually. 

Stakeholders from the private sector, industries, 

civil society, markets and the public must continue 

working together to close this gap.



protected areas within our oil palm plantations, and we 

partner with local and international research bodies to 

continually improve them. 

To ensure vigilance and responsiveness, we employ a 

combination of strategies which include both manual 

patrolling and technology to monitor our conservation areas. 

The use of technology includes the mobilisation of drones, 

the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) and 

group messaging mobile application for communication 

purposes. But we also believe that education goes a long 

way to conserving biodiversity. As such, we also conduct 

regular awareness briefing to our workers and community 

members to identify and report encroachment and other 

threats to our conservation areas.

Wilmar is one of the few oil palm companies who have 

government-appointed Honorary Wildlife Rangers and Wildlife 

Wardens deployed in both Sabah and Sarawak. Having 

completed our specialised training programme conducted 

by the Wildlife Departments of the respective states, Rangers 

and Wardens are empowered with authority similar to the 

State-appointed Wildlife Rangers and Wardens to stop any 

illegal activity related to wildlife found within our plantation 

boundaries. In late 2017, Wilmar staff from the Sustainability 

and EHS departments received training as Honorary Wildlife 

Wardens in Sabah. All participants were detailed on the 

responsibilities and powers of Honorary Wildlife Wardens as 

set out in the Sabah Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997. 

As of January 2018, a total of 32 new Wildlife Wardens, 

including eight women, have been appointed and 12 of the 

existing Wardens have been reappointed.

river basins it feeds. The Atewa Forest 

Reserve is one of the Guinean Forest's 

biodiversity hotspots, one of Ghana’s 

high biodiversity significant areas, and 

is home to a large diversity of plants 

and animals. The forest also serves as a 

watershed for three main rivers.

Wilmar’s subsidiary Benso Oil Palm 

Plantation is a member of the Atewa Living 

Waters’ private sector working group, 

which facilitated the establishment of a 

conservation plan for the Atewa Forest. 

Following the project's completion 

in March 2017, the working group 

formed BESNet to continue advocating 

the conservation of the Atewa Forest. 

Benso Oil Palm Plantation is currently 

a BESNet member.

BESNet sucessfully collaborated with 

civil society organisations to engage with 

the government to crack down on illegal 

mining activities in the Atewa Range 

Forest Reserve, resulting in a significant 

improvement of surface water quality.

PARTNERS

Provincial Government of Central Kalimantan

and Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation 

(BOSF)

INITIATIVE

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) to advance 

the knowledge and application of sustainable plantation 

practices in Malaysia, Indonesia and the wider tropics 

through a five-year research and training programme.

Both parties commit to support and facilitate research 

by academics from leading universities, including the UK 

universities of York, Oxford, Cambridge, Leeds, Nottingham 

and Aberdeen, and Universiti Malaysia Sabah, with a strong 

focus on biodiversity conservation and the management of 

conservation areas within oil palm plantation landscapes.

Wilmar and SEARRP will work together to develop simplified 

methods for environmental assessment and monitoring. 

By deepening the partnership between a leading palm oil 

processor and one of the foremost research programmes 

in the tropics, Wilmar and SEARRP aim to make a major 

contribution to science that is critical to underpinning 

conservation, sustainability and environmental best practices 

for the palm oil industry.

Since 2011, Wilmar has been working with SEARRP in studying 

our conservation areas, particularly in our plantations in the 

Telupid and Lahad Datu districts in Sabah.

SEARRP’s findings and recommendations for plantation 

management were presented to a workshop of producers, 

consumers, NGOs and academics in June 2015 at the RSPO 

roundtable conference in Europe.

An MOU has been signed for the research partnership to 

be extended for another five years, to initiate more projects 

related to the sustainable management of oil palm plantations 

and their embedded forest patches and riparian reserves.

INITIATIVE

A collaboration to safeguard almost 4,000 

hectares of High Conservation Value areas 

in our PT Mentaya Sawit Mas (MSM) estate 

in Central Kalimantan.

The BOSF partnership was initiated in 2011 to 

ensure that orangutan populations identified in 

Wilmar’s concession could continue to thrive.

In May 2016, the partnership commissioned 

an external evaluation to review the progress 

and outcomes of the conservation programme 

against its initial objectives set five years 

previously. Three independent conservation 

experts conducted the evaluation, all of whom 

have more than 25 years of experience in 

conservation and orangutan-related work 

in the palm oil industry.

Key findings from the external evaluation 

include: (i) that the tripartite partnership has 

succeeded in increasing community awareness 

and understanding on the importance of 

orangutans and conservation; (ii) that there 

is a need for greater coordination among all 

partners in order to resolve outstanding issues 

with local communities; and (iii) that there is 

potential for the programme to contribute 

significantly to the conservation of orangutan 

populations in Central Kalimantan, as the 

HCV area in PT MSM remains connected to 

a larger forest landscape extending beyond 

the concession's borders.

BOSF completed a community participative 

mapping exercise for five of the villages 

adjacent to Wilmar’s PT MSM estate. This 

mapping exercise provided the basis for joint 

agreements between village communities, the 

provincial government, BOSF and Wilmar to 

manage and conserve the 3,979 hectares of 

HCV orangutan habitat in Wilmar’s concessions. 

Best management practices for orangutan 

conservation were also developed for the 

estate and used as a guide for stakeholders.

The tripartite partnership ended in November 

2017.

INITIATIVE

An NGO collaboration on gibbon rehabilitation.

We have extended our partnership with the Kalaweit Foundation, a rehabilitation programme that returns rescued 

siamangs to the wild, for an additional five years. This ensures that we can monitor and sustain the achievements 

made so far.

Six pairs of siamangs were released into the HCV area in a Wilmar plantation in Sumatra in March 2015. Unfortunately, 

the three initial pairs had to be replaced, as they were not able to adapt to their surroundings.

Subsequent replacement pairs were introduced with infants to encourage them to establish their territories and 

protect their young. One pair have successfully established their territory and have reproduced.

Kalaweit Foundation intends to re-introduce another four pairs of siamangs into a different section of the HCV area. 

If successful, this would be the first siamang re-introduction programme in the world.

INITIATIVE

Riparian Rehabilitation Project with the objective to enrich 

and enlarge riparian areas on state and company land, and 

restore habitats for the populations of endangered Proboscis 

Monkeys and Silvered Langurs.

The collaboration with Sabah Forestry Department has to date 

achieved:

- 

The conservation and expansion (from 20 m to 50m) of riparian 

areas along the Segama River.

-	

The	planting	of	more	than	55,000	trees	along	a	47km	stretch	

of riparian area to increase the availability and variety of food 

for proboscis monkeys, and support with natural regeneration 

of trees.

- 

The extension of the partnership to include a new 110 ha 

site, the Sapi-Sapa Payau Riparian Project, where more than 

13,000 trees have been planted since 2015.

Our oil palm concessions are equipped with firefighting 

infrastructure and equipment and have on-site fire brigades. 

We operate a dual fire monitoring system to alert us of fires 

inside and within a 5-km radius of our concessions, and a 

fire prevention and suppression programme to minimise the 

incidence and impact of fires and haze. Personnel in our oil 

palm concessions are trained to be vigilant and to respond 

proficiently if fires occur. All our suppliers are aware that 

any deliberate breach of our No Burn policy will result in an 

immediate termination of business relations.

Wilmar became a founding member of the Fire Free Alliance 

(FFA) in 2016, a voluntary multi-stakeholder platform which 

pursues a broad approach to preventing land and forest 

fires in Indonesia. Under this initiative, we expanded on our 

strict No Burn policy for our palm operations and our use 

of mechanical methods in land development.

The FFA is a platform where members share experiences, 

tools and approaches with regards to addressing the incidence 

of fires in the areas where they operate. Members include 

APRIL, Asian Agri, IDH, IOI Group, Musim Mas, PM Haze, 

Sime Darby and Wilmar. Among the tools that is jointly used 

by all members is a methodology for the production of a 

fire risk map of the operational area with the 5-km radius 

outside of the plantation boundaries.

Central to the FFA is the Fire-Free Village Programme (FFVP), 

a community-based incentive scheme to help reduce the 

incidence of fires. Under this programme, we engage with 

local communities, building capacity and providing fire 

suppression equipment and training to the villages operating 

around our concession area.

A member review undertaken in March 2017 showed that the 

FFA has already expanded fire prevention outreach to 218 

villages in various parts of Indonesia. Of these, 77 villages 

signed up with FFA members for training programmes in 

2016. As a founding member of the FFA, Wilmar has actively 

socialised the FFVP to villages in the vicinity of our estates 

in Indonesia, reaching 96 villages in South Sumatra and 

Central Kalimantan since February 2016. 

Some 1.39 hectares of planted area and 82.88 hectares 

of unplanted area were burnt in 2016. In some cases, FFA 

members have reported reductions in the incidence of fires 

between 50% and 90% from 2015 to 2016. In 2017, the 

number of fire incidents and the affected hectarage within 

our palm operations remained relatively low due to favourable 

weather conditions. We achieved our 2017 goal to halve the 

mean average incidence of fires recorded between 2011 and 

2015 in Indonesian plantations, and reduce fires in buffer 

areas 5-km beyond our plantation boundaries.

Specific Uses Of Fire

in Cane Production

While modern palm oil production does not entail the use 

of fire, there are two different methods of fire use commonly 

employed in sugarcane production. The first involves the use 

of fire in preparing land for replanting. The second involves 

the use of fire during the harvesting phase.

The use of fire in harvesting is common, especially where 

manual harvesting is practiced, as the burning of leaves is 

required to enable a clean cut to the cane. Replacing the use 

of fire in harvesting is primarily done where mechanisation 

has replaced manual harvesting, and where environmental 

conditions and local circumstances permit.

Specific uses of fire in Wilmar’s sugarcane 

operations

In Australia, fire use is still practiced in Wilmar’s own operations, 

but only in the Burdekin district in North Queensland, where 

the terrain and climate require the use of fire in harvest to 

achieve the best environmental outcome. The method used 

is a clean and controlled burning, which involves stressing 

the cane prior to burning by cutting off irrigation for a short 

period. This reduces the water content in the foliage, and 

with drier foliage, burns quickly, which in turn reduces smoke.

The Burdekin area has a very dry climate and a flat landscape 

that requires flood irrigation for production to be possible. 

Coupled with the climatic conditions, the result is that this 

area produces extremely high tonnages of sugarcane. With 

such large harvests, cutting the cane green would result in 

a blanket of cane trash that would be too thick for water 

to move along the furrows. The obstruction of water flow 

could lead to water percolating into the soil, which would 

cause an increase in the water table and subsequently a 

number of production and environmental issues. Burning 

is therefore required to mitigate these impacts.

Prescribed, controlled burning was used in our Myanmar 

operations in previous years during the post-harvesting 

phase of production to reduce the risk of accidental fires. 

In 2017, we have discontinued this practice since the setup 

of an overhead irrigation system, which has created wetter 

conditions and removed this risk of accidental fires.

In 2017, a total of 2,919 hectares was burnt in our sugar 

operations in Australia, as a result of prescribed, controlled 

burning and one accidental fire which was not planned.

WILMAR'S POSITION ON FIRE USE IN SUGAR OPERATIONS

As part of Wilmar’s NDPE Policy refresh and expansion 

of reporting coverage to include our sugar division, we 

recognise that we have an opportunity to clarify further 

under what contexts the use of fire will not be permitted 

within our directly owned cane production operations, 

as well as within the operations of our suppliers. 

In all operations where burning is necessary, Wilmar 

employs the clean and controlled burn method in a 

confined and predetermined area. Wilmar also commits 

to abiding by all applicable local regulations and having 

robust SOPs in place to govern prescribed burning.

In line with our NDPE Policy, we are committed to progressively 

reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by identifying 

significant pollutants and emissions and preparing and 

implementing plans to mitigate or minimise them.

We have continued to map emissions for our palm oil 

operations throughout 2017 using the latest RSPO PalmGHG 

calculator and the GHG Protocol accounting standard. 

The data collected will help us to monitor our progress in 

reducing the carbon footprint of our plantation and industrial 

operations.

With the expansion of the reporting scope to include Wilmar’s 

sugar business, we will be covering GHG emissions data for 

our sugar operations in both Australia and Myanmar moving 

forward. The data will also be collected and calculated in 

accordance with the GHG Protocol accounting standard.

RSPO PALMGHG CALCULATOR

We use the RSPO PalmGHG calculator to measure the GHG 

emissions of our RSPO-certified palm oil mills on a yearly basis, 

in accordance with the requirements of the RSPO standards. 

As there have been substantial changes made across the 

different versions of the calculator, historical data cannot 

be used as a definitive indicator of year-on-year reductions 

and/or increases in carbon dioxide emissions prior to 2016. 

In 2013, we tested the RSPO PalmGHG version 1 calculator. 

Version	2.1.1	was	used	to	calculate	emissions	for	2014	and	

2015. For 2016 and 2017, we have used the latest version, 

PalmGHG 3.0.1. The major changes between versions 2 and 

3 are summarised on the RSPO PalmGHG website.

PALM OIL OPERATIONS: EMISSION 

SOURCES AND SINKS

The most significant source of our emissions in 2017 is 

historical	land	use	change	after	November	2005	(41.7%),	

followed	by	peat	oxidation	(30.4%)	and	palm	oil	mill	effluent	

(13.2%). Although we are unable to undo historical land 

conversions, we remain committed to expansion only in 

low carbon landscapes. This commitment will continue to 

ensure that all future developments have a significantly 

lower carbon footprint.

In 2017, two additional sites from our Indonesian operations 

were added to our RSPO PalmGHG emissions calculations, 

which is why overall PalmGHG net emissions have significantly 

increased since 2016. Without these two additional sites, 

our net emissions would have shown an overall increase of 

8%,	as	opposed	to	an	increase	of	40%.

SUGARCANE OPERATIONS IN AUSTRALIA

For our operations in Australia, we calculate GHG emissions 

as part of our reporting obligations towards the Australian 

Government Clean Energy Regulator, under the National 

Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme (NGER). The 

National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) 

Determination 2008 provides methods, criteria and measurement 

standards for calculating GHG emissions and energy data 

under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 

2007 (NGER Act). It covers scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, 

as well as energy production and consumption. Scope 1 

GHG emissions are emissions released to the atmosphere 

as a direct result of an activity, or series of activities at a 

facility level. Scope 2 GHG emissions are those released 

to the atmosphere from the indirect consumption of an 

energy commodity. For our three Bonsucro certified mills in 

Australia, we also report net GHG emissions data for both 

mills and farms (e.g. per tonne of sugarcane/sugar) as part 

of the certification process.

Wilmar is the largest producer of renewable energy from 

biomass in Australia. Our eight sugar mills are powered 

by renewable steam and electricity generated onsite by 

burning bagasse (a by-product of sugar milling), with a total 

generation capacity of about 199 megawatts. This process is 

called cogeneration. A significant portion of the electricity 

produced is exported into the Queensland power grid, 

thereby reducing the region’s overall GHG emissions. Three 

of our mills - Invicta, Pioneer and Victoria – have upgraded 

cogeneration facilities to increase their export capacities 

and further drive the efficient use of biomass. Surplus 

bagasse produced is stockpiled on specially designed pads 

to ensure a ready source of renewable energy outside the 

crushing season.

Restoring degraded forest areas

GHG PROTOCOL AND CDP REPORTING

Wilmar participated in three of CDP programmes in 2017, 

including annual reporting for the Climate Change module. 

With the support of more than 800 institutional investors, 

CDP encourages corporations and cities to measure and 

disclose their carbon emissions information, which provides 

opportunities for better management of environmental risk.

For the 2018 CDP report, the scope of reporting will cover 

all upstream and downstream palm/sugar processing entities 

where we have a major presence and over 50% shareholding 

and operational control. This includes operations in Indonesia, 

Malaysia, Africa, Myanmar and Australia, and covers various 

processing units in the supply chain. The report will be publicly 

available and discloses Wilmar’s carbon footprint as per the 

reporting scope, in accordance with the standards defined by 

the GHG Protocol. The report also presents our assessment 

of the business risks associated with climate change, as well 

as information on our emission reduction efforts.

AVOIDING PEAT 

Around 8% of our planted area is currently on peat, with 

the vast majority in our older estates in Sumatra. For our 

existing plantations on peat, Wilmar is working with expert 

stakeholders to ensure that best management practices, as 

defined by the RSPO and peat experts, are adopted and 

implemented. These practices include maintaining water 

tables at an appropriate level. 

In line with our NDPE Policy, we are sharing best practices 

with third-party suppliers to ensure that they have access to 

the latest knowledge and insights on responsible peatland 

management. Through our collaboration with Tropical Forest 

Alliance 2020, we are also engaging with other companies 

in the palm oil and pulp and paper sectors to exchange 

knowledge on best practices in peatland conservation 

and restoration. In addition, we are cooperating with the 

Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) and sharing 

information with them that helps progress their peatland 

conservation targets.

 

The latest details on the implementation of our peat 

commitments are provided on the Sustainability Dashboard 

on our website.

METHANE RECOVERY TO MITIGATE GHG 

EMISSIONS 

Wilmar constantly strives to adopt best practices to reduce 

the carbon footprint of our palm oil mill operations. These 

best practices include the building of methane capture and 

power generation facilities to reduce GHG emissions from 

palm oil mill effluent (POME). Methane from POME is one 

of our largest sources of avoidable GHG emissions and has 

therefore been a major strategic focus for our emissions 

reduction efforts in Indonesia and Malaysia. 

As of 2017, we have 22 commissioned and operational 

methane capture-power generation facilities, with another 

three in various stages of construction. These facilities 

capture biogas for either flaring or electricity generation, 

provide alternative sources of electricity for our operations, 

and help to reduce our overall fossil fuel consumption. An 

operational methane capture facility can potentially reduce 

a palm oil mill’s GHG emissions by 90%. 

Based on data collected from 213 of the operational sites 

in Malaysia and Indonesia, in 2017, we have achieved 

a POME GHG emissions reduction of 515,027 tCO2e#. 

Through this initiative, we estimated that we can achieve 

an annual emissions reduction (from methane gas capture 

only, excluding the emissions avoided by not using fossil 

fuels for electricity generation) of about 500,000 tonnes of 

carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) when all 25 sites are in full 

operation. However, based on current progress, we should 

be able to comfortably exceed this estimate.

Clean, accessible water is critical for the well-being of 

communities, wildlife and aquatic ecosystems. This is 

reflected under two of the Sustainable Development Goals, 

SDG	14	on	Life	Under	Water,	and	SDG	6	on	Clean	Water	

and Sanitation. In line with these goals, we continuously 

monitor the impact that our palm oil and sugar operations 

have on waterways. This enables us to safeguard water 

availability and quality, and to drive efforts to mitigate any 

potential negative impacts. We also seek to minimise the 

use of potable water in all our operations.

PALM OIL OPERATIONS

Wastewater from FFB processing at our mills (POME) is either 

applied to land as a fertiliser (land application) or released 

into local rivers (river discharge). When applied to land as 

fertiliser, POME provides moisture, nutrients and organic 

matter to the soil and reduces the need for commercial 

fertilisers. When wastewater is released into local waterways, 

it is treated before discharge. In both cases we comply with 

local environmental limits in order to minimise the risk of 

disturbance to the aquatic environment and the pollution 

of ground water. All of our operations were in compliance 

with all relevant local thresholds in 2017.

SUGARCANE OPERATIONS

One	of	the	targets	under	SDG	14,	Life	Under	Water,	aims	

to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all 

kinds, and in particular from land-based activities, by 2025. 

In Australia, sugarcane is the major agricultural crop grown 

within the vicinity of the Great Barrier Reef's catchments. 

Approximately	4,400	farms	are	spread	out	over	380,000	

hectares. 

Declining water quality and climate change have had a 

devastating impact on the health of the Great Barrier 

Reef, which has lost half of its coral cover since 1985. If this 

trend continues, what coral is left could be halved again by 

2022. Fertilisers have been identified as one of the sources 

of nutrients entering the Reef, with nitrogen being a key 

concern. Nitrogen in fertilisers not taken up by sugar crops 

pose a risk of entering waterways through run off. An increase 

of nitrogen in water run off contributes to the risk of algal 

blooms and in turn, to the population growth of species

that multiply to plague proportions and become harmful for 

the reef. Fine sediments and the pesticides used on coastal 

floodplains could also negatively impact water quality. 

For our raw sugar mills in Australia, surplus water or ‘effluent’ 

may be processed through detention ponds, activated sludge 

plants or treated in constructed wetlands. The treated water 

is then either recycled back to the mill, directed to a joint 

local government and mill facility for further treatment, 

used for irrigation (either for sugarcane or for pastures), or 

discharged to local water courses. In some cases, effluent 

is discharged from the mill to be used directly for irrigation 

for agricultural land.

For mill effluent discharged to local waterways, Wilmar 

complies with local regulatory4 water quality and discharge 

limit requirements. In cases where water surplus is used for 

irrigation, and there are no regulatory discharge requirements, 

we follow good practice guidelines for monitoring water 

quality to ensure it is suitable for irrigation and that there 

is no long-term detriment to the soil.

Water runoff initiatives

Water quality in the Barratta Creek catchment has come under 

scrutiny with the increased government focus on the quality 

of water entering the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Through 

Wilmar Sugar Australia, Wilmar is a founding member of 

the Barratta Creek Action Group (BCAG), a partnership 

between sugarcane farmers, the government and providers 

of research, development and agricultural extension. Since 

2016, the BCAG has been monitoring the water quality of 

four Barratta Creek sub-catchments located in the Burdekin 

region of Queensland. These sub-catchments collect farm 

runoff	from	close	to	4,000	hectares	of	land	predominantly	

cultivated for sugarcane. 

The BCAG captures baseline data about nutrient and pesticide 

loads in runoff water from sugarcane farms and uses this 

data to influence on-farm activities to improve the quality 

of water flowing to the Great Barrier Reef. More specifically, 

the BCAG has worked to identify where in the catchment 

nutrient, herbicide and pesticide loads are originating, as 

well as which products are contributing the highest loads. 

This has led to increased awareness of the potential loss 

pathways of fertilisers and pesticides that producers are 

applying to their farms.

In 2017, the BCAG provided advice to a number of sugarcane 

farmers in Burdekin region and has seen an improvement in 

the quality of water leaving these farms. A large number of 

participant farmers expressed interest in trialling different 

methods and products on their properties, supported by 

water quality monitoring to establish which practices and 

products might be the most effective in reducing losses on 

their farm. In response to this, funding is being sought for a 

follow-up project to enable farmers to undertake agronomist-

endorsed, on-farm trials and comparisons, supported by on-

farm water quality monitoring undertaken by independent 

third parties. This second stage of the project is considered 

critical, as it will enable farmers to establish the connection 

between their farming practices and the amount of water 

lost to the receiving environment.

Outside of the BCAG, Wilmar is also trialling a number 

of approaches and methods as part of our Cane Supply 

Improvement Programme. These include a nitrogen fertiliser 

rate trial in Burdekin, which looks at optimising nitrogen 

fertiliser application while maximising sugarcane crop growth. 

We have also been looking into whether using low rates 

of mill mud and ash could still have a positive impact on 

productivity, while improving runoff water quality compared 

to the broadcast application at higher rates. Mill mud and 

ash are widely recognised as soil ameliorants that improve 

soil water holding capacity and act as a valuable source of 

nutrients. The broadcast application of these products at 

high rates has been seen as a concern in terms of impact 

on runoff water quality.

WATER USAGE

Our mills account for the majority of our water use in our palm 

oil operations, drawing supplies from local waterways and 

wells in order to process FFB. In addition to mill water, we 

also draw some water for nursery irrigation and household 

use. In 2017, the amount of water used by our mills have 

remained in line with normal industry levels, with decreases 

in water use per tonne of FFB processed for mills in Sumatra, 

West Kalimantan, Sarawak and Nigeria.

For our sugar mills in Australia, water is either sourced from 

nearby surface water bodies or artesian bores. For almost 

all cases, government approval is required to access and 

use water from these sources.

Mill effluent discharged to local waterways are subject to regulation by the Queensland State Government.

The Bonsucro standard requires that sugarcane plantations and 

mills monitor net water consumed per unit mass of product, 

which is defined as water used less water returned from mill 

to the environment. For plantations with fully irrigated cane, 

there is an additional requirement towards ensuring irrigated 

water is used efficiently, which relies on a direct measure of 

all waters applied to the fields (including extracted waters, 

recycled waters, diluted vinasse, diluted effluents).

Sugarcane being a water intensive crop, water consumption 

in the production of sugarcane is considered to be a focus 

area within the industry. Although not all of Wilmar’s sugar 

operations have undergone the Bonsucro certification 

process, we have calculated net water consumed per unit 

mass product for our mills and plantations (where this data 

is available), as well as efficient water use for our plantations 

with fully irrigated cane according to Bonsucro’s definition. 

Based on these measurements, in 2017, all of our mills and 

plantations in Australia were within the limits set out in the 

Bonsucro standard.

The use of chemicals to enhance production and manage 

pests and diseases is a key aspect of good agricultural 

practice. On the other hand, ineffective and improper 

application and handling of chemicals can pose significant 

risks to workers and the environment. At Wilmar, we work 

towards optimising the use of pesticides and ensure that 

the appropriate measures are in place to minimise potential 

hazards for workers, communities and ecosystems.

CHEMICALS POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES

We monitor toxicity at all of our palm operations. We also 

undertake strict, detailed risk assessments on a regular basis 

for any substances that put our workers and the environment 

in which we operate at risk, and the use of a number of 

chemicals of concern is restricted. With the exception of 

specific urgent situations, we do not permit the use of class 

1A or 1B pesticides as categorised by the World Health 

Organization (WHO), or those listed under the Stockholm 

or Rotterdam Conventions5.

To minimise our reliance on chemicals, we have adopted 

an integrated pest management system that applies a 

combination of natural and mechanical pest reduction 

strategies, including the introduction of natural predators. 

We also use precision application. Our R&amp;D laboratory in 

Indonesia has identified beneficial microbes that are being 

used to develop environmentally friendly approaches to 

controlling or preventing oil palm diseases. These may also 

reduce our reliance on synthetic fertilisers and improve 

plant growth.

The use of paraquat has been banned in Wilmar’s own oil 

palm operations since 2011; this has been expanded to 

include our joint-ventures and third-party suppliers since 

the launch of our NDPE Policy in 2013.

Paraquat is widely used in the sugarcane industry due to the 

absence of viable alternatives. We currently use paraquat at 

our sugarcane plantations in Myanmar and Australia. The 

use of paraquat is necessary in cane planting because it 

kills weeds while allowing for the regeneration of ratoons 

(cane roots), which can regenerate for three cycles after 

harvesting. Suitable alternatives have not yet been identified 

for sugarcane. For example, the use of glyphosate, a common 

replacement in oil palm production, is not appropriate 

for cane as it kills ratoons. To replace paraquat, a residual 

would need to be used. In our operations in the Burdekin, 

North Queensland, this type of replacement is seen as more 

environmentally damaging than paraquat due to run off into 

the Great Barrier Reef while these chemicals remain active. 

We have banned the application of paraquat via knapsack 

spraying and have taken measures to limit all potential 

exposure. Where paraquat is used in our sugar operations, 

it is applied strictly in a mechanised manner using booms 

by highly trained operators. The booms are equipped with 

legs to ensure precise application and reduce the likelihood 

of spray drift, and air filters for the operator’s cabin to 

minimise risk of contact with the chemical. Boom sprayer 

workers are also required to have appropriate personal 

protective equipment (PPE) and undergo regular and frequent 

medical evaluations to ensure chemical exposure is avoided 

or minimised. Further, the application of all hazardous 

chemicals follows robust risk management, health &amp; safety, 

and environmental protection SOPs.

With the refresh of our NDPE Policy later this year, we 

will be incorporating specific commitments for sugarcane 

operations. These will outline the strict conditions and 

cases under which paraquat use may be permitted. We will 

also work with our suppliers to ensure that the health and 

safety risks associated with paraquat are managed beyond 

Wilmar’s own operations.

Wilmar uses some pesticides in the form of pre-formulated mixtures. In these instances, the final classification that we adopt is based on the 

classification set by the manufacturer for the actual formulation. This is explained on page 7 in the document "The WHO Recommended 

Classification of Pesticides by Hazard and Guidelines for Classification 2009" available here http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/

classification-pesticides/en/

Wilmar International Limited

Sustainability Report 2017


PROTECTING WORKERS

Across all of Wilmar’s operations, workers who handle 

chemicals are required to undergo extensive and ongoing 

training. It is mandatory that they wear PPE on site – including 

protective eyewear, facial masks, gloves and boots – and 

showering is compulsory after each shift. These workers 

are subject to regular check-ups to detect any presence 

of residual chemicals. All chemicals are stored in locked 

facilities to which only authorised personnel have access. 

Containers used for storing chemicals are collected, stored 

and disposed of in accordance with the legal requirements 

for hazardous waste.

MONITORING PESTICIDE USAGE AND 

TOXICITY

Palm oil operations

We monitor pesticide usage, placing specific focus on tracking 

the use of herbicides as these are applied as part of good 

agricultural practice. Fungicides, rodenticides and insecticides 

are used only to contain outbreaks and attacks, and year-

on-year comparisons would not be meaningful. The amount 

of herbicide used is largely determined by planting cycle, 

as new plantings and young crops require greater amounts 

than mature crops. Herbicide usage is also determined by 

local climatic conditions, such as heavy rainfall, as well as 

pest profiles and agricultural and soil conditions.

We also monitor toxicity, which enables us to more accurately 

assess our performance against peers over time, as well as 

ensure that changes to the type or volume of herbicides 

used do not adversely affect our environmental footprint. 

Although only a few oil palm plantation companies disclose 

toxicity levels – making comparison difficult – we believe 

that our current range of 100–700 toxicity units per hectare 

for our palm oil operations is largely in line with industry 

best practice.

Sugar operations

For our sugar operations, we monitor active ingredient 

per hectare as this measurement is a core requirement 

of the Bonsucro Production Standard, as it functions as 

a measure of potential toxic effects on aquatic life. Our 

measurement includes quantities of active ingredients of 

all agro-chemicals applied including pesticides, herbicides, 

insecticides, fungicides, nematicides, and ripeners. Annual 

monitoring of active ingredient per hectare will allow us to 

benchmark our performance year on year and compare our 

agro-chemical use with our peers. In 2017, our chemical usage 

for both Myanmar and Australia plantations were within the 

limits indicated by Bonsucro (&lt; 5 kg per hectare per year). 

In terms of toxicity levels, our sugarcane farms range from 

1,900-3,400	toxicity	units	per	hectare	and	information	on	

the types of herbicides currently used in Wilmar plantations 

can be found on page 89.

NO EXPLOITATION OF PEOPLE

AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES

Wilmar is committed to respecting and protecting the 

human rights of workers who are part of our business, and 

we have policies in place that make our position clear. We 

are guided by international standards as set out in the UN 

Global Compact, the Guiding Principles on Business and 

Human Rights, International Labour Organization (ILO) 

conventions, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 

and its covenants, and the UK Modern Slavery Act. In 

accordance	with	Section	54	of	the	UK	Modern	Slavery	Act,	

we have developed a transparency statement for the 2017 

financial year. This highlights our risk-based approach to 

due diligence in our supply chain and our proactive and 

collaborative strategy towards monitoring and identifying 

issues that could be linked to our suppliers at plantation, 

mill or Group level.

Wilmar is a member of the RSPO Human Rights Working 

Group	(HRWG),	which	was	established	in	2014	and	is	now	

a part of the RSPO structure. The work of the HRWG is 

directly linked to the globally accepted UN Guidelines on 

Business and Human rights (the "Ruggie Framework"). Wilmar 

is actively participating in the HRWG Labour Taskforce, 

addressing the rights of plantation workers and vulnerable 

groups such as migrant workers and casual workers, as well 

as issues including the promotion of living wages, health and 

safety conditions at plantations and freedom of association.

Since August 2017, through the Labour Taskforce, we have 

also strongly supported the RSPO's development of a 

definition and methodology for a sector-specific living wage 

standard, for public consultation and consideration by the 

RSPO/P&amp;C Taskforce.

SDG 8 - DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC 

GROWTH

SDG 8, which relates to decent work and economic growth, 

is underpinned by the rationale that sustainable economic 

growth will require societies to create conditions that allow 

people to have quality jobs that stimulate the economy while 

not harming the environment. With over 51,000 people 

employed	in	our	palm	oil	operations,	and	with	nearly	4,700	

employees in our sugar operations, we understand that we 

have a great opportunity to provide good livelihoods and 

development opportunities to all our workers and their families.

In addition to our NDPE Policy, we have established the 

following labour and human rights policies: Human Rights, 

Child Protection, Occupational Health and Safety, Equal 

Opportunity and Sexual Harassment, Violence &amp; Abuse, and 

Reproductive Rights. We expect all of our own operations 

to adhere to all of these policies. For our sugar operations, 

we have additional policies covering Environment Health &amp; 

Safety, and Injury Management. All of our policies are set 

out to ensure that our business is conducted in an ethical 

manner, that our employees’ human rights are respected, 

that they are treated equally and work in a safe environment, 

and that they return home to their family and friends as 

healthy as they were when they arrived at work.

Although we are committed to ensuring that people working 

in any operation covered under our NDPE Policy are not 

subject to exploitation, we acknowledge that labour risks 

exist in global supply chains. In late 2016, civil society groups, 

including Amnesty International, drew attention to concerns 

about labour practices at our North Sumatra operations, PT 

Perkebunan Milano (Milano) and PT Daya Labuhan Indah 

(DLI). By the end of 2017, a total of two internal and five 

external assessments had been successively undertaken to 

investigate the matter.

One of the external reviews was conducted by Business for 

Social Responsibility (BSR) in December 2016. The assessment 

methodology involved visual observations, interviews, 

focus group discussions and documentation reviews. More 

than 100 Wilmar employees, almost all non-management 

workers, were interviewed by BSR, and the findings have 

been made public.

External due diligence audits also took place in these 

operations via the RSPO and ISCC certification processes 

in 2016 and 2017. A compilation of all external findings and 

our action plan has been published on the Grievance List 

on our Sustainability Dashboard, which can be accessed 

from our website. 

We have strengthened labour practices in our upstream 

palm oil operations over the past year. In December 2017, 

we published a 12-Month Progress Report detailing the 

extensive range of actions we have taken in this area. Though 

the road to improvement has been challenging, we have 

made meaningful progress with the support of a variety of 

stakeholders, especially our employees. 

We conducted internal reviews while regular assessments 

were undertaken by external parties, including the ISCC, 

RSPO, BSR and Verité Southeast Asia. Improvements were 

made in three main areas:

1. Wages and employment 

•	

Reduced	the	dependency	on	temporary	workers	

in our plantations by converting temporary 

contract holders to permanent contract workers.

•	

Improved	and	standardised	payslips	to	provide	

greater clarity to workers on their pay, incentives, 

and deductions (e.g. social security payments).

•	

Abolished	informal	volunteer	work	arrangements	

and established a policy for formal application for 

overtime work on official rest days.

2. Caring for the children in our plantations 

•	

Launched	our	Child	Protection	Policy,	which	

supersedes our longstanding No Child Labour 

Policy, to more holistically address issues of 

children’s rights and welfare.

•	

Improved	access	to	quality	education	for	the	

children of our workers and local communities 

through our school redevelopment programme.

3. Health and safety 

•	

Improved	the	allocation	and	efficacy	of	PPE.

•	

Better	communication	of	workers’	health	

screening results by doctors at our estate clinics.

To complement the Progress Report, we also held two 

stakeholder engagement events with our partners, Verité 

and TFT, to socialise our progress updates with our key 

customers and bankers and respond to their concerns. 

Recognising that individual companies in the private sector 

cannot resolve entrenched labour challenges alone, we are 

working with four other palm oil companies to improve the 

protection of human and labour rights in the agriculture 

sector, by delivering practical and realistic recommendations 

to help rural workers and secure their long-term ability to 

thrive, through the Decent Rural Living Initiative. Launched 

in March 2018, the Initiative is convened by Forum for 

the Future and will seek to engage and collaborate with 

external stakeholders from the public and Civil Society 

Organization sector for the benefit of rural communities in 

developing nations, starting in Indonesia, where all parties 

have operations. The first consultative workshops have taken 

place in May 2018, with intended clear work streams to be 

announced before the end of 2018. 

Through our collaboration with BSR and our buyers, we have 

organised two training sessions for our suppliers entitled 

Human Resources and Labour in Indonesia. The sessions 

involved government, union and civil society speakers, and 

covered key issues such as wages, employment contract 

status and grievance mechanisms. The first workshop 

took place in Medan in November 2017, where more than 

60 representatives from 30 different supplier companies 

participated. The second was held in January 2018, where 

more than 50 representatives from 33 different supplier 

companies took part.

Wilmar met with Amnesty International on 13 June 2017 

to further discuss labour progress. We provided updates 

on our labour programme, including the internal audit 

process, as well as on our collaborations with BSR and 

Verité. We are committed to providing regular updates 

to all our stakeholders, including Amnesty International, 

on our progress in implementing our labour action plan. 

To give stakeholders a better understanding of Wilmar’s 

labour-related practices and efforts on the ground, we have 

also produced a short video documenting the lives of our 

plantation workers in North Sumatra and West Sumatra. The 

video includes interviews with workers and their children, 

union representatives, and an estate doctor.

Collaboration with Verité

To ensure the development of robust and sustainable solutions 

to labour issues, both in our own operations and industry-

wide, we have initiated a collaboration with the global fair 

labour non-profit organisation Verité. Launched in 2017, this 

12-month collaboration began with a problem analysis phase. 

The objectives of this phase have been to identify why issues 

occur despite continuous efforts to improve practices, and 

to establish lasting solutions to their root causes.

In the first phase, the Verité team conducted ground 

verification at PT DLI and PT Milano from 19 to 25 August 

2017. The scope of the verification included assessments of 

current labour and occupational health and safety policies, 

procedures and practices. The assessments were conducted 

using internationally recognised standards, including:

•	

RSPO	Principles	and	Criteria

•	

Palm	Oil	Innovation	Group	(POIG)	Indicators

•	

Wilmar’s	No	Exploitation	Policy

•	

Free	and	Fair	Labour	Principles

•	

Occupational	Safety	&amp;	Health	standards	used	by	

the International Labour Organization (ILO), the 

Occupational Safety and Health Administration 

(OSHA), and the World Health Organisation (WHO)

The intent of the review was to examine how all the various 

policies, procedures and practices align at an overall level, as 

well as how they are put into practice on the ground. While 

we will continue to proceed with improving conditions in PT 

DLI and PT Milano, the next phase in our work with Verité 

will be to focus on integrating new and current procedures 

into a working framework to support and implement social 

standards, identify critical success factors, and build a strategy 

map to achieve social responsibility goals and objectives. 

This is a significant challenge, and we will be working to 

progress these next steps to the fullest extent possible 

throughout 2018.

STAKEHOLDER COMMENTARY BY 

VERITÉ

Melizel Asuncion, Research and 

Stakeholder Engagement Manager, Verité 

Southeast Asia

In 2017, Verité began working with Wilmar on a 12-month 

programme that held the following key objectives: (a) 

To build internal processes and competencies necessary 

to implement robust management and due diligence 

systems that are aligned to international and customer 

requirements, and informed by key stakeholders, and (b) 

To formulate sustainable solutions to egregious, recurring 

and/or systemic labour problems in its Indonesian palm 

oil operations, and ensure sustained company-wide 

conformance to social standards, and to legal and 

customer requirements.

We initiated the programme with ground verification in 

PT Daya Labuhan Indah (DLI) and PT Perkebunan Milano 

(Milano) on 19-25 August 2017, where we sought to 

understand the risk sources at both the micro and macro 

levels, and to identify what is driving the recurrence of 

issues even when policies and procedures are in place. 

One of the most critical aspects we identified was 

related to process gaps in the management system for 

social compliance—i.e. the lack of reflexivity in terms of 

intent and implementation and effectiveness of labour 

policies and procedures. For example, while Wilmar has 

an articulated grievance mechanism, the process for 

anonymous reporting is not very clear, there are no key 

performance indicators for effective grievance mechanism, 

and the non-reprisal policy is not linked to the process.

The absence of a well-coordinated plan can result in non-

conformance to any of the social compliance standards. 

Moreover, it can lead to difficulty in monitoring and 

measuring progress, inconsistencies in the effective 

communication and focused implementation of key 

activities, and failure to meet documentation requirements 

of some social compliance (SC) audits. This gap is by 

no means unique to Wilmar. In our work with other 

palm oil companies, we found that their environment 

compliance system is much more advanced than their 

social compliance system, which is generally characterised 

by internal systems and structures that are not adequate 

to support and/or enable social sustainability goals.

In response to our management system findings, we 

organised a strategic planning workshop in January 2018 

with the operations and sustainability teams of PT Milano 

and PT DLI to integrate new and current procedures into 

a working framework to support and implement social 

standards, identify critical success factors, and build a 

strategy map to achieve social responsibility goals and 

objectives. We are currently in the process of reviewing 

the draft 3-year strategy map (2018-2020), which we 

hope to refine and finalise through a Problem Solving 

Decision Making (PSDM) workshop that will be specially 

designed to work through specific labour issues brought 

up by NGO stakeholders. Strengthening Wilmar’s social 

compliance management system will be Verité’s focus in 

the succeeding months. The management system will 

be piloted in PT Milano and PT DLI, with the intention 

to roll it out to their entire Indonesian operations.

Reflecting on Wilmar’s Sustainability Report 2017, our 

recommendation is that moving forward, Wilmar collects 

feedback from workers to measure the effectiveness 

of the implemented changes. Currently, the only 

measure of progress is based on what Wilmar reports, 

but whether those changes significantly and positively 

impact the supposed and intended beneficiaries of those 

improvements is not known.

In general, there is also much to be improved in terms 

of occupational health and safety, which should be more 

straightforward than systemic social and labour issues 

like tenure rights or child labour. As agriculture is a 

gendered sector, more focus must be given to women 

workers. While they are fewer than male workers, women 

workers have specific needs that gender-neutral policies 

will invariably miss.

Finally, the next challenge for Wilmar relates to evolving a 

due diligence and monitoring mechanism for their suppliers 

that will assure the survival of subsistence farmers while 

ensuring compliance with legal and Wilmar’s policies.

FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS

We are committed to paying fair wages to all employees, 

and to ensuring that our lowest wage paid always meets at 

least the applicable legal minimum wage. This also applies 

to workers subject to key performance indicators, such as 

harvesters who will always earn at least the daily minimum 

wage as long as a full work day is completed.

Palm oil operations

In 2017, the wages1 paid to all workers employed in our palm 

oil operations met at least the applicable minimum wage 

in the various regions where we operate, across Indonesia, 

Malaysia, Nigeria and Ghana.

In addition to wages, every permanent worker in our palm 

oil operations receives free housing for themselves and their 

immediate family. They also receive other benefits, including 

access to facilities such as playgrounds and daycare centres 

for babies, toddlers, and children of pre-school age. We 

also provide access to education for the children of our 

employees who are of school going age.

In 2017, we addressed a key issue regarding the lack of clarity 

and details on workers' payslips within our Indonesian operations. 

Based on a review, our payslip format has been improved 

to provide greater clarity and reduce misinterpretation. Our 

payslips are now worded entirely in Bahasa Indonesia, and 

provide a clear salary breakdown including pay, incentives 

and statutory deductions. The slips now also show how many 

days the employees have worked each month, details on 

ledgers of individual harvesters’ productivity, and different 

premiums to show that every worker is paid at least the 

minimum wage. Following a thorough system integration 

test, and several trial runs at an operational level, the new 

standardised payslip was implemented across Indonesia in 

April 2017. 

Concerns have been raised in previous years that workers 

are being given high targets and quotas. Our harvester 

wage system pays a minimum wage regardless of whether 

these targets and quotas, also known as Key Performance 

Indicators (KPIs), are met. The KPIs are now used to calculate 

premium payments as an incentive for the harvesters, 

specifically for the collection of quality fruit bunches. The 

practice of premiums and penalties for quality fruit harvest 

is common among the industry, and in working through 

this issue with our partner Verité, we have understood that 

this could be seen as a form of exploitation. Based on their 

experience in other industries, we are now working with 

Verité to develop an improved incentive mechanism that 

is easier to understand and that mitigate the concerns of 

labour exploitations. In January 2017, we also collaborated 

with labour union leaders in PT Milano and PT DLI in our 

North Sumatra operations, to develop an updated SOP 

and to conduct a revised calibration process to determine 

proper KPIs for the 2017 harvesting. 

We have also been working over the past year to improve 

workers' understanding of the Terms and Conditions of 

their employment, as is stated within the Collective Labour 

Agreement (CLA). This includes understanding the difference 

between the KPIs and the basic work code. We will continue 

to make clear that base wages will not be reduced, regardless 

of whether harvesters achieve the base KPI within a working 

day, and that the premiums and penalties related to the 

achievement of KPIs will not affect their basic wages or 

family allowance. We will also continue to make clear that 

harvesters are not required to pick up loose fruits during 

peak fruit periods, as there are separate teams tasked for 

that purpose during those periods. 

Sugar operations

Both Australia and New Zealand have minimum wage 

legislation overseen by their respective governments. 

Industrial legislation in Australia is stipulated by the Fair 

Work Act 2009, which provides an absolute minimum wage 

for adult, non-trainee workers. Under the Act, employees 

covered under instruments such as Awards and Enterprise 

Agreements may have higher minimum wages defined in 

their agreements.

The Sugar Industry Award 2010 underpins the minimum 

wage for both milling and farming workers, predominantly 

in the sugar sector in Australia. Wilmar also has an Enterprise 

Agreement that provides over-award pay-rates for Wilmar's mill 

employees. Farm employees are provided wage information 

through common law contracts. These contracts are tested 

against the National Employment Standards (NES) payrates 

to ensure that Wilmar’s contract rates (inclusive of overtime) 

exceed the NES rates.

We comply with the rules and regulations of labour law in 

the countries where we operate with regards to working 

hours, overtime and break times. In addition, our employees 

in Myanmar are provided with staff housing and meal 

allowances, and we ensure our cane field farm workers have 

access to purified drinking water distributed in bottles from 

the factory. Workers in planting, harvesting, and application 

of fertilisers and herbicides are sub-contracted through an 

independent agency, while all other types of labour are paid 

directly by Wilmar based on a daily rate.

Wages includes basic pay, fixed allowances and variable allowances.

TEMPORARY WORKERS

Temporary workers are hired to perform seasonal work, and 

to allow for employment flexibility for our workers.

Palm oil operations 

In Central Kalimantan, where there is a lack of workers 

among the resident population (Central Kalimantan is one 

of the least populous provinces in Indonesia), the number 

of workers with temporary status is actually lower than 

in other regions precisely because there are not enough 

workers to do the plantation work required. Although most 

of the workers in Central Kalimantan originate from other 

parts of Indonesia, they tend to reside in company housing 

in our plantations and stay longer than the required three-

month period. Hence, they are categorised as permanent 

employees. In other regions, many of our employees are 

locals who live in communities near our plantations. Most 

of these workers have alternative sources of income, such 

as their own oil palm, rubber or paddy fields, and prefer to 

work on a casual basis to supplement their regular source 

of income. 

We have been working in 2017 to reduce the proportion 

of temporary workers in our plantations in North Sumatra. 

We have been doing this by converting temporary contract 

holders to permanent contract holders. As at October 

2017, PT DLI and PT Milano (North Sumatra region) has a 

total of 2,050 workers of which less than 5% are temporary 

–	compared	to	47%	a	year	ago.	From	April	to	November	

2017, we have appointed a total of 826 temporary workers 

into permanent positions in the estate. 

Our efforts in North Sumatra are consistent with Wilmar’s 

overall efforts countrywide, as reflected by the year-on-year 

increase in the average number of permanent workers in our 

Indonesian operations from 2015 to 2017. Between 2015 

and the end of October 2017, we achieved an 11% reduction 

in the total number of temporary workers in our Indonesian 

estates. The total number of temporary workers across all of 

our	oil	palm	plantations	decreased	by	24%	between	2016	

and 2017 (financial years).

Sugar Operations

Sugarcane is a seasonal crop, and a large proportion of our 

workforce is temporary, comprising of seasonal workers. In 

our Australia operations, many of the seasonal workers are 

locals, and foreigners are mostly from New Zealand. All 

of our incoming staff must provide evidence that they are 

residents and permitted to work in Australia. In recent years, 

cases of exploitation of foreign seasonal workers have been 

reported publicly in Australia, which has raised concerns in 

the Australian media and among the public, government 

and civil society stakeholders. To our knowledge, this does 

not relate to the sugar industry.

Non-discrimination

Wilmar has non-discrimination and equality policies in place 

that are published on our Sustainability Dashboard. We are 

committed to providing equal employment opportunities, 

regardless of gender.

Given the vast cultural differences between the countries 

and regions in which we operate, gender distribution varies 

greatly. In Malaysia, where a high proportion of women are 

part of the formal labour force, the share of female employees 

is largely proportionate to the working population. In other 

regions where women are often outside the formal labour 

market, the share is much lower. In other countries, such as 

Australia, agriculture tends to be a male-dominated industry 

and our operations reflect this trend. Wilmar does not 

discriminate between male or female workers for any role.

While we seek to ensure that pay and conditions are equal 

for men and women, we recognise that many women in our 

oil palm plantations are on temporary work contracts, rather 

than permanent employee contracts. This is often based on 

requests from the women, as many of the temporary female 

workers are spouses of permanent workers. In these cases, 

when provided the option for permanent employment, 

their preference is for employment on a casual basis as the 

flexible working hours also enables them to manage domestic 

and childcare responsibilities. Workers on permanent work 

contracts are generally not permitted flexible working hours. 

We continue to have dialogues with our workers to improve 

their contract terms, work conditions and work-life balance.

PROTECTING AND SUPPORTING 

CHILDREN’S WELFARE 

To date, the oil palm industry has largely focused on the 

issue of child labour and its eradication within plantations. 

Increasingly, however, there is a call for the industry to expand 

this scope to the rights and well-being of the children living 

in oil palm estates. While we remain committed to keeping 

children out of plantation operations, we are also taking 

action to address the wider issue of safeguarding children 

and their rights, using guidance from organisations such as 

ILO and UNICEF.

Since 2010 Wilmar has had in place a clear No Child Labour 

Policy, which forbids the employment of anyone below the 

age of 18. As part of our commitment to more fully address 

the issues of children’s rights and welfare, we launched our 

new Child Protection Policy in November 2017. The Policy 

underlines a wider commitment to ensure that all children 

in our plantations, schools and facilities, as well as those 

under the care of our third-party suppliers and contractors, 

are provided with safeguards and protection from abuse 

and exploitation. The Policy also now contains specific 

remediation actions for any instances where child labour 

is found. The new policy is applicable across our global 

operations, including joint ventures, third-party suppliers, and 

contractors. This is the first Policy of its kind to be applied 

explicitly to external parties.

UNICEF was one of the key stakeholders consulted in the 

development of this Policy. Our next steps will include 

building on UNICEF’s Child Safeguarding Toolkit, which 

will be incorporated in Wilmar’s internal SOPs. We will also 

be rolling out training on the Child Protection Policy for all 

relevant staff and workers, and we will explore possibilities 

to do the same for our suppliers and contractors. We will 

be working closely with Verité on the development and 

implementation of the SOPs.

In specific regard to the allegations made about children 

working on Wilmar’s North Sumatran estates, we have found 

no evidence that this had been taking place. Independent 

interviews with teachers from nearby schools, and comparisons 

between Wilmar’s census data and school attendance records, 

found that 327 children were attending school daily, and 

that the few who were not accounted for were not likely to 

be missing school to work with their parents. Interviews with 

union representatives undertaken by independent assessors 

also indicated that children were not present on the plantation 

to help their parents, and that the rule that children cannot 

accompany parents is well understood by workers.

However, we did find that a handful of our workers were 

coming into the estate and bringing their children with 

them, in some cases asking their children to do errands 

for them around the workplace (e.g. fetching lunch boxes). 

After speaking with these workers, we have found that the 

primary reason for their children's presence was a lack of 

access to schooling. Some of the children had developmental 

challenges and were not accepted in schools, while some were 

considered “problematic” and had been expelled. In other 

cases, there were children who were simply not interested 

in attending school, and rather than risk them getting into 

trouble elsewhere, employees brought them into work.

We remain committed to finding solutions together with these 

parents, and we continue to monitor their children. Solutions 

we have put in place include sending the children to non-formal 

education programmes (Depdiknas), vocational training or 

to special needs schools. While we have been successful in 

getting some of the children back to school, we continue to 

work with the remaining 15 children as of December 2017, 

and their parents, on pathways to reintegration.

Percentage of children who live in Wilmar 

plantations that attend school

In total, there are 10,888 children of compulsory school-

going age living in Wilmar’s palm plantations in Indonesia, 

Malaysia, Nigeria and Ghana. In our efforts to provide 

access to quality education to these children, Wilmar has 

embarked on a school redevelopment programme in our 

estates.	44.9%	of	children	attend	Wilmar	operated	schools#, 

and	approximately	46.8%	of	children	attend	government	

schools in the vicinity (within or outside) of our estates. For 

our Myanmar sugar farms, about 93% of children of school 

going age attend schools operated by the government.

In September 2017, Wilmar together with TFT and the 

Malaysian Palm Oil Certification Council (MPOCC) held 

a workshop in Sabah titled “Children in Plantations”. The 

workshop was attended by representatives from 25 supplying 

companies and was focused on sharing best practices in 

preventing children working in plantations. Speakers at the 

workshop included representatives from the Indonesian 

Consulate, MPOCC, UNICEF, ILO and the Humana Child 

Aid Society. This workshop was a good platform to raise 

awareness about the issue among Wilmar suppliers. It also 

enabled us to better understand the challenges they face in 

their plantations and provided a forum to discuss potential 

next steps and strategies.

# 

The percentage only refers to the number of children living in Indonesia, Malaysia and Ghana, because there are no Wilmar operated schools 

in Nigeria. EY has performed limited assurance procedures on this figure.

BONDED LABOUR

In line with our commitments and the requirements of the 

RSPO and our NDPE Policy, we do not permit any forced, 

trafficked or bonded labour, either in our own operations 

or in our supply chain.

Forced labour often affects migrant workers or other 

vulnerable groups who lack means, language skills, and 

access to information. In the oil palm sector, the highest 

risk of force or coercion occurs when workers are recruited 

through employment agencies.

For our plantation and mill operations in Malaysia and 

Indonesia, we ensure that we recruit all workers directly 

and therefore our workers do not pay fees to recruitment 

agencies. We only use agents to assist with the processing of 

recruitment documents, such as work permits and passports, 

and to help arrange transport for workers to the plantations. 

In these cases, we take full responsibility for payment and no 

cost is charged to the workers. In some cases, team leaders 

(mandores) are requested to assist in the recruitment of local 

workers and they are paid an incentive to do so. In countries 

like Ghana and Nigeria, agents are used in the recruitment 

process, however we do not permit the agent to request 

the lodging of monetary deposits or other collateral as a 

condition of employment.

We also seek to ensure that employees are never subject 

to the unlawful withholding of wages, identification cards, 

passports or other travel documents, or other personal 

belongings, without their consent. Recognising that passport 

retention is a particularly important issue in Malaysia, we 

have taken steps to ensure that all employees have access 

to a secure place to store their personal belongings through 

the installation of lockers for our workers. Workers retain 

their locker keys and they can access their passport without 

restriction. When workers remove their passports from their 

locker, they are requested to enter a record into a log book. 

This initiative is being rolled out to all our plantations in 

Malaysia. Some 750 lockers were installed in 2016 during 

the initial trial period, and 10,000 lockers were successfully 

installed in 2017. With this installation, Wilmar became one 

of the first oil palm plantation companies in Malaysia to 

return passports to all of our migrant workers. An official 

passport handover event was organised in March 2018, and 

attended by the Chief of the Indonesian Consul-General’s 

Office in Tawau, Bapak Sulistijo Djati Ismojo.

In sugarcane production, a number of countries have been 

identified by the United States Department of Labor, Verité 

and KnowTheChain as having a high-risk of forced labour. 

These countries include Bolivia, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, 

Myanmar, and Pakistan. In our sugarcane operations in 

Myanmar, we contact the labour head (agent) to subcontract 

workers for daily operations. Labour conditions for our 

workers in Myanmar will be reviewed in more detail in 2018.

Our mills in Australia only buy sugarcane from farms within 

the country. These farms operate in a heavily unionised and 

legislated environment, where there is strong trade union 

involvement that ensures all labour is voluntary, and that all 

employees are able to terminate their employment of their 

own free will at any time. We also subscribe to sources that 

advise on labour-related legislation changes, and conduct 

regular reviews of our environmental and social standards, 

including labour practices.

Furthermore, we are also pursuing Bonsucro certification for 

our Australian mills and farms. One of the core criteria of 

Bonsucro standards is compliance with ILO labour conventions 

governing child labour, forced labour, discrimination and 

freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. 

For our Bonsucro certified Australian operations, we have 

not identified any major forced labour issues in either our 

own mills and farms or those of third parties.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND 

COMPLAINTS MECHANISMS

We are committed to ensuring that workers have access to 

an appropriate complaints mechanism and a process for 

addressing grievances.

In Indonesia, all employees (including temporary workers) 

can make complaints verbally or in writing to their supervisor. 

If the complaint concerns a direct supervisor, the employee 

may also go to a union representative, or make use of on-

site feedback boxes to make an anonymous complaint. If a 

complaint cannot be settled satisfactorily, the matter may 

be first escalated to the Human Resources Department and 

subsequently to senior management (general manager level). 

If a complaint is not resolved in a manner that is satisfactory 

to the employee, he or she may seek the assistance of a 

mediator from the Department of Manpower, or may ultimately 

resort to legal action. Confidentiality and the anonymity of 

the complainant may be requested and will be guaranteed. 

Our mill and farm operations in Australia and Myanmar 

also have grievance processes in place for all employees. 

Employees are made aware of these processes at the point 

of employment and are given an employee handbook that 

outlines the details of the grievance mechanism. Employees 

also receive regular reminders about the grievance processes, 

including updates on company notice boards and our intranet, 

as well as in team briefings. Our workers are free to approach 

their supervisors, members of the HR Department, or their 

trade union representatives to raise any issues or complaints. 

In addition to our general grievance mechanism, complaints 

mechanism and workers’ unions, we have gender committees 

in place in our oil palm plantations to ensure that women can 

access support and raise concerns. An assessment conducted 

with BSR in Indonesia in 2016 found that workers had a low 

level of awareness about grievance mechanisms, and that it 

was unclear whether temporary workers were covered by 

existing mechanisms. We are now reviewing ways to raise 

awareness among our employees about the complaints 

options available to them.

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND UNION 

RELATIONS

Wilmar supports the rights of employees to form and join 

trade unions of their choice and to bargain collectively. 

Where the rights to freedom of association and to collective 

bargaining are restricted under law, parallel means of 

independent and free association and bargaining are made 

available for all personnel.

Unions are our key stakeholders in ensuring that we 

understand and appropriately address the concerns and 

grievances of our employees. We recognise that they play 

a significant role in helping our workers understand their 

rights, as well as in providing input for improvements to 

working conditions. Workers can also utilise the union as 

a grievance channel or for collective bargaining purposes, 

such as to negotiate with the company on issues related to 

wages and premium incentives. 

Indonesia

In 2017 we have taken a very proactive approach to 

working with labour unions in Indonesia and have built 

good working relationships with key union organisations. 

We have also engaged with our suppliers on the need for 

labour improvements, and conducted training sessions 

involving speakers from the government, unions and civil 

society organisations.

In our North Sumatra operations, we are working closely with 

Serbundo (a North Sumatra–based union affiliated with the 

International Union of Food Workers). Together, we have 

developed a Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) for both 

PT DLI and PT Milano since 2015. We have recently renewed 

and finalised the CLA covering years 2018 – 2020. CLAs are 

developed jointly with workers’ union representatives to 

provide clarity and assurance on the rights and responsibilities 

of both plantations/mills and workers, as well as on workers' 

benefit entitlements. These agreements are negotiated 

between the plantation/mill management and workers, 

who are represented by the respective labour union, and 

are valid for workers who are members of the union. Our 

permanent worker’s contract refers to the CLA that has been 

accepted by the workers’ union representatives. This CLA 

is reviewed every two years.

Wilmar International Limited

Our positive and ongoing engagements with Serbundo 

resulted in the appointment of five union leaders from our 

North Sumatran plantations in August 2017. Recognising 

the progress we have made in the province, Serbundo 

conducted a field visit to both PT DLI and PT Milano in 

October 2017 to gain better insight into our practices. During 

the visit, Serbundo’s team spoke to our workers and union 

representatives to learn more about working conditions 

at Wilmar. Based on these experiences, we have involved 

Serbundo in our supplier training workshops, so they can 

engage directly with our third-party suppliers and help them 

improve their own labour practices.

Apart from Serbundo, we have also recently started working 

more closely with KSBSI-HUKATAN, a national union affiliated 

to the Dutch federation CNV. We have so far conducted 

three co-training sessions on workers’ rights and improving 

industrial relations in Riau. On 31 October 2017, we adopted 

the KSBSI-HUKATAN multiple site work agreement template 

for our mill in West Sumatra, PT Bumi Pratama Khatulistiwa 

(PT BPK), as the new CLA for the workers there.

Workers at our sugar refinery PT Refined Jawamanis in 

Indonesia are also fully unionised and we have a CLA in place. 

Malaysia, Ghana, Nigeria and Myanmar

In Ghana and Nigeria, the majority of our workers are 

unionised. Unions also play a significant role in our Myanmar 

operations, particularly in securing legislated protection and 

rights for workers. Wilmar has in place a robust framework 

and process for determining rates of pay, including regular 

negotiations with trade unions.

Our Malaysian operations are not unionised, but we have 

ongoing engagements with workers on conditions and 

pay. For collective bargaining purposes, we have a Social 

&amp; Welfare Committee in place to discuss related matters, 

including wages. The Committee meets three times a year 

and is chaired by the manager of the estate or mill and 

represented by both management and worker representatives. 

Australia and New Zealand

Union rights and collective bargaining rights are well embedded 

in Australia and New Zealand. A large percentage of our 

workforce is unionised, and there are collective bargaining 

agreements in place. Some of our sugar suppliers are 

Bonsucro certified and we are therefore confident that they 

also have such practices in place, as it is a core requirement 

under	indicator	2.1.4	(Respect	the	right	of	all	workers	to	

form and join trade unions and/or to bargain collectively).

PALM OIL OPERATIONS

Improving health and safety at our plantations and mills 

has been one of our key workplans throughout 2017. This 

includes better allocation, efficacy and training on use 

of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and improved 

communication of workers’ health screening results by 

doctors in our estate clinics. 

Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) training will continue 

to be conducted on a regular basis for all workers. This is to 

ensure that workers fully understand PPE use and our safe work 

practices. We have also drafted a comprehensive standard 

operating procedure (SOP) in Malaysia and Indonesia on the 

issue of working during haze events based on government-

issued guidelines in each country. We have included in this 

specification the identification and provision of PPE that is 

appropriate for any haze occurrence. We have consulted a 

range of stakeholders, including medical professionals, in 

the development of this specific SOP, which was finalised 

in early 2018.

We are also looking to address certain non-work-related 

behaviours that put workers at risk. For example, to stop 

workers using herbicide containers for storing drinking water 

we are providing drinking containers and potable water in the 

field. We have also implemented a triple-rinsing process for 

empty herbicide containers. We maintain our focus on safety 

and are following through with our efforts to strengthen our 

safety culture. Key indicators that link employees’ remuneration 

to their health and safety performance are now being set to 

instil a behaviour-based safety culture, support increased 

safety awareness and improve safety practices.

Provision of healthcare

We provide free healthcare from the Wilmar-funded estate 

clinics to all workers in our oil palm plantations, both 

permanent and temporary as well as their families. The terms 

and conditions related to healthcare and health benefits for 

permanent workers are stipulated in the workers’ contract 

which is negotiated and accepted by the workers’ union 

representatives and the estate. In addition to free on-site 

healthcare, our permanent workers are covered by medical 

insurance, which allows them to claim for reimbursement 

of medical fees on outpatient treatment sought outside 

of Wilmar’s clinics. Permanent workers are also entitled to 

dental care benefits and subsidies on spectacles, dentures 

and hearing aids. Regular hearing checks are conducted for 

our mill employees that work in areas where exposure to 

elevated noise levels is a risk. 

All employees working with chemicals are provided with regular 

medical check-ups and a biannual blood test to ensure that 

they are not adversely affected. In certain instances, where 

medical evaluations demonstrate high blood chemical levels, 

we reassign chemical workers to non-chemical handling jobs 

and continue to monitor their health every three months.

We recognise that it is also important for our workers to 

understand the process through which medical feedback 

is provided to them. Since 2017, we have instructed our 

doctors to clearly explain the health screening process and 

to directly communicate any abnormal results (and their 

implications) to affected workers. All workers that have 

undergone a screening now receive feedback on their results 

from the appointed doctor.

SUGAR OPERATIONS

Where sugarcane is cultivated manually there is a high risk 

of accidents and injuries, especially during the cane-cutting 

process. The use of heavy machetes can cause musculoskeletal 

injuries, and the protection of eyes is crucial as cutting can 

leave workers vulnerable to cuts and injuries from cane 

stalks. These specific risks are not present in our Australian 

sugarcane operations where machines are used to plant, 

harvest and apply any chemicals.

To ensure that health and safety is properly addressed, we 

have a specific Sugar Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) 

Policy in place. This EHS Policy outlines our commitments 

towards promoting awareness, identifying and communicating 

hazards and risks, and providing training for our employees. 

In addition, the EHS Policy commits us to conducting our 

operations in compliance with all applicable legislation, 

licences, codes of practice and industry standards, and 

providing and maintaining safe and healthy working areas 

and methods of work, while minimising our environmental 

impact.

For our operations in Australia and New Zealand, we also 

have a dedicated EHS management system that outlines 

our EHS framework, and explains the policies, standards 

and procedures within our sugar operations. The focus 

of the management system is compliance with legislative 

requirements and ensuring activities are carried out in a 

manner that complies with the system’s guiding requirements.

FATALITIES

Every fatality is followed by a thorough review of its cause 

and actions are defined to prevent recurrence. The reviews 

are reinforced with continued efforts in training and PPE use 

to minimise, if not eliminate, risks.

In 2017, it is with regret that we report five work-related 

employees fatalities in Malaysia and Indonesia. There 

were two fatalities in our plantation in Sumatra, one in our 

plantation in Sabah, and two in the mills of Sumatra and 

Central Kalimantan. Three of these fatalities were as a result 

of electrocution and two from vehicle related accidents.

In both of the vehicle related cases, the incidents occurred as 

a result of a lack of training, and in one case, specifically also 

because the vehicle was being operated by an unlicensed 

operator. The three incidents related to electrocution occurred 

as a result of lack of training, awareness and management, 

malfunctioning equipment, and because procedures were 

not followed. 

 

All incidents were thoroughly investigated, and a range of 

steps have been taken with regards to improving training 

and awareness, ensuring that appropriate risk assessments 

are conducted, fixing faulty equipment, ensuring appropriate 

tools and PPE are provided, and ensuring that all personnel 

are licensed and trained to operate assigned vehicles and 

equipment.

Safety briefing for palm oil mill workers

Wilmar International Limited

Sustainability Report 2017

Smallholders are an integral part of the palm oil industry and 

facilitating their inclusivity in the supply chain is a priority 

for Wilmar. Smallholder inclusivity is not only important for 

securing our social license to operate, but also for securing 

our future fruit supply and maintaining our relations with 

local communities. The RSPO estimates that sustainable 

methods and best agricultural practices will boost smallholder 

productivity by up to 85%, thereby enhancing many incomes 

and livelihoods. We therefore strongly support certification 

as a component in incentivising smallholders to implement 

sustainable practices. However, we also believe that this 

incentive requires that smallholders understand the direct 

value of sustainability as an integral part of producing 

quality FFB. 

While our formal programmes with smallholders and 

external partners have a strong focus on certification, we 

also engage in ongoing consultations with our oil palm 

and sugar smallholder suppliers and provide them with 

technical assistance to support their compliance with 

our NDPE Policy. These smallholders benefit from better 

yields with the application of good agronomic inputs and 

practices, as well as improved market access. To address 

a vast diversity of cultures, traditions, land tenure models 

and local development needs, the format and focus of our 

smallholder work is shaped locally and in partnership and 

dialogue with communities and local government bodies. 

Wilmar sources from both plasma and independent smallholders. 

We are committed to helping our own scheme smallholders 

achieve certification under the RSPO Smallholder Principles 

&amp; Criteria. We have also continued to grow our independent 

smallholder base. In 2017, we bought a total of 3,620,630 

tonnes of FFB from independent smallholders, of which 

about 97% was from Indonesia, about 2% was from Malaysia 

and the remainder from Ghana.

Our joint venture Great Wall-Wilmar Sugar Mill in Maung 

Kong, Yangon, is the biggest sugar mill in Myanmar with 

a market share of nearly 30%. Since 2016, we have been 

conducting training programmes for smallholder farmers 

who account for a significant supply of sugarcane to this 

mill. By improving technical capacity and knowledge in 

best management practices, the farmers have benefited 

from higher yields and incomes. In 2017, we conducted 10 

farmers’	meetings	in	various	locations	for	425	attendees	

in total to share knowledge of advanced farming systems. 

The training workshops are also a platform for farmers to 

share their experiences and seek help in overcoming specific 

challenges on their farms.

SMALLHOLDER SUPPORT INITIATIVES

Wilmar also works with a variety of partners on smallholder 

empowerment projects. These projects focus on improving 

yields through technical support and improved practices, 

as well as on meeting national requirements and obtaining 

certification. 

Supporting independent smallholders and 

outgrowers in Asia to achieve certification

In 2017, Wilmar’s smallholder development team in Indonesia 

embarked on a programme to train and facilitate smallholders 

in obtaining the Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil certification 

(ISPO). The programme was piloted in the Riau province in 

August	2017	with	225	smallholders	(covering	450	hectares)	

from the Sekato Jaya Lestari cooperative. This programme 

has	the	potential	to	scale	up	to	benefit	4,300	smallholders	

covering a total land area of 8,600 hectares.

We have also established a partnership with the Malaysian 

Palm Oil Certification Council (MPOCC) to assist all of our 

Malaysian suppliers in achieving certification against the 

Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) standard by the end 

of 2019. Over 260 supplier mills covering more than 55% of 

the mills in Malaysia are expected to benefit from through 

this collaboration. Underpinned by mutual sustainability 

interests, three areas of collaboration have been identified to 

generate the biggest impact within the two-year timeframe. 

They have been conceptualised to engage, share knowledge 

and lend support to the suppliers in preparing them for 

MSPO certification.

The three areas include:

 

Supplier Reporting Tool 

The tool enables suppliers to measure their performance 

against the MSPO requirements and Wilmar's NDPE Policy. 

Wilmar and MPOCC will in turn be able to identify gaps and 

deploy resources (e.g. audit assistance) more effectively. The 

tool was successfully rolled out at the end of March 2018 

for suppliers of Wilmar’s PGEO refinery in Johor Bahru. It 

will be extended to all of Wilmar’s suppliers in Malaysia by 

the end of 2018. 

Group certification for small and medium 

suppliers in Sabah 

Wilmar has identified several small and medium growers in 

the Sapi region who are facing challenges in meeting MSPO 

requirements. These suppliers will be linked to specific mills 

and will have access to training and assistance for group 

certification under the MSPO Certification Scheme. 

Sustainable best practices training for suppliers 

in Sarawak 

A roadshow is planned in collaboration with MPOCC to build 

capacity among Sarawak suppliers towards the adoption of 

sustainable practices, including good agriculture practices, 

which forms part of MSPO requirements.

Launch of pilot outgrower scheme at Biase 

Plantations, Nigeria 

We have continued supporting independent FFB suppliers in 

Nigeria. In October 2017, Biase Plantations Ltd (BPL) launched 

its Pilot Outgrower Scheme for outgrowers in the Biase Local 

Government Area. The project, which is fully funded by BPL, 

covers four smallholder groups and is expected to benefit 

43	individual	smallholders.	The	programme	is	designed	to	

empower local farmers by demonstrating best practices 

for sustainable smallholder oil palm development. BPL is 

implementing the Pilot Outgrower Scheme in partnership 

with the Heritage Bank of Nigeria. Heritage Bank received 

special recognition from the Central Bank of Nigeria in 

December 2017, as the BPL Pilot Outgrower Programme 

won second place in the Sustainability Transaction of the 

Year in Agriculture Award.

Wilmar Smallholders Support in Honduras 

(WISSH)

Smallholders	own	more	than	40%	of	the	total	planted	area	

of oil palm in Honduras – Latin America’s third largest palm 

oil producer and a key player in the supply of palm oil to 

Europe. In 2016, we initiated Wilmar Smallholders Support 

in Honduras (WISSH) in partnership with the Industrial 

Association of Palm Oil Producers in Honduras (AIPAH). 

WISSH aims to enhance smallholders’ technical capacities 

on best agricultural management practices in order to bring 

about better environmental outcomes as well as increasing 

yields and income. By the end of the programme's first year, it 

had	achieved	its	first	training	target:	86%	of	the	4,000	AIPAH	

smallholders were trained on Wilmar’s NDPE Policy. By the 

close	of	2017,	426	training	sessions	had	been	conducted	for	

3,200 independent and associated smallholders. A survey of 

the associated smallholders showed that 97% were satisfied 

with the WISSH programme and 99% applied the knowledge 

they had acquired on their plantations. 

The last two WISSH training topics for independent 

smallholders and assessments for associated smallholders 

were completed in February 2018. Following this, a series of 

assessments has commenced to review the implementation 

of best practices. The assessments are targeting around 

170 smallholders to verify implementation and identify 

instances of non-compliance with Wilmar NDPE Policy. The 

outcome of the assessments will be an action plan to close 

any identified gaps. 

A short video that showcases the impact of WISSH over last 

two years can be accessed at https://youtu.be/HGR0_EP1Ym4 

Wilmar small growers support in Colombia 

(WISSCo)

Modelling the success of the WISSH programme, we have 

partnered with the Sustainable Trade Platform, Solidaridad 

and NES Naturaleza to launch WISSCo in Colombia. This 

programme reaches independent smallholders and small 

growers supplying up to 10 mills on less than 500 hectares 

of land. Launched in August 2017, the programme will 

comprise a series of eight training sessions. A total of 235 

small growers, owning a total area of 28,715 hectares, are 

expected to benefit. Like the WISSH programme, WISSCo 

also aims to enhance smallholders' capacity to implement 

good environmental and social practices in accordance with 

Wilmar's NDPE Policy.

SMALLHOLDER INTERVIEW – LEO MENSAH, BOPP GHANA 

I have been a smallholder with Benso Oil Palm Plantation 

(BOPP) since 1998. I can say that the benefits of this 

association have improved since Wilmar took over in 

2011. I have gained practical knowledge in oil palm 

management and this has increased both my yields 

and my earnings.

In terms of specific training organised by BOPP, I have 

participated in RSPO programmes on buffer zone 

management, health and safety and conservation. These 

programmes have helped me focus on building safe and 

more sustainable practices into my daily work.

It also helps to have regular contact with BOPP 

management. As part of a group of farmers, I meet with 

BOPP's Smallholder Management Team every quarter to 

discuss any issues that have arisen. I also have access to 

a BOPP Smallholder Manager if there is an immediate 

concern that needs to be resolved.

Of course, being a smallholder has its challenges. Access 

is limited by poor road conditions, so improvements 

to the road network are always on the wish list. The 

company does perform occasional grading on roads, 

but it would be a significant benefit if this happened 

on a more regular basis.

Another issue we have raised is the necessity of leaving 

harvested crops in the field overnight – which can impair 

FFB quality – when the mill reaches capacity in busy 

periods. BOPP has recently upgraded the mill capacity 

from 20 to 30 tonnes per hour, and I believe this will 

speed up crop reception at the mill and ensure our crops 

are collected in a timely manner.

Repaying the cost of fertilisers is another ongoing concern. 

This is a substantial outlay for a smallholder to cover up 

front, and has seen some of us get into arrears. BOPP 

management could do more to support smallholders 

by helping us pay outstanding arrears and subsidising 

future fertiliser purchases.

But beyond these challenges, my association with BOPP 

has brought many benefits. The most significant was 

being able to contribute towards RSPO certification, 

which	the	company	received	in	2014.	I	was	part	of	the	

entire process, from preparations to the audits, and I 

am proud to say that I was personally interviewed by 

the auditors. Participating in this way gives me a lot of 

satisfaction and a sense of recognition.

The smallholder programme has so far had positive 

outcomes. I hope that BOPP's top management expands 

the project so that more people will benefit. This will 

help to alleviate poverty in our communities.

COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND CONFLICT 

RESOLUTION

Wilmar works to obtain the free, prior and informed consent 

(FPIC) of local communities for all development projects. 

The principle of FPIC is recognised in the United Nations 

Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), 

and upholds that local communities have the right to give or 

withhold their consent to proposed projects that may affect 

the lands they customarily own, occupy or otherwise use. 

When carried out properly, FPIC is a participatory process 

that empowers local communities to negotiate the conditions 

under which a project will be designed, implemented, 

monitored and evaluated.

Land use and land ownership are inherently complex matters 

in most of the countries we operate in, with overlapping 

or undelineated land rights in land concessions. Shaped 

by a nation’s development policies and projects, these can 

sometimes have an unintentional impact on local communities 

and result in disagreements and conflicts. We endeavour to 

be respectful of local communities whenever such disputes 

arise and are committed to building long-term relationships 

as part of our goal of achieving harmonious relations with 

all our stakeholders.

Making reference to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's 

Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of 

Tenure, Wilmar’s policy guidelines are: 

•	

Wilmar	will	respect	the	resource	(e.g.	land,	forests	

and fisheries) and tenure rights of local communities. 

This is done in cognisance of the national obligations, 

constitutions, local laws and regulations of the country 

we are operating in. We diligently strive to ensure 

that we use land to which we have a legal right, and 

in which the country’s government recognises us as 

the rightful entity to manage the land in question.

•	

If	there	are	land	disputes,	Wilmar	seeks	to	resolve	

them in an open and consensual manner. In the event 

of loss or damage affecting legal or customary rights, 

property, resources or livelihoods, we endeavour 

to undertake all measures to remedy such loss or 

damage.

Wilmar pledges to recognise and respect the long-term 

customary and individual rights of indigenous and local 

communities. We also commit to ensuring legal compliance 

and that international best practices on FPIC are implemented, 

in accordance with the full scope of our NDPE Policy, prior 

to commencing any new operations.

Our standard practice involves negotiating with individual 

landowners and local community leaders, or the government, 

depending on the country. With respect to compensation, we 

strive for a fair compensation to the local community leaders 

for existing crops, with statutory levels of compensation 

as a minimum. We also implement progressive community 

development programmes through employment opportunities 

and smallholder schemes, making every effort to ensure that 

communities are satisfied with the socioeconomic benefits 

that development will bring. We continually strive to improve 

and strengthen our land claims resolution system through 

an inclusive, multi-stakeholder approach, and by working 

closely with local civil society groups and social experts.

SUPPORTING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

Given the nature of our business, many of our operations 

are located in remote parts of developing countries, and 

often close to local communities. Our business activities have 

a direct impact on the livelihoods and quality of living of 

both our employees and individuals in these neighbouring 

communities. Our approach is therefore to ensure that we 

bring meaningful and lasting benefits to communities, and 

build open, honest and mutually beneficial relationships. 

In accordance with this approach, we are committed to 

addressing the needs of locals, but also to facilitating self-

reliance, particularly through the provision and support of 

education, healthcare and infrastructure. In some of the 

areas we operate in, we also facilitate basic services. In rural 

Sabah, for example, we are supporting the communities 

to retrospectively register births and apply for national 

identification. This gives them access to public services.

SDG 4 - Quality Education

In	line	with	SDG	4,	which	concerns	improving	access	to	

inclusive and quality education for all, we strongly believe that 

education is a cornerstone for empowering individuals and 

communities to break out of poverty and build meaningful 

lives in the long term. We provide a range of services in our 

oil palm plantations, including childcare, kindergartens and 

schools, to ensure that all our workers’ children have access 

to daycare and education while their parents are at work.

We have 15 schools in our Indonesian plantations, which 

together cover kindergarten, primary and secondary-level 

curricula. We also support the education of more than 

5,000 children in our local communities, including our 

employees' children. A short video was made about our 

school redevelopment programme in Indonesia in 2017, 

which can be accessed here www.wilmar-international.com/

Wilmar International Limited

Sustainability Report 2017


In our estates in Malaysia we have a total of 17 primary 

schools	that	benefit	a	total	of	747	children.	In	addition,	

we are working with the non-profit organisation Humana 

Child Aid Society of Sabah to provide for the children of 

immigrant workers in our operations in Malaysian Borneo. 

The educational syllabus is designed based on the Malaysian 

curriculum, but also integrates Indonesia-centric subjects to 

help ease the Indonesian children’s transition into mainstream 

societies whether they choose to stay in Malaysia or return 

to Indonesia. As well as providing free education, we also 

subsidise uniforms, books and food every year.

Through our joint venture, Great Wall-Wilmar Sugar Mill 

(GWWH), we are providing donations for school redevelopment 

programmes in the vicinity of the mill. Further, there are 

kindergartens in the factory compound, and 80 students 

are children of employees.

With our strong support in providing access to quality education 

for children in our plantations, an estimate of about 88% of 

children living in our plantations of compulsory school-going 

age attend school (see page 73 for more information).

RSPO COMPLAINTS CASE – UPDATE 2017

Ongoing social issue at PT Permata Hijau Pasaman I

In 2015, we were made aware of a case that was filed 

with the RSPO regarding our subsidiary PT Permata 

Hijau Pasaman I (PHP I), in which the community of 

Nagari Kapa requested clarity on the extent of PT PHP 

I's nucleus estate and requested that PT PHP I's land 

use right application to the National Land Agency over 

the customary land of Nagari Kapa not be accepted.

•	

Following	a	review	of	the	case,	in	March	2015,	the	

RSPO Complaints Panel made a preliminary decision 

that PT PHP I was in compliance with the RSPO 

Principle and Criteria No. 2 on Compliance with 

Applicable Laws and Regulations, and that the HGU 

was issued properly in accordance with the law. The 

Complaints Panel sent a letter to the community of 

Nagari Kapa informing them of this decision and the 

case was initially dismissed.

•	

The	complainant	objected	the	Complaints	Panel’s	

decision. All parties agreed to move forward with a 

ground-checking in order to have a clear understanding 

of the case. 

•	

In	February	2017,	the	RSPO	Complaints	Panel	decided	

that the land in dispute would be measured through 

participatory mapping. This would entail the participation 

of the community of Nagari Kapa and surrounding 

settlements (Nagari), the complainants and the local 

authority. PT PHP I would be required to assign an 

independent expert to conduct the participatory 

mapping and the result of the participatory mapping 

would need to be submitted by the involved parties 

to the National Land Agency (BPN).

•	

In	April	2017,	Wilmar	was	compelled	to	file	an	appeal	

after our review found possible breaches in the 

complaint handling process within the RSPO. Along 

with the appeal, Wilmar requested to postpone 

the participatory mapping activities as the exercise 

would require the direct involvement of Indonesian 

government regulatory bodies. Proceeding with the 

exercise would therefore not be appropriate until 

the completion of the appeal process.

•	

In	November	2017,	Wilmar	withdrew	the	appeal,	

based on the view that the appeals process was 

impeding the resolution process with the complainant. 

The withdrawal of the appeal was granted by the 

RSPO. This reinstated the initial decision made by 

the Complaints Panel on 1 February 2017.

Status as at December 2017/January 2018: Wilmar and 

the complainant have jointly appointed an independent 

party to carry out the decision made by RSPO.

School redevelopment programmes

As part of our endeavour to ensure that the children of 

our plantation workers and in our local communities have 

access to quality education, we have embarked on school 

redevelopment programmes in Indonesia, Nigeria and Ghana. 

In addition to upgrading and providing new facilities, we 

have also made provision for students to participate in extra-

curricular activities ranging from music and arts to sports 

and uniformed groups. Outstanding students are offered 

scholarships to pursue further education at provincial and 

national universities.

We are aiming to upgrade and modernise 15 schools in 

and around our Indonesian oil palm estates by 2020. Two 

pilot schools have been completed, and the process will be 

replicated across the 15 schools in Wilmar’s plantation estates. 

Redevelopment work is underway in five schools. Following 

redevelopment, students will have access to computer and 

science labs, a library, as well as a range of extracurricular 

activities. This will benefit between 6,500 and 7,000 children 

from pre-primary school age through to secondary school 

age annually. Our aim is to ensure that these children have 

the opportunity to excel and succeed, just like their peers 

in urban areas. We are working closely with the Indonesian 

Education Ministry to ensure that our privately-run schools 

are in compliance with all government standards. Where 

there are already existing government schools close to our 

estates, we have also planned for their improvement. Two 

government schools in North Sumatra have benefited from 

this redevelopment programme. One located in PT DLI is 

scheduled for completion in December 2017, while a second 

school at PT Milano is budgeted for redevelopment in 2018.

Wilmar’s team in Cross River State, Nigeria, has kickstarted 

a project to rebuild schools in surrounding communities that 

contributed land for plantation development. Redevelopment 

work has commenced at two secondary schools and one 

primary school near our estates. Besides overseeing the 

construction and renovation of schools, Wilmar’s staff volunteers 

will also support the management of schools. The aim is to 

improve the quality of school infrastructure and facilities, 

teaching standard and extra-curricular activities offered to 

students. Another batch of scholarships were awarded in 

2017 to outstanding students from local communities to 

support their tertiary education. So far, Wilmar has awarded 

115 university scholarships. We plan to redevelop all schools 

in the vicinity of our estates in Nigeria. 

In Ghana, one junior high school has been redeveloped and 

there are plans to expand the programme to more schools.

Provision of healthcare

Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals concerns 

ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, at 

all ages. At Wilmar, we also consider health and well-being 

to be essential components of sustainable development. In 

addition to providing healthcare to workers and their families, 

our clinics in the oil palm plantations are also open to local 

communities and provide them with basic healthcare services. 

Our employees are also highly supportive of our healthcare 

programmes. For example, our Malaysian operations organise 

annual blood donation drives to support local hospitals.

Harvesting season in Myanmar takes place during November to April, and therefore, financial year runs from 1 April to 31 March each year 

(not based on calendar year). As a result, production and yield data for Myanmar for the 2017 financial year is taken as at 31 March 2018.

5 

From year 2017, reporting will be based on area burnt within concession boundaries and area burnt outside concession boundaries (within 

5km radius).

14 Figures exclude number of women and men in temporary workforce as gender data was not available for temporary workers.

15 In the course of compiling data for our Sustainability Report 2015, we discovered that methodology for collating incidents differed across 

our sites, with some sites using national or regional thresholds for reporting, and others using international Occupational Safety and Health 

Administration (OSHA) standards. Due to these inconsistencies, we have excluded LTIFR reporting in our 2015 report. We resumed LTIFR 

reporting in our Sustainability Report 2016 after setting a more consistent reporting standard across the Group.

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a multi-stakeholder standard for sustainability reporting, providing guidance on 

determining report content and indicators. GRI is the first and most widely adopted global standard for sustainability 

reporting and has been designed to enhance the global comparability and quality of information on environmental and 

social impacts, thereby enabling greater transparency and accountability of organisations. Sustainability reporting based 

on the GRI Standards should provide a balanced and reasonable representation of an organisation’s positive and negative 

contributions towards the goal of sustainable development.

There are two options for preparing a report in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core and Comprehensive. This report 

has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option.

Management’s and Board of Directors’ 

responsibility

The Management is responsible for the preparation of the Subject 

Matters in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Sustainability Reporting Standards. The Board has ultimate 

responsibility for the company’s sustainability reporting.

The Management is responsible for the collection and presentation 

of the information and for maintaining adequate records and internal 

controls that are designed to support the sustainability reporting 

process. For the purpose of the Sustainability Report 2017, there 

are no legally prescribed requirements relating to the verification of 

sustainability reports.

Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and other ethical 

requirements of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority 

(ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public 

Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), which is founded 

on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional 

competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.

Our firm applies Singapore Standards on Quality Control 1 of the 

Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and, accordingly, 

maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including 

documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with 

ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 

regulatory requirements.

We have the required competencies and experience to conduct this 

assurance engagement. Our professionals have both the required 

assurance skills and experience in the applicable subject matters 

including environmental, social and financial aspects.

Auditor’s responsibility 

Our responsibility is to form a conclusion on Wilmar’s preparation of 

the Subject Matters based on our work. We performed our work in 

accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 

3000 (ISAE 3000) (Revised) – Assurance Engagements other than 

Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (the “Standard”). 

This Standard requires that we plan and perform our work to form 

the conclusion. The extent of our work performed depends on our 

professional judgment and our assessment of the engagement risk.

Our review was limited to the information on the select indicators set 

out within the Report from 01 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 

and our responsibility does not include:

•	

Any	work	in	respect	of	sustainability	information	published	

elsewhere in Wilmar’s annual report, website and other 

publications,

•	

Sustainability	information	prior	to	01	January	2017	and	

subsequent to 31 December 2017, and

•	

Management’s	forward	looking	statements	such	as	targets,	plans	

and intentions.

Reporting criteria

As a basis for the assurance engagement, we have used the criterion 

of “Accuracy” as defined by GRI and specific criteria determined 

by Wilmar as being relevant for its sustainability performance. We 

consider these reporting criteria to be relevant and appropriate to 

review the Report.

Assurance standard used and level of 

assurance

Our limited assurance engagement has been planned and performed 

in accordance with the ISAE 3000 Assurance Engagement Other Than 

Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information.

A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries and 

applying analytical and other review procedures. Our procedures 

were designed to provide a limited level of assurance and as such 

do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a 

reasonable level of assurance. 

The procedures performed depend on our judgement including the 

risk of material misstatement of the specific activity data, whether 

due to fraud or error. While we considered the effectiveness of 

Management’s internal controls when determining the nature and 

extent of our procedures, our review was not designed to provide 

assurance on internal controls. We believe that the evidence we 

have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 

conclusion.

What we did to form our conclusions

We designed our procedures in order to state whether anything has 

come to our attention to suggest that the Subject Matters detailed 

above has not been reported in accordance with the reporting criteria 

cited earlier. In order to form our conclusions, we undertook the steps 

below:

1. 

Inquiries with Wilmar’s Sustainability team to:

a. 

Understand principal business operations, 

b. 

Appreciate key sustainability issues and developments,

c. 

Map out information flow for sustainability reporting and the 

relevant controls,

d. 

Identify data providers with their responsibilities, and 

e. 

Recognise the likelihood of fraud on the sustainability 

information.

2. 

Undertake multiple visits to:

a. 

Wilmar’s headquarters in Singapore and

b. 

Wilmar’s selected plantations and mills in West Sumatra.

3. 

Interviews with and clarifications sought from employees and 

Management in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana and 

Nigeria (e.g. Sustainability team, Human Resources, Estate 

Managers) to understand key sustainability issues related to 

the selected indicators, collection processes and accuracy of 

reporting. For Myanmar, Australia and New Zealand, clarifications 

were secured through emails. 

4.	

Conduct	process	walk-through	of	systems	and	processes	for	data	

aggregation and reporting, with relevant personnel to understand 

the quality of checks and control mechanisms, assessing and 

testing the controls in relation to the concerned subject matters.

5. 

Obtain documentation through sampling methods to 

verify assumptions, estimations and computations made by 

Management in relation to the concerned subject matters. 

6. 

Conduct general media research (including reports from 

reputable NGOs) on the concerned subject matters.

7. 

Checking that data and statements had been correctly 

transcribed from corporate systems and / or supporting evidence, 

in relation to concerned subject matters.

Observations and areas for improvement

Our observations and areas for improvement will be raised in a 

separate report to Wilmar’s Board of Directors and Management. 

These observations and areas for improvement do not affect our 

conclusion on the aforementioned Subject Matters included in the 

Sustainability Report.

Other matters

Our responsibility in performing our limited assurance activities 

is to the Management of Wilmar only and in accordance with the 

terms of reference agreed with them. We do not accept or assume 

any responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person or 

organisation. Any reliance any such third party may place on the 

Report is entirely at their own risk.

Conclusion

Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, 

nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 

information in the Report was not presented fairly, and calculated in 

all material respects in accordance with the reporting criteria detailed 

above.

Glossary

Bagasse

The dry, fibrous matter that remains after the extraction of juice from sugarcane. 

Biodiversity 

The diversity (number and variety of species) of plant and animal life.

Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) 

The amount of oxygen used when organic matter undergoes decomposition by micro-organisms. Testing for BOD is done 

to assess the amount of organic matter in water.

Bonsucro

A global standard for responsible sugarcane production aimed at creating lasting value for people, communities, businesses, 

economies and eco-systems in all cane-growing areas.

CO2 Equivalents 

Carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 eq) provide a universal standard of measurement against which the impacts of releasing 

(or avoiding the release of) different greenhouse gases can be evaluated.

Efﬂuents 

Water discharged from one source into a separate body of water, such as mill process water.

Extraction rate 

The amount of oil extracted from oil palm fruit at a mill. Crude palm oil (CPO) is extracted from the flesh; palm kernel oil 

(PKO) from the nut.

Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) 

FPIC is the principle that a community has the right to give or withhold its consent to proposed projects that may affect 

the lands they customarily own, occupy or otherwise use.

Fresh fruit bunch (FFB) 

Bunch	harvested	from	the	oil	palm	tree.	The	weight	of	the	fruit	bunch	ranges	between	10	kg	to	40	kg	depends	on	the	size	

and age.

High Conservation Values (HCVs) 

HCVs are biological, ecological, social or cultural values which are considered outstandingly significant or critically important, 

at the national, regional or global level.

High Carbon Stock Approach (HCS Approach)

The HCS Approach is a methodology to avoid deforestation in land development, initially developed in a partnership 

between Greenpeace, TFT and Golden Agri-Resources. The approach stratifies the vegetation on an area of land into 

different classes using analyses of satellite images and field plot measurements. Each vegetation class is validated through 

calibrating it with carbon stock estimates in the above-ground tree biomass.

Independent Director 

According to the Listing Manual of SGX, an independent director is one who has no relationship with the company, its 

related corporations (i.e. a corporation that is the company’s holding company, subsidiary or fellow subsidiary), its 10% 

shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s 

independent business judgement with a view to the best interests of the company.

Independent smallholder 

Small growers with less than 50 hectares, which are self-financed, managed, and equipped and are not bound to any one mill. 

They may deal directly with local mill operators of their choice or process their own palm oil using personal or community 

manual palm oil presses (more common in Africa).

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 

IPM is the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures 

that discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are 

economically justified and reduce or minimise risks to human health and the environment. IPM emphasises the growth of 

a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms.

(POME) applied to land as a fertiliser.

Mass Balance 

The Mass Balance system allows for mixing of RSPO certified and non-certified palm oil at any stage in the supply chain 

provided that overall company quantities are controlled. The mass balance model is constructed in such a way that volumes 

of RSPO certified product shipped will never exceed volumes received by the end-user.
