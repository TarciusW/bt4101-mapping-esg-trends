It gives me great pleasure to present the Sustainability Report of Vicplas International Ltd (“Vicplas” 

or “the Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, “the Group”) for the financial year ended 31 July 

2018 (“FY2018”). 

In our first Sustainability Report, we highlight the progress and achievements of the Group over 

the previous 12 months, with particular focus on our commitment to working alongside our valued 

stakeholders to build a sustainable business based on our resilience, adaptability and innovation. 

It is our belief that building a sustainable business is vital to our continued success and that we must be

as our financial performance. 

Our responsibility to society is to ensure that sustainable practices are incorporated into every link of 

our value chain and we are committed to the principles laid out in our Corporate Sustainability Policy. 

We must meet the needs not only of our customers, employees and the community we operate in, but 

also those of our environment and our future generations. This report provides detail about how we 

have met our responsibilities with our key stakeholders during FY2018 and beyond.

CORPORATE PROFILE

3.1 

Vision and Mission

Our mission is to multiply profitability through continuous technological innovation and product 

and service improvements. This will help us to fulfil our commitment to provide optimum value 

to our customers, business partners and shareholders. We believe it is our responsibility to do so 

on a sustainable long-term basis.

3.2 

Governance

Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) oversees all corporate governance and operational matters 

relating to our business. For corporate sustainability, the Board is supported by the Corporate 

Sustainability Committee (“CSC”) which is chaired by our Group Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) 

and includes designated senior executives. CSC provides leadership and approval over corporate 

sustainability matters such as Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) plan, community 

investment and environmental initiatives. 

Supported by CSC, our Corporate Sustainability Champion (the “Champion”) is our Subject 

Matter Expert (“SME”) in the area of corporate sustainability, and pro-actively raises awareness 

through education and training across the organisation. Through the Corporate Sustainability 

Work Group (“CSWG”), our Champion engages the business functions in collectively executing 

the CSR plan, identifying and managing the Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 

Factors as well as engaging sustainability stakeholders. The business functions provide back-to-

back assurance over the quality of information for sustainability reporting. 

7




3.3   Ethics and Compliance

As a listed company on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), we adopt the Code of Corporate 

Governance as required in the listing rules. Our corporate governance framework covers ethics 

and compliance through a Code of Conduct as well as action guidelines which are to be adhered 

by the officers and employees across the organisation. 

Every new employee is introduced to our Code of Conduct and our policies on ethics and 

compliances which includes areas such as anti-corruption. Communication channels, such as 

Whistle-Blowing Policy, are in place to enable all employees and individuals engaged in business 

activities to report complaints of unethical behaviour. We have a dedicated officer who maintains 

a register of incidences regarding ethics and compliance issues and escalates to the management 

where appropriate.

4 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS

We believe corporate social responsibility is a key driver towards long-term sustainability. It 

is one of the core values in our corporate culture. Through our action today, we play a part 

in influencing the environment for our future generations. Through integrating the notion of 

sustainability in our business, we ensure that our business strategy and operations are in line 

with a long-term vision towards a conducive and sustainable future.

4.1   Sustainability Management Framework

In July 2017, we took the initiative to establish our sustainability reporting framework. We 

performed an analysis on our business and operation models as the basis for our stakeholder 

mapping and materiality assessment. Through our analysis, we identified five key stakeholder 

groups within our sustainability context and their respective material issues are shown in this 

report.

4.2   Key Stakeholders and Material Issues

We have regular reviews, assessments and feedback on ESG topics. Key to this is our Enterprise 

Risk Assessment and Quality Management System which entails the identification, assessment 

and documentation of material risks and corresponding internal controls. Such material risks 

include fraud and corruption, environmental, health and safety, and human capital risks which 

are ESG-relevant. We are continuously improving the adequacy and effectiveness of our processes 

in response to changing business and operation environment.

We identify and review material issues that are most relevant and significant to us and our 

stakeholders. For external stakeholders, priority is given to issues important to society and 

applicable to us. Then, we prioritise our sustainability efforts and report issues that are most 

material to the business and stakeholders.

4.3   Alignment with International Initiatives

4.3.1      Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Established in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations (“UN”), the General Assembly 

occupies a central position as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ 

of the United Nations. Comprising all 193 Members of the United Nations, it provides a 

unique forum for multilateral discussion of the full spectrum of international issues covered 

by the Charter. It also plays a significant role in the process of standard-setting and the 

codification of international law.

On 25 September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the 17 SDGs to end poverty, protect 

the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. 

Each goal has specific targets to be achieved over the next 15 years, until 2030. Although 

the SDGs are primarily aimed at governments, they represent an important opportunity 

for businesses to also act for a more sustainable world. We will use SDGs as one of the 

guiding principles for our sustainability initiatives. We acknowledge that our participation 

in reaching the SDGs has room for improvement. As we advance on our sustainability journey, 

we will continue to assess our alignment with the SDGs and, whenever possible, redirect our 

internal priorities and sustainability strategy to more effectively and comprehensively address 

the goals.

4.3.2      United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)

UNGC is a United Nations initiative to encourage businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable 

and socially responsible policies, and to report on their implementation. The UNGC is a 

principle-based framework for businesses, stating ten principles in the areas of human 

rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. Below are the references of our report 

to the 10 principles of the UNGC.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Key to the success of our sustainability programme is regular and up-to-date communication 

about our CSR policies and activities to all our stakeholders, and the provision of appropriate 

feedback mechanisms so that we can monitor and evaluate how we are doing and explore new 

possibilities stimulated by stakeholder responses. We see our sustainability reports as being a 

critical component of this continuous cycle of communication and evaluation.



15




5.1   Protecting Our Environment for the Future Generations

5.1.1      Our Approach

We are committed to maintaining and building on the same stringent environmental policies 

and standards across the Group. We continually seek new and innovative ways to reduce 

the environmental impact of our products and services while maintaining the highest levels 

of quality. We recognise our responsibility to protect the environment for the health and 

wellbeing of future generations. 

5.1.2      Reduction of Carbon Footprint

We recognise that the effective management and monitoring of carbon footprint can reduce 

operating costs, raise brand profile, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholder 

value. Our carbon footprint is measured in terms of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission. 

However, GHG emission is an absolute measure of how much carbon dioxide equivalent 

(CO2e) is emitted. Our GHG emission is predominantly indirect (Scope 2) emission. We 

have insignificant direct (Scope 1) emission, and we do not include the GHG emissions 

generated by our suppliers (Scope 3).

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our GHG 

emission efficiency index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. To this 

end, we have set a target for GHG emission efficiency improvement of 12% from our 2018 

level by 2030. Our target for GHG emission improvement is 1% per year. Although various 

business lines and operations account for different percentage of GHG emissions across the 

organisation, they all support this target and have aligned our environmental objectives 

accordingly. 

In FY2018, our GHG emission efficiency index stands at 4.95. Please refer to section 6.1 

for information on how this index is computed. FY2018 is our first year of sustainability 

reporting. FY2018 will be used as reference against which the performance will be measured 

in subsequent years. 

16




5.1.3      Reduction of Paper Consumption

All our employees are urged to minimise paper wastage at work. For example, double-sided 

printing is set as a default, lower grammage paper is used for daily printing, and blank sides 

of unneeded single-sided copies are used for printing drafts. Paper re-use and recycling 

habits are also cultivated through initiatives such as our in-house reminders posted near the 

copy machines. All waste paper from our own offices is collected for recycling. Furthermore, 

we encourage all employees to adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with an 

aim to further reduce paper consumption. 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our paper 

consumption index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over time. To this end, we 

have set a target for a paper consumption improvement of 12% from our 2018 level by 2030. 

Our target for paper consumption improvement is 1% per year. 

Although various business lines and operations account for different percentage of paper 

consumption across the organization, they all support this target and have aligned our 

environmental objectives accordingly. 

In FY2018, we consumed total of 5,481 kg of paper, 100% of which are Forest Stewardship 

Council (FSC) certified. Our paper consumption index is 82.23. Please refer to section 6.2 

for information on how this index is computed. FY2018 is our first year of sustainability 

reporting. FY2018 will be used as reference against which the performance will be measured 

in subsequent years. 

17






5.1.4      Promoting Green Practices 

We have embraced various green practices in our business and operation. Our pipes and pipes 

fittings fully conform to the relevant Singapore Standards on Specifications for unplasticisied 

PVC pipes and fittings (“Singapore Standards”) as well as its British, Australia and Japanese 

equivalent standards. Singapore Standards are nationally recognised published documents 

established by consensus; setting out specifications and procedures for the design, use or 

performance of materials, products, processes, services and systems. 

Even though not required under the Singapore Standards, we have differentiated ourselves 

from our competitors and gone above the Singapore Standards to eliminate lead from 

our pipes and pipes fittings in accordance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances 

Directive 2002/95/EC, (RoHS 1) adopted in February 2003 by the European Union.

5.2   Caring for Our Employees

5.2.1      Our Approach

Our people are our most valuable resource and investing in their professional and personal 

well-being is vital to our business sustainability. Our goal is to establish work ethics among 

our employees, which are in line with our core values and code of conduct. They are the 

foundation upon which we build all our business initiatives and conduct our day-to-day 

activities. 

We recognise that a motivated workforce will convey a positive and powerful message 

to all our key stakeholders, such as our customers, suppliers and the community. By 

attracting, nurturing, empowering and rewarding our employees, we create an environment 

conducive for innovation and inspiration flourish to further boost our competitiveness. 

Such commitment to our employees promotes a corporate culture of passion, quality, 

excellence and trust within the organisation which reflect in our ability to create values to 

our stakeholders.

18




Our Human Resource (“HR”) management principles and policies have been developed and 

established based on fair employment practices with the goal of attracting, supporting and 

retaining a motivated workforce. Our HR policies cover key areas such as remuneration, 

benefits, health and safety and training. All HR policies are published on the group’s intranet 

which can be assessed by all employees.

5.2.2      Employment Practices

Our employment practices focus on maximising the strength of our employees by providing 

equal opportunities based on merits, and helping our employees to develop strength 

through our training and development programme. We regularly review the performance 

and development of our employees and our performance-based reward scheme provides 

guidance and motivation to our employee to perform to their potential in alignment with 

the objectives of the company.  

5.2.2.1   The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices 

We adopt best practices in HR management. Our HR practices are guided by the Singapore 

Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. The Singapore Tripartite 

Alliance comprises the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore National Employers Federation 

and National Trades Union Congress. The Tripartite Alliance has formulated guidelines on 

fair employment practice for adoption by Singapore employers regarding the recruitment, 

training, treatment and reward of employees. 

19




5.2.2.2 

Communications 

As our Company grows, effective communications across the organisation are crucial 

to ensure continuous alignment of objectives of the employees and the organisational 

objectives. We achieve this through our various communication sessions customised 

based on target employees. Communication sessions for our managers are held on a 

regular basis. 

For example, monthly managers’ meetings are held to discuss operational matters with 

additional yearly meeting to discuss high level topics like strategic business direction and 

key project reviews. 

5.2.2.3 

Employee Feedback 

We value the expertise of our employees in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their 

feedback is important in the improvement of overall management and operation of the 

organisation.

We gather feedback through various employee engagement channels, such as employee 

objective setting, performance review as well as exit interview in the case of resignations. 

In addition, there are other feedback channels for areas specific to business and function, 

such as whistle-blowing policy on control and compliance matters.

20






5.2.2.4 

Career Development and Training

We recognise that consistent and ongoing education is critical to maintaining a 

competitive, skilled, productive and motivated workforce. The training is targeted based 

on the employees’ job scopes and skills set requirements. Training topics range from 

soft skills development in areas such as communications and leadership, to technical 

programmes covering project management and office productivity tools. 

In FY2018, employees each received an average of an hour of training. We recognised that 

the training requirements vary depending on the levels of management responsibilities. 

Each senior manager registers an average of an hour of training while managerial and non-

managerial staffs receive an average of 4 hours and an hour of training respectively.

In light of changing business requirements and training methodologies, we continue to 

revise our training curriculum and programme to align with organisation’s objectives and to 

strive for effectiveness and efficiency in our training approach.



21




5.2.3      Workforce Diversity

Our business operates in three main countries; Singapore, Malaysia and China. As such, 

there is a diverse workforce with employees from various ethnic groups, religion, age and 

gender.

 

In FY2018, 385 of our employees were female, comprising 55% of our workforce, while 

318 (45%) employees were male. In terms of management function, 12 females (26%) held 

managerial positions compared to 34 males (74%), while 373 females (57%) and 284 males 

(43%) held non-managerial positions. 

The male to female ratio managerial and non-managerial positions were 34: 12 and 284:373 

respectively. From age profile perspective, there were 311 employees below 30 years old. 

The number of employees between 30 and 50 years old was 350 as compared 42 employees 

above 50 years old. Our oldest employee is 74 years old.



22






23






5.2.4						Employee	Benefits

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered by the Employment Act, which 

provides basic employment terms and working conditions including contract requirements, 

remuneration, hours of work, overtime, rest days and annual leave entitlement. We also 

comply with the local laws and regulations regarding employment in the countries where 

we operate. 

In addition to the statutory requirements, we provide beyond-compliance-level benefits to 

our fulltime employees. Examples of these benefits include paternity leave and compassionate 

leave. 

 

5.2.4.1  Retirement and Healthcare 

Our company has presence in various geographic locations where there are various local laws 

and regulations on pension and healthcare for employees. Our HR management practices 

comply with such laws and regulations. 

In Singapore, we participate in the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) personal savings scheme, 

which helps employees fund their retirement, home ownership, healthcare and education. 

Under this scheme, monthly deductions from employees’ gross salaries are paid into their 

CPF savings accounts. 

We make employer contributions to these accounts, according to rates stipulated in the CPF 

Act. In addition to CPF contributions, we provide comprehensive medical coverage for all 

employees. For more information on the CPF scheme and contribution rates, please go to 

www.cpf.gov.sg.  

24






5.2.5     Safety and Health in the Workplace

We are committed to Workplace Safety and Health and take every precaution to prevent 

occupational injuries among employees. We believe that optimum work conditions not only 

make our employees safer, but also boost morale. As an essential requirement we are in 

compliance with the Ministry of Manpower’s Workplace Safety &amp; Health Act in Singapore.

5.2.6      Individual Rights 

Respecting and protecting basic human rights is fundamental to all our operations and 

deeply ingrained in our Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees. Labour rights, 

the prohibition of discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, prohibition of 

forced and child labour, and workplace health and safety are all strictly observed within the 

work environment and discrimination and harassment of any kind is not tolerated at our 

company. 

We also respect our employees’ rights to freedom of association as well as their membership 

of trade unions and other professional bodies. 

In FY2018, none of our workforce was covered by a collective bargaining agreement; 

no incidents of forced labour, child labour or young workers were identified across the 

organisation, and no human rights-related grievances have been reported.

 

25




5.3   Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs

5.3.1     Our Approach

We are committed to providing quality products with the highest level of product safety and 

customer satisfaction is important to us. We are focused on customer service excellence 

and continuous improvements in the quality and safety of our products. Open and frequent 

communication and responsive feedback are ingrained into our interaction with the 

customers. 

In addition to service excellence, we attach enormous importance to data privacy. We have 

process and controls in place over confidential and sensitive data related to our customers 

such as contracts. We are certified under the ISO 9001 standard for quality management 

systems. The certification has helped us to improve our internal processes and the quality 

of our products.  

5.3.2      Customer Feedback and Satisfaction

We listen to our customers and take their opinions very seriously. We collect customer 

feedback through various channels including our website, regular customer survey, and 

our customer service personnel. These feedbacks are analysed and actioned upon for 

improvements. Customer compliments are also tracked so that we can monitor where we are 

getting things right and cascade positive feedback to our employees and the management. 

5.3.3      Service Quality and Safety

Reliability and quality of our products are of paramount importance to us. Health and safety 

of our customers is always our priority. We have in place a set of key quality assurance 

processes and standards, such ISO 9001:2015, ISO13485:2016, to ensure compliance with 

regulations and international standards. Ultimately, we aim to foster a ‘Safety First’ culture 

through employee training and quality control so as to eliminate product safety or recall 

incidents.

26




5.3.4      Data Safety and Privacy 

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of great priority to us. We have 

processes and controls in place for handling and communicating sensitive and confidential 

information of our customers such as contracts, customer orders and service delivery orders. 

Our information security policies ensure our customers’ data are managed in accordance 

to the level of confidentiality. We strictly observe all local laws and internal regulations 

applicable to personal information protection.

5.4 

Partnering Our Suppliers

5.4.1      Our Approach

We strive to encourage our suppliers to adopt sustainable business practices. We recognise 

that we are only at the beginning of our journey to integrate sustainable business practice 

throughout our supply chain. However, we are committed to collaboration with our 

suppliers to gradually increase transparency and minimise our indirect environmental and 

social impacts.

5.4.2      Supplier Selection

Our new suppliers are carefully selected through our supplier selection process. When 

selecting our new suppliers, we examine criteria such as financial health, quality of 

products and services, as well as competitiveness of pricing. In addition, we also take into 

consideration the overall sustainability policies adopted by our suppliers. Our final decision 

on supplier selection is based on the overall assessment which takes a balanced view across 

all selection criteria.

27




5.4.3      Supplier Review 

We regularly review the performance of our key suppliers. During the key supplier review 

process, we engage with our key suppliers to communicate our expectations and feedback. 

Such review process ensures that our key suppliers’ services and products are aligned to our 

business requirements and sustainability objectives.

5.5 

Supporting Our Community

5.5.1      Our Approach

We believe in giving back to society and contributing to the community. Our CSR programme 

is geared towards helping the community and underprivileged in meaningful ways. Our 

engagement programmes encompass financial and practical support in carefully selected 

communities, through donation, voluntary activities and fundraising.

PERFORMANCE TABLE

6.1 

Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions 

GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2); the underlying measures for direct and indirect 

CO2 emissions calculation are electricity consumption in kilowatt Hours (kWh) and fuel 

consumed. The electricity and fuel we purchase are both from non-renewable sources.

Our business and function grow over time; the GHG emissions and electricity consumption 

vary. To ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity consumption 

measures over time, we create a GHG emission index and electricity consumption index for our 

performance monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions and electricity consumption for 

the size of our activities. 

We normalise the amount GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of our 

revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is 

measured in t-CO2 per SGD million and the electricity consumption index is measured in kWh 

per SGD million. 



29




6.2   Paper Consumption

We capture the data for paper consumption by how many reams of paper used where one ream is 

equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across various paper 

sizes, such as A3 and A4 papers, we measure the paper consumption by the weight of paper used 

which is adjusted for the various sizes and quality of papers.

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We devise 

a paper consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the paper 

consumption for the size of our activities. We normalise the amount of weights of paper consumed 

by the amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. The paper 

consumption index is measured in kilograms per million SGD. 



6.3	

Employment	Profile



We have not set a target for this ratio as our employees are hired based on their suitability in 

relation to the job scope and not gender. We will monitor and report our employment profile 

every year.

30




6.4   Employees Engagement and Training

We have not set a target for training as it varies and is dependant on the employees’ job scope 

and skills set requirements. We will monitor the average training hours per employee every year.

Supplier Screening for Sustainability Criteria

This is the first year of our report and we have started to include sustainability as a criterion 

when screening new suppliers on top of existing criteria such as financial health, quality of 

products and services, and competitiveness of pricing. We will continue to screen new suppliers 

for sustainability and report every year. 

We have not set a target for community contribution as we have always been committed to 

participate in local events, charitable and worthy causes. We will monitor our community 

contribution every year.
