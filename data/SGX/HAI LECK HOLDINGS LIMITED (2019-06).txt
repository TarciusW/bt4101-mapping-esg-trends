2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 

CEO’S STATEMENT 

 

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS, 

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Hai Leck 

Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), 

I am pleased to present our sustainability report 

for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 

(“FY2019”). 

 

Bearing in mind the importance of being able to 

sustain the viability and profitability of the Group 

for the long-term, we have continued to evaluate 

and monitor the environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) factors that are key to the 

sustainability of the Group’s operations. 

 

FY2019 has been a challenging year for our 

industry. Nonetheless, we remained mindful of the 

need to look beyond the immediate challenges 

and continued to invest in our people, safety and 

productivity in order to secure the future of our key 

stakeholders. 

 

We share in the global community’s concerns 

over climate change and actively play our part to 

ensure that our operations do not bring harm to 

the environment and personnel involved. 

 

Closer to home, we have not overlooked the need 

to cultivate a more tolerant and inclusive society 

and have participated again in the annual SPD 

Charity Walk held on 1 September 2019. 

 

We strongly believe that our people are our most 

important assets. I am heartened to see the unity 

and resilience that our people has shown and 

thank them for their hard work and dedication. 

 

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank 

all our stakeholders: shareholders, customers, 

employees, suppliers, bankers and business 

partners for the support given through the years. 

The Group looks forward to being able to 

contribute to the well-being of all stakeholders for 

many years to come. 

 

 

Cheng Yao Tong 

Chief Executive Officer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“Despite the challenges 

faced, we remain resilient 

and continue to build on our 

strong foundation.”

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 

We have zero tolerance where workplace safety 

is concerned, and this is a culture that we actively 

cultivate within the Group. 

 

To maintain our target of a zero accident 

workplace, we have implemented a robust 

workplace safety and health management system 

that is BS OHSAS 18001 compliant. We have also 

been certified to have attained bizSAFE Level Star 

which is the highest certification level accorded by 

the Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) Council. 

 

In line with our culture of zero tolerance where 

safety is concerned, we believe that everyone is 

responsible for their own safety and the safety of 

others. To inculcate this culture right from the start, 

each new hire is required to attend the necessary 

safety 

induction 

courses 

tailored 

to 

their 

respective scope of work, during which workplace 

hazards and at-risk areas are highlighted. They 

are also issued with standard personal protective 

equipment 

as 

well 

as 

specialised 

safety 

equipment suited to their nature of work. External 

training courses and all medical examinations 

required under the Workplace Safety and Health 

Act are carried out by qualified service providers. 

 

Best safety practices are regularly shared in order 

to continuously improve on our safety standards. 

Recent accidents in the industry or near misses 

are periodically shared as learning points and to 

serve as reminder of the importance of safety at 

our workplace. To further reinforce the importance 

of workplace safety, we regularly conduct safety 

campaigns or actively participate in campaigns 

organised by our customers. 

 

In fact, safety is so deeply ingrained into our 

corporate culture that compliance with the Group’s 

safety requirements and safety awareness form 

part of our performance appraisal. 

 

Our safety performance record for FY2019 and 

the financial year ended 30 June 2018 (“FY2018”) 

are as shown below:

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 

 

Our people are one of the most important and valuable resources to us. To ensure successful execution of 

our work, we need employees with a wide range of experiences and qualifications, who will bring different 

perspectives with them. 

 

Hence, the Group advocates equal opportunity, as well as racial, gender and age diversity. Employment and 

promotion are based on merit, regardless of their gender, race, age, religion and marital status. 

 

Our employee profiles by gender, age and nationality as well as ratio of basic remuneration of women to 

men are presented below:

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

 

We 

dispose 

of 

waste 

in 

a 

safe 

and 

environmentally sound manner in accordance with 

local regulations. 

 

The waste generated by our operations are 

categorized into hazardous and non-hazardous 

waste. Due to its potential impact on the 

environment and persons who come into contact 

with them, waste disposal, particularly hazardous 

waste, is taken seriously. All wastes are collected 

by licensed waste collector to ensure proper 

transportation and disposal. 

 

The amount of waste generated is a function of 

the level of activities during the year. Nonetheless, 

the Group is careful not to procure excess raw 

materials with limited shelf life that may eventually 

end up as waste. 

 

The quantities of hazardous and non-hazardous 

waste disposed in FY2019 and FY2018 are as 

shown below: 

 

 

 

 

 

Our target is to have no violation of local 

regulations. There were no violations in FY2019. 

 

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

 

We are committed to creating wealth for our 

stakeholders. Therefore, we constantly seek 

opportunities 

for 

operational 

and 

financial 

improvements.
