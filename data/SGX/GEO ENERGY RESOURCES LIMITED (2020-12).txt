NOT LOSING SIGHT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY

THERE IS NO MORE IMPORTANT TASK THAN TO NURTURE AND REFRESH THE CULTURE AND VALUES IN AN 

ORGANISATION, ESPECIALLY AMID THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. WE CONTINUE TO KEEP SUSTAINABILITY AT THE 

HEART OF THE BUSINESS AND REINFORCE ETHICAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT INTO OUR BUSINESS.

The biggest takeaway of 2020 

is to not lose sight on the 

importance of sustainability. 

Should Geo Energy 

prioritise profits or pursue 

goals that improve society? 

Many potential investors, 

partners and even banks 

have increasingly stringent 

requirements on sustainability.

COVID-19 was an 

extraordinary window into 

the cultures of companies: 

How do companies treat 

their customers, their 

employees, and their 

communities? Beyond a 

focus on health and safety, 

investors are increasingly 

turning their focus toward 

employee and stakeholders’ 

engagement. Efforts to 

provide better benefit 

and training demonstrate 

values alignment between 

a company and its worker, 

and increased employee 

well-being and satisfaction 

can have positive return on 

investment through marked 

increases on productivity 

and decreases in turnover 

rates. Investors taking a 

sophisticated approach to 

ESG recognise that social 

issues are a lens for finding 

untapped values in a rapidly 

changing world.

Sustainability leadership 

during COVID-19 pandemic 

challenges us to re-examine 

the fundamentals that are 

critical to the sustainability 

of our business, to ask 

the right questions and 

reinforce resilience. There 

is no more important task 

than to nurture and refresh 

the culture and values in 

an organisation. While 

we prioritise the safety, 

health and well-being 

of our employees and 

stakeholders, our operations 

continue to progress in 

a safe and responsible 

manner. We will continue 

to remain vigilant and 

reinforce social distancing 

and hygiene practices, and 

ensure our operations are 

not compromised.

Support for our local 

communities remains a 

critical part of our wider 

sustainability objectives. 

We engage and support 

local communities through 

beneficial social investment 

programmes. We have 

invested over US$600,000 

towards community well-

being, particularly through 

supporting education, public 

Centre Singapore ('NCSS')  

to raise much needed

awareness and support for 

cancer research. It was great 

to get involved and bring 

positive change to lives of 

others. We will do our best 

to support charities in the 

unique work they do. 

We will continue to explore 

opportunities to enhance our 

social value contribution.

“Working as a team to do 

what is right, and not what 

is easy.” Human capital is 

important for Geo Energy. 

It's the key to the Group's 

success and is not easily 

replaceable. In order to 

analyse the capabilities and 

skills of our employees, 

we have a sound Human 

Resource Management 

system in place. Our focus is 

to recruit and retain diverse 

talents who can support our 

vision, mission and values. 

We take an active role in 

encouraging our employees 

to grow, develop and retain 

our employees by providing 

a competitive remuneration 

package aligned with their 

contributions to the Group.

We set up health and 

safety practices to identify 

risks and hazards, and to 

propose mitigation controls 

and measures. In 2020, we 

have zero fatalities and work 

related incidents in our mines.

Climate change has become 

a global phenomenon and 

is one of the most pressing 

challenges we face today. 

“CLIMATE CHANGE HAS BECOME A GLOBAL PHENOMENON AND IS ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING 

CHALLENGES WE FACE TODAY. DIRECTORS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE GOVERNANCE AND 

SHOULD GENERALLY ENSURE THAT A COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 

APPLICABLE LAWS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS OF ITS SHAREHOLDERS.”

During these unprecedented 

times, we remain committed to 

manage climate change as the 

global economy shifts towards 

a low carbon and green 

economy. We understand 

the importance of balancing 

the economic development 

needs while mindful that 

our business operates in an 

energy-intensive industry. 

We take a proactive stance 

by increasing disclosure of 

climate metrics, including 

emissions data, and setting 

targets to reduce overall 

carbon footprint, by working 

closely with our partners and 

mining services contractor. 

In 2020, we managed to 

reduce both energy and 

carbon intensity by 26%.  

We are always committed 

to manage these impacts 

through best practices, take 

operational initiatives where 

possible, and comply with 

applicable environmental 

regulations.

Directors play a crucial 

role in the governance and 

should generally ensure 

that a company conducts its 

business in accordance with 

the applicable laws, taking 

into account the interests of 

its shareholders. 

We are dedicated to 

strengthening our Good 

Corporate Governance 

('GCG') Principles and 

Framework and continue 

to focus on upholding 

principles of ethics and 

integrity in our business 

and throughout our 

operations. 

Geo Energy’s initiative and 

push for change towards 

achieving its sustainability 

goals won the Singapore 

Business Review Listed 

Companies Awards 

2020 (Metals &amp; Mining 

category). The Group also 

won the prestigious Asia 

Pacific Enterprise Awards 

(APEA) 2020 (corporate 

excellence in Mining 

&amp; Energy category) for 

demonstrating sustainable 

growth, responsible 

leadership and operational 

excellence. In recognition 

of our stakeholder 

engagement, IR Magazine 

of London in association 

with the SGX has also 

awarded a certificate for 

excellence in investor 

relations to Geo Energy in 

their IR Magazine Awards

AND FRAMEWORK AND CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON UPHOLDING PRINCIPAL OF ETHICS AND 

INTEGRITY IN OUR BUSINESS AND THROUGHOUT OUR OPERATIONS.

ABOUT GEO ENERGY

[GRI 102-1 to 102-7,  

102-13]

Geo Energy Resources 

Limited (‘Geo Energy’, 

together with its subsidiaries 

the ‘Group’) is a major 

Indonesian coal producer 

with an established track 

record in operating coal 

mines, coal production 

and selling coal throughout 

the region. Geo Energy 

commenced business in 

2008 and became a listed 

company on the Mainboard 

of Singapore Stock 

Exchange in 2012 “RE4” 

and is part of the Singapore 

FTSE-ST Index.

Starting the business as 

primarily a coal mining 

services provider in 2008, 

the Group has transformed 

to be one of Indonesia’s 

leading coal producers.  

This transition has allowed 

us to change the business 

model from operating as a 

relatively small-scale mining 

services provider in an 

environment of high capital 

expenditure and relatively 

low operational efficiency, 

with high dependence 

on owners of coal mining 

concessions, to being a 

low-cost coal producer with 

high quality coal mining 

assets. Our corporate offices 

are based in Singapore and 

Jakarta while our mining 

operations are in Kalimantan, 

Indonesia. The Group owns 

four mining concessions 

located in South and East 

Kalimantan, namely SDJ and 

TBR (actively in operation), 

BEK (re-commenced 

operations) and STT 

(undergoing drilling and 

development).

SUSTAINABILITY AT GEO ENERGY

WE HAVE INTEGRATED SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS INTO THE BUSINESS,  

THROUGH OUR STRATEGY, CULTURE, OPERATIONS AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.

"Driving and 

deriving value 

through better 

environmental 

and social 

responses has 

been part of 

Geo Energy’s 

DNA."

APPROACH TO 

SUSTAINABILITY 

Driving and deriving 

value through better 

environmental and social 

responses has been part 

of Geo Energy’s DNA 

since the founding of our 

Group. We have integrated 

social and environmental 

considerations into the 

business, through our 

strategy, culture, operations 

and decision-making 

process. This 2020 

Sustainability Report shows 

the accumulation of our work 

over the past four years. 

We understand that as a 

resource-based company, 

our impacts on society and 

the environment can be 

substantial. We constantly 

evaluate the potential 

risks and impacts from 

activities associated with 

our operations by using the 

Environmental, Social and 

Governance (‘ESG’) risk 

assessment to mitigate and 

reduce risks while creating 

value for the community and 

the environment.

"Communicating 

with our stakeholders 

is imperative. We 

ensure continual 

communication 

with regulators and 

investors, which 

is central to our 

ambition to be our 

industry’s trusted 

partner."

SUSTAINABILITY 

STRATEGY AND 

MANAGEMENT 

[GRI 102-18] 

The core of our business 

strategy is meeting 

shareholder expectations, 

creating innovative 

products and operating in 

a responsible manner. The 

Enterprise Risk Management 

(‘ERM’) Working Group is 

part of our Sustainability 

Framework, which identifies 

sustainability risks and 

opportunities across our 

operations enabling us to 

deliver tailored solutions to 

meet our objectives. 

We work collaboratively 

with stakeholders to ensure 

that we keep channels 

of communication open 

and talk about issues 

that are important to our 

stakeholders. To ensure 

the sustainability of our 

business, we recognise that 

communicating with our 

stakeholders is imperative. 

We ensure continual 

communication with 

regulators and investors, 

which is central to our 

ambition to be our industry’s 

trusted partner. 

Improving our ESG, 

our targets, and our 

commitments towards the 

community have always 

been a priority in our 

business. In 2020, we 

continue to maintain and 

improve the implementation 

of the Environment and 

Social Management System 

('ESMS') by working 

collaboratively with 

BUMA to ensure that all 

environmental, health and 

safety risks are managed 

well for the entire group. 

We also aim to improve 

our health and safety 

performance through the 

migration from OHSAS 

18001 to ISO 45001 for 

our mining contractors. 

We support and align our 

policies and management 

approach to United Nations

SUSTAINABILITY AT GEO ENERGY

WE CONDUCTED A MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT AND MAPPED OUT KEY ISSUES, WHICH WERE 

BENCHMARKED AGAINST GLOBAL INITIATIVES AND INDUSTRY PEERS IN ASIA THAT ARE  

IMPORTANT TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND GEO ENERGY.

MATERIALITY

[GRI 102-47]

We conducted our first 

materiality assessment 

in 2017 and mapped 

out key ESG issues that 

are important to our 

stakeholders and Geo 

Energy. Each material 

issue was benchmarked 

against global initiatives, 

namely the Sustainability 

Accounting Standards 

Board (‘SASB’), Dow Jones 

Sustainability Index (‘DJSI’), 

and World Coal Association. 

Benchmarking was also 

done against industry peers 

in Asia.

First, we identified the 

material sustainability issues 

relevant to our industry, 

strategy, business model 

and key stakeholders 

affected by our business. 

We then defined the issues 

and engaged with relevant 

stakeholders through direct 

interviews. Since 2017, we 

have reported our material 

issues based on the GRI 

Standards and followed the 

AccountAbility (‘AA’) 1000 

recommended guidelines. 

Criteria was set out to 

measure the material 

issue's impact and the 

importance on business 

success and its influence on 

the stakeholder's decision 

of whether to engage with 

Geo Energy. We process the 

results of the stakeholder 

engagement and produce 

our materiality matrix.

MATERIALITY 

ASSESSMENT

Our identified material 

ESG issues are still relevant 

to our business context and 

key stakeholders today. 

We identified new material 

issues and made minor 

changes in categorising 

the material issues. These 

changes include:

•  Adding a “medium” 

materiality to accurately 

reflect the materiality 

level of each ESG issue;

•  Moving Energy and 

Climate Change 

from low to medium 

materiality;

•  Including Digitalisation 

and Technology and 

Customer Relationship 

Management as the new 

materiality issues in 2020 

and categorised as low 

materiality; 

•  Merging Compliance, 

Economic Performance, 

and Ethics and Integrity 

into Corporate Governance 

and Risk Management;

•  Adding a community 

element into Human 

Rights, renaming it 

as Human Rights and 

Community Relations;

•  Renaming Employment 

Practices to Human 

Capital Management; and

•  Renaming Effluents 

and Waste to Waste

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT 

WE AIM TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH THE GCG PRINCIPLES 

AND FRAMEWORK. WE BELIEVE GCG CULTIVATES SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS.

MANAGEMENT 

APPROACH  

AND COMMITMENT

[GRI 103-1 to 103-3, 

419-1]

Geo Energy is dedicated 

to create long-term 

sustainable value for our 

business and protect our 

stakeholders’ interests.  

We implement best-

practice standards 

for GCG to safeguard 

our transparency and 

accountability. Our 

commitment and approach 

together foster a belief that 

we can create long-term 

value for our stakeholders. 

GCG is integral for a resilient 

corporation and enables 

it to be more transparent 

and forward-looking. It 

safeguards against fraud 

and dubious financial 

engineering, protects 

shareholders' interests and 

creates long-term value and 

returns for shareholders. 

The Board of Directors 

(‘the Board’) recognises 

the importance of risk 

management practices in 

protecting shareholders' 

interests and the Group's 

assets, as well as to minimise 

negative impacts on the 

environment and society. 

It provides reasonable 

assurance of the integrity 

and reliability of the financial 

information, and safeguards 

and maintains assets’ 

accountability.

In 2020, we sustained our 

good performance in term of 

socioeconomic compliance. 

No non-compliance notice 

was issued by the regulators 

during the reporting year. 

GCG PRINCIPLES  

AND FRAMEWORK

[GRI 102-18]

We aim to ensure 

accountability and 

transparency in our 

operations through the GCG 

principles and framework. 

Our corporate governance 

is constantly reviewed 

and evaluated to maintain 

compliance with relevant 

regulations. We believe 

GCG cultivates sustainable 

growth and value for our 

stakeholders.

We are committed to 

complying with the SGX 

Listing Rule, the Principles 

and Practice Guidance 

outlined in the Code of 

Corporate Governance 2018, 

and Indonesian laws and 

regulations. Geo Energy has 

adhered to the guidelines

PROTECTS 

SHAREHOLDERS’ 

INTERESTS AND 

CREATES LONG-TERM 

VALUE AND RETURNS 

FOR SHAREHOLDERS."

the Code 2018 in 2020, as 

confirmed by the Board. 

The Group has conducted 

a review of all operations 

and governance and 

developed an overarching 

system, the ESMS, following 

the International Finance 

Corporation (‘IFC’) 

Performance Standards 

(‘PS’). The implementation 

of ESMS was led by our 

Head of Technical and 

Engineering across our 

operations. The ESMS 

states our commitment to 

environmental and social 

management, which 

enhances the processes 

to identify, assess and 

manage our environmental 

and social risk. The Group 

also manages the material 

issues with the Code 

of Ethics and Conduct, 

Whistleblowing Policy, and 

ERM Framework.

Geo Energy strives to 

achieve the following goals

WE IMPLEMENT A CLEAR AND ROBUST ERM FRAMEWORK TO SAFEGUARD THE COMPANY AGAINST RISKS,

AND REPORTING ACROSS ALL ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS.

ETHICS AND 

INTEGRITY 

[GRI 102-16, 205-3]

Fundamentally, our 

operations are based on 

having ethics and integrity 

incorporated throughout 

our business. These 

principles are vital to 

sustaining a relationship 

with our stakeholders and 

shareholders. 

We outline the principles 

and expectations for daily 

decisions and interactions 

in our Code of Ethics and 

Conduct. We focus on 

high standards of business 

integrity to enforce our zero-

tolerance for fraud, bribery 

and corruption. Should 

any employee breach our 

anti-corruption and bribery 

policy, they shall face 

prompt disciplinary actions 

or termination, regardless of 

their role or status. 

We are proud that we have no 

confirmed cases of corruption 

and bribery in 2020.

WHISTLEBLOWING 

POLICY 

[GRI 102-16]

Our whistleblowing policy 

aims to provide an avenue 

for employees and external 

parties to raise concerns 

and offer reassurance that 

they will be protected from 

reprisals or victimisation 

for whistleblowing in good 

faith. It also outlines the 

channels where employees 

or external stakeholders 

are able to express concern 

about non-compliance 

within the operations 

and business ethics. All 

concerns raised by whistle-

blowers will be treated with 

strict confidentiality.

Our Audit and Risk Committee 

(‘ARC’) reviews significant 

reports to ensure timely and 

adequate investigation and 

resolution. This mechanism 

ensures that we continually 

maintain our business 

ethics and integrity while 

protecting our employees. 

Our ARC received zero 

whistleblowing reports 

during this reporting period.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

APPROACH 

[GRI 103-2, 103-3]

The Board and Senior 

Management oversee the 

Group's corporate governance 

and risk management. We 

implement a clear and robust 

ERM Framework to safeguard 

the company against risks. 

Our ERM Working Group 

reviews all significant control 

policies and procedures 

on an ongoing basis and 

highlights all significant 

matters, mitigating actions, 

and monitoring mechanisms 

to the ARC and the Board. 

We conduct rigorous cyclical 

annual risk identification 

and assessment, along with 

monitoring and reporting 

across all aspects of our 

operations. The steps are  

as follows: 

•  At the operational 

level, key management 

personnel of the 

respective business 

units, who are the risk 

owners, together with 

the ERM Working Group, 

identify potential risks. 

•  An annual risk workshop 

is held to prioritise 

the risks affecting the 

Group and provide 

countermeasures for 

the risks identified. 

All identified risks are 

assessed, analysed and 

prioritised by their level 

of importance. 

•  The ERM Working Group 

outlines a course of 

action to minimise the 

impact of these risks 

and the expected costs 

related to the mitigating 

actions. 

•  Each prioritised risk 

is then assigned to its 

respective Risk Owner, 

who is responsible for 

monitoring, controlling 

and reporting on the 

status and effectiveness 

of each risk response 

action to the ERM 

Working Group. 

•  The identified top risks 

will be presented to the 

ARC and the Board for 

review and approval 

for the adequacy 

and effectiveness 

of the Group's risk 

management and 

internal control.

Our Initiatives

KPMG, our ERM Consultant, 

assists in refreshing the 

Group's risk universe 

and facilitates workshops 

with key stakeholders 

(including the Board, ARC, 

Management and Heads of 

Departments) to prioritise 

key risks, discuss and 

generate the action plans to 

minimise the risks. 

Shareholders are increasingly 

looking at ESG factors 

and business growth to 

increase value and meet 

shareholders’ expectations. 

Our sustainability consultant, 

Environmental Resources 

Management Ltd, assists in 

the materiality assessment 

process and develops 

our sustainability report.

Sustainable Mining – 

Emerging Risks in  

the Future  

As risks are dynamic, we 

continuously monitor our 

operating and external 

environments to identify 

any emerging risks. Special 

attention is given to global 

and industrial trends before 

they becomes a threat and 

impact to our business. 

These emerging risks are 

discussed at the Board and 

Management levels. If the 

emerging risk poses a real 

threat, we will escalate and 

develop an appropriate 

response and mitigation 

plans. The following 

emerging risks were 

monitored closely. 

Emerging risks and potential impact on Geo Energy:

Emerging Risk Event 

Potential Impact 

Regulatory Risk

As Geo Energy continues to grow, 

compliance is increasingly a challenge, 

especially in an environment where laws 

and regulations are getting more stringent. 

Any change in laws or regulations may 

have an impact to our operations and for 

future investment opportunities. 

• Penalties and damage to 

reputation if non-compliant 

• Reduced profit and loss of 

business or market share 

• Decrease in the confidence of 

our stakeholders (customers, 

suppliers, investors) 

Access to Capital Risk

As the world transitions to a low carbon 

economy, investors are increasingly 

taking a sustainable approach to pursue 

their investment goals. This leads to 

an inability to raise sufficient capital 

and poses a challenge to business 

sustainability. 

• Difficulty accessing capital, 

disrupting trade financing 

• Unable to fully fund our 

operations or execute our 

business plan 

• Inability to create value for 

stakeholders (customers, 

suppliers, employees)

Strategic Investment Risk

Every business carries risks. Geo Energy 

is looking for business diversification and 

expanding its value chain to minimise  

the environmental impact. The Group  

aims to ensure the planned/targeted 

projects are completed as planned 

to sustain its business. 

• Inability 

to implement business 

strategy, business 

diversification and minimising 

environmental impact  

• Loss of business opportunities

DIGITALISATION AND TECHNOLOGY

ADOPTING DIGITAL INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IS CRUCIAL FOR GEO ENERGY TO ENHANCE OPERATIONAL 

AND RESOURCE EFFICIENCIES. WE BELIEVE DIGITALISATION AND IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY WILL BECOME 

INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN THE COAL INDUSTRY IN THE FUTURE.

MANAGEMENT 

APPROACH AND 

COMMITMENT 

[GRI 103-1 to 103-3] 

Adopting digital innovation 

and technology is crucial 

for Geo Energy to enhance 

operational and resource 

efficiencies. While 

digitalisation enhances 

efficiencies, it carries an 

inherent risk of cyber 

intrusion and cyber-attacks. 

COVID-19 has increased our 

reliance on remote working 

and as a result, cybercrime 

cases may increase, a threat 

to the organisation.

To ensure business continuity, 

we strive to provide stable 

and secure access to our

internal networks, IT and 

data systems. We ensure 

effective risk management at 

all time to avoid any potential 

disruptions to our digital 

systems or services.

While we understand the 

importance of digitalisation 

and technology especially 

in the current COVID-19 

pandemic, the coal mining 

industry is however lacking 

advancement in this area. 

At Geo Energy, we continue 

to focus on strengthening 

our risk management and 

securing our data systems to 

ensure business continuity. 

We believe digitalisation 

and improved technology 

will become increasingly 

important in the coal 

industry in the future.

MANAGEMENT 

APPROACH AND 

COMMITMENTS 

[GRI 102-9, 201-10]

Geo Energy has established 

sound processes and solid 

governance structures around 

its procurement activities. 

We provide guidance on 

all purchasing activities to 

prevent all forms of unethical 

behaviour in our procurement. 

Our procurement policies 

include:

•  Selection and assessment 

of vendors;

•  A Local Recruitment and 

Procurement Plan; and 

•  Criteria standards and 

procedures for purchases 

and payables.

Our goal is to continually 

create an independent and 

strong local communities

forward, Geo Energy aims to 

align procurement practices 

with Human Resources 

policy and the overarching 

ESMS, following IFC PS. We 

will continue to implement 

clear processes.

PERFORMANCE AND 

CASE STUDIES

[GRI 308-1, 414-2]

In 2020, SDJ and TBR sourced 

100% of the products and 

services from local suppliers 

located in South Kalimantan 

province. We have also 

improved our cost base 

through negotiations with 

our service providers. As 

most of our costs are linked 

to the coal prices and market 

conditions, we will continue 

to monitor the coal price 

movement and market 

conditions and negotiate our 

costs when necessary. 

We do not have any new 

suppliers for the reporting 

period. At Geo Energy, we 

assess our new suppliers 

using environmental and 

social criteria. We will 

continue to take actions, 

when needed, to ensure our 

suppliers are aligned with 

the Group’s policy and all 

applicable environmental 

and social regulations.

EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL ROLES IN OUR COMPANY.

MANAGEMENT 

APPROACH AND 

COMMITMENTS 

[GRI 103-1 to 103-3]

Human capital is important 

for Geo Energy. It is the 

Group’s most important 

resource and is not easily 

replaceable. Our people 

are the key to our Group’s 

success. In order to analyse 

the capabilities and skills 

of our employees, we have 

a sound Human Resource 

Management system in 

place. Our focus is to recruit 

and retain diverse talents 

who can support our vision, 

mission, and values. 

The implementation of 

Human Capital Management 

at Geo Energy is based 

on equal employment 

opportunities. We are fully 

committed to diversity and 

inclusion in our business 

and operations by providing 

equal opportunities for all 

roles in our Company. We 

recruit and develop people 

regardless of race, colour, 

religion, gender, age, and 

disability. Employees are 

hired according to their 

abilities and skills as well as 

job requirements. 

We ensure that all labour 

relations and human resource 

procedures align with the 

best practice standards and 

applicable regulations. We 

aim to ensure that we remain 

competitive regarding our 

employment practices and 

ensure that employees 

complete good quality work.

We adopt the following 

policies:

•  Company regulations 

approved by the 

Indonesia government 

for human resource 

mechanisms;

•  Human Resource policy; 

•  Whistleblowing policy;

•  Grievance mechanism 

policy; and

•  Stakeholder engagement 

policy.

Our human capital 

management goals and 

targets:

•  Encourage employees to 

have a compelling mix 

of skills, attributes and 

attitudes;

•  Encourage employees 

to develop their skills 

in order to function 

successfully in their roles;

•  Ensure equal 

opportunities in 

receiving professional 

development and career 

progression; and 

•  Tailor training and 

education based on 

roles and responsibilities 

to make the greatest 

impacts.

COVID-19 Challenges 

COVID-19 pandemic has 

impacted businesses in 

Indonesia and Singapore 

with dire effects on human 

health and economies. 

Aligning with the World 

Health Organization 

(‘WHO’) guidelines, 

a strategic objective 

of Geo Energy’s is to 

interrupt human-to-human 

transmission amongst 

our workforce to limit 

the spread of the virus. 

In 2020, we immediately 

implemented preventive 

measures, including 

employee work rotations 

and work from home 

arrangements, initiation 

of virtual meetings, self-

isolation arrangements and 

socialisation of preventative 

actions. General self-care 

and hygiene campaigns 

were also established, such 

as making hand sanitisers 

available at all of our offices 

and site locations and 

administering personal 

temperature tests for 

both staff and visitors. We 

remain committed to these 

measures to help ensure 

the health and safety of all 

employees and contractors.

Our People at a Glance 

In 2020, 171 out of 191 

employees are based in 

Indonesia, where our mining 

operations are located, with 

20 employees based in our 

Singapore office. Most of 

our employees in Indonesia 

are in non-executive 

positions, making up 66% 

of total employees. We have 

talented young individuals 

working in Indonesia, with 

29% of employees less than 

30 years old.

Due to the nature of our 

business, the female-to-

male ratio across all our 

operations is 1:2.6. This 

can be seen in our mining 

operations in Indonesia 

which altogether have  

127 males and 44 females. 

We acknowledge that 

we can contribute more 

by encouraging more 

females to join and stay 

within the fields of Science, 

Technology, Engineering 

and Mathematics (‘STEM’). 

We are committed 

to fostering a non-

discriminatory workplace 

environment. Going forward, 

we want to streamline the 

communication between 

the executive and non-

executive employee levels 

as we commit to improve 

our human resources 

performance. 

Talent Attraction  

and Retention 

We always seek talented 

individuals wherever 

we operate and provide 

equal opportunities for all 

genders based on their 

qualifications. In 2020, we 

hired 17 new employees, 

with females making up of 

24%, and our operations 

maintained an approximate 

turnover rate of 10.6% of 

total employees.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN A SAFE WORKPLACE AND ENCOURAGE SAFETY BEHAVIOUR IN ALL 

WORKERS WITHIN OUR SITES, OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS AND COMMUNITIES TO MINIMISE  

ANY ACCIDENTS, INJURIES AND OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESSES.

MANAGEMENT 

APPROACH AND 

COMMITMENT

[GRI 103-1 to 103-3]

We understand that health 

and safety are integral to  

our business operations.  

We are committed to creating 

a safe and comfortable 

working environment. It is 

our responsibility to maintain 

a safe workplace and 

encourage safety behaviour 

in all workers within our sites, 

our employees, contractors 

and communities to minimise 

any accidents, injuries, and 

occupational illnesses. 

To achieve this goal, we 

adopted the following 

policies for all of our mine 

operations: 

•  Occupational Safety, 

Health and Environment 

(‘OHSE’) policy;

•  Environmental, Health 

and Safety, and Social 

Management System 

(‘EHS&amp;SMS’); and

•  Contractor Health, Safety 

and Environment (‘HSE’) 

Evaluation policy (2018).

Our policy is a guideline  

that outlines our commitment 

to protect our employees, 

contractors and communities 

and to comply with 

applicable legislation.  

Our target is to maintain at 

zero injuries, zero accidents, 

and no or low negative 

environmental impacts.

COVID-19 Challenges

We are committed to ensure 

a healthy and safe operation 

during this COVID-19 

pandemic. We have 

implemented additional 

health and safety protocols 

in line with WHO guidelines. 

We have implemented 

preventive measures, 

including work rotation/work 

from home arrangements, 

virtual meetings and self-

isolation arrangements in 

addition to the preventative 

actions, maintain safe 

social distancing, wear 

mask and practise good 

personal hygiene. General 

self-care and hygiene 

campaigns have also been 

established, such as making 

hand sanitisers available 

at all of our offices and site 

locations and administering 

personal temperature tests 

for both staff and visitors. We 

remain committed to these 

measures to help ensure 

the health and safety of all 

employees and contractors. 

As at the date of this report, 

no significant health and 

safety disruptions were 

identified. 

Health and Safety 

Compliance and 

Management System 

At a minimum, we comply 

with all national laws related 

to health and safety to 

protect our employees. 

Our health and safety 

management programs 

are based on applicable 

local laws and regulations. 

Additionally, we follow 

international best practice 

frameworks such as 

OHSAS 18000 and other 

international standards 

that are applicable to us. 

Currently, we are adjusting 

our standards to meet ISO 

45001, the best practice 

standard in occupational 

health and safety, which will 

improve our management 

system and ensure our 

people are protected. 

Our EHS&amp;SMS identifies 

and evaluates the potential 

risks, hazards and impacts 

within our operations, along 

with the corresponding 

controls and mitigation 

measures required. It 

sets out the health and 

safety management plans, 

procedures and provisions 

on monitoring review. We 

developed the EHS&amp;SMS 

based on relevant national 

regulations, international 

financing standards such 

as IFC PS and international 

standards for management 

systems: OHSAS 18001:2007 

(Occupational Health 

and Safety Assessment 

Series). We follow the 

internal standard operating 

procedure, SOP-008-

HSE-2017, to report any 

hazards. Our employees 

perform their work in 

accordance with the Job 

Safety Analysis (‘JSA’).

As part of the implementation 

of EHS&amp;SMS, we are 

committed to conduct 

monitoring and reviewing 

processes to maintain our 

ongoing improvement, 

performance and effective 

management system in 

accordance with the Plan-Do-

Check-Act (‘PDCA’) model. 

OCCUPATIONAL

Our Contractor HSE 

Evaluation Policy (2018) 

enable us to supervise, 

monitor, oversee and 

manage our contractor’s 

selection appointment 

process and to evaluate 

the existing contractors 

appointed in terms of HSE 

requirements. 

In addition to the Contractor 

HSE Evaluation Policy (2018), 

BUMA has developed robust 

policies and programmes 

that enhance our health 

and safety management 

system, such as Joint 

Observation Safety Health 

and Environment (‘JOSHE’), 

Zero Incident Awareness 

Programme (‘ZIAP’), and 

a daily five-minute safety 

meeting before the start of 

operations (‘P5M’). BUMA 

also applies international

our strong commitment 

and health and safety 

programmes, we are proud 

to achieve zero fatalities 

and work-related injuries 

from about 3 million hours 

of work at the SDJ mine and 

about 4 million hours at the 

TBR mine in 2020. We are 

grateful that no occupational 

illnesses occurred during 

the reporting period. 

INTERNAL SAFETY 

TRAINING

[GRI 403-1 to 403-7]

Internal safety training 

sessions are often organised 

to enhance the mine area’s 

safety culture. Topics 

include basic occupational 

health and safety, first aid, 

housekeeping, working at 

heights, fire prevention and 

working near water. The 

internal training is carried 

out based on a Training 

Need Analysis according 

to each worker’s position 

and exposure to potential 

hazards. A minimum 

pass test score of 80% 

is necessary to ensure a 

proper understanding of the 

training material. 

In 2020, we conducted at 

least six training sessions, 

namely hazard identification 

and risk assessment, mining 

safety basics, occupational 

health fundamentals, 

environmental fundamentals, 

accident investigation 

techniques and work on the 

water surface. Additionally, 

BUMA also gives periodic 

refreshers on emergency 

training and special training 

to those who work in a high-

risk area.

Our safety performance 

achievement is an effort 

made together with BUMA to 

achieve zero injuries, zero 

accidents and no or low 

negative environmental 

impacts. We regularly 

monitor and measure our 

programme’s effectiveness 

and continually make 

improvements. There are 

daily safety patrols being 

performed to check on the 

mining environment and 

ensure the working area 

is safe. 

We aim to increase 

employee engagement with 

safe work procedures and 

our HSE rules.

MANAGEMENT 

APPROACH AND 

COMMITMENTS

[GRI 103-1 to 103-3, 

412-1]

We uphold strong human 

rights practices in our 

operations and supply chain. 

We respect our employees, 

mine site workers regardless 

of their status, and value 

our relationship with the 

communities where we 

operate. To achieve this 

goal, we tend to align our 

policies with human rights 

conventions such as the 

United Nations Guiding 

Principles on Business 

and Human Rights and 

the International Labour 

Organization (‘ILO’) 

Conventions. 

Mirroring our strong 

commitment to our

positive and lasting impact 

on the community where 

we operate. We believe 

that strong relationships are 

built on trust and respect. 

As such, obtaining and 

maintaining community 

support and a social 

license to operate is key 

for our continued success. 

Proactive approach toward 

community needs is always 

our focus in running our 

business. We will continue 

to carry out our corporate 

social responsibility (‘CSR’) 

programmes and maintain 

open communication 

with the community to 

understand their needs and 

provide assistance that is 

within our capacity.

We assess the impact to 

our business activities in 

relation to human rights. In 

2020, we have conducted 30 

social impact assessments 

(including gender impact 

assessments based on 

participatory processes) 

and 30 stakeholder 

engagements at  SDJ mine 

site. While our contractor, 

BUMA, has conducted an 

additional 30 social impact 

assessments (including 

gender impact assessments 

based on participatory 

processes), 30 stakeholder 

engagements, and 30 formal 

local community grievance 

mechanism processes at 

TBR mine site. We recorded 

zero non-compliance to the 

laws and regulations in the 

social and economic areas. 

STAKEHOLDER 

ENGAGEMENT 

AND COMMUNITY 

RELATIONS 

[GRI 413-1]

Our stakeholder 

engagement process is 

initiated by identifying and 

mapping relevant parties 

to form the foundation of 

our plans and strategies 

for engagement activities. 

We utilise various tools 

to engage with our 

stakeholders such as 

websites, presentations, 

and interviews.

Our engagement process 

goes beyond information 

sharing and consultation to 

provide an opportunity for 

participation, negotiation and 

understanding of partnerships. 

The two-way approach 

means that stakeholders can 

provide feedback through 

communication channels 

and ensure all feedback 

is recorded and handled 

appropriately. 

Our Stakeholder Engagement 

Plan (‘SEP’) provides 

guidance for consultation 

and information disclosure 

with all our stakeholders. 

We developed a grievance 

mechanism process for 

affected stakeholders to raise 

their concerns associated 

with our operations. This 

process is designed 

to provide an effective 

engagement and disclosure 

programme. We regularly 

monitor our grievance 

redress to identify areas 

of improvement for better 

engagement and support 

our affected stakeholders.

BIODIVERSITY

WE BELIEVE THAT MANAGING BIODIVERSITY IMPACTS NOT ONLY BENEFITS THE ECOSYSTEM BUT ALSO REDUCES 

OUR BUSINESS RISKS AND ENHANCES THE COMPANY’S COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES.

MANAGEMENT 

APPROACH AND 

COMMITMENT

[GRI 103-1 to 103-3, 

304-1]

As a resource-based 

company, it is crucial 

that we and our mining 

contractor understand the 

impacts on biodiversity, 

and it is imperative for us 

to manage our ecological 

footprint across our mining 

areas. We believe that 

managing biodiversity 

impacts not only benefits 

the ecosystem but also 

reduces our business 

risks and enhances the 

Company’s commercial 

activities. 

In addition to our ISO 

14001:2015 certified 

EMS and overarching 

ESMS across all assets, 

the following approach 

is adopted across our 

operations to manage 

biodiversity impacts:

 

•  Avoid selecting assets 

located at or near areas 

of high biodiversity value; 

and

•  Mitigate and remediate 

environmental and 

ecological impacts where 

impacts are unavoidable.

We continue to achieve the 

following goals and targets: 

•  Avoid and prevent 

negative ecological 

impacts by considering 

potential impacts when 

selecting mining sites; 

•  Maximise mitigation 

and remediation of 

environmental and 

ecological impacts, 

when impacts are 

unavoidable; and 

•  Preserve good stakeholder 

relationships and 

implement environmental 

stewardship principles.

Avoiding and preventing 

impact on biodiversity 

through asset selection

Our assets do not reside 

in nor are situated near 

protected areas or areas 

of high biodiversity 

value. They are located 

in plantation areas, where 

there is minimal impact on 

biodiversity. Nonetheless, 

we recognise that the 

nature of our operations 

will cause some negative 

impacts on biodiversity. 

With unavoidable negative 

impacts, we optimise our 

mitigating and remediating 

efforts to minimise the 

impact to as low as 

practicable. 

Mitigating and 

remediating 

environmental and 

ecological impacts that 

are unavoidable through 

land reclamation and 

rehabilitation 

We believe that a strategic 

approach to post-mining 

reclamation is the cornerstone 

to good environmental 

management in our 

industry. Our coal reserves 

are located underneath a 

previous palm oil plantation 

where we have agreed with 

the landowner to borrow, 

use, and return the land 

once mining activities are 

completed. This means 

that every time we initiate 

mining activities, we 

excavate and store the 

topsoil for land reclamation 

purposes. We are fortunate 

that due to previous land 

use activities, the impacts 

of our operations on local 

biodiversity is kept at a 

minimum.

Together with BUMA, 

we employ an industry-

standard approach in land 

reclamation by preserving 

materials above the 

coal seam or ore body. 

Once a mining activity is 

completed, we return the 

preserved materials and 

rehabilitate the landscape 

by spreading topsoil and 

cover crop to improve soil 

quality and reduce soil 

erosion.

In 2020, the total land 

reclamation for SDJ  

(87 ha) and TBR (49 ha)  

is approximately 136 ha,  

an increase of 44.6% total 

land reclaimed from the 

previous year. As part of 

our land reclamation plan, 

we proactively reclaim and 

rehabilitate land once an 

operation in a particular 

area has finished. This has 

allowed us to minimise and 

mitigate the impacts swiftly.

Geo Energy is committed 

to protect and preserve 

shared water resources. 

Our operations employ 

water and wastewater 

management based 

on best management 

standards and applicable 

water quality regulations. 

Measuring, monitoring, and 

evaluating water quality 

is a part of our standard 

procedure to ensure that 

every wastewater discharge 

complies with applicable 

water quality standards. 

All our operations source 

its water from municipal 

suppliers and a wellbore  

in our operation area.

We carefully manage 

and minimise our impact

Our daily and monthly water 

quality measurements help 

us monitor our progress. 

WATER AND 

EFFLUENTS 

PERFORMANCE 

[GRI 303-1, 303-2]

At Geo Energy, we 

understand the impact 

that water and effluents 

have on the ecosystem and 

that is why we conduct 

stringent management 

implementation to ensure 

we minimise our impacts to 

water resources. 

We conduct daily and 

monthly monitoring for our 

effluent water and apply 

treatment to ensure its water 

quality are up to standards 

before discharge. Our 

treatment process involves 

the removal of hazardous 

pollutants, normalisation of 

pH, and required treatments 

as per applicable water 

quality regulation at our 

settling pond before 

release. 

In 2020, the amount of 

water withdrawn from 

groundwater at TBR 

site decreased slightly 

by 1.53%. The water 

consumed at SDJ site almost 

doubled the consumption 

in 2019. We, together 

with BUMA, continue our 

efforts to reduce the water 

consumption at SDJ and 

TBR site. 67,078 m3 of 

water has been discharged 

and over 90% of water 

discharged to surface water 

sources were categorized 

as freshwater (≤1,000 mg/L 

Total Dissolved Solids). 

There were no significant 

water-related impacts to 

communities and there 

were no incidents of non-

compliance regarding 

the discharge limits. Due 

to the pandemic in 2020, 

our mine site workers are 

required to stay at the mine 

site and on-site quarantine 

zones were also set up for 

workers returning from 

leave. Further, our coal 

production in 2020 is 

higher compared to 2019.

MANAGEMENT 

APPROACH AND 

COMMITMENT 

[GRI 103-1 TO 103-3, 

306-2, 306-3]

Our mining operations 

deal with many forms of 

waste on a daily basis 

from liquid to solid waste. 

Our operations strictly 

implement an international 

guideline on waste 

management, in addition to 

complying with applicable 

local regulations. The 

Material Safety Data Sheet 

(‘MSDS’) is the foundation 

of our waste management 

and streamlines the 

processes in handling and 

storing the waste of our 

production by-products. 

The handling and disposal 

of our waste is managed 

by an approved waste 

management contractor 

with a strict adherence to 

industry standards and local 

environmental regulations. 

We ensure our employees 

are fully trained, with 

suitable personal protective 

equipment (‘PPE’) being 

provided to handle and 

manage hazardous and  

non-hazardous waste.

We are committed to 

continue to uphold the 

international guideline 

on waste management 

for internal operations, 

comply with all applicable 

local regulations, and 

further improve the waste 

management processes 

through MSDS.

In 2020, 517.74 tonnes 

of hazardous and non-

hazardous waste were 

generated from SDJ and 

TBR, 21.9% less than the 

previous year.

Hazardous Waste

Hazardous waste includes 

waste coal, coal gangue, 

anthracite culm and coal 

tailings. In 2020, there was 

a slight increase by 5.9% 

(426 tonnes) of hazardous 

waste compared with the 

previous year given the 

increase in production in 

2020. Together with our 

mining contractor, we have 

implemented a policy to 

minimise the hazardous 

waste from our production.

Non-hazardous Waste

Non-hazardous waste 

includes domestic waste, 

including paper, glass, wood, 

kitchen waste, and rubber. 

Our waste contractor handles 

all of our non-hazardous 

waste disposals. In 2020, 

a total of 158.74 tonnes of 

non-hazardous waste have 

been generated, a 39.3% 

decrease from the previous 

year. Together with our 

mining contractor, we have 

also implemented a policy to 

minimise the non-hazardous 

waste from our production.

operations employ energy 

efficiency measures such 

as reducing lighting and 

air conditioner usage 

and utilising energy-

efficient equipment for 

our supporting facilities. 

Energy conservation 

campaigns to improve 

awareness by reducing  

fuel consumption for  

mobile equipment are 

conducted yearly.

In 2020, there is an increase 

of 10.7% (1,642.75 TJ) of 

the total non-renewable 

energy fuel consumed at 

our SDJ and TBR mine. We 

have increased our coal 

production in 2020 and due 

to the COVID-19 pandemic, 

most of our workers resided 

at the mine site area to 

avoid human-to-human 

transmission to limit the 

spread of the virus. As such, 

more energy was consumed. 

GREENHOUSE 

GAS EMISSIONS 

PERFORMANCE 

[GRI 305-1, 305-4]

Our GHG inventory includes 

scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. 

Our fuel (diesel and LPG) 

usage and electricity usage 

are consolidated on an 

annual basis. 

Scope 1 GHG emissions 

cover direct emissions 

from owned or controlled 

sources, including diesel-

fuel consumption and the 

small amount of fuel gas 

used in supporting facilities. 

Scope 2 GHG emissions 

cover indirect emissions 

from the generation of 

purchased electricity, steam, 

heating and cooling. Scope 

2 emissions are calculated 

based on electricity 

purchased from the national 

grid for site offices. Emission 

factors of all sources are 

considered based on the 

best measurement practice 

(CDP Technical Note: 

Conversion of fuel data to 

MWh 2019; GHG Protocol 

Emission Factors from Cross-

Sector Tools 2017; Indonesia 

National Grid 2016 Data 

from Ministry of Energy and 

Mineral Resources). 

Scope 1 and scope 2 GHG 

emissions from SDJ and 

TBR mines have increased 

significantly compared to the 

previous year due to higher 

production in 2020 and our 

workers residing at the mine 

site to avoid the spread of 

the virus. We will continue 

our efforts in reducing our 

electricity consumptions by 

implementing more energy-

efficient equipment at our 

site office.
