About This Report 

 

Rich Capital Holdings Limited (hereafter referred to as “Rich Capital”, the “Company” and collectively 

with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) presents its annual Sustainability Report (the “Report”) which covers 

the Group’s sustainability practices from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 (the “Reporting Period”). 

 

The Report provides information about Rich Capital’s key sustainability topics, its management approach 

and its performance across the Group’s operations.  The Group has chosen the Global Reporting Initiative 

(“GRI”) Standards as it is a more established international sustainability reporting standard for reporting 

on a range of environmental, social and governance impacts. This Report is prepared with reference to 

the GRI Standards - “Core” option and incorporates the primary components of the report content as set 

out under Listing Rule 711B of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the “SGX-ST”) Listing 

Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist (“Catalist Rules”) and Practice Note 7A Sustainability Reporting Guide 

which provides the “Comply or Explain” requirements on sustainability reporting under Catalist Rule 711B. 

 

The Group’s material topics are identified based on their impact on our internal and external stakeholders, 

as outlined in the Key Stakeholder Engagement section.  Detailed section reference with GRI standards is 

found at GRI Standard Content Index Page.  The Sustainability Task Force of the Group, that provides 

oversight of sustainability issues has assessed that external assurance is not required as the Group has 

limited operations in the Reporting Period.  The Group will continue to strengthen the sustainability 

reporting framework in the next few years as the Group diversifies into property development, property 

investment and management, and provision of specialist construction services business.  

 

As part of our continued efforts to improve our reporting, stakeholders are welcome to send enquiries 

regarding the Report to us at general@richcapital.com.sg 

 

 

Chairman Statement 

 

The Group will continue to adopt sustainability practices relevant for the property development and 

investment business, inter alia, the assessment of joint venture partners and contractors for 

environmental, social and governance compliance as well as engaging the local communities in which the 

Group’s projects are based in. 

 

 

Governance and Statement of the Board 

 

Rich Capital is committed to contributing its fair share of shaping a sustainable society.  We have 

established a Sustainability Task Force comprising senior management currently headed by the Group 

Deputy General Manager for Projects and Operations who provides oversight over the Group’s 

sustainability objectives and progress so as to align with our strategic direction.  As part of the Group’s 

strategic formulation, the Board has considered the sustainability issues as part of its strategic 

formulation, determined the material Environmental, Social and Governance factors (“Material ESG 

Factors”) and overseen the management and monitoring of the Material ESG Factors.  

 

The Group has also adopted a precautionary approach in its strategic decision-making and day-to-day 

operations by ensuring material risks are identified and mitigated to an acceptable level. The 


Page 2 of 13 

Sustainability Task Force will continue to monitor, review and assess the environmental, social and 

governance factors relevant to the Group from time to time in future and at least on an annual basis to 

create long-term value for our stakeholders. However, under the “New Normal” amidst the COVID-19 

environment, the Task Force will step up its assessment on a half-yearly basis, or as and when there are 

new regulatory guidelines from the relevant authorities.  

 

 

Identification of Material ESG Factors and Key Stakeholder Engagement  

 

The Group’s approach to sustainability starts from the identification of key stakeholders and relevant 

factors relevant to the Group’s business. The Group regularly engages and communicates with all our 

stakeholders and updates on the Group’s developments to understand their needs and incorporate these 

into our corporate strategies to achieve mutually beneficial relationships.  

 

The feedback we receive from our stakeholders helps us to determine our material topics, areas of 

concern and relevant factors as set out below:

The relevant factors are prioritised based on the interests and requirements of key stakeholders and 

their relevance to the Group’s business, strategy and business model to identify material factors that 

are then validated internally.  

 

Material Topics and Boundaries 

 

The Group has referenced the GRI Principles for Defining Report Content to identify material topics which 

are relevant to its business and to its stakeholders. The Group will report material topics as and when 

these topics become relevant as a result of the diversification.  

 

The following table summarises the material Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) topics that are 

determined to be the most significant to the Group during the Reporting Period. As there are no 

significant changes in activities of the Company since the financial year ended 31 March 2021 (“FY2021”), 

the material topics remains the same as per FY2020.

Material ESG Factors and Targets 

Environment 

As a Group, we are committed to be a responsible partner in the communities that we operate in.  In 

order to achieve this, we ensure that our processes are safe, efficient and environmentally friendly. Our 

overarching commitment towards sustainability in all our projects includes:  

 

• 

Compliance with regulatory requirements and guidelines 

• 

Energy and water efficiency 

• 

Environmentally friendly waste management 

• 

Accessible and safe design for end-users 

• 

Ease of and safety for maintenance 

• 

Efficient structural system that boost construction productivity 

• 

Selection of sustainable materials whenever plausible 

• 

Engagement and communication with surrounding communities 

 

 

Energy and Water Consumption 

 

Rich Capital is dedicated to maintaining and upholding energy saving standards in its water and electricity 

consumption.  In our property development business, we review measures and adopt innovative 

technologies that could help us with improving environmental matters relevant to the property.  This 

includes sustainability certification, energy efficiency and water conservation, promoting responsible 

sourcing practices along the supply chain and encouraging the use of eco-friendly and recycled materials.  

 

The Group had in FY2019 introduced the following practices:  

 

At all our project sites, where energy and water consumption can be very excessive, we will encourage 

and ensure that our appointed contractors adhere to the following practices: - 

 

i) 

Using recycled water in recycle tanks or sumps at washing bays, harvesting non-portable 

water for heavy washing, 

ii) 

Selected products that meet PUB’s Water Saving Standards or WELS for our projects, 

iii) 

Insist on energy saving products, motion sensors light switches and using Low-E or Low-

Emissivity glass for our facades, and adopting Photovoltaic Solar panels were plausible. 

 

The Group targets to implement these practices across all of our project sites in the financial year 

ending 31 March 2022 (“FY2022”) as the Group’s operations at its project sites in FY2021 were minimal. 

 

Workplace Safety and Health 

The Group has requirements in place to enforce Workplace, Safety and Health Act (WSHA), not only within 

the organisation, but also to our surrounding community and neighbours.  We conducted periodic checks 

and audits for WSHA compliance, prepared Risk Assessments (RA) before any high-risk works were carried 

out, insisted on Project Quality Plans (PQP), etc. All our projects are also required by the WSH, Design for 

Safety (DfS) to identify and address foreseeable safety risks throughout the lifecycle of the projects. 

Merco Pte Ltd, a construction subsidiary of the Company has been accredited BizSafe Level 3 Risk 


Page 7 of 13 

Management by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Contractors are required to ensure that we protect 

the environment and surroundings for our projects. We ensured that the contractors that we engage have 

proper access to the worksite, full safety hoarding surrounding the site, deploying security guards, 

constructing washing bay and even Earth Control Measures (ECM) to ensure mud and earth do not spill 

out of the site together with the trucks and trailers. We also created a Public Hotline for feedback and 

issues that public may raise during construction.    

We intend for these practices to continue in the future at all work sites and that we will also making the 

necessary adjustments and improvements to suit any changes of conditions at the workplace. So far, 

there had been no reported cases of safety lapses and/or accidents in our project sites in FY2021. The 

Company also targets to achieve zero fatality, major accidents or incidents and to impose heavy fines for 

infringement of its internal safety policies in FY2022. 

 

Sustainable Supply Chain Management  

Rich Capital takes great care in selecting the right mix of supply chain in order to be aligned with the 

Group’s sustainability strategy.  In doing so, the Group seeks to ensure that its contractors, consultants 

and suppliers can produce the quality of works and fulfil the commitments to the environment, health 

and safety standards that the Group desires. Our vendors, suppliers and short-listed contractors are 

selected and pre-qualified based on several factors including face-to-face meetings, track records, 

customer feedback, project references, and financial stability. In selecting contractors, where it is 

necessary, we also pay visit to project sites to appraise the short-listed contractors’ quality of works 

delivered and check on their safety records and satisfy ourselves that they have a similar belief for the 

well-being of the environment, safety and quality. It should be noted that the Group did not carry out 

these activities in FY2021 because of the reasons set out in the Property Development project above. The 

Group will continue to conduct 100% checking and verification on our selection of major vendors, 

suppliers and contractors when all of our projects resume activity. 

 

Social Topics 

 

Diversity and Equal Opportunities 

 

The Group embraces diversity and offers employees a fair and inclusive environment. We do not 

discriminate our employees in any aspect, including gender, race, religion or age. Employees are recruited 

based on their ethics, attitude, qualification and work experience. The Group will continue to abide by 

the local labour laws in the countries that we operate in and to promote fair employment practices. All 

employees are treated with respect and there was no reported incident of discrimination from our 

employees or the relevant authorities in FY2021 and the Group targets to maintain this performance in 

FY2022.  

 

 

Labour Practices and Work Environment  

We believe that our employees are our key assets. We are committed to actively engaging our workforce, 

motivating them to work together with the Company. Spreading positivity and appreciation in the 

workplace to encourage and helps nurture happy, satisfied employees, spurring their desire to contribute 

positively to the Company.  To complement our commitment to work-health safety, we strive to build a 

workplace culture that promotes work-life balance and a healthy well-being.  


Page 8 of 13 

During the Reporting Period, the Group engaged staff on monthly meetings or whenever it is convenient 

for the purpose of giving them updates, offering opportunities for their feedback, encouraging them to 

contribute to new ideas, 2-ways interaction between management and subordinates, improvements on 

work practices, and providing on-the-spot trainings to help them perform better and more efficiently. We 

also organise small lunches or simple informal staff gatherings and bonding events. However, since Phase 

2 Heightened Alert was imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have delayed these gatherings 

until such time where social gatherings are allowed again.  

Notwithstanding the above, the Group notes that there was high employee turnover in FY2021. The 

newly-appointed management of the Company endeavours to review and improve the selection and 

hiring processes, understanding any staff issues during appraisals, to better understand and bridge the 

gaps in expectations between the employer and employees. Encouraging employees to come forward 

with any work or work environment related issues based on dialogue is expected to help to adjust or 

assist, if necessary, to create a more inclusive and corporative working environment. With this, the 

Company hopes to maintain only a core group in FY2022 until the market sentiment improves.   

 

Governance  

 

Ethics and Compliance  

 

Rich Capital is committed to conducting its business in accordance with the highest standards of business 

ethics and integrity. We work diligently to ensure that our employees understand and comply with 

applicable laws, regulations and professional codes of conduct, by informing and updating the employees 

during regular staff meetings and appraisals.  

 

 

Anti-Corruption and Whistleblowing 

 

The Group takes a strong and uncompromising stance against corruption and bribery, and does not 

tolerate any form of malpractice, impropriety, statutory non-compliance or wrongdoing by staff in the 

course of their work.  To achieve the highest standards of integrity and accountability, the Audit 

Committee (the “AC”) has incorporated a whistleblowing policy into the Company’s internal control 

procedures so as to provide a channel for staff to report in good faith and in confidence, without fear of 

adverse consequences and reprisals, concerns about suspected fraud, corruption, bribery, dishonest 

practices or other similar improper conduct matters. The objective of the policy is to ensure an 

independent investigation of such matters and appropriate follow-up action. During FY2021, the 

Company did not receive any complaints through its whistleblowing avenues. The Group targets to 

continue to ensure full compliance with its whistleblowing policy in FY2022 and to continuously improve 

the policy, where gaps and areas of weaknesses have been identified.  

 

 

 

 


Page 9 of 13 

Interested Person Transactions 

 

The Company has set out procedures to ensure that all transactions with interested persons are reported 

on a timely manner to the AC and that the transactions are conducted at arm’s-length basis, on normal 

commercial terms and will not be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority 

shareholders.  

 

The Group did not have an IPT general mandate in FY2021.  

 

Working with Reputable Partners 

 

The Group has actively searched for new investments and will continue its policy of working with 

reputable partners with its diversification into property development and property investment. The 

Group will continue to engage in meaningful partnerships with established local and overseas players in 

the property sector, and to reassess all major partners on their environmental and social impacts using 

topics from the GRI Standards with all our future projects or investments. Working with the reputable 

partners will enhance a project’s marketability and branding, which translates into higher levels of sales, 

value per sq. ft and better profitability. The assessment includes an assessment of their reputation in the 

industry, sustainability practices, disclosure on their compliance with relevant international and local laws, 

whether they have taken mitigating actions to address impacts (if any) and whether there have been fines, 

pending legal disputes, on-going litigations, sanctions or penalties against them for the past three (3) 

years.  The Group targets to maintain these assessment criteria for selecting and working with reputable 

partners in FY2022.  

 

Regulatory Compliance   

 

We encourage open communication and compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures. The Group 

adheres to the relevant labour standards and complies with local laws.  In FY2021, there were no fines or 

non-monetary sanction as a result of non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and 

environmental area except as explained below.  

 

The Board was informed in early Feb 2020 by its Indonesian partner, PT KIB that the Company’s 80% 

owned subsidiary, Oxley Batam Pte Ltd (“OBPL”) had allegedly breached its obligations under the 

Shareholders Agreement and the Joint Operations Agreement through gross mismanagement of the sales 

of the Project by selling units in the Project, without complying with an Indonesian law which provides 

that Sale and Purchase Agreements (“SPAs”) with buyers can only be entered into once building 

construction progress has reached 20%. The signing of the SPAs which was alleged to be illegal has been 

ongoing since the inception of the Project in 2016, even before the Company became involved with the 

Project through Company’s acquisition of an 80% interest in OBPL. While the Company is fully committed 

to comply with the law, the Company has requested PT OKIB to engage independent lawyer to review the 

matter and investigate the facts as well as how to conduct the refund and what are PT OKIB’s legal 

obligations and responsibilities. However, the Group has lost control over the management over PT OKIB.  

 

Moving forward, the Group’s continual commitment towards sustainability will focus on these ESG factors 

for FY2022 within the office until our projects resume operations:  

 

• 

Compliance with regulatory requirements and guidelines; and  

• 

Engagement and communication with surrounding communities 

 


Page 10 of 13 

 

Shareholders’ Meetings 

 

Rich Capital believes in encouraging shareholders’ participation at its general meetings.  It delivers the 

notices of general meetings and related information ahead of the meetings based on the requisite notice 

period, giving shareholders sufficient time to plan their schedule, to review the notices of meeting and 

the proposed resolutions and to appoint and give instructions to proxies to attend on their behalf if they 

wish.  The notices of the webcast (online) meeting was made public through Company’s announcements 

on the SGXNet.   

Shareholders were requested to submit any queries via the web-portal, or email their queries to the 

Company’s Corporate Secretary or the general email in advance prior to the general meeting, to address 

any shareholders’ queries, if any, relating to the conduct of the audit and the preparation, content of the 

auditor’s reports, or any other matters. The Company received some queries from SIAS, and were 

addressed, replied and also uploaded on to SGXNet.  

 

Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic  

 

Since the start of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic took hold of the world, pushing countries into varying 

degrees of quarantines and lockdowns globally. Economies and social activities slowed down significantly, 

with most industries taking hard hits operationally and financially. Singapore’s economy has not been 

spared and is still undergoing the challenges. COVID-19 has cast a thick cloud of uncertainty, and market 

sentiments will likely remain cautious. The Company has also looked at the following aspects amidst the 

COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Social Aspects 

During the various Heightened Alerts imposed, the Company has responded to the government’s call to 

institute safe distancing measures, embrace ‘Work from Home’ (WFH) arrangements and telecommuting 

as long as possible and necessary. Where WFH is impossible, the Company has also implemented Safe 

Entry registry and safe distancing within the office, providing face masks and hand sanitisers to the 

employees. The Company will continue to do so until it is safe and based on the Government’s guidelines 

and regulations. The Company is also encouraging all employees to take the vaccination when it is 

available to them.  

The economic downturn brought on by the crisis has also threatened livelihoods, and job security which 

is also a key concern for many employees. However, the company will maintain the employment of its 

existing employees as long as the Company is viable to keep the business going.  

As at the date of this report, there has been no material disruptions or constraints to our operations due 

to the outbreak of the pandemic, as there are currently no activities on our project sites, or have we 

breached any of the COVID-19 restrictions that may lead to penalties by the relevant authorities. 

Nevertheless, our office remains operational and undisrupted due to the safe distancing measures, as we 

are still able to operate efficiently from home, where possible.  

 

 

Business Aspects 

COVID-19 pandemic has changed the business landscape and consumer behaviour in an irreversible 

manner. Given the current economic uncertainty and the lack of investible quality property assets locally, 


Page 11 of 13 

we continue to monitor the market closely for good buying opportunities in a depressed market post 

COVID-19. The Company will conduct a fundamental review of its business and its business strategy 

against the operating environment considering all macro-environment factors. It requires the Company 

to look into the future and consider various scenarios that may play out when we emerge from the 

pandemic. The company is actively looking into the possibility of diversifying into businesses outside of 

the property industry that are less capital intensive, potentially higher margin and generating stronger 

free cash flow. We strongly believe that the coming fiscal year will be a year of change and we continue 

to position ourselves to seize any opportunity in the near term by staying lean and with the ability to 

respond quickly to market changes in this ever-changing business landscape. 

 

Financial Aspects 

The Group has completed proposed disposal of 50% of the entire issued share capital of  Rich Capital 

Realty Pte Ltd on 2 June 2020 to meet ongoing operational and funding requirements. This includes the 

review of our current property portfolio to align with our business strategy and searching for new 

opportunities in real estate development and investments. 

 

With the current dispute with the Indonesian joint venture partner and lawsuits in the Batam Project, all 

site work has stopped, hence construction expenditures have also stopped.  There is currently no material 

financial impact arising from COVID-19 to the Group. In addition, the Group has not commenced 

development of Kim Chuan Project.  

 

Environmental Aspects  

 

With the impact of COVID-19 on global change were every organisation and individual can play a part. we 

target to reduce staff carbon footprint from telecommuting and working from home, where possible. We 

have adopted an active and holistic approach in addressing the threat of climate change through 

mitigation and adapting energy efficient products in all our projects, focusing on reducing our energy 

consumption in our worksite, as well as our workplace. With work-from-home arrangements in place, we 

could contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and our carbon footprint. The daily commute 

is a big contributor to greenhouse gas emissions which are harmful for the environment. Staff commute 

daily to work releasing toxic pollutants into the atmosphere leading to poorer air and health problems. 

The Company will do its part in any way to create a sustainable and holistic approach to safeguard our 

environment and the impact on climate change.
