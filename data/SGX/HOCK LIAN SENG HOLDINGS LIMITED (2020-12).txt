BATTLING COVID-19

FY2020 was an unprecedented year with the COVID-19 outbreak 

which evolved into a global pandemic. Due to the widespread 

outbreak of COVID-19 in the foreign workers dormitories in 

March 2020, Singapore has introduced “circuit breaker” measures 

from 7 April 2020 to 1 Jun 2020. The construction activities 

grounded to a halt during this period and only in 4th quarter of 

2020 the construction work resume meaningfully.

The group has implemented strict safety protocols in compliance 

with government regulations. Trained safe management officers 

were appointed to enforce safe management measure and 

safe distancing rules. Staggering working hours is implemented 

to avoid crowding in workplace and travelling during non-peak hour.

To ensure the health and safety of our employees during 

this time, we have used virtual meetings where possible, in 

place of physical meetings with our suppliers and customers, 

minimised social gatherings within the workplaces, increased 

the frequency of cleaning of common spaces in our offices, 

implemented daily checks for temperature and respiratory 

symptoms as well as ‘SafeEntry’ requirements for all on-site 

employees and visitors.

FRAMEWORK

We prepared our report in alignment with the sustainability

reporting regulatory requirements set out in the SGX-ST Listing 

manual and with reference to the Global Reporting Initiatives 

(“GRI”) Core Reporting Options.

Our employees are key drivers

in our pursuit to enhance overall

business performance to deliver

sustainable growth.

As at 31 December 2020, Hock Lian Seng Group has 209

employees. The number of employees has reduced by 25% as 

compare to 31 December 2019. This is mainly due to the higher 

resignations as the active projects on hands has reduced, as 

such employee turnover rate in 2020 was much higher than 

target. All employees are Singapore-based. We maintain a 

diverse workforce in terms of age and gender with different 

skills and experiences which will contribute positively to the 

Company.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

We are committed to respecting diversity. We treat all employees 

fairly, with respect and dignity, irrespective of nationality, race 

or religion.

The hiring procedures are fair and non-discriminative. Staff are 

hired on the basis of merit-skills, experience or competency to 

perform the job.

We offer competitive remuneration and reward contribution, 

with performance-based pay and bonuses. Regular salary reviews 

are conducted to ensure that our remuneration package remains 

competitive. We offers all employees a comprehensive benefits 

package which includes health and welfare, maternity and

paternity leave entitlements as well as coverage under the 

Company’s group health insurance plan.

To remain competitive in the market, we recognizes the need 

to continually upskill our staff. Various training/development 

programmes are available to provide employees with the right 

skills and technical know-how to equip them to do their job 

more efficiently and effectively. Due to the disruption of the 

circuit breaker period and high turnover rate in 2020, our staff 

received about 4 hours of training in the past 12 months, as 

compare to the target of 10 hours.

Our construction activities is subject to BCA certification which 

has mandatory training requirement on professional and technical 

employees.

 

Our employees undergo a diverse range of career-building 

and learning experiences including job-specific technical skills 

training, on-the-job and professional training combined with 

executive and leadership development, technical and professional 

seminars, courses, workshops, and overseas immersion

programmes. Regulars visits to our various project sites are 

organized to share best work practices and provide insights on 

how technical challenges are overcome.

and scholarships. We offers the BCA Built Environment Under-

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

Health and Safety at the workplace is always top priority at 

Hock Lian Seng. The Board Safety Committee was established 

since 2012 to oversee and monitor the establishment and 

maintenance of the safety practices and policies of the Group. 

Given the high risk nature of construction activities, we place 

greater emphasis on health and safety training, awareness, 

procedures and general education and aim to develop a culture 

whereby safety is ingrained into each and every employee and 

subcontractor working with us.

Our approach to workplace health and safety management is 

underpinned by legislative requirements and industry safety 

standards. We are certified under OHSAS 18001 certification 

in Occupational Health and Safety Management. This certification, 

as well as the BIzSafe Star certificate, reflect our ongoing 

commitment and efforts to reduce risks and to make safety an 

integral part of our business.

Safety awareness starts with all new hires who are required 

to attend a compulsory safety induction programme during 

which workplace hazards and at-risk areas are highlighted and 

the Group’s OHSAS procedures are outlined. New employees 

are also issued with personal protective equipment including 

safety boots, helmets, goggles and ear plugs. All regulatory 

training, in addition to all medical examinations required under 

the Workplace Safety and Health Act, are carried out by external 

providers where necessary. 

From a supply chain perspective, all suppliers, contractors and 

subcontractors are required to abide by the company safety 

policy and procedures in addition to relevant laws and regulations.

Safety induction training is also provided onsite for contractors 

and subcontractors required to work in our site prior to

commencing work. Safe work procedures and risk assessments 

are also required to be in place prior to the start of a project 

and are regularly reviewed at various stages of the project.

We assess our workplace safety performance by examing

reportable injuries. In 2020, there were zero work-related fatalities 

across all our construction sites. Accident frequency rate (AFR) 

was 0 and accident severity rate (ASR), which evaluates the 

number of work days lost as a result of accidents, was 0.
