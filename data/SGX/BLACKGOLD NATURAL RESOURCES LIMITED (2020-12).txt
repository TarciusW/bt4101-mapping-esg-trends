BLACKGOLD NATURAL RESOURCES LIMITED

PAGE 01

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased

to present the fourth Sustainability Report of

BlackGold 

Natural 

Resources 

Limited

(“BlackGold” or the “Company”, and together

with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) for the

financial year ended 31 December (“FY”) 2020.

This 

report 

presents 

the 

Group’s 

policies,

practices 

and 

performance 

in 

relation 

to

sustainability and was prepared in accordance

with the SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide

and 

Global 

Reporting 

Initiative 

(Core)

Standards.

During the reporting period, the Company has

commissioned 

an 

independent 

mining

consultant, PT DMT Exploration Engineering

Consulting Indonesia, to perform an assessment

of the PT Samantaka Batubara concession.

Please refer to the published mineral resources

and reserves summary table in the 2020 Annual

Report and the published Independent Summary

Qualified Person’s Report (“ISQPR”) dated 6

May 2021. BlackGold remains committed to, and

focused on fostering its relationship with the

local communities, ensuring that the Group’s

activities are conducted in a socially and

environmentally responsible manner.

Indonesia is a nation abundant in natural

resources and has increasing energy demands

to 

fuel 

the 

country’s 

continued 

economic

growth. 

Fueled 

by 

Indonesia’s 

economic

progress, urbanisation and a growing middle

class have accelerated the need for greater

access to electricity across the archipelago.

Demand for electricity is expected to rise, as

the country’s political and business leaders

begin to prioritise energy, infrastructure and

electrification, of which coal is an integral part

of, in the immediate future.

The Group is dedicated to building a

sustainable 

business 

that 

not 

only

delivers 

long-term 

value 

to 

our

stakeholders but one which commits to

sustainable considerations in our mining

practices. To be a part of the future of

Indonesia’s 

electricity 

generation, 

we

must first protect its future. The Group

continues to uphold its pledge to provide

a safe and healthy work environment for

all our employees and contractors

Sustainability is at the center of our

business 

practices 

and 

operational

considerations. The Group places health

and 

safety 

as 

our 

utmost 

priority,

ensuring that we are environmentally

responsible in our operations and are

committed to respecting human rights

and supporting our host communities. As

the 

Group 

embarks 

on 

its 

growth

journey, we strive to operate sustainably

and 

create 

positive 

impacts 

for 

our

employees, 

as 

well 

as 

the 

local

communities. We strive to continuously

improve our sustainability performance

and 

mature 

in 

our 

sustainability

reporting journey over time. 

BlackGold is committed to complying

with the prevailing laws and regulations

of the jurisdictions in which it operates.

Where the local jurisdiction’s regulatory

requirements are less stringent than our

own, we continue to uphold the Group’s

own standards of legal and regulatory

compliance.

recognizes the significance of adopting

sustainable practices and how it could

improve 

our 

business 

operations 

and

performance. 

To 

that 

end, 

the 

Board

strikes a right balance between financial

results, 

social 

engagement 

and

environmental 

stewardship 

in 

our

strategic formulation. 

Under the guidance and oversight of the

Board, 

the 

Group’s 

management 

(the

“Management”) works closely with its staff

and employees to identify, manage and

monitor 

material 

environmental, 

social

and governance ("ESG") factors relevant to

our business and our stakeholders. The

ESG data and information provided have

not been verified by an independent third

to 

ensure

accuracy. 

The Group’s Board of Directors provides

strategic 

oversight 

for 

its 

overall

manage 

material 

risks 

across 

our

business 

activities, 

functions 

and

processes 

through 

our 

internal 

risk

management standards. This allows the

legal 

and 

financial 

impacts. 

By

incorporating risk management into all

our work processes and critical business

business 

unit 

level, 

economic,

operational as well as health and safety

issues and other risks are reported to -

BLACKGOLD NATURAL RESOURCES LIMITED

The Group takes the view that sustainable growth is contingent upon

meeting and exceeding the key expectations of our key stakeholders. The

Group’s 

material 

sustainability 

factors 

are 

those 

with 

significant

environmental, social, and governance impacts, which would influence the

assessment and decision making of the stakeholders.

The materiality analysis and assessment framework allows BlackGold to

develop a robust understanding of what issues are material to the Group’s

operations, the environment and communities that act as barriers or

enablers to achieving our business goals in the short, medium and long term.

In doing so, Management is able to prevent or mitigate these risks and gain

access to opportunities which will allow us to successfully deliver our

business strategy, while also meeting our shareholders’ expectations for

value in our developed assets.

The Group defines our material sustainability matters as ESG matters that

have significant impact to our business and stakeholders. Determination of

material aspects and priority topics for presentation in this report is based

on a 2016 GRI publication, “Defining What Matters” as guidance to strike a

balance between key issues that the Group would like to highlight and areas

in which stakeholders would prefer to have greater visibility of.

To understand what matters to our company, first we need to listen to the

voice of our stakeholders. The process begins with an internal meeting

between Management and each respective Head of Departments to identify

the materiality aspects for the report. This is followed by circulated

questionnaires to various senior members of departments such as Mining and

Exploration, Sales and Marketing, Human Resources, as well as Finance and

Accounting. The feedback from each department represent the voice of

internal stakeholders. The Group also conducted surveys to get input from

our external stakeholders including our customers, vendors, and local

communities.

In FY2020, we have reviewed the material ESG matters identified in FY2019

and are of the view that the they remain relevant in FY2020. The identified 8

(eight) key focus areas hold high relevance to the global sustainability

challenges that the Group faces throughout its operational processes. As we

embark 

on 

our 

growth 

journey, 

we 

plan 

to 

reassess 

our 

material

sustainability matters and to progressively disclose a wider and more in-

depth focus on material sustainability matters in the next reporting period.

Water usage plays an important function in the Group’s operations, and is a

scarce and valuable resources. As such, the Group recognises the importance of

managing the consumption of water at our Jakarta Head Office (“Jakarta HO”),

as well as at the PT SB mining site.

In FY2020 (FY2019: Nil), there were no reports or complaints on incidents

related to the use of water nor any environmental harm caused to water bodies

in the vicinity of our mining areas.

The Jakarta HO has deployed automatic shut off water faucets in the restrooms

to minimise water usage. At the Jakarta HO and at the PT SB Concession, water

is used effectively and recycled wherever possible to optimise the usage of

water and reduce the impact on the environment.

The Group is unable to provide a reliable estimate of its total water usage for

FY2020 as the costs and quantity of water usage at its Jakarta HO is not

separable from the monthly office rental costs, and therefore unable to be

separately monitored. At the PT SB Concession, water is drawn from natural

aquifer wells. Approximately 44,500 litre of water was used during FY2020 at PT

SB mining site office. 

Moving into FY2021, BlackGold shall continue to accelerate its search for more

ways to minimise and conserve water usage, within our permissible boundaries.

WASTE

MANAGEMENT

Waste, whether in the form of liquids, solids

or effluents, is generated in the course of our

mining 

activities. 

The 

storage,

transportation, and disposal of waste can

potentially cause serious harm to human

health and the surrounding environment,

should such activities be conducted without

the necessary resources to foresee, and

prevent any potential damage.

As 

such, 

the 

Group 

recognises 

waste

management as a material factor in our

sustainability 

reporting 

and 

strives 

to

improve our waste handling processes year

on year.

At PT SB Concession, the Group has put in

place a waste management policy at the

mining operational area. A settling pond was

constructed to eliminate acid water seepage

from the mine and ensure proper water

drainage. This pond is also used to neutralise

the pH level in the water prior to being

discharged. The waste from our mining areas

is primarily disposed of at our own facilities.

Waste 

material, 

mainly 

consisting 

of

overburden and waste rock, remains at the

site where it is generated. Reusable by-

products of our mining operations such as

topsoil are stored separately and protected

from erosion to be used for the rehabilitation

of the mined-out area.

The 

variance 

in 

the 

amount 

of 

waste

produced from FY2017 to FY2020, as shown

below, is mainly due to the reasonable wear

and tear of our equipment that requires more

regular maintenance and servicing, which in

turn leads to more waste being produced as

an unintended result. Composition of Waste

Contributon in FY2020 is 100% (FY2019:

100%) from mining operations.

Moving forward, the Group will spend more

time on researching for ways to minimise the

amount of waste generated, and to discover

new 

methods 

to 

manage 

waste 

in 

a

sustainable manner.

Electrical power is essential for every part of our lives, as such, we recognise the critical

importance of using energy with careful consideration and efficiency so as to ensure that

there will be ample energy to run our mining operations and for future generations to come.

Management is the driving force behind enforcing energy saving policies and practices set

out by the Group. This stance is emphasised to the employees regularly and sessions to

improve employees’ awareness of environmental issues are held whenever possible.

At the Group’s Jakarta HO and at the PT SB site office, electricity is to be switched off after

working hours at 6.00 pm, unless there is overtime work that requires the use of electricity.

All electronic devices are also to be switched off when not in use. The effective use of energy

will translate into greater productivity. Notwithstanding, we continually seek to maintain a

balance between energy conservation and operational efficiency. 

As shown in the table below, energy consumption during FY2017 and FY2018 are the highest

compared to FY2019 and FY2020. The Group manages to maintain energy consumption

during FY2020 below the minimum standard consumption set by the management building

of  840 kWh.

ENERGY

CONSUMPTION

As of FY2020, BlackGold Group spent a total of US$1,834 on electricity usage at BlackGold’s

Jakarta HO and US$1,303 at BlackGold’s mining site office.

Moving forward, the Company targets to produce better results, in terms of reporting

gradually decreasing energy consumption, year on year, to the best of our ability.

GHG EMISSIONS

In spite of our best efforts to minimise

any 

environmental 

effects, 

BlackGold

recognises the impacts of its coal mining

activities 

to 

the 

environment.

Nevertheless, despite this, coal will likely

continue to be the most affordable and

readily available source of energy for

decades to come, and that, is critical for

the 

growth 

and 

improvements 

in

standards 

of 

living 

for 

developing

nations.

Managing the effects of climate change is

a priority in BlackGold’s environmental

management strategy, the combustion of

coal at the PT SB Concession produces

GHG and other emissions such as dust

that may have an adverse impact on the

environment and the local communities.

At 

BlackGold, 

we 

are 

constantly

exploring 

the 

use 

of 

different

technologies in our approach to creating

a clean and safe working environment for

our 

employees 

and 

the 

 

local

communities, as well as minimizing the

effects 

of 

such 

emissions 

on 

the

biodiversity in the area.

Our open-pit mining activities emit dust

during excavation and transportation. As

part 

of 

the 

Group’s 

environmental

management strategy, we have employed

extensive 

use 

of 

dust 

suppression

techniques to control the emanation of

mining dust at the mine site. 

Catalytic converters are also installed in

all heavy equipment used at the mine site

to reduce the toxicity of gases released

into the atmosphere.

Prior to the release of this report, the

Group has approached 2 separate third-

party 

environmental 

consultants 

in

relation 

to 

the 

monitoring 

and

management of GHG Emissions. The

Group is currently in the process of

assessing and vetting the third-party

environmental consultants to come to a

consensus on which agency would be the

best fit for managing such a key material

factor.

As of FY2020, the Group has yet to

implement any systems to measure the

volume of GHG emitted, largely due to

the high costs involved that makes a

measurement system impracticable to be

installed in the Company’s current stage

of growth. 

Moving into FY2021, the Group targets to

engage 

a 

third-party 

environmental

consultants for the purpose of collecting

and analysing data on PT SB Concession’s

GHG Emissions.




It is our strong belief that long-term success is dependent on the strength and depth of our

talent pool and therefore, the Group is committed to growing and developing our human

resources. We believe in the importance of creating and maintaining a work culture that not

only improves job satisfaction but also encourages employee retention and instils motivation

in our people. 

The Group believes that it is in our best interest to invest in the career of our employees

through continuous learning. We do this by providing ample on-the-job training for

employees as and when needed, as well as exposing them to development opportunities

where they can get to undertake challenging projects or assignments. We have also sent our

employees to attend relevant courses relating to the business. BlackGold places a strong

emphasis on providing safe working conditions, recognising and awarding outstanding

performances, fostering team work and offering rewarding career growth.

The Group continuously strives to improve the performance of its people as the primary

asset in running the Company’s business. We believe that our approach to employee-

employer relationships helps attract, motivate and retain our talent. We are committed to

promoting diversity in our workforce – inspiring creativity in our business considerations

and execution. BlackGold is an equal opportunity employer, employing and promoting people

purely based on merit.

Our employees are hired on the basis of their overall qualification for the required job; we do

not discriminate based on race, nationality, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, gender

identity, disability, and political (or other) opinions. The majority of BlackGold’s employees

are male, owing to the nature of our mining activities which naturally attracts more male

workers. It is not indicative of any fom of gender discrimination at the workplace.

At BlackGold, our remuneration structures are fair and merit-based according to a person’s

knowledge, experience and ability. We ensure a fair system across all eligible employees by

conducting an annual performance evaluation, during which we discuss an employee’s

strengths and areas for career development. The Group’s Remuneration Committee also

reviews existing remuneration structures on an annual basis to ensure that the structure is

fair and appropriate in accordance with updated regulations. 

The Group ensures that all permanent employees are covered under a fair compensation and

remuneration scheme comprising of basic salary, annual incentive, medical reimburse and

job-specific allowances, without prejudice. 

The Group invests in its employees through various professional development opportunities

and training programmes for mining supervisors to develop their skillset and equip them with

the necessary knowledge for further career advancement. In addition to professional training

programmes, knowledge sharing sessions are held regularly. These sessions see each

employee conduct a short lesson in their field of expertise to share their knowledge and

experience with the team. This fosters a holistic education to each team member’s

contribution to the work place and has proven to be an effective tool in developing a cohesive

work environment.

Comprehensive Health Check-ups – conducted annually for all workers;

Emergency Preparedness Plan – a comprehensive plan to guide our workers and sub-

contractors on how to react during emergencies or accidents; 

Safety Risk Management – a guide on how to control and minimise risks in situations that

pose a safety hazard to our employees;

Safety, Health, and Environment Feedback Channels – there are prescribed procedures in

place for employees to address their concerns to Management.

Our mining operations involve using large, heavy equipment. If not managed properly, such

equipments may affect the safety of employees at the mine site. Mining activities also entail

other risks such as unforeseeable emergency situations due to mine accidents and natural

disasters. That is precisely why the implementation of sound, well-structured health and

safety systems and emergency response protocols is critical to our accident and disaster

mitigation efforts.

BlackGold regards health and safety as a critical and integral part of its operations. We

believe that the health and safety of our employees are essential for the sustainable growth of

the Group. Promoting a healthy and safe workplace has always been our highest priority, and

we remain committed to working towards the goal of zero-work related accidents.

We demonstrate our commitment to maintaining this high standard by diligently improving

the health and safety practices described in its Health, Safety and Environmental (“HSE”)

Management System. 

The principal aspects of BlackGold’s HSE Management System include:

At BlackGold, health check-ups are conducted annually for all workers as we believe in taking

care of our employees beyond their safety at the workplace. Our mining concession is located

in an area which is a distance from the city centre, as such, medical resources are limited at

the mining concession. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to us to ensure the health

aspects of our employees and their family members are taken care of as a form of social

responsibility towards the local communities which we operate near to.

To instill a strong safety culture in our operation, we conduct mandatory daily safety talks for

our employees and contractor at our mining site. The regular safety talks discuss various

safety topics such as the importance of proper Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) usage,

identification of unsafe conditions, as well as the provisions of safe and healthy working

conditions and activities. This initiative is mostly targeting our employees and contractor in

our mining site due to the higher risk their work possessed, as compared to our employees in

the office. Through the implementation of this program, Management aims to promote safe

work practices among our workers and to manifest the goal of zero work-related accidents in

our operations. 

During FY2020 (FY2019: Nil), no injuries or fatalities have occurred through the course of our

mining operations; and in line with our commitment to upholding a record of having zero

fataliites and staying injury-free, we have procured additional enhanced safety equipment for

our employees at the mine site. Moving into the future, as the production volume increases,

we shall also step up on our efforts to maintain a safe and healthy environment for our

employees to work in.

Village development 

While profitability is important, BlackGold believes in maintaining a balance between

pursuing both financial and corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) objectives. Our success is

dependent on our ability to maintain the trust and relationships with the communities at our

concession, and we foster these relationships through various sponsored activities and

programmers to help enhance their standards of living.

The local community is viewed as an integral part of the Group’s operations. As part of the

Group’s CSR efforts, priority is given to local people in our recruitment as we believe in

empowering, developing and supporting the local talent present in the relevant countries in

which we operate. We believe that community empowerment not only benefits the local

society but also advances the Group’s business through various support from the

communities to our operations. 

The Group also supports local business owners by procuring our food supplies directly from

them, and we sponsor the training of workers at the local community health centers so they

can in turn provide better health services to the community.

In FY2020 we carried out various CSR activities relating to the following areas:

In addition to the monthly financial and non-financial assistance that we provide to the local

communities neighboring our mining concession, BlackGold also sponsors certain special

annual events. During special occasions such as Ramadhan, Eid Al-Adha, Hari Raya Idul Fitri,

Lebaran Haji, and Christmas, the Group sponsored meals for the community and supported

the villagers with their celebrations financially. Amid Novel Coronavirus 2019 (the “Covid-19”)

outbreak, the Group provided masks to its employees as well as donated personal protective

equipment to the local community as its effort to curb the spread of Covid-19 around PT SB

Concession area. In FY2020, the total cost of corporate social responsibility activities of the

Group is approximately US$16,777 (FY2019: US$29,500).

PT SB Concession is located in a remote and relatively underdeveloped area, where amenities

and infrastructure are less adequate as compared to the city centers. As such, we take it upon

ourselves to improve the lives of the community through formal employment, infrastructure

investments, healthcare, and education. 

Education is also one of the Group’s key focuses when it comes to aiding local communities.

We believe that the only sustainable way to help improve the standards of living for the

villagers and their future generations is through providing opportunities for education to

keen and motivated learners, regardless of their age and proven abilities.

As our mining operations are based on the open pit mining method, the Group ensures that

we have a well-planned and strategic approach to the local communities settled in the mining

operational areas. If needed, the residents will be relocated from the designated operating

areas and the necessary assistance will be provided for the continuance and betterment of

their livelihoods. During FY2020, no relocation was required.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES


The Group is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and supports the

principles of transparency, integrity and accountability advocated by SGX-ST. The Board of

Directors of the Group recognises the importance of corporate governance and is committed

to maintaining high standards to safeguard the interests of the Company’s shareholders and

enhance corporate value and accountability by complying with the corporate governance

practices, principles and guidelines contained in the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 as

well as all regulatory reporting that is required to provide investors with an accurate,

coherent and balanced account of the Group’s performance.

BlackGold has a dedicated investor relations and corporate communications team whose

primary function is to provide investors with timely and accurate disclosures as well as

develop investor engagement initiatives. Such initiatives include one-on-one meetings with

potential investors, investor roadshows as well as regular updates to the investor relations

section of the corporate website. 

The Group, in the course of its business activities and engagement with local suppliers and

partners, is exposed to a relatively high degree of risk for corruption. Therefore, we have

made it our top priority to identify areas where corruption could occur and implement

policies and practices to prevent it.

We manage this risk by maintaining our commitment to uphold the highest standards of

ethical behaviour and communicating to all employees that the Group has a zero-tolerance

attitude to all forms of unethical practices.

Employees who suspect or are aware of an occurrence of unethical behaviour are strongly

encouraged to report to Management immediately as part of our whistleblowing policy.

The Group maintains its resolve to continue upholding stringent standards towards

corruption and unethical behaviour. In FY2020 (FY2019:Nil), there were no unethical

behaviour or offences uncovered, and we target to report the same for FY2021.

Moving forward, into and beyond FY2021, the Group shall step up on its efforts to identify

risks within its organisation in order to address them in a timely, and well-organised manner.
