4. CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE 

DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

Delivering health and wellness to communities in which we operate is the focus of our initiatives to 

contribute to the society. In 2020, we continue with our heritage of providing Tiger Balm products to 

those in need.  

Throughout the year, the Group has been supporting COVID-19 relief efforts through donations of 

Tiger Balm pain-relieving products to healthcare workers who suffer aches and pains from working 

long hours caring for their patients. In China, Singapore and Malaysia, we donated Tiger Balm products 

to medical personnel at hospitals and also at charities in Singapore such as SPD, Institute of Mental 

Health and National Kidney Foundation who are caring for vulnerable groups. Other front-liners  

from security officers to cleaners providing essential support during this difficult time also received 

Tiger Balm Care Packs. In a unanimous show of appreciation to front-liners, our factory staff in 

Singapore joined the Group’s initiatives through hand-wrapping Tiger Balm Care Packs. We also 

contributed Tiger Balm to Care Packs given out to lower-wage workers through Chemical Industries 

Employees’ Union’s “Gift from the Heart” outreach to members.  

We believe that no one should be constrained from leading an active life, and sport is a force for 

wellbeing and empowerment. Since 2015, the Group has been supporting athletes from Singapore 

Disability Sports Council (SDSC). In 2020, we sponsored the 3rd edition of Haw Par Para Sports Bursary 

to help financially-marginalised athletes sustain their sports development, enabling more to live 

healthier and active lives. We also presented the Singapore Disability Sports Awards for the second 

consecutive year to recognise the achievements of the athletes and the community behind them. 

  

Even as we cope with the impacts of the pandemic, we are mindful of other global threats that loom 

ahead, not least the loss of biodiversity and the implications for the health of our planet, and in 

correlation, the wellbeing of our communities. The Group aims to do its part to contribute to 

environmental protection and conservation. In line with our Blue Mission to inspire, educate, 

conserve, Underwater World Pattaya leveraged its unique showcase of hundreds of species of aquatic 

life enhanced with informational signage to raise awareness about environmental conservation and 

pledged its support for Earth Hour for the 11th time in 2020. As the tiger and leopard, listed among 

endangered species on Earth, are the namesakes of the Group and our company’s founders, we have 

been sponsoring the Malayan Tiger Exhibit and the Leopard Exhibit at the Night Safari and the 

Singapore Zoo since 1995 and 1986 respectively. Taking direct action to protect the environment, Tiger 

Balm collaborated with Globe Hope in Finland in 2020 to launch a collectible Tiger Balm bag upcycled 

from old in-store marketing banners. 

The United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 to achieve sustainable 

development for all by 2030. The Group contributes to five of the goals.
