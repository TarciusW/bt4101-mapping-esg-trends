Values and Principles

Supply Chain Management 

Our Group uses different dental equipment and supplies while providing our services to the 

patients. Shenyang Maotai Q &amp; M Medical Equipment Co. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of 

the Group, is engaged in the distribution and sale of dental equipment and supplies, such as 

dental chairs, ultrasound scanners, dental equipment, materials and consumables, to dental 

hospitals, clinics, distributors and laboratories.  

 

We have a Procurement Policy in place which sets our guiding principles on our suppliers’ 

assessment against our Group’s sustainability criteria. 

 

To maintain sustainable procurement practices, we have entered into long-term distribution 

agreements with major suppliers such as Shofu Dental Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.（松风齿

科器械贸易（上海）有限公司）and Shanghai Pinrui Medical Equipment Co., Ltd (上海品

瑞医疗器械设备有限公司). We have also secured distribution rights for brands such as 

Acteon-Satelec and Shofu Dental for certain provinces, such as the Liaoning Province in the 

Northern PRC. 

 

 

 

We also provide maintenance and aftersales support to our customers. Through our team of 

certified technicians, we offer maintenance and support for dental equipment and supplies 

within and beyond the warranty period, thus extending the useable lifespan of the 

equipment. We also work closely with our suppliers to ensure availability of specific parts 

and technical support for our customers in the event that they need repairs for the specific 

equipment.  

 

In addition, we have 100% stake and control of our hospitals, polyclinic and entities. As such, 

we are able to take control of the procurement of dental equipment and supplies as well as 

fine tune the individual needs of our dental centers. With this in mind, we will be better 

positioned to obtain bulk volume discounts from our suppliers and ensure continued 

sustainability of our supply chain.  






Organisational Profile

Membership of Associations and Certificates 

Aoxin Q &amp; M is committed to conduct our business in a responsible and sustainable manner. 

We have therefore aligned our operations and business practices with industry/market 

accepted principles and standards. In recognition of our efforts, we were awarded the latest 

GB/T 19001-2016/ISO 9001:2015 certification in 2018, which demonstrated our ability to be 

consistent in providing our services that meets customers and applicable statutory and 

regulatory requirements.  

In 2015, Liaoning Medical College certified that Shenyang Aoxin Q &amp; M Stomatology Branch 

Hospital had met the standards set by the college and qualities reviewed by experts in the 

field.   

In 2016, Shenyang Aoxin Q &amp; M Stomatology Branch Hospital entered into a mutual 

agreement with Liaoning Medical College which allowed the exchange of knowledge in the 

field of dentistry. Given the medical facilities and resources that Liaoning Medical College 

has and the training opportunities we provide to aspiring dental professionals, the 

agreement proved to be beneficial to both parties. At the same time, it ensured that the 

professional standards of our dental professionals and services are always improving.  

On 21 May 2018, Dr Shao Yongxin was reappointed as the Dean of Jinzhou Medical 

University. The re-appointment, for a further period of five years, is a recognition and a 

testament of his contributions to raise the standards of dental training in China. The 

Company collaborates with Jinzhou Medical University to provide instruction and training to 

students and dental professionals. Our stomatology training centre at Shenyang is also 

accredited by Jinzhou Medical University for undergraduate and post-graduate training. As a 

result, our students who graduate from this training centre with dental qualifications are 

recognised by reputable universities in China. Together with the re-appointment of Dr Shao, 

this training centre has received accreditation for a further five years. Currently, this is the 

only training centre accredited by a university in Northern China. 

In FY2018, two (2) of our dentists, Dr Sun Hailong and Dr Ma Shuyi have been awarded the 

Young Clinical Doctor Award and Clinical Expert by Jinzhou Medical University respectively. 

In addition, Dr Sun Hailong was awarded the third prize for the Root Canal Therapy 

Competition hosted by United Dental (常州益锐医疗器材有限公司), DentaLink (深圳市菲

Governance and Sustainability Approach 

18 

 

Our governance of sustainability of the Group encompasses three service lines, i) provision 

of dental services; ii) distribution of dental equipment and supplies; and iii) laboratory 

services.  

 

To enhance our corporate governance structure, we have established the Sustainability and 

Risk Management Committee (“SRMC”). In consultation with the Board of Directors, the 

SRMC oversee the development of the sustainability strategy, sustainability performance 

and monitoring, as well as the production of this sustainability report. The SRMC comprises 

of the following personnel as shown in the organisation chart below: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We have established a quality assurance team, consisting of experienced technicians and 

engineers, who routinely check the dental equipment and supplies received from our 

suppliers. We provide strong aftersales support to ensure customer satisfaction. These are 

our approaches towards risk management in daily operations. 

 

We monitor and ensure compliance with all PRC laws and regulations in relation to quality 

standards, and we constantly seek feedback from our dental professionals, patients, 

customers and relevant stakeholders.

Material Topics 

 

21 

 

In light of stakeholders’ feedback, new trends in sustainability, challenges facing the 

industry, experts’ views and our own business goals, we have considered several topics that 

are material to our stakeholders. Therefore, we focus our sustainability efforts on these 

issues. 

 

The following Materiality Matrix summarises our list of relevant sustainability topics and 

ranking results based on an assessment of economic, environmental and social impacts, as 

well as the degree of influence they have on our stakeholders’ assessments and decisions. 

The topics have been prioritized and evaluated based on our engagement process with the 

respective stakeholder groups and these will be reviewed and updated annually.  

 

We have identified an additional material topic for FY2018, Local Communities, in addition

Economic Performance 

 

22 

 

At Aoxin Q &amp; M, we strive to deliver sustainable long-term value for our stakeholders. We 

have seized the opportunity by entering the growing paediatric dentistry market and secured our 

market position as one of the leading dental service providers in the region by tapping on the 

extensive paediatric dentistry infrastructure network of Shenyang Aoxin Q&amp;M Stomatology 

Hospital Co., Ltd. (“Shenyang Aoxin”). 

Revenue from the primary healthcare segment increased by approximately 12% to RMB75.1 

million in FY2018 (FY2017: RMB67.3 million). This was mainly due to higher paediatric 

dentistry and implantology revenue from the existing hospitals and clinics, the newly 

opened Panjin Hospital and Shenyang Shenhe Aoxin Stomatology Polyclinic in May 2018 and 

revenue from Zhuanghe City Aoxin Dawei Dental Co., Ltd. which was acquired in December 

2017.  

Revenue from the distribution of dental equipment and supplies segment increased by 6% 

to RMB32.3 million in FY2018 (FY2017: RMB30.6 million), due to higher sales generated 

from dental supplies as compared to the previous year.  

Revenue from the laboratory services segment was contributed by Shenyang Qingaomei 

Oral Restorative Technology Co., Ltd. which was acquired in October 2017. The growing 

demand for private dental healthcare, especially in the areas of paediatric dental care, has 

led to an increase in our Group’s revenue. Our presence was well-received by the local 

community and this has served as an encouragement to us. We believe that with our 

expansion to other provinces, our Group’s revenue will be sustainable in the long term.  

Please refer to our 2018 Annual Report pages 7 to 9 for the financial review of our Group.  

 

Subsequent reporting for FY2019 

For FY2019, our Group hopes to maintain and ensure its financial stability. 

 


Anti-Corruption 

 

23 

 

As noted from the Clifford Chance Financial Markets Toolkit, Anti Bribery and Corruption 

Review dated June 2017, the PRC government has stepped up its anti-bribery efforts to 

reduce improper payments and other benefits received by staff in connection with the 

purchase of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and supplies, and the provision of 

healthcare services.  

We are pleased to announce that Aoxin Q &amp; M Dental Group Limited does not have any 

confirmed incidents of corruption in FY2018 and we intend to maintain this record, as stated 

in our Sustainability Report 2017. We strictly enforce our values and ensure that our stand 

on corruption is clear. We recognize the importance of upholding our values to obtain the 

trust and respect of our stakeholders. 

We take a strong stance against corruption within our Group’s employees, and will not 

hesitate to punish those found guilty.  

The Company also has in place a whistle-blowing policy, which provides proper avenues for 

stakeholders to raise concerns about actual or suspected improprieties in matters of 

financial reporting or other matters and to receive feedback on any action taken.  

Subsequent Reporting for FY2019 

Our Group aims to maintain its zero record of corruption cases and will continue to cultivate 

an anti-corruption environment by inculcating a clean and transparent working culture 

within the organisation.  

 


Energy 

 

24 

 

As part of our focus on sustainability, our Group seeks to source energy that generates the 

smallest impact on the community and the environment. Additionally, we also looking 

forward to explore renewable sources of energy in the future. We are not only committed 

to the procurement of new sources of energy but also to the use of cleaner and 

environmentally friendly sources of energy such as solar energy and also the use of energy-

saving lamps. 

Environmental protection was identified and continues to be one of the many priorities in 

China’s Government Work Plan, with plans to increase afforestation and the reduction of 

major pollutions. To help address the issue, China’s National Energy Administration has 

pushed for more wind turbines to be installed during the five-year (2016 to 2020) period. 

Over the next five years, water consumption, energy consumption and carbon dioxide 

emissions per unit of GDP should fall by 23%, 15% and 18% respectively. The number of 

days with good urban air quality is targeted to exceed 80% by 2020.

Our Group is committed to creating a green workplace for employees, such as increasing the 

use of energy saving lamps. Our Group has been using LED energy saving lamps since 2014, 

and today, all of the lamps in our Group have been replaced by energy saving lamps. The 

advantages of using these lamps are that they are energy saving, have a longer lifespan and 

are brighter than traditional lamps.  

 

Additionally, we also practice switching on our centralised air-con only when it reaches a 

certain temperature during the summer seasons, and during the winter seasons we also 

ensure that the heater temperature is maintained at an acceptable temperature to reduce 

our electricity/gas consumption.

Subsequent Reporting for FY2019 

Moving forward as an environmentally conscious company targeting to reduce our carbon 

footprint in China, we pledge to increase our sustainable efforts and communicate our goals 

to the employees of Aoxin Q &amp; M. For FY2019, we target to reduce or maintain our current 

level of energy consumption. 

 

 


Training and Education  

 

26 

 

Training and Education is instrumental in ensuring the continuous development of our 

employees to equip them with the relevant skill sets to provide quality service to our 

patients. At Aoxin Q &amp; M, we ensure that all employees are provided with the necessary 

training to assist them in acquiring the right skills and knowledge needed to perform their 

jobs effectively. New employees will be required to undergo an orientation pre-job training 

and a mandatory probation period during which their skills and experience are assessed. 

Besides on-the-job training, our new hires are required to shadow another experienced 

employee to familiarise themselves with our Group’s operations, and their specific job 

scopes. 

Subsequent to the probation period, our employees who are retained are provided with 

regular and continuous training and development. Our training programs includes internal 

trainings, training by external experts and expatriation. Our stomatology centre in Shenyang 

provides students with exciting internship programs which allow them to be employed by 

our Group once their internship period is completed and all necessary educational 

requirements have been met.

Dental Professionals 

 

Our Group has implemented customised training models to nurture our staff and enhance 

our service quality. We pride ourselves in having the relevant resources and budgets to 

allow our staffs and employees to attend several training programs that are held throughout 

the year, in order to ensure the continued education in our dental professionals. To assist 

and facilitate our dentists in their continuous efforts in keeping abreast with the latest 

technology and evidence-based practice, we are always engaging them with workshops, 

seminars and conferences. We ensure that our dental centres are fully equipped with 

qualified dental professionals with the necessary exposure and experience in different 

departments. 

 

Besides providing basic training and teaching classes, we also often encourage our dental 

professionals to share on academic platforms to exchange ideas. Additionally, our dental 

professionals also attend courses and postgraduate trainings which are held in specialised 

institutions such as China Medical University and Jinzhou Medical University. Our dental 

professionals also receive regular performance and career development review with their 

respective heads of department.  

 

Subsequent Reporting for FY2019 

As our employees are our greatest assets, we also believe that employees’ wellbeing is 

essential for the Group’s long-term efficiency and productivity.  

We believe that our employees must be healthy and happily engaged at work for them to 

maximise their potential and productivity. In Aoxin Q &amp; M, we respect and acknowledge the 

strengths and contribution of every employee. We will establish a review process to assess 

the training hours for each respective role in our organisation to ensure we have highly 

qualified staff at all levels.  

 




Occupational Health and Safety 

31 

 

 

Our dentists and nurses take on the role of direct service providers and as such, their well-

being is one of our primary concerns. In our line of work, dentists and nurses are exposed to 

several health hazards and it is our responsibility as employers to mitigate such risks.  

 

Physical Well-being 

 

Infectious hazards are the easiest to distinguish. Needles and other sharp objects, spatter, 

and aerosols can transmit viral infections that are life-threatening such as acquired 

immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatitis B. Bacterial infections are also a concern.  

 

At Aoxin Q &amp; M, we have implemented guidelines on clinic operational procedures to 

safeguard patients’ safety and health. We provide every patient with a new set of dental 

consumables such as gloves, dental bib, mouth cup, needles and dental instruments. After 

each session, this set of dental consumables will be properly disposed and replaced with a 

new set, and the dental instruments used will be sterilised. Other examples of health 

hazards include exposure to X-ray radiation during trainings, and we have posters to remind 

our employees on the safety measures.  We ensure an X-Ray signage is displayed on the X-

Ray room door in all clinics. We are subject to inspection from government officials to 

ensure we adhere to the country’s safety standards.  

 

 

 

Mental Well-being 

 

We also ensure that the mental well-being of our staff and employees are well taken care of. 

Dentists are given ample rest between treatments or surgery, to ensure that our patients 

receive the full attention and quality treatment that are rendered to them.   

 

 

 




Occupational Health and Safety 

32 

 

Mental Well-being (Cont’d)  

 

Every new dentist will be assigned to an experienced dentist to conduct on-the-job training. 

An experienced dentist is not only trained in dental technology, but also responsible for 

guiding young dentists in other areas, which includes, among others, the sitting posture of 

dentists and communication with patients. This helps to alleviate the stress and also 

provides the necessary mental support for our young dentists, so that they can provide the 

best service to our patients. We strive to reduce the stress levels of our dentists and not 

compromise on the service that we provide.  

 

Privacy 

 

Besides physical and mental well-being, we recognize privacy to be fundamental to human 

rights. The protection of patients' privacy is an industry consensus, and at Aoxin Q &amp; M, we 

take a firm stance in safeguarding the confidentiality of personal information. Our clinics 

have adopted the use of the Clinic Assist (CA) IT systems, which ensures that adequate 

controls are in place to restrict access to such sensitive information. Examples includes 

computers being connected internally to our local intranet and that our dentists can only 

view the information of patients that they have attended to.  

 

 

Subsequent Reporting for FY2019 

We continue to ensure that there are minimum serious workplace injuries encountered by 

our staff and employees, and our goal for the following years will be to ensure that our 

employees maintain strict adherence to workplace safety and guidelines.  

 

 


Local Communities 

33 

 

We are making an effort to integrate sustainability into our local communities. This is in line 

with our expansion plans, which allows us to add another fully functional clinic in Northern 

China and thus increasing our reach to our patients and raising dental health awareness.  

We have increased our presence to the paediatric dental health market as well as the 

medical insurance market. We hold free clinics and treatment sessions on “Oral Care Day”, 

which fall on 20 September every year. We also sponsored the Liaoning Children Health 

Check-up initiative, while conducting about a hundred rounds of free dental hygiene 

education and dental check-up, offering dental hygiene assistance to special needs children. 

Complemented with our marketing and media campaigns through online platforms, we are 

able to raise dental health awareness and our reputation in the region. These initiatives are 

in line with our corporate concept of giving back to the community and have allowed us to 

integrate Aoxin Q &amp; M’s values into our business decisions. 

 

We have collaborated with leading academic institutions and have conducted visits to 

kindergartens, schools and communal space to organize educational talks on oral care. With 

the relationships forged, we are collaborating with Jinzhou Medical University, to provide, 

amongst others, instruction and training to students and dental professionals. Notably, 

pursuant to such collaboration, a few of our dental centres are designated as training 

centres. 

Our stomatology training centre at Shenyang is equipped with a multimedia teaching hall, a 

multi-function simulation laboratory and a technical laboratory to ensure that aspiring 

dentists are equipped with the relevant technical skills before we allow them to practice on 

patients.  

 






Local Communities 

34 

 

Dr. Shao, who is also the Dean of Jinzhou Medical University, Shenyang Department of 

Stomatology, actively participates in the learning and growth of the undergraduates through 

conducting lectures and reviewing their progress.  

The stomatology training centre at Shenyang is also accredited by Jinzhou Medical 

University for undergraduate and post-graduate training. Students who graduate from this 

training centre with dental qualifications awarded by Jinzhou Medical University will be 

recognised by universities in China. Students will be awarded with the dental qualifications 

as shown below:  

 

Enrolment remains highly competitive and it is extremely well-received as a degree of 

choice among undergraduates in the region.  

Moving forward, we target to reach out to more people through free clinic, free dental 

hygiene education and dental check-up, offering dental hygiene assistance to special needs 

children.
