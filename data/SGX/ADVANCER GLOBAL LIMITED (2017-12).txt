MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD

With 

growing 

expectations 

and 

importance of stakeholders’ concerns 

about companies’ abilities in tackling 

global issues, our Board believes that 

embedding 

sustainability 

efforts 

in 

decision-making is integral to the Group’s 

strategy and operations.

We are delighted to present our first 

Sustainability Report which discusses 

the challenges and material issues that 

are important to our stakeholders, our 

strategy in managing these challenges 

and issues, and how we have performed 

in terms of our key performance 

indicators. 

Mr Desmond Chin

Executive Chairman

Mr Gary Chin

CEO &amp; Executive Director

“We are continually looking for new sustainable opportunities 

to strengthen our stance in contributing to a better living 

environment.”





In the pursuit of growth, we will continue 

to innovate ways to advocate a sustainable 

culture, and continuously work for the 

needs of stakeholders. Our sustainability 

efforts are led by the senior management 

who ensures that our commitments to 

sustainable development are in line with our 

business objectives. The Board has reviewed 

and set the Group’s sustainability objectives 

and targets throughout the year.

This Sustainability Report focuses on 

environmental, 

social 

and 

governance 

factors that have been carefully selected to 

be material factors, given the Group’s key 

stakeholders.

such information.

FRAUD AND WHISTLEBLOWING 

POLICY

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

To maintain sustainable economic growth and our pursuit to provide a holistic array of 

smart solutions essential to our daily lives, the Group acquired seven new subsidiaries for 

the Group’s Building Management Services and Security Services segments. As a result 

of this, understanding and maintaining the financial sustenance of the Group becomes 

increasingly vital in order to sustain healthy profits, and generate tangible value for our 

stakeholders. 

Financial Highlights

During FY2017, the Group is proud to announce that it registered a 28.2% growth in 

revenue from S$50.9 million in FY2016 to S$65.3 million in FY2017. All business segments 

registered revenue and gross profit growth. 

The cost of services increased by 24.2% from S$37.4 million in financial year ended 31 

December 2016 (“FY2016”) to S$46.4 million in FY2017, mainly due to the increase in (a) 

direct costs from newly acquired subsidiaries, (b) average direct labor cost and operating 

lease expenses for  the Group’s cleaning and stewarding projects, and (c) number of 

security officers. In spite of that, gross profit rose by 39.1% from S$13.6 million in FY2016 

to S$18.9 million in FY2017.

With the increasing demand for smart solutions and services in the real estate management 

sector, the Group is well-placed as a one-stop integrated facilities management solutions 

and services operator within the real estate sector.

The Group strives to drive growth through cross-selling and integrating our offerings to 

customers. It continues to enhance efficiency and bring effectiveness to its business 

platforms by infusing technology to enable greater convenience and satisfaction for its 

customers. With the development of the integrated facilities management solutions and 

services, the Group is able to enjoy cost benefits with increased employee productivity 

and retention despite the rising costs and challenging economy.

EMPLOYMENT

Our Group believes in investing in people 

as our employees are our most valued 

asset. We focus on providing equal access 

to opportunities for all employees. With 

equality and diversity as our ethos, we aim 

to develop our employees in all aspects so 

they are equipped to address the challenges 

in the ever-changing global landscape. 

Policies on Employment 

The Group hires a diversity of employees 

across all our various industries. We have 

established policies and practices to ensure 

transparency and fairness for staff.  

New Employee Hires and Turnover 

Rates

We believe that diversity in both gender 

and age are key to sustaining our dynamic 

workforce. Providing equal employment 

opportunities for these groups are part of 

our employment policies. 

Benefits for Full Time Employees 

The Group provides benefits to full-time 

employees in the form of Healthcare 

subsidies, tie-ups with insurance, the 

option of stock ownership under our 

Employee Share Option Scheme, disability 

coverage (WICI), and also in the form of 

parental leave. 

In addition to the government regulated 

leaves, the Group also provides childcare 

leaves for employees with children. During 

the reporting period, 4 male employees and 

2 female employees have taken Paternity 

and Maternity Leaves respectively. The 

aforementioned employees are currently 

employed under the Group.

We will continue to review our employment 

policies and strive towards greater gender 

equality and a more inclusive workforce.

TRAINING &amp; EDUCATION

At Advancer Global, we believe in ensuring our employees are adequately trained and 

continuously kept abreast of any updates in standards throughout the various industries. 

New hires are given the opportunity to learn on the job to familiarize themselves with our 

operations.

Average Training Hours &amp; Training Programs 

The yearly average training hours per employee stands at 16 hours for Operations staff 

and 12 hours at the Management level. Programs for upgrading employee skills and 

certificates are available across business segments as shown in the following table:

Performance and Career Development Review

According to our Group policy, all of our employees undergo the annual performance 

appraisal. This exercise allows the managers and employees to set expectations, and 

address potential gaps in their performance. Regular and ad-hoc feedback are also given 

to employees. These practices to develop and improve employees’ performance have 

contributed to improve organisational performance. Furthermore, these practices allows 

the Group to monitor the skill-sets of employees and to develop human capital within the 

organisation. As at reporting date, all employees have concluded their annual performance 

review for the year ended 2017.

Target setting:

To provide at least 20 hours of training and development, or cross-training yearly per

CUSTOMER PRIVACY 

Personal Data Protection Act

With the establishment of the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in 2012, personal data 

is protected in Singapore by various rules governing the collection, use, disclosure and 

care of personal data. Protection of the personal data of our stakeholders, including but 

not limited to, customers and employees are vital to our ability to conduct operations. 

We have in place a PDPA policy which includes procedures on responsible data handling, 

use of data and compliance monitoring. Customers’ data are stored in secure databases 

where we have established safeguards in place against impending IT security threats. 

These policies and procedures are disseminated to all employees and our operating 

entities in the Group. Every operational manager is expected to establish and implement 

the Group’s PDPA policy and monitor for compliance. 

Here at Advancer Global, we are very proud to announce that we have not received any 

substantiated complaints or had any breaches or loss of customer data. Our customers’ 

privacy is of utmost importance to our Group and we consistently monitor and update 

our PDPA policy in accordance with new requirements and business developments. We 

target to achieve zero complaints and PDPA breaches on a yearly basis. 

We understand that with the advancement of technology, there is a growing trend of 

concerns for individuals on how their personal data are being collected and used.
