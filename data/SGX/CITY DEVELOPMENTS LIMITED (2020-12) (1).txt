EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN 

STATEMENT



In the face of uncertainty, 

CDL’s longstanding conviction 

to Economic, Environmental, 

Social and Governance (EESG) 

integration has laid the 

foundation for our operational 

resilience and agility.

Kwek Leng Beng

Executive Chairman

Climate action: It’s time to make peace with nature, UN chief urges. United Nations News. 2 December 2020.

The Global Risks Report. The World Economic Forum. January 2021.

Dear Stakeholders,

2020 was a fitting reminder that change is inevitable and 

unceasing, especially in the face of a global pandemic 

and the climate crisis. 

UN Secretary-General António Guterres rightly puts 

it, “the state of the planet is broken”.1 While infectious 

diseases have topped the global risks chart in The 

World Economic Forum (WEF)’s Global Risk Report 

2021, climate change-related crises – to which no one is 

immune – remain as catastrophic risks.2 At CDL, we have 

long believed that the state and health of the planet are 

interconnected with the health of people and the economy. 

As the world undergoes massive transformations to tackle 

unprecedented challenges arising from the COVID-19 

pandemic, enhancing risk processes, strengthening 

capabilities and collective global action, will enable the 

world to build resilience against future disruptions.

Operational Resilience and Agility

In the face of uncertainty, CDL’s longstanding conviction 

to Economic, Environmental, Social and Governance 

(EESG) integration has laid the foundation for our 

operational resilience and agility. In 2020, we embraced 

change, pre-empted obstacles and accelerated solutions.

COVID-19 not only impacted our financial bottom line but 

also affected our global workforce, supply chains and 

communities. We had to accelerate our digital capabilities; 

apply innovative technologies and solutions; adapt to safe 

distancing measures; seek alternative revenue streams 

while focussing on the environmental, health and safety of 

all our employees and stakeholders as a priority – putting 

people at the heart of what we build. 

At the peak of the pandemic in 1H 2020, our tenants in 

Singapore and overseas, particularly in retail and F&amp;B, 

were significantly impacted, and several struggled with 

operating challenges and cash flow constraints. We 

provided more than $40 million in property tax and rental 

rebates to our tenants to help them tide through this 

difficult period. Our hospitality subsidiary, Millennium &amp; 

Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&amp;C), also rolled out support 

programmes to frontline workers and displaced guests. 

Lockdowns and restrictions across multiple regions 

resulted in temporary closures of our showflats. We 

stepped-up digital marketing efforts through virtual 

tours, online presentations and digital collaterals to 

reach out to potential homebuyers, achieving sales that 

are comparable with 2019. Across our commercial and 

retail portfolio, we swiftly implemented ever-evolving 

precautionary and safe distancing measures to manage 

business continuity.

Irrespective of the current pandemic situation, the Group 

continues to work diligently to reposition itself and 

grow its business. We have shielded ourselves through 

conservative accounting policies and have yet to unearth 

the deep value of our asset portfolio. In the meantime,

we have taken a prudent approach with regards to our 

non-cash, non-recurring impairments and a special 

working group has been tasked to explore all options 

in formulating a recovery plan. Adaptability, resilience, 

and foresight will remain our compass as we navigate 

through this storm.

Climate Change Resilience – Towards A Low 

Carbon Future

Even as we continue to enhance our operational 

efficiencies amid this health crisis, we remain steadfast 

to our environmental obligations.

When we first started our green journey in 1995, 

sustainability was not quite the mainstream political 

or business agenda it is now. Today, with 10,000 square 

metres of city space being added every minute3 and rapid 

urbanisation impacting the climate and well-being, we 

have seen the re-evaluation of how the built environment 

is engineered. 

The world has witnessed the fast-growing global 

convergence of long-term commitments to achieve net 

zero carbon, and Singapore is no exception. In addition 

to the launch of The Singapore Green Plan 2030 to 

promote sustainability across various key sectors, Prime 

Minister Lee Hsien Loong recently reaffirmed Singapore’s 

commitments under the Paris Agreement and submitted an 

enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution to achieve its 

Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy. 

Further, COVID-19 has accelerated global ESG investing 

and increased investors’ appetite for companies with 

strong fundamentals. Leading asset managers and 

financial companies such as Morningstar, BlackRock, 

Allianz, Invesco and MSCI reported that their ESG indices 

and portfolios outperformed their non-ESG counterparts 

since the onset of COVID-19.4 5

Target: Net Zero Emissions by 2050

At our core, we have a strong foundation to adjust and 

adapt to change and to turn ambition into action by 

supporting the global transition to net zero buildings and 

a low-carbon future. Along with setting more ambitious 

science-based emission reduction targets, CDL has 

become the first real estate developer in Singapore 

and the first real estate conglomerate in Southeast 

Asia to sign the WorldGBC’s Net Zero Carbon Buildings 

Commitment, pledging to achieving net zero operational 

carbon emissions by 2030 and advocating for all 

buildings to be net zero operational carbon by 2050. 

In 2020, we are honoured to remain listed in 12 leading 

global sustainability ratings and indices. I am proud of 

the management for leading CDL to be placed on 2021 

Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World 

by Corporate Knights as the top real estate company 

in the world for the second consecutive year and top 

Singapore company for the third consecutive year. CDL 

also maintained its double ‘A’s in the 2020 CDP Global 

A List for corporate climate action and water security 

and is the only company in Southeast Asia and Hong 

Kong to score ‘A’ for corporate climate action for three 

consecutive years.

The Board fully supports CDL management’s unwavering 

commitment to transforming the built environment 

and the way we design, build and manage our buildings 

towards a low-carbon, healthy and sustainable world. 

Change in the world is afoot, and prioritising ESG 

requires fundamental alteration to businesses’ 

DNA. As Singapore’s real estate pioneer and green 

building leader, CDL will continue to create impactful 

collaborations by engaging on issues that matter, 

driving long-term sustainability and value creation for 

our business and stakeholders, and building resilience 

against future crises.

GROUP CEO AND 

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR STATEMENT



In our relentless battle against 

climate change, we recognise 

the increased urgency for the 

built environment to act swiftly, 

as buildings are responsible for 

almost 40% of energy-related 

global carbon emissions and 50% 

of global material use.

Sherman Kwek

Group CEO and Executive Director

Dear Stakeholders,

2020 was one of the most unpredictable and challenging 

years in modern civilisation. With a global lockdown and 

unprecedented disruption to travel, transportation, supply 

chains, industries and production, millions of people 

lost their lives and livelihoods because of the COVID-19 

pandemic. The global economy also plunged into its 

worst recession since World War II. In addition to this 

economic crisis, 2020 experienced a climate crisis with 

one of the hottest temperatures on record1, exacerbated 

by devastating bush fires and extreme weather conditions. 

In our relentless battle against climate change, we 

recognise the increased urgency for the built environment 

to act swiftly, especially since buildings are responsible 

for almost 40% of energy-related global carbon emissions 

and 50% of global material use. Based on the 2020 Global 

Status Report for Buildings and Construction, emissions 

from building operations hit an all-time high in 2019 as 

energy demand grew, with the majority of it still met by 

fossil fuels.2 The high environmental impact of the real 

estate sector places us in a position to drive change 

towards a low-carbon and sustainable future.

An Urgency to Advance Change Resilience

We believe that change is the only way forward for 

the sustained growth of our business. Raising the bar 

on our decarbonisation efforts, CDL became the first 

real estate developer in Singapore and the first real 

estate conglomerate in Southeast Asia to sign on to the 

WorldGBC’s Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment.  

We have committed to achieving net zero operational 

carbon by 2030 for our new and existing wholly-owned 

assets and developments under our direct operational 

and management control. 

CDL has remained proactive in exploring the latest 

green building technologies and solutions. As a leading 

sustainable developer, we have continued to reduce our 

carbon footprint, prioritise energy efficiency and advance 

the global agenda for liveable and healthy spaces—a 

critical need amidst the pandemic. 

When reflecting on our achievements in 2020, I am 

confident that our strong fundamentals in sustainability, 

underpinned by our four strategic pillars—Integration, 

Innovation, Investment, and Impact—will position us well 

to tackle future challenges and drive forward a green and 

resilient recovery. There are boundless opportunities to 

tap on in the new normal, and we will continue to work 

closely with our key stakeholders to ride through this 

storm and emerge stronger.

The CDL Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint, 

which maps out our strategic goals and ESG targets, 

has remained effectively integrated into CDL’s business 

strategies and operations. We have continued to track 

and report our performance annually since 2008 and 

every quarter since 2017. In the year under review, I 

am glad to report that we are on track to achieve all 

our key ESG targets, with some areas requiring further 

examination due to the impact of COVID-19.

To address changing stakeholder expectations, tackle 

emerging risks and future-proof our business, we have 

conducted annual materiality assessments since 2014. 

Given the impact of COVID-19 on businesses (particularly 

the real estate industry), a more comprehensive 

materiality study was conducted.

Our 2020 materiality study revealed the reprioritisation 

of CDL’s top 2019 critical material ESG issues, where 

the top five priorities are now: occupational health, 

safety, and well-being; innovation; product/service 

quality and responsibility; economic contribution 

to society; and energy efficiency and adoption of 

renewables. As anticipated, COVID-19 has emphasised 

the importance of wellness, health, and safety, 

catapulting the “S” in “ESG” to the top of the list. 

This bodes well for CDL’s longstanding dedication to 

green and healthy buildings, as we have already been 

focussing on indoor air quality, ventilation, and occupant 

comfort long before the pandemic. 

We remain committed to providing investors with 

relevant and meaningful ESG information that is aligned 

with our top material ESG issues. Building on our 

robust ESG reporting, we have further expanded our 

SASB and TCFD reporting to provide greater insights 

on our comprehensive disclosures to investors. The 

GRI Standards remain the core of CDL’s blended 

sustainability report framework, which also uses IIRC’s 

integrated approach to make strong business and 

financial sense of ESG. Embracing 14 out of 17 SDGs has 

continued to help us track and report on our long-term 

strategies towards sustainable development, addressing 

the fast-growing stakeholder capitalism. 

To communicate and align our expectations to our 

internal and external stakeholders, we enhanced our 

Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, Human Rights 

Policy, and Supplier Code of Conduct—all of which have 

been integrated into our operations for over a decade. We 

also published a Biodiversity Policy and Green Building 

Policy, which are benchmarked against global best 

practices. These policies are fully integrated into our 

business operations. 

INNOVATION: Digital Transformation Towards 

Greener, Healthier and Smarter Buildings 

Innovation has become key to the long-term resilience of 

businesses in the new normal. As a frontrunner in smart 

building solutions, CDL takes pride in developing strategic 

low-carbon buildings for over two decades. With innovation 

identified as our top ESG issue from 2017 to 2019, we have 

intensified our search and application of viable innovations 

and technologies to reduce our carbon footprint.

CDL’s strategic R&amp;D partnership with the NUS School of 

Design and Environment since 2017 has served us well. 

In 2020, the NUS-CDL Smart Green Home developed 

an Acoustic Friendly Ventilation Window prototype that 

reduces noise while achieving air change efficiency of 

up to four times more than conventional windows. Such 

innovative experimental studies on smart green building 

features will help CDL to set benchmarks in building 

innovation and sustainable development. 

Accelerating our shift towards renewable energy, we 

partnered with SERIS to apply for a Solar Competitive 

Research Programme in 2020 to testbed cost-effective 

high-power density Building-Integrated Photovoltaics 

(BIPV) modules with the potential for implementation 

at CDL’s properties. Another partnership with SERIS 

in late 2020 was to pilot printed bifacial BIPV panels 

at City Square Mall as a testbed for more efficient PV 

installations. 

Keeping a pulse on the latest innovation trends, CDL 

remains an active investor in PropTech venture capital 

funds such as Fifth Wall and Dragonrise Capital. We also 

actively explore PropTech solutions such as digiHub, an 

in-house digital platform that focusses on predictive and 

integrated facilities management solutions, and Pupil, 

a real estate AI measurement startup which uses 3D 

spatial data to measure real-world interiors.

With increased demands for safety and wellness, 

we leveraged innovative technologies such as UVC 

disinfection robots to create a safe environment for 

building occupants while increasing operational efficiency 

and minimising exposure risk for frontline staff.

The CDL eMall was launched to increase sales for our 

retail tenants from City Square Mall, Palais Renaissance 

and Republic Plaza through an online retail presence.  

CDL has also embraced digitalisation, launching more virtual 

tours of our Singapore and UK properties and allowing 

homebuyers to view our properties anytime, anywhere. 

Digitalisation and decarbonisation are drivers for our 

transformation. With a focus on customer- and digital-

centric solutions, CDL will continue to nurture an 

innovative culture within the organisation while also 

prioritising our communities’ health and well-being.

INVESTMENT: Building Leverage for Our Future

CDL Group’s performance for FY 2020 was affected by the 

combination of COVID-19’s impact on the global hospitality 

sector and losses in China, resulting from a weaker 

operating environment and policy changes to the real 

estate sector. The Group reported a loss after tax and non-

controlling interest of $1.9 billion for FY 2020 (FY 2019: 

GROUP CEO AND 

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR STATEMENT

PATMI of $564.6 million). The results reflected significant 

losses attributable to its joint venture investment in 

Sincere Property Group in China and impairment losses 

for its hotels and investment properties, and allowance for 

foreseeable losses for development projects, with global 

market conditions and economic growth ravaged by the 

prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.

For FY 2020, the gross profit margin was 39%, as 

compared to 48% achieved in FY 2019. The lower gross 

profit margin for FY 2020 is mainly due to allowance for 

foreseeable losses of $35.0 million made on development 

properties, coupled with thinner profit margins achieved 

for Singapore residential projects that are still under 

construction as well as a more compressed margin from 

the hotel operations segment, led by lower room rate 

seen in most countries. 

To move towards a low-carbon economy, innovation 

and new technology must be supported by sustainable 

investments and financing. CDL’s robust ESG track 

record has helped the company to gain access to 

sustainable finance. Last year, CDL secured a $470 

million green revolving credit facility for the refinancing 

of Republic Plaza — CDL’s flagship commercial property 

— and on-lending to other eligible green projects.  

As of 31 December 2020, CDL has secured more than 

$1.3 billion of sustainable financing, through a green 

bond, green loans and a sustainability-linked loan.3

Beyond infrastructure, we have also invested in building 

capacity and people development. In 2020, we facilitated 

the efficient transition to Work From Home (WFH) 

arrangements by leveraging digital working tools and 

providing relevant virtual training to ensure business 

continuity. Our workforce has now acclimatised to WFH 

arrangements and has become adept using digital 

tools to maintain work productivity and connectivity. 

We also stepped up on training by expanding our suite 

of online capacity building offerings for our workforce. 

Webinars focussing on leadership building, digital 

tools, sustainability, occupational health and safety, and 

cultivation of healthy lifestyles and mental resilience 

were well-received by our employees. 

IMPACT: Maintaining Resilience and 

Amassing a Climate Force

Giving back to the community remains one of CDL’s 

core tenets. To support vulnerable communities and 

advocate for social inclusion during these tough times, 

CDL launched several community initiatives, including 

donating more than $400,000 to The Invictus Fund 

administered by Singapore’s Community Chest. We 

also organised an internal dollar-to-dollar matching 

fundraiser raising $88,000 for migrant workers at our 

development projects, providing them with necessities 

during the Circuit Breaker period.

Our low-carbon strategies and programmes have been 

designed to contribute to Singapore’s goal to achieve 

net zero emissions “as soon as viable” in the second 

half of the century. From 2012 to 2020, we reported 

energy savings of more than $30 million due to energy-

efficient retrofitting and initiatives implemented across 

all managed properties. In 2020, we achieved a 44% 

reduction in carbon emissions intensity against 2007 

levels, putting us on track to achieving our SBTi-

validated target of 59% by 2030.

Our continued progress in 2020 is widely recognised by 12 

leading global sustainability ratings and rankings, including:

• Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, of which CDL is 

listed for four consecutive years

• Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark 

(GRESB), of which CDL is recognised as a Global 

Sector Leader (Diversified-Office/Retail-listed) and 

Overall Regional Sector Leader (Diversified) 

• Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), of which CDL 

continued our inclusion in the DJSI World and Asia 

Pacific indices for the 10th consecutive year

• MSCI ESG Research, of which CDL received an ‘AAA’ 

rating for the 11th consecutive year

• Sustainalytics, of which CDL is ESG Industry Top 

Rated and Global 50 Top Rated 

• FTSE4Good Index Series, of which CDL continued our 

inclusion for the 19th consecutive year 

Amongst the distinguished accolades, we are proud to 

be named one of the world’s 50 Sustainability &amp; Climate

Building a sustainable future requires the collaboration 

of a larger ecosystem. During Singapore’s Circuit Breaker 

period and the subsequent social distancing restrictions, we 

stepped up on our community investments through active 

digital engagements, continuing to boost sustainability 

thought leadership and advocacy at a local and global scale.

In 2017, we designed and built the Singapore Sustainability 

Academy (SSA), the first ground-up and zero-energy facility 

in Singapore dedicated to advocacy and capacity building 

for the collective achievement of the SDGs. An extensive 

partnership involving government agencies, industry peers 

and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the SSA has 

become a hallmark of CDL’s community engagement and 

Singapore’s leading knowledge and networking hub for 

sustainability. The SSA has gone virtual due to COVID-19, 

continuing our outreach efforts through free virtual 

workshops in Singapore and beyond. Last year, the Virtual 

SSA events reached out to over 1,200 participants from 

over 25 countries, including Switzerland, Nigeria, Malaysia, 

Thailand and the United States.

While some of our community programmes were postponed 

due to COVID-19, we furthered our community impact 

and youth empowerment through online initiatives like 

the inaugural My Tree House’s Eco-Storytelling Contest, 

Youth4Climate Concert, the 10th CDL-Global Compact 

Network Singapore Young SDG Leaders Award, and 

partnership with the Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore), 

amplifying positive impact across our community.

LOOKING AHEAD — Advancing Change 

Resilience is Key to Sustainable Growth

The Singapore government announced its enhanced 2030 

Nationally Determined Contribution and its Long-Term Low-

Emissions Development Strategy to secure Singapore’s future 

as a climate-resilient nation. Businesses are expected to play 

their part, and CDL certainly aims to intensify our climate 

action in 2021 to help achieve both global and national goals.

In the global race to a low-carbon future, CDL will remain 

steadfast in fulfilling its commitment to Decarbonisation, 

Digitalisation &amp; Innovation, and Disclosure.

Decarbonisation — Commitment to Green Buildings and 

a Low-Carbon Economy 

In 2021, we were the first real estate developer in 

Singapore and the first major real estate conglomerate 

in Southeast Asia to sign on to the WorldGBC’s Net 

Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment. By joining the 

Commitment, CDL is dedicated to achieving net zero 

operational carbon by 2030 for our new and existing 

wholly-owned assets and developments under our 

direct operational and management control. 

To achieve this ambitious goal, we will strive to reduce 

our carbon emissions, including retrofitting our managed 

buildings to further enhance energy efficiency and 

accelerating the transition to renewable energy. Plans 

are underway to roll out BCA Green Mark Super Low 

Energy (SLE) certified buildings in Singapore by 2023.

In deepening our ambitious decarbonisation goals, 

we are reviewing our SBTi-validated GHG reduction 

targets to align with a 1.5°C warmer scenario-compliant 

business model. This complements CDL’s pledge of 

support to the Business Ambition for 1.5°C led by the 

UNGC, SBTi and We Mean Business coalition, of which 

CDL was one of the pioneering 87 companies to sign on 

to the campaign in September 2019.

As a signatory to the WorldGBC’s Net Zero Carbon 

Buildings Commitment, CDL is also a member of 

EP100, pledging to improve its energy productivity by 

deploying energy-efficient technologies and practices.

Complementing CDL’s target to achieve net zero for 

its buildings by 2030, a new Smart, Sustainable and 

Super Low Energy (3S) Green Building Framework was 

established. An expansion of CDL’s green procurement 

guidelines, this holistic framework is aligned with 

the BCA SLE building requirements, as well as 

international standards for advancing health and well-

being in buildings. 

To accelerate the sustainability agenda in Singapore, the 

Singapore Green Plan 2030 was unveiled on 10 February 2021.  

It entails multi-ministry and 3P efforts to drive ambitious

and collective action through interventions such as 

increased carbon tax, stricter green building policies, 

energy efficiency and waste reduction policies. As a staunch 

supporter of the Singapore Government’s green initiatives, 

we will continue to work closely with like-minded partners 

as Singapore ramps up its sustainability drive. 

Digitalisation &amp; Innovation — Driving Cutting-edge 

Green Building Technology Applications

Riding on CDL’s firm commitment to technological 

advancement and its recognition of innovation as one of 

our top-voted material ESG issues since 2017, a dedicated 

Green Building &amp; Technology Application team was set up 

in 2020. This aims to support the company’s intensifying 

efforts in the search and application of innovative solutions. 

Working together with the internal Enterprise Innovation 

Committee formed in 2018, the team will contribute to the 

company’s strategy by applying cutting-edge technology to 

reduce its carbon footprint in the way it designs, builds, and 

manages assets. As part of our efforts to reduce embodied 

carbon, we are also set to advance circular solutions in the 

years ahead, including studying the feasibility of adopting 

carbon-absorbing construction materials.

Accelerating Healthy, Green and Smart Buildings

Today, incorporating health considerations in a building’s 

design is not just a luxury but also a necessity. In 2020, 

“Healthy Buildings” emerged as a new material issue 

and “Occupational Health, Safety and Well-being” was 

rated as the top ESG issue for CDL.

Through CDL’s Green Building Policy, we will continue to 

place a strong focus on the health performance of our 

buildings by designing buildings with the following thrusts: 

(i) creating liveable and healthy buildings through thoughtful 

and intentional spaces by placing health and wellness at the 

centre of design and construction; (ii) developing healthy 

and low-carbon buildings using materials that are safe and 

made with low embodied carbon; (iii) promoting biophilic 

design by increasing connectivity to the natural environment 

through more exposure to greenery and nature; and 

(iv) creating safe and accessible spaces for users of all 

abilities, which puts users’ needs as a priority.

Disclosure — Unlocking Financial Value with Global 

Growth of ESG Investing

The asset management industry weathered the COVID-19 

crisis stronger than many in 2020. Assets under 

management in the global marketplace rose to USD110 

trillion. The robust performance of ESG funds and indices 

have fuelled the shift towards ESG investing more than ever. 

Given CDL’s strong commitment to ESG integration 

for over two decades and its proven track record in 

sustainability, we are in a strong position to benefit from 

the fast-growing trend of global sustainable investment 

and finance. The trend is expected to accelerate and we 

look forward to engaging more like-minded investors who 

believe in our long-term ESG-centric business approach. 

We will continue to tap on alternative financing streams to 

accelerate our green building developments and capture 

potential sustainable investments. 

Recovering Stronger and More Sustainably through 

Collaboration and Thought Leadership 

As a firm advocate for capacity building, knowledge 

sharing and partnership, CDL has been actively engaging 

our stakeholders to build a larger sustainability 

ecosystem. Our extensive network includes UN 

agencies, government, academia, NGOs, and industry 

organisations like WorldGBC, Urban Land Institute, GRI, 

Asia Pacific Real Estate Association and SGBC. 

Creating positive social and economic impact aligned 

with the UN SDGs will remain a key focus of CDL’s ESG 

strategy and business. In the wake of COVID-19, we have 

deployed and will continue to explore novel modes of 

community engagement for outreach and collaboration, 

without letting our guard down from the pandemic. 

CDL will continue to stay the course and create impactful 

collaborations by engaging issues that matter most. 

With greater collaboration amongst more stakeholders, 

ideas will spark and actions will amplify to build a more 

resilient future for all.

To conclude, I would like to thank our stakeholders 

and investors for their support of CDL’s commitment 

and efforts towards a net zero future. The faith and 

encouragement we have received from investors, 

customers, business partners, colleagues, and 

communities across the value chain over the years is a 

key driver enabling CDL to come this far.

In the year ahead, we are confident that our multi-

pronged sustainability strategy will put us on the path 

to renew, transform and emerge stronger, embracing 

change for a more resilient future together.

CREATING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH WHILE 

DELIVERING ON PURPOSE 

CDL’s value creation business model is anchored on our 

ethos of “Conserving as We Construct” since 1995. The 

model encapsulates our role as a developer, an asset 

owner and a corporate citizen, and guides us in creating 

sustained value for our business and our stakeholders. 

As an early adopter of sustainability and ESG reporting, 

CDL’s robust sustainability reporting has evolved into 

a unique hybrid model using GRI Standards as its core 

since 2008, IIRC’s Integrated Reporting Framework 

since 2015, SDG Reporting since 2016, TCFD framework 

since 2017, and SASB since 2020. This report is assured 

against the CDSB framework, complementing CDL’s 

unique blended reporting framework that addresses the 

increasing and more diverse demands for corporate ESG 

disclosures by investors and stakeholders. 

Our integrated sustainability report has progressed from 

focussing on operational ESG performance to a strategic 

ESG communication channel. The CDL Future Value 

2030 sustainability blueprint was first published in ISR 

2017, which sets goals for our integrated sustainability 

strategy towards 2030—a milestone year for sustainable 

development and the global climate agreement.

Since July 2017, we also voluntarily publish an 

online quarterly sustainability report that updates 

stakeholders of our progress towards key goals and 

targets set under the sustainability blueprint.

Sustainability integration is fundamental in our strategy 

to create long-term value and future-proof our business 

for our stakeholders. In the face of global disruptions, 

our early adoption of ESG integration has enabled CDL 

to remain steadfast as a responsible business in an 

ever-changing environment while advancing our greater 

purpose to drive value beyond profits.

STRONG LEADERSHIP COMMITMENT 

TO SUSTAINABILITY

Integrating sustainability at the highest governance 

level in CDL enables strategic oversight of ESG issues 

for long-term value creation. Since 2017, the leadership, 

spearheaded by CDL’s Board Sustainability Committee, 

has been critical and effective in delivering CDL’s 

sustainability purpose, integration, and performance 

that add business and economic value to CDL.

CDL has established the longest history amongst 

Singapore companies to have a dedicated Sustainability 

portfolio, headed by the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) 

for over a decade. The CSO reports directly to the Board 

Sustainability Committee (BSC), which comprises three 

independent directors, and CDL’s Executive Director and 

Group CEO. The BSC has direct advisory supervision 

on CDL’s sustainability strategy, material ESG issues, 

workplans and performance targets. It convenes meetings 

at least twice annually to discuss CDL’s sustainability 

plans and review its performance. Throughout the year, 

the CSO updates the BSC on CDL’s ESG performance and 

initiatives through the quarterly sustainability reports, as 

well as global and local ESG trends.

To achieve effective integration of sustainability 

throughout the company, the CSO chairs the 

Sustainability Committee, which comprises members 

across all departments and operational units in CDL. 

Heads of departments and their line managers are held 

accountable for their ESG performances, which are 

linked to their remuneration and appraisal.

DYNAMIC APPROACH TO MATERIALITY 

ASSESSMENT 

The global pandemic has disrupted the world and all 

businesses in an unprecedented manner. To address 

the fast-changing economic and social developments, 

we conducted a comprehensive materiality study ahead 

of schedule. 

Since 2014, we have been conducting comprehensive 

materiality studies biennially with the validation of 

key ESG issues in between two studies. While the 

last comprehensive study was conducted in 2019, we 

recognised the need to conduct a special assessment with 

a more extensive scope and depth to identify the shifting 

priorities and expectations of our stakeholders in the “new 

normal”. To review CDL’s business strategy for sustained 

growth, we engaged an independent external consultant 

to identify key Economic, Environmental, Social and 

Governance (EESG) issues that were deemed material by 

our key stakeholders. 

We conducted an extensive macro scanning exercise to 

determine the list of material risks and opportunities 

relevant to CDL’s business. We sent out online surveys and 

received responses from more than 250 stakeholders. 

Through interviews with selected senior-level stakeholders, 

we gained more insight into how COVID-19 impacted 

them, their perspectives on the relevance of sustainability 

to business resilience, and how CDL can remain 

competitive and sustainable in a post-COVID environment.

The preliminary material issues were validated by CDL’s 

Senior Management, followed by the approval of the BSC.

Materiality Matrix 

The findings reflect a shift in the rankings 

of the key material issues. In line with 

global concerns about the widespread 

and prolonged impact of the pandemic, 

“Occupational Health, Safety and Well-being” 

was the top ESG issue. This material issue 

refers to the physical and mental well-being 

of our employees and on-site workers, 

including measures taken to prevent the 

spread of the pandemic in our managed 

spaces. A new material issue on “Healthy 

Buildings” underscores the rising awareness 

of wellness and comfort (e.g. indoor air 

quality and natural lighting) for our building 

users. The ranking of “Stakeholder Impact 

and Partnerships” has shifted up, reflecting 

the higher expectations for CDL to provide 

support to the communities that we operate 

in and establish stakeholder partnerships 

to drive climate action and sustainable 

practices. Since 2014, “Innovation” has 

remained high on the list and took second 

place in 2020. Issues on “Product/Service 

Quality and Responsibility” and “Energy 

Efficiency and Adoption of Renewables“ 

are ranked amongst the top five, reflecting 

stakeholders‘ concerns about our continual 

commitment to sustainability performance.

Responses to Risks and Opportunities of the 15 Key Material ESG Issues in 2020

 

The table outlines our actions in addressing risks and capturing opportunities related to CDL’s top 15 material ESG issues derived from the 2020 materiality assessment study. It is mapped to 14 relevant SDGs and the four 

pillars of the TCFD framework. These ESG risks and opportunities complement CDL’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, which can be found in the Risk Management Report in CDL’s Annual Report 2020.

Occupational Health,

Safety and Well-being

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

 

Most activities at CDL’s construction sites 

and managed buildings are carried out by our 

appointed contractors. Safety lapses by our 

contractors can expose CDL to reputation and 

regulatory risks.

In the wake of COVID-19, safe management 

measures need to be effectively enforced to 

prevent community transmission at CDL’s 

construction sites and managed buildings. 

Failure to enforce the measures may lead to 

regulatory fines and/or disruptions to CDL’s 

operations.

Anticipating and controlling workplace hazards 

that could impair CDL employees’ physical and 

mental health and well-being is vital to CDL.

The safety, health and wellness of our employees and contractors’ workers have always been CDL’s priorities. 

In 2020, CDL completed the migration from OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series to 

ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety for all our key operations in Singapore, to effectively manage the safety, 

health and well-being of our employees and workers, directly or indirectly hired. 

Established since the early 2000s, CDL’s EHS Policy and CDL 5-Star EHS Assessment have been continually 

enhanced in standard and scope, working closely with the appointed contractors, where possible, to ensure 

migrant workers’ work and living conditions are in line with national guidelines. With the announcement of the 

new dormitories standards in June 2020, CDL enhanced our 5-Star EHS Assessment to ensure, where possible, 

migrant workers’ living conditions are improved. 

Since the start of Phase 1 post-Circuit Breaker on 2 June 2020, CDL’s EHS team regularly conducts compliance 

checks on the implementation of safe management measures across all our managed properties to deter any 

transgression. 

Strict monitoring and response procedures were put in place to address any reported cases of COVID-19 infections 

amongst CDL’s employees, workers and building users. 

Innovation

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

 

To build value in a pandemic-inflicted economy, 

it is important to innovate and evolve swiftly to 

changes.

Innovative real estate business models, such as 

providing safe and healthy spaces as a service, 

are also gaining traction in response to COVID-

19’s impact on changing customer demands. 

By investing in green building technologies and 

adapting to new business models, CDL can 

ensure that our products and services operate 

at the highest efficiency and remain relevant and 

resilient against impending disruptions.

Innovation has been a top priority in CDL’s growth and investment strategy. Our pipeline of innovation projects in 

green buildings and digitalisation is growing and will generate environmental and social benefits.

In adjusting to the “new normal”, CDL deployed various technologies including autonomous UVC disinfection 

robots, automated thermal scanners, indoor air quality sensors, and anti-microbial disposable films, to create 

safer and healthier environments for our building users.

CDL also launched the first-of-its-kind contactless lift eCall solution at Republic Plaza using our proprietary smart 

building app, CityNexus, in collaboration with Otis Singapore. 

In 2020, the NUS-CDL Smart Green Home developed, amongst others, an Acoustic Friendly Ventilation Window 

(AFVW) prototype to achieve better noise reduction and ventilation. The AFVW prototype was installed at Irwell Hill 

Residences’ showflat in March 2021.

CDL’s Top Material ESG Issues 

Risks/Opportunities

CDL’s Responses and Achievements

Product/Service Quality  

and Responsibility

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

 

As the impact of COVID-19 on the construction 

sector has a cascading effect on the value chain, 

the relief provided by the Singapore government16 

allowed CDL to focus on delivering safe and high-

quality products and services, particularly for our 

residential and commercial projects. 

As a landlord, CDL also has the responsibility of 

ensuring a safe and healthy environment for all 

its building users, by preventing the spread of 

COVID-19. 

To ensure compliance and prevent latent defects, CDL implemented a robust process guided by the Design for 

Safety regulations to identify design risks and assess the severity of EHS impacts throughout the construction 

stages of our developments.

In anticipation of social distancing due to COVID-19, CDL piloted the Virtual Unit Handover initiative at Forest 

Woods, as an option for vacant possession of strata units, upon obtaining its TOP in November 2020. This allowed 

homeowners to opt for a virtual walkthrough, led by CDL’s Customer Service Officer. Potential homebuyers are also 

treated to 3D virtual tours of CDL’s showflats as well as online sales presentations in the comfort of their homes.  

On a global scale, CDL made further headway towards digitalisation and launched more virtual tours of our 

Singapore and UK properties. 

The CDL eMall platform was launched to support tenants from City Square Mall, Palais Renaissance and Republic 

Plaza by providing them with an online sales channel complete with end-to-end fulfilment services. 

Economic Contribution 

to Society

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

 

CDL’s financial performance impacts the vested 

interests of our employees, shareholders, 

investors and supply chain.

As CDL remains resilient against the prolonged impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to uphold high 

standards of ethical business practices, maintain strong branding and deliver quality products to return profits 

and provide optimum returns for investors in our fiduciary duty as stewards of capital, creating value for our 

stakeholders.

CDL committed more than $40 million in property tax rebates and rental relief to our Singapore and overseas, 

retail and commercial tenants to tide over this difficult period. This includes passing on the full quantum of 

property tax rebates from the Singapore government to local tenants. Tenants facing severe cash flow issues were 

also offered more flexibility in rental payments.

Energy Efficiency and 

Adoption of Renewables

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

 

 

Globally, there is increased pressure for 

businesses to accelerate the transition towards a 

low-carbon economy. More stringent regulations 

on the energy performance of buildings and 

rising carbon tax are also expected, with the 

launch of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 in 

February 2021.

As energy consumption contributes

to a significant portion of CDL’s building’s 

operating expenses and carbon footprint, CDL 

needs to implement robust low-carbon strategies 

for our managed buildings, to maintain our 

leadership as a green developer.

Through robust resource management and regular asset upgrading and enhancement efforts, CDL has been 

maintaining good energy performance for our existing commercial properties. 

Since 2004, CDL has retrofitted all our existing managed buildings. From 2012 to 2020, CDL achieved savings of 

more than $30 million in energy expenses across all managed properties. 

Together with SERIS in 2020, CDL jointly applied for a Solar Competitive Research Programme and built a PV-

integrated modular pod at Central Mall to develop suitable solar modules for BIPV integration. Also, with SERIS, 

CDL piloted printed bifacial BIPV panels at City Square Mall, as a testbed for innovative solar integration solutions.

100% of CDL’s retail and office tenants are subscribed to CDL’s Green Lease Partnership Programme, which guides 

them on energy-saving fittings and measures.

Plans are currently underway to roll out BCA Green Mark SLE-certified buildings in Singapore by 2023.

16 To provide relief to the construction industry due to COVID-19, all construction deadlines between developers and main contractors were extended by four months, as legislated by the Singapore government in November 2020 under 

the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act.

CDL’s Top Material ESG Issues 

Risks/Opportunities

CDL’s Responses and Achievements

Stakeholder Impact and 

Partnerships

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

Building goodwill in the community provides CDL 

with a strong social license to operate. Through 

working with like-minded partners, CDL has 

pioneered partnerships that create multiplier 

effects on outreach and impact.

Taking action during COVID-19 requires an 

understanding of how CDL’s community and key 

stakeholders have been affected so that CDL can 

provide immediate responses, where relevant. 

To support vulnerable communities during the onset of COVID-19, CDL donated more than $400,000 to The Invictus 

Fund. Through an internal fundraiser, CDL raised $88,000 for close to 1,500 workers at our development projects, 

to provide them with necessities during Circuit Breaker.

CDL raised funds for Assisi Hospice, one of its longstanding community partners, for the annual Assisi Hospice 

Fun Day 2020, which involved stakeholders such as staff and like-minded business partners and associates.

While some of CDL’s community programmes were postponed due to COVID-19, we furthered our initiatives 

virtually, including events at the SSA, amplifying positive impact throughout CDL’s community while adhering to 

safe management measures. 

Climate Resilience

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

 

 

The built sector contributes to some 40% of global 

energy-related carbon emissions and is heavily 

reliant on natural resources for operations.

Regulatory transition risks such as carbon tax, 

water pricing and potentially stricter building 

design requirements will pose challenges to 

maintain profitability and sustained growth.

Extreme weather patterns can lead to stranded 

assets and affect the well-being of building 

occupants. In the face of climate change, climate-

proofing CDL’s buildings for a low-carbon future 

is key to our growth strategy.

CDL recognises climate change as a material strategic risk under CDL’s risk assessment framework. We are 

committed to implementing mitigation and adaptation measures to combat the effects of climate change on our 

portfolio of assets.

For close to a decade, CDL has been achieving our voluntary target of at least Green Mark GoldPLUS certification for all 

new developments, two tiers above mandatory requirement. To date, 85% of CDL’s portfolio of owned and managed 

buildings, based on gross floor area, are rated Green Mark GoldPLUS or Platinum—the highest tier certification.

In February 2021, CDL pledged support to the WorldGBC’s Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment to achieve net 

zero operational carbon by 2030 for our new and existing wholly-owned assets and developments under our direct 

operational and management control.

CDL is also reviewing our SBTi-validated GHG reduction targets to align with a 1.5°C warmer scenario-compliant 

business model. 

Healthy Buildings (NEW)

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

 

 

Building occupants are paying more attention to 

attributes of a healthy environment in buildings 

that can contribute to their health, well-being 

and productivity.

Buildings with poor IAQ and sanitisation practices 

are susceptible to viral transmissions.

CDL designs and manages our buildings with the health and wellness of our building occupants in mind, including 

factoring in acoustic comfort, natural ventilation, thermal comfort and biophilic design.

In 2020, CDL developed a Smart, Sustainable and Super Low Energy (3S) Green Building Framework, a holistic 

framework that is aligned with BCA SLE buildings requirements and international standards for advancing health 

and well-being in buildings.

Since August 2020, Republic Plaza tenants can view IAQ indicators such as temperature, humidity, PM2.5, carbon 

dioxide and volatile organic compounds levels through the CityNexus app.

In 2020, CDL supported a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, Center for the Built 

Environment, and SinBerBEST, which was funded by the National Research Foundation, to benchmark our IEQ 

responses to similar commercial buildings in Singapore. While overall staff satisfaction was high, the study 

identified further areas for improvement, such as privacy, noise level of work spaces and office dress code.

CDL’s Top Material ESG Issues 

Risks/Opportunities

CDL’s Responses and Achievements

Cyber-readiness, Security and 

Data Privacy

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

Strengthening CDL’s capabilities to protect 

itself and recover from cyber-attacks is vital to 

preventing data theft, financial loss, and disruption 

of operations. Given rising data privacy concerns 

both locally and globally, CDL needs to be mindful 

of compliance requirements for international and 

local data privacy protection laws.

Globally, cybersecurity threats (e.g. phishing and 

malware) are occurring more frequently due to 

WFH arrangements and COVID-19-themed lures.

Besides establishing holistic IT governance structures and developing robust detection and mitigation measures 

to protect CDL’s critical business systems and data, our response plans are tested by independent external and 

internal auditors and benchmarked against industry best practices.

CDL’s risk assessment framework has identified data privacy as a key risk, given recent developments in data 

privacy regulations and the increasing impact of potential data privacy breaches. In response, CDL has been 

carrying out various mitigating measures including staff awareness training, as well as monitoring of local and 

international data privacy developments relevant to its business.

Responsible Supply Chain

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

 

 

The procurement of unsustainable building 

materials and unfair labour practices that go 

against human rights can negatively impact CDL’s 

ESG performance and reputation. Usage of toxic 

building materials can also harm the health of 

building users and workers.

For more than a decade, CDL has been implementing guidelines that contain clear specifications for responsible 

sourcing along our supply chain. This includes the implementation of the Responsible Procurement Guidelines17 

since 2008 and the Green Procurement Guideline for property developments since 2009. 

In line with our corporate EHS Policy introduced in 2003, these guidelines encourage the use of eco-friendly and 

recycled materials that have been certified by approved local certification bodies, such as SGBC and SEC.

All suppliers are required to sign a Supplier Code of Conduct (introduced in 2015), which provides comprehensive 

guiding principles for our vendors and suppliers to comply with CDL’s expectations, including environment, health, 

safety, and ethical employment.

CDL completed a supply chain segmentation study in 2020, where environmental (e.g. embodied carbon intensity) 

and social risks (e.g. forced or child labour) were assessed for its top suppliers and building materials procured 

for its developments. The results were shared with the BSC in late 2020 and will be communicated to relevant 

business units through a workshop in 2021 to develop strategies specific to their operations.

Ethical and 

Transparent Business

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

Bribery and corruption are amongst the highest 

risks for businesses that could lead to financial 

and reputational loss. Legal non-compliance can 

lead to the erosion of trust by CDL’s stakeholders, 

causing CDL to lose our social license to operate.

By taking a firm stance on its zero-tolerance 

policy towards fraud, bribery and corruption, 

CDL can influence its value chain and provide 

strong assurance to our stakeholders, including 

investors and customers.

CDL benchmarks our practices with the voluntary SS ISO 37001 Anti-bribery Management Systems to minimise 

gaps. We operate as per industry standards. Anti-money laundering workshops are conducted annually for our 

employees.

CDL implements clear and transparent policies, risk management systems, and ESG disclosures to continuously 

monitor and validate business processes. Within CDL’s robust EHS Management System, applicable legal 

requirements are regularly monitored and evaluated for compliance. Incentives and penalties are also 

implemented to improve and tighten contractors’ site management. 

CDL adopts fair marketing practices to reinforce customer’s trust in how CDL-branded properties are marketed.

CDL’s Top Material ESG Issues 

Risks/Opportunities

CDL’s Responses and Achievements

Future-ready Workforce

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

A workforce that is ill-prepared to keep up 

with industry developments, knowledge and 

technological trends will impact human capital, 

operational efficiency, and sustained growth.

In reacting to the pandemic, businesses had a 

short lead time to transition their workforce and IT 

infrastructure for WFH arrangements. A workforce 

that is not agile to adapt to such sudden disruptions 

will threaten its business continuity. 

Building a workforce with skill sets that contribute to future-proofing CDL’s business in a fast-changing and 

uncertain global economy is a priority. We actively foster a culture of continuous learning in our workforce, 

enabling employees to acquire holistic skills and competency to stay relevant and adapt effectively to changing 

job demands. 

In complementing WFH arrangements, CDL stepped up on virtual learning and development offerings for our 

employees. Topics covered include leadership building, digital working tools, sustainability, occupational health 

and safety, and cultivation of healthy lifestyles and mental resilience.

Sustainable Finance

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

The rise of ESG investing and responsible banking 

has unlocked alternative financing streams that 

can lower CDL’s borrowing costs and expand our 

pool of ESG-centric investors and lenders.

Sustainable financing mechanisms also help drive 

companies’ sustainability strategies and targets. 

In 2020, CDL secured a $470 million green revolving credit facility for the refinancing of Republic Plaza and 

other eligible projects set out in the CDL Sustainable Finance Framework. The framework allows CDL to be well 

prepared for opportunities where sustainable financing can be used to fund green projects that support CDL’s 

business strategy and vision.

As of 31 December 2020, CDL has secured more than $1.3 billion of sustainable finance, including a green bond, 

green loans and a sustainability-linked loan.

Human Rights and 

Labour Conditions

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

 

Respecting and promoting the rights and dignity 

of employees, workers and communities help 

to build a more resilient supply chain, which is 

expected from a responsible business.

Creating a workplace that provides a decent work 

environment, fair remuneration, security in the 

workplace, freedom of expression, work-life balance, 

and career growth, is key to building a sustainable 

workforce. This allows CDL to strengthen employee 

loyalty, increase work productivity, strengthen 

teamwork and increase creativity.

CDL engages our contractors and suppliers to abide by CDL’s fundamental principles and policies such as the 

Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy, and Universal Design Policy. Since 2001, the CDL 5-Star EHS 

Assessment—an independent audit tool to assess, measure, and improve the main contractors’ EHS management 

and performance, has been in place to ensure a comprehensive, audited, and appraised approach.

 

The spread of COVID-19 amongst workers could be exacerbated by their living conditions at commercially run 

dormitories. During the lockdown of foreign worker dormitories to combat the outbreak of COVID-19, CDL 

enhanced our 5-Star EHS Assessment audit standards in line with the national improved standards for the living 

conditions of migrant workers. CDL fully supports the Singapore government’s enhanced living standards for 

purpose-built dormitories, and is committed to work closely with our main contractors on this issue.

CDL provided timely updates of the COVID-19 situation to our workforce and rolled out WFH arrangements 

swiftly. This ensured that all employees were equipped with essential digital tools to facilitate communication and 

workflow under new work conditions.

Water and Waste Management

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars: 

 

 

 

Prudent water usage can help to lower operational 

costs of managed buildings, and conserve water, 

which is a precious natural resource.

Waste management is a growing concern in 

Singapore as the country is expected to run out 

of landfill space by 2035. As such, more stringent 

regulations to manage the various waste streams 

can be anticipated.

CDL’s developments are designed with a lifecycle approach to water sustainability and sound waste management. 

CDL adopts technologies to raise water efficiency and manage waste, such as rainwater harvesting and twin-chute 

pneumatic waste disposal system, which are implemented at many of our commercial and residential developments.

CDL was placed in the 2020 CDP A List in water security, an affirmation of CDL’s robust water management 

strategy. CDL was the only Singapore company to score an A in the 2020 assessment, and the only company in 

Southeast Asia and Hong Kong to remain listed on the CDP A List for water security for two consecutive years.

ENGAGING THE VALUE CHAIN IN 

OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY

To catalyse change within the larger 

ecosystem for a multiplier effect, 

CDL is committed to engaging and 

influencing our value chain to adopt 

more sustainable practices aligned with 

our expectations and policies to build 

sustainable communities. 

Our value chain management 

encapsulates how CDL embraces the 

relevant SDGs. We have identified key 

areas along our value chain where we can 

create social and environmental impact, 

referencing the “SDG Compass: The 

Guide for Business Action on the SDGs”, 

jointly developed by the GRI, UNGC, and 

World Business Council for Sustainable 

Development.

Leveraging our sphere of influence 

amongst stakeholders, we apply our 

core competencies, invest in innovations 

and engage our network to promote and 

contribute to the relevant SDGs (see 

diagram on the right). Underlying this 

value chain process is a proactive and 

continuous engagement with internal and 

external stakeholders through the lifecycle 

of asset development and management.

BEST PRACTICES AND ESG COMMITMENTS

We support industry best practices and ESG commitments to uphold good corporate governance, to conduct business with integrity, as well as to promote fair and responsible practices and 

inclusivity along our value chain. In line with advocating for best practices in our business, CDL also raises the bar on decarbonisation and climate action towards a sustainable future for all.

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing Terrorism Policy

In 2016, CDL introduced the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing Terrorism 

Policy for our property business in line with URA’s guidance and the Monetary 

Authority of Singapore’s mission to mitigate the risk of Singapore being used as a 

platform by global criminals and terrorist organisations to launder illicit funds. The 

Policy provides guidelines and procedures for our frontline sales and compliance 

function to detect and report such criminal acts.

Board Diversity Pledge

In 2015, CDL supported the Board Diversity Pledge initiated by the Singapore Institute 

of Directors and SGX. By taking the Pledge, CDL commits to promoting diversity as a key 

attribute of a well-functioning and effective Board. In 2017, the Board of CDL formally 

adopted the Board Diversity Policy, which sets out the policy and framework  

for promoting diversity on the Board.

Crisis Management Protocol

In 2016, CDL validated our corporate crisis management protocol which includes incident 

escalation, operational response and crisis communication. The effort culminated in a crisis 

simulation exercise where Senior Management was put through a series of rigorous crisis 

scenario-based tests and a mock media conference and interview.

In February 2020, CDL released a Group-wide Incident Escalation and Reporting 

Framework to facilitate structured reporting and management of all incidents with  

a potential financial, operational or reputational impact on the Group.

Employers’ Pledge of Fair Employment Practices

CDL is a signatory of the Employers’ Pledge of Fair Employment Practices with TAFEP. 

TAFEP works with employer organisations, unions and the Government to create 

awareness and facilitate the adoption of fair employment practices. The alliance is  

co-chaired by representing employer unions and National Trades Union Congress.

Ethical Marketing Practices

Since 2000, we have developed a set of internal procedures and an operational 

manual for marketing and leasing. These are reviewed annually to reflect changes in 

marketing practices, technology, regulation and stakeholder expectations.

Marketing collaterals produced by CDL are compliant with the Singapore Code of 

Advertising Practice administered by the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore, 

an Advisory Council to the Consumers Association of Singapore.

CDL’s marketing practices also comply with the URA’s Housing Developers Rules 

(HDR) and BCA’s Guidelines for Outdoor Signs at our construction sites. The HDR 

seeks to enhance transparency in the real estate industry, enabling homebuyers 

to make better-informed decisions when buying a home, while the BCA guidelines 

prohibit cross-marketing of other products and services.

Green Lease Partnership Programme 

To support our office and retail tenants’ efforts to lower their carbon footprint, we 

implemented the Green Lease Partnership Programme in 2014. 100% of existing 

office and retail tenants have pledged their commitment to go green by signing a 

Green Lease.

Pledge for Zero – A CEO Commitment Charter 

CDL is a founding signatory of the “Pledge for Zero – A CEO Commitment Charter”, 

launched at the inaugural Construction CEO Summit organised by the Workplace 

Safety and Health Council in 2008. CDL adopted the pledge and committed to 

establishing a zero-injury workplace. In 2016, CDL reiterated our commitment towards 

Construction Industry WSH Action Plans by galvanising 24 of our key builders and 

consultants to sign the “Pledge Towards Vision Zero Through Safe Design – Safe 

Practices – Safe Culture”.

The list of our commitment to ESG and best practices is non-exhaustive. Please refer to our sustainability website for more information.

Responsible Procurement Guidelines

Reflecting our commitment to use resources more efficiently, and respect health 

and safety in our supply chain, our Responsible Procurement Guidelines set out our 

requirements for the selection of vendors and suppliers at our Corporate Office and 

across business operations in Singapore. 

The guidelines include:

• Sharing the Corporate EHS Policy with new vendors and suppliers

• Indicating a preference for use of eco-friendly and recycled materials and products

• Indicating a preference for ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and bizSAFE Level 3 certified 

vendors 

• Declaring the use of eco-friendly and recycled paper in printed materials

• Meeting applicable EHS legal requirements, i.e. risk assessments conducted and 

risk controls implemented for work activities carried out for and/or on behalf of 

CDL that may impact CDL, the vendor/supplier’s workers and any other interested 

parties at the workplace.

Singapore Stewardship Principles

CDL is committed to upholding the highest standards of governance, integrity and 

sustainability in all our business activities. As a sustainability leader and a proponent 

of responsible investing, we support the call for good governance and stewardship by 

investors as communicated in the Singapore Stewardship Principles.

Supplier Code of Conduct

The Supplier Code of Conduct provides comprehensive guiding principles for our 

vendors and suppliers to comply with CDL’s expectations of ethical standards, covering 

the following areas: 

• Business integrity 

• Environmental sustainability

• Fair competition 

• Health and safety

• Open communication 

• Legal compliance

• Conflict of interest 

• Human rights

• Gifts and entertainment 

• Reciprocity

Sustainable Employment Pledge

Purposeful actions by companies will foster a vibrant economy and society through 

sustainable employment practices and encourage innovation. CDL has taken the 

Sustainable Employment Pledge, an initiative by Singapore Business Federation, and 

has committed to making at least one improvement to our practices in sustainable 

employment every twelve months.

UN Climate Neutral Now Pledge

As part of our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality, we joined the UN Climate 

Neutral Now Pledge in 2020 to commit maintaining carbon neutrality for our corporate 

office operations and 11 Tampines Concourse. In March 2021, we further expanded 

this pledge to achieve net zero operational carbon for the rest of our wholly-owned 

buildings and developments under our direct operational and management control, to 

align with our pledge to the WorldGBC Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment.

Women’s Empowerment Principles 

We recognise the valuable contribution of our female employees to CDL’s business 

growth and sustainability leadership. With a workforce that is nearly 70% female, 

CDL is committed to empowering women in our workplace and supporting their 

pursuit of career and personal development. The Board and top management of CDL 

firmly believe that diversity and inclusion will strategically enhance a company’s 

human capital and performance for future growth. Our Group CEO joined over 1,600 

leaders globally in pledging CDL’s support for the Women’s Empowerment Principles. 

Developed through a partnership between the UN Women and UNGC, the principles 

offer practical guidance to the private sector on how to empower women in the 

workplace, marketplace and community.

WorldGBC’s Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment

In February 2021, we were the first real estate developer in Singapore and the first 

real estate conglomerate in Southeast Asia to pledge our support to the Commitment 

to achieve net zero operational carbon by 2030 for our new and existing wholly-owned 

assets and developments under our direct operational and management control.

BUILDINGS

COVID-19 has shown that incorporating sustainable and 

health concerns in a building’s design is not just a luxury, 

but a necessity. In 2020, “Healthy Buildings” emerged as 

a new material issue and “Occupational Health, Safety 

and Well-being” was rated as the top material issue for 

CDL. Given the high environmental impact of the built 

industry, innovation and climate action have been CDL’s 

top material issues in our growth and investment strategy.

As Singapore’s real estate and green building pioneer, 

CDL has amassed a portfolio of 110 BCA Green Mark 

certifications for our developments and office interiors1 

since the launch of the Green Mark scheme in 2005.2 This 

makes us the most awarded BCA Green Mark Platinum 

developer in the private sector.

Endorsed by the Management and supported by the 

Board, we have set the following targets to take our 

green building ambition to the next level:

• Setting a minimum target for all new developments 

to be BCA Green Mark GoldPLUS certified, two tiers 

above the mandatory BCA Green Mark certification 

level (since 2011)

• Investing 2% to 5% of the construction cost of new 

developments in green and healthy design and 

features

• Commitment to achieving BCA Green Mark 

certification for 90% of CDL owned and/or managed 

buildings, by 2030

Fuji Xerox Towers was awarded the Green Mark Platinum certificate 

from 22 December 2017 to 22 December 2020. Recertification was 

subsequently put on hold due to redevelopment works.

• Commitment to reduce the embodied carbon of 

our construction materials by 24% as compared to 

conventional equivalents, by 2030

• Commitment to achieve at least one SLE building by 

2023 

• Commitment to achieve net zero operational carbon 

for wholly-owned and directly managed in Singapore 

by 2030

RAISING ESG/BUILDING PERFORMANCE:

DECARBONISATION &amp; HEALTH ARE KEY

3S Green Building Framework 

To further advance CDL’s green building ambition and support 

global net zero goals, CDL developed a Smart, Sustainable 

and Super Low Energy (3S) Green Building Framework, 

known as the 3S Green Building Framework. It builds upon 

two critical enablers–innovation and digitalisation–to support 

CDL’s business growth and transformation as we move 

into a post-COVID-19 world. An expansion of CDL’s green 

procurement guidelines, this holistic framework is aligned 

with BCA SLE buildings requirements, as well as international 

standards for advancing health and well-being in buildings. 

Plans are currently underway to roll out BCA SLE-certified 

buildings in Singapore by 2023. 

WorldGBC’s Net Zero Carbon  

Buildings Commitment

Riding on our firm commitment to decarbonisation, in 

February 2021 CDL was the first real estate developer 

in Singapore and the first real estate conglomerate in 

Southeast Asia to sign the WorldGBC’s Net Zero Carbon 

Buildings Commitment. By joining the Commitment, CDL 

is dedicated to achieving net zero operational carbon 

by 2030 for our new and existing wholly-owned assets 

and developments under our direct operational and 

management control. Further details can be found under 

“Alleviating Environmental Impact”. 

Dedication to Occupational Health,  

Safety and Well-being

In 2020, “Occupational Health, Safety and Well-being” 

was our top material issue. As part of our dedication to 

this issue, we have implemented strategic actions in six 

key areas: policies, standards, certification, innovations, 

technology applications, and user engagements. 

From enhancing ESG policies on safe and healthy 

environments to implementing UVC disinfection robots, 

we aim to address changing stakeholders’ expectations 

through a holistic and multipronged approach. Further 

details can be found under “Achieving a Fair, Safe and 

Inclusive Business Environment”.

DRIVING INNOVATION 

AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION 

Innovation is one of CDL’s top-voted material ESG issues 

since 2017. The Green Building &amp; Technology Application 

team was set up in 2020 as part of the Sustainability 

portfolio. Working together with the Enterprise 

Innovation Committee (EIC), the team will contribute 

to the company’s strategy to leverage cutting-edge 

technology, to reduce our carbon footprint in the way 

we design, build, and manage our assets. CDL is also 

set to advance circularity solutions in the years ahead, 

including studying the feasibility of adopting advanced 

low-carbon construction methods and materials as part 

of our efforts to reduce embodied carbon.

Enterprise Innovation Committee 

CDL’s EIC was formed by CDL Group CEO Mr Sherman 

Kwek in 2018 as an anchor platform for multidisciplinary 

teams to collaborate on driving innovation and business 

transformation. Chaired by CDL Group Chief Strategy 

Officer Mr Kwek Eik Sheng, the EIC has made headways 

in discovering, executing and investing in customer- and 

digital-centric solutions that create value.

The gamut of innovation activities ranges from 

strategy to execution. They are inclusive (teamwork is 

paramount), transcend technology (includes operating 

and business models) and have near-to long-term 

horizons in the sights.

These activities are powered by the CDL innovation 

engine which comprises three mutually-reinforcing 

gears: (1) Innovation Pipeline, (2) People and Culture and 

(3) PropTech Investment.

Getting the Innovation Pipeline right grows value outcomes. 

In 2020, CDL extended our network of partners, enabling 

us to collectively capture and assess over 300 leads. Of 

all the leads, 19 were piloted and one was scaled despite 

disruptions from COVID-19. While the EIC doubles down 

on this gear in 2021, the committee will also keenly assess 

existing pilot outcomes for potential scale-ups.

Getting People and Culture right sustains the pipeline. 

In 2020, the EIC continued efforts to promote learning, 

appropriate experimenting and propagate the CDL 

innovation strategy via targeted staff workshops. As a 

result, we have benefited from tighter cross-departmental 

collaborations and quicker ideas-to-pilots conversion.

Getting PropTech Investment right raises pipeline quality. 

In 2020, CDL invested in Pupil, a PropTech start-up 

with a vision to digitise the world’s interiors, scaled the 

usage of Gush paint (an existing portfolio start-up), and 

will continue to harvest learnings from vested VC funds. 

Details can be found in page 39.

In 2020, the EIC continued implementing several activities 

to foster an innovation culture. This includes:

• Organising strategy workshops and virtual staff 

capability building sessions to generate greater 

awareness of the company’s innovation strategy, 

which aims to raise the odds of successful execution.

People &amp; 

Culture

• Distributing a fortnightly e-newsletter with 

information about global trends and building 

innovations, and putting forth business challenges 

to crowdsource ideas company-wide. Ideas 

generated by our staff were then captured in the 

EIC’s Central Ideas Repository and assessed based 

on relevance and the value creation potential for 

CDL’s stakeholders.

• Inviting start-ups and other innovative companies 

that were aligned with our business operations to 

speak at EIC Fireside Chats, a series of informal 

knowledge-sharing generated organic cross-

departmental discussions, opening doors for 

potential collaboration.

Championing Innovation through 

Partnerships to be Future-ready 

R&amp;D and technology are fundamental in improving 

the quality of the built environment, as well as 

in raising building performance standards and 

construction methods. Besides scouting for the 

latest technology and solutions, CDL also engages 

in strategic partnerships with research institutions.

Innovations by NUS-CDL Smart Green Home

The NUS-CDL Smart Green Home3 is a unique indoor 

test-bed environment that serves as a platform for holistic 

and innovative experimental studies on smart features, 

green building technologies and design for sustainable 

living. Situated in NUS School of Design and Environment, 

NUS-CDL Smart Green Home is a 100 m2 full-size home 

designed for plug-and-play experimentation of new smart 

materials, systems and finishes.

The Acoustic Friendly Ventilation Window (AFVW) allows 

for air change efficiency of up to four times more than 

conventional windows, allowing fresh air in while 

reducing noise. The AFVW prototype was installed at 

Irwell Hill Residences’ showflat in March 2021 for test 

bedding and system refinement as part of the NUS-CDL 

Smart Green Home collaboration. Based on the findings 

of the pilot, CDL will explore moving this technology into 

larger-scale implementation in our future projects.

The novel anti-microbial disposable adhesive film 

is the first locally-developed coating that protects 

high-touch areas against virus contamination and 

surface transmission. It uses nanotechnology solution 

that enables surfaces to be self-decontaminating by 

denaturing the surface-contaminated pathogens over 

four to six months. As part of system testing, these 

films have been installed at selected locations at CDL 

managed buildings.

Acoustic Friendly Ventilation Window (AFVW)

Anti-microbial Disposable Film

How AFVW works 

1  Air passes through two staggered vents and is enhanced by a mechanical 

ventilation system to provide four times better ventilation compared to an 

open conventional window.

2  Combination of double glazed glass panes and sound absorbers reduces 

environment noise such as traffic noice by about 26db (more than a fourfold 

reduction in terms of a human’s perception of loudness).

Tape will lose its translucency  

as it becomes ineffective over 

time, indicating the need to

Collaborations with SERIS

In support of Singapore’s long-term low-emissions 

development vision, CDL and SERIS jointly applied 

for a Solar Competitive Research Programme in 

2020 to testbed high-power density BIPV modules at 

Central Mall. PPVC technology improves construction 

productivity and reduces cost, as it is deployed modularly 

at the construction site. Integration of BIPV modules with 

such prefabrication technology could greatly reduce the 

cost of BIPV integration.

Working with architects and building contractors, 

SERIS developed a “modular pod”, i.e. a building block 

consisting of various prefabricated BIPV elements 

(panelised wall, monsoon windows, unitised wall and 

fixture wall) to mimic the different real-world building 

components. The modular pod has been installed, and 

the various BIPV elements are monitored and evaluated 

for their indoor thermal and visual comfort as well 

as electrical performance. The development of such 

prefabricated BIPV elements would allow architects and 

developers to easily integrate BIPV into future buildings.

In the same year, SERIS and CDL piloted a new generation 

of PV art wall (bifacial BIPV panels) at City Square 

Mall. These bifacial BIPV panels were integrated 

into the outdoor balustrades at level 6 of City Square 

Mall, serving both as an aesthetic feature and power 

generator. These BIPV panels serve as a testbed for 

more efficient PV installations.



Collaboration with SUTD AIRLAB

CDL is collaborating with SUTD Architectural Intelligence 

Research Lab (AIRLAB) to pilot a functional vertical farming 

system, developed through 3D printing using sustainable 

bio-based materials at City Square Mall. If successful, the 

project will be expanded to a larger-scale pilot and wider 

scope of collaboration to incorporate sustainable, 3D 

printed architectural features in future CDL developments.

INNOVATION HIGHLIGHTS FOR SAFE, HEALTHY AND SMART BUILDINGS DURING COVID-19 

Autonomous UVC Disinfection Robots

CDL deployed UVC robots at City Square Mall and 

Republic Plaza to autonomously disinfect areas 

with high traffic and touchpoints. These robots 

complemented existing cleaning services and 

heightened disinfection measures to protect building 

users from COVID-19 transmission. 

Active IAQ Monitoring 

In August 2020, IAQ devices were installed at Republic 

Plaza Tower 1 Lobby and integrated with the CityNexus 

app, giving tenants a view of IAQ parameters, such 

as temperature, humidity, PM2.5, carbon dioxide and 

VOC levels. This initiative allows CDL to proactively 

demonstrate to building occupants that their health 

and well-being is a priority.

Digitalised Construction Site Inspection 

Action cameras were mounted on safety helmets at the 

construction site of Boulevard 88 and The Singapore 

EDITION Hotel to facilitate virtual structural inspection. 

This initiative improved productivity, reduced big 

group physical inspections, and encouraged virtual 

collaboration amongst various stakeholders.

Real-time Visibility of Lift Performance 

In collaboration with TÜV SÜD and Bosch, CDL 

implemented lift analytics and installed IoT sensors on 

10 lifts across five CDL commercial properties. From 

a single dashboard, we can now track the physical 

condition, utilisation, ride comfort and receive alerts if 

anomalies are detected. This may enable CDL to shift 

from a conventional periodic maintenance regime to one 

that is more predictive and efficient in maintenance, with 

the aim to reduce lift issues and downtime.

Contactless Lift

In collaboration with Otis Singapore, CDL launched 

the first-of-its-kind contactless lift eCall solution at 

Republic Plaza using our proprietary smart building 

app, CityNexus. The app helps tenants avoid touching 

any public surfaces, enabling them to move safely and 

seamlessly within the building.

Photoplasma Air Disinfection System in Lifts

Photoplasma air disinfection system has been installed 

across all CDL’s managed properties, either at lift 

lobby or within lift cars. It eliminates bacteria, virus, 

unpleasant smells, mould and VOCs.

INVESTING IN PROPTECH AND 

SUSTAINABILITY SOLUTIONS 

Besides investing in VC funds (Fifth Wall and Dragonrise 

Capital), we have also invested in several PropTech and 

sustainability solutions during the year under review that 

include: 

• 

Pupil – UK-based spatial data company Pupil builds and 

captures digital twins of the built environment. Pupil’s 

digital surveyors scan a residential unit with a LIDAR 

camera to capture datasets. Within 24 hours, their ‘Spec’ 

technology delivers 3D walkthroughs and a millimetre 

accurate floorplan of the actual build unit. CDL utilised 

‘Spec’ for its UK residential properties. In January 

2020, CDL invested in the company’s Series A round. 

• Gush – Following the successful mould prevention 

pilot of Gush paint at Nouvel 18, CDL invested $3 million 

in the Singapore start-up that produces sustainable 

paint which purifies air, eliminates bacteria and 

regulates humidity. In 2020, CDL utilised the paint 

for fit-out works at its residential properties for 

lease. The paint will also be used at new residential 

developments, notably Haus on Handy.

• Incubator For SDGs – A rent-free workspace at 

Republic Plaza for selected social enterprises and 

start-ups that are aligned with one or more SDGs. 

In partnership with UNDP, raiSE and Social Collider 

in 2019, Incubator For SDGs was launched to help 

these companies tap into an extensive network of 

management experts to help them scale up and 

reach out to potential investors and markets. Due to 

COVID-19, part of the Incubator For SDGs programme 

was put on hold due to restrictions on physical 

meetings and networking sessions. Nevertheless, 

the start-ups were still able to utilise the rent-free 

workspaces in 2020. For 2021, CDL will seek the 

second intake of impact-driven businesses with its 

new partner GGEF, a well-connected impact investing 

accelerator, in addition to our founding partners 

UNDP and raiSE.

We are also exploring PropTech solutions such as 

digiHub, an in-house integrated facilities management 

solution that utilises AI to analyse big data from loT 

sensors installed at various major M&amp;E equipment to 

enable preventive and predictive maintenance.

Longstanding Commitment to Support 

EV Adoption 

With the recent launch of the Singapore Green 

Plan 2030, 60,000 EV charging points will be 

built at public car parks and private premises 

by 2030—more than double the target of 28,000 

set last year. In support of this national push 

for EV adoption, CDL has been at the forefront 

in providing carpark lots with EV chargers. 

Under CDL’s Green Procurement Guideline for 

property developments, EV chargers are currently 

mandatory provisions at our new commercial 

properties, an extension of our pioneering 

efforts for City Square Mall and Quayside Isle. 

Going forward, we will explore incorporating EV 

chargers in new residential developments and at 

existing CDL managed properties. These efforts 

will help support the transformation of the local 

urban mobility scene.

AND TENANT 

EXPERIENCE 

IN THE AGE OF 

COVID-19

DRIVING BETTER TENANT AND CUSTOMER 

EXPERIENCE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY 

CDL actively leverages technology to automate 

processes, standardise protocols and drive data-backed 

decision making. Examples of such enablers are 

systems that support asset management modelling, 

customer relationship management, lease management 

and facilities management. Desired outcomes include 

more consistent service standards, higher productivity, 

reduced error and increased competitiveness.

INNOVATION HIGHLIGHTS FOR ENHANCING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE DURING COVID-19

Approach 

The CDL eMall platform was 

launched to support tenants 

from City Square Mall, Palais 

Renaissance and Republic Plaza 

by providing them with an online 

sales channel complete with 

end-to-end fulfilment services. 

The CDL eMall was launched on 

16 December 2020, just in time to 

capture Christmas retail sales.

Ramped Up Virtual 

Marketing and Sales Efforts 

Potential homebuyers are treated 

to 3D virtual tours of CDL’s 

showflats as well as online sales 

presentations in the comfort of 

their homes. On a global scale, 

CDL made further headway 

towards digitalisation and 

launched more virtual tours of our 

Singapore and UK properties.

Safer and Hassle-Free 

Handover Options for 

Homeowners 

In anticipation of social distancing 

due to COVID-19, CDL piloted the 

Virtual Unit Handover initiative 

at Forest Woods, as an option 

for vacant possession of strata 

units, upon obtaining its TOP in 

November 2020. This allowed 

homeowners to opt for a virtual 

walkthrough, led by CDL’s 

Customer Service Officer.

Achieving High Customer Satisfaction 

To better understand customers’ expectations, identify 

areas for improvement, and enhance service quality, CDL 

regularly reviews customer satisfaction measurements 

through formal surveys. Our target is to achieve at least a 

70% satisfaction rate from homebuyers and at least 80% 

from office, industrial and retail tenants. 

As part of the tenant engagement programme 

and continued efforts for improvement, tenants of 

commercial properties are surveyed annually on 

their levels of satisfaction in areas such as building 

and services management. In 2020, all sectors have 

exceeded the targeted 80% tenant satisfaction rate, with 

the office sector maintaining it at 97%, the industrial sector 

increasing to 88% and retail sector slightly dropping to 94%.

For homebuyers, an online customer satisfaction survey 

is sent at least nine months after handover to measure 

their experience across various touchpoints. However, 

there was no customer satisfaction survey administered 

in 2020 as there was no development that obtained TOP 

within the relevant timeframe.

During COVID-19, homebuyers were continually engaged 

via virtual platforms. In 2020, CDL organised three online 

contests and six webinars on health, wellness and home 

design/space planning for our homebuyers.

Engaging Homebuyers in Living Green

Since 2004, CDL has implemented the Let’s Live Green! 

eco-home initiative for our newly completed residential 

properties. As part of the initiative, every homebuyer 

will receive a Green Living Guide, designed specifically 

to provide eco-friendly tips for a green lifestyle and to 

encourage active usage of green features and facilities 

catered within the individual property units and in the 

common areas. Soft copies of the Green Living Guide 

were distributed to homebuyers of Forest Woods when 

the development obtained TOP in November 2020.

Engaging Tenants in our Green Initiatives

Beyond investing in green infrastructure, we work closely 

with our commercial tenants, given that tenant and 

occupant activities within a building can account for close 

to 50%4 of the total electricity consumption of a building. 

Through our Green Lease Partnership Programme, 

we have shifted user mindsets and behaviour to jointly 

achieve progress for the worldwide green movement and 

dovetail nationwide efforts with BCA’s Green Building 

Masterplan for Singapore’s future.

CDL implemented the Green Lease Partnership 

Programme since 2014 to support our 

commercial tenants’ efforts to lower their carbon 

footprint. Since end-2017, 100% of existing 

tenants have pledged their commitment to go 

green by signing a Green Lease. Some Green 

Lease Partnership Programme activities include: 

• All new tenants receive kits comprising green 

guidelines and checklists to help them in 

fitting out works and operations.

• CDL annually conducts various end-user 

initiatives, e.g. conducting eco-themed 

movie screenings, talks and workshops on 

environmental-related issues.

• In support of World Green Building Week 2020, 

CDL conducted a quiz reaching out to close 

to 1,000 tenants on reducing their carbon 

footprint in the workplace and the intrinsic 

links between green and healthy workplaces.

Delivering Leading Quality Buildings  

and High Safety Standards 

CONQUAS. Our developments have consistently excelled 

under the BCA CONQUAS scheme, the de facto national 

standard assessment system on the quality of buildings. 

While it is not mandatory for private sector projects 

to subscribe to BCA CONQUAS, CDL has consistently 

pushed for all our projects to be assessed ever since the 

assessment system was introduced. The outcome of our 

CONQUAS score for projects that obtained TOP in 2020 is 

still pending at the time of this publication.

BCA Quality Excellence. In 2020, CDL emerged as the 

only developer to be conferred the Quality Excellence 

Award – Quality Champion (Platinum) for eight 

consecutive years. This is a testament to our steadfast 

commitment to delivering quality green homes and 

commercial spaces. 

BCA Quality Mark. A voluntary scheme for developers, 

BCA Quality Mark measures the quality of workmanship 

in each newly completed residential unit, covering 

all internal finishes such as flooring, wall and ceiling 

finishes, architectural components and fittings, and M&amp;E 

fittings and switches. In 2020, CDL applied for the BCA 

Quality Mark certification for 1,384 residential units that 

we had developed. The outcome of this is still pending at 

the time of this publication.

Figures for 2019 have been restated to correspond with BCA’s IQuas platform. In 2019, there were no projects that obtained TOP status.

Social Inclusion through Universal Design 

In line with our commitment to putting users’ needs as a 

priority in the spaces we build, CDL instituted a company-

wide Universal Design Policy since 2011. Endorsed by 

CDL’s top management, the policy exceeds the mandatory 

requirements specified in the Code of Barrier-Free 

Accessibility by BCA to create an inclusive built environment 

in Singapore that caters to the varied needs of the public. 

CDL also strives to work towards achieving BCA Universal 

Design Mark GoldPLUS certification, where possible, for all its 

new developments. We will do so by integrating user-centric 

philosophy into our design, operations and maintenance 

and contribute largely to an inclusive and barrier-free built 

environment. In 2020, Haus on Handy and The Tapestry 

clinched the BCA Universal Design Mark Gold Award. 

Data Privacy 

Information security materials are made available 

to better educate stakeholders on prevailing risks, 

especially in the handling of sensitive corporate data. 

Since 2014, we have implemented a Data Privacy Policy 

which informs stakeholders on how CDL manages 

personal data in compliance with the Singapore 

Personal Data Protection Act (No. 26 of 2012). 

Customers and business partners can get in touch with 

our Data Protection Officer by mail, email and phone 

on matters concerning their personal data with CDL. 

The Data Privacy Policy is available to the public on our 

corporate website.

CDL’s Social Media Guidelines advocate employees’ 

responsibility on the use of social media, including taking 

precautions for the protection of information privacy. In 

2020, there was zero substantiated complaint concerning 

breaches of customer privacy, theft, leak and loss of 

customer data or critical information.

Buildings are responsible for almost 40% of global 

energy-related carbon emissions and 50% of global 

material use. The real estate industry’s high carbon 

footprint puts CDL in the position to drive change by 

implementing robust strategies to mitigate, measure, 

and report our environmental impact. As Singapore 

ramps up its sustainability drive with the Singapore 

Green Plan 2030, we will intensify our decarbonisation 

efforts and continue to work closely with like-minded 

partners to limit global temperature rise to no more 

than 1.5oC. 

STEPPING UP IN THE GLOBAL RACE TO  

NET ZERO





In line with our firm commitment to sustainability, we 

remain steadfast in taking the lead on decarbonisation 

towards a low-carbon future. In September 2019, CDL 

was one of the pioneering 87 companies to sign on to 

the Business Ambition for 1.5°C led by UNGC, SBTi and 

We Mean Business coalition. CDL will be setting a more 

ambitious carbon emissions reduction target in line with 

a 1.5°C future by September 2021.

Recognising the financial implications and business 

risks of climate change, CDL also completed two 

climate change scenario analyses, in line with the TCFD 

recommendations, as a means of testing our strategic 

resilience against different plausible and science-based 

climate scenarios. 

After months of review and deliberate planning, we 

became the first real estate developer in Singapore and 

the first real estate conglomerate in Southeast Asia to 

pledge our support to the WorldGBC’s Net Zero Carbon 

Buildings Commitment in February 2021.

By joining the Commitment, CDL is dedicated to 

achieving net zero operational carbon by 2030 for 

our new and existing wholly-owned assets and 

developments under our direct operational and 

management control. Pledging to the WorldGBC’s Net 

Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment will entail CDL 

disclosing, reducing and verifying operating Scope 1 

and 2 emissions of our managed buildings, including 

our corporate office in Singapore.

Our net zero pledge complements the Singapore 

government’s strong commitment to climate action and 

sustainability. The latest announcement of the Singapore 

Green Plan 2030 includes setting ambitious and concrete 

targets on a sectoral basis and pushing for the adoption 

of BCA SLE-certified buildings.

1 

The Climate Group is an international non-profit organisation, founded in 2004, that works with businesses and government leaders globally to 

address climate change by focussing on renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions.

2 

The Alliance to Save Energy is a coalition consisting largely of industrial, technological and energy corporations that promotes energy efficiency to 

achieve a healthier economy, a cleaner environment, and greater energy security.

To achieve the ambitious net zero goal, CDL will strive to 

reduce our carbon emissions, including retrofitting our 

managed buildings to further enhance energy efficiency 

and accelerating the transition to renewable energy. 

As a signatory to the Commitment, CDL is also an 

EP100 member, an initiative led by The Climate Group1 

in partnership with the Alliance to Save Energy2. EP100 

is a corporate commitment platform through which 

companies pledge to improve their energy productivity 

by deploying energy-efficient technologies and practices, 

and has a global outreach with member companies 

operating in over 130 markets.

Pioneering Adoption of Carbon Neutrality

Since 2009, CDL has been voluntarily reducing 

our annual carbon emissions to net zero for our 

corporate office operations including our data 

centre, and 11 Tampines Concourse – the first 

CarbonNeutral® development in Singapore and the 

Asia Pacific. 

As an extension of our commitment to carbon 

neutrality, we joined the UN Climate Neutral Now 

Pledge in 2020 to commit maintaining carbon 

neutrality for our corporate office operations and 

11 Tampines Concourse. In March 2021, we further 

committed under this pledge to achieve net zero 

operational carbon for the rest of our wholly-

owned buildings and developments under our 

direct operational and management control.

CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIO ANALYSIS OF 1.5°C WARMER SCENARIO 

Aligned with the recommendations of TCFD, IPCC, and best practices for climate risk analysis, CDL completed our first climate change scenario planning in 2018 to identify the risks, 

opportunities and strategies associated with 4°C and 2°C warmer scenarios. As an extension of this study, CDL completed a second study for a 1.5°C warmer scenario in 2020 to align 

with the IPCC 1.5°C Special Report.

This scenario study covers both transition risks (which incorporates policy risk, technology risk, market risk and reputation risk) and physical risks—across three key CDL business units in 

different regions. The study employs a systematic and cohesive approach to identify and assess the hotspots of exposure to climate risks and opportunities in CDL’s selected portfolio. 

Note 1: CDL has retrofitted all its existing managed buildings in Singapore to achieve greater energy efficiency. We will step up advocacy efforts to encourage the implementation of best in class energy-saving measures for CDL managed 

properties in other regions.

Note 2: This transition risk is not applicable for completed buildings under the investment properties and hotel operations units.

* CDL does not have any development properties in the USA.

are currently not cost-efficient but may become so under a high carbon price scenario. CDL may also enjoy 

energy cost savings if all CDL hotels are retrofitted to the highest energy efficiency standard.

Key Findings and Strategies

Based on the study, CDL can expect a net negative impact of $82 million on our operating profits in 2030 in a 1.5°C warmer scenario – using 2018 as the baseline year. A majority of the 

negative impact is attributed to transition risks, with maximum impact on our Development Properties unit due to anticipated changes in building standards and construction costs. 

Given the likely impact of relevant climate-related risks on CDL’s operations, reputation and profitability, we will consider strategies including:

Carbon Emissions Performance

Given the significant drop in activities4 at our assets 

and developments due to COVID-19, CDL achieved a 

significant carbon emissions intensity reduction of 44% 

as compared to the baseline year of 2007. Total carbon 

emissions in 2020 was also 14% lower across all CDL’s 

business operations in Singapore, excluding hotel 

properties, as compared to 2019.

Historically for CDL, the largest source of emissions 

is electricity usage reported as Scope 2 emissions in 

the charts. This frames our carbon mitigation strategy 

to focus on reducing Scope 2 emissions. Details can 

be found under “Energy Reduction Strategy and 

Performance”.

CDL recognises the importance of addressing Scope 3 

emissions, which are indicators of exposure to climate 

risks in our supply chain or use of products. We monitor 

and report Scope 3 emissions to enhance our carbon 

reduction efforts by identifying large emission sources 

along our value chain. Details can be found under 

“Driving Sustainable Supply Chain and Sourcing”.

Common amenities in retail malls were closed, and no events were allowed at mall atriums. For CDL’s commercial buildings and corporate office, most employees were on WFH arrangements to reduce their risk of exposure to 

COVID-19. Construction activities were disrupted for months to curb the spread of COVID-19 amongst the workers.

ENERGY REDUCTION STRATEGY  

AND PERFORMANCE 

Electricity constitutes a significant proportion of CDL’s 

operational expenditure. It impacts the total amount 

of Scope 2 emissions released through our business 

activities. CDL places great emphasis on cost-effectively 

improving our energy performance to reduce carbon 

emissions and energy intensities. With this priority in 

mind, we were the first developer in Singapore to achieve 

the ISO 50001 energy management system certification 

for asset management in 2014. We have since continued 

to set energy reduction targets for our managed 

properties in Singapore, while continually improving 

their energy performance through careful review and 

implementation of energy management plans.

Lifecycle Approach to Energy Management

We take a holistic view towards energy reduction by 

adopting measures across the various stages of a building’s 

lifecycle—from design and construction to operation of 

the asset. Each business unit adheres to the following 

guidelines that detail the strategic initiatives, performance 

standards, and specific requirements relating to energy 

efficiency and climate mitigation measures.

Energy Reduction Initiatives

Since 2004, CDL has retrofitted all our managed 

buildings by upgrading chiller plants, introducing 

motion sensors, installing energy-efficient lighting, and 

recladding facades. Implementation of new energy-

saving initiatives was postponed in 2020 due to COVID-19. 

However, our efforts from previous initiatives since 2012 

continued to yield an estimated annual energy savings 

of around 16.1 million kWh, equivalent to more than 

$3.8 million of cost savings. We have also incorporated 

climate-resilient design and installations, such as green 

roofs and vertical green walls, into our investment 

properties to reduce heat gain and mitigate the urban 

heat island effect. 

Since 2014, we have been implementing our Green 

Lease Partnership Programme to engage and encourage 

tenants to adopt energy conservation measures. We 

have maintained a 100% programme participation rate 

for our retail and office tenants in 2020. As part of the 

programme, CDL’s building managers guide tenants on 

“greening” their offices by providing advice on indoor 

greenery and energy and water conservation measures. 

In partnership with Tuas Power, we introduced the 

automated meter reading portal initiative in 2014 for our 

tenants to monitor their electricity use on a near real-

time basis. This empowers our tenants to keep tabs on 

their individual units’ energy consumption and formulate 

initiatives to achieve energy savings. Over the years, we 

have also actively engaged tenants in CDL’s sustainability 

outreach efforts, such as World Green Building Week 

2020, to raise awareness and promote green practices. 

Accelerating Renewable Energy Solutions 

The adoption of renewable energy is integral in the 

design and construction of our projects. In addition to the 

installation of PV panels at selected investment buildings 

since the early 2000s, we also started to progressively 

participate in the emerging RECs marketplace since 

2017. In 2018, CDL was the first Singapore developer to 

purchase RECs using SP Group’s blockchain-enabled 

platform. By procuring locally-sourced RECs, CDL 

attributed 100% of the electricity consumed by our 

headquarters’ operations and part of our commercial 

buildings’ operations in 2020 to renewable sources. 

This offset 1,184 tonnes of carbon emissions in 2020, 

equivalent to powering over 611 typical 4-room HDB 

flats for one year. More details on CDL’s partnerships 

and innovations to boost our on-site renewable energy 

generation may be found here.

Energy Efficiency and Reduction Performance 

As part of our ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 environmental 

and energy management systems, CDL has been 

tracking and reporting our environmental performance 

against our energy targets since 2007. 

We regularly review the energy reduction and efficiency 

plans for all our properties and introduce initiatives 

where areas for improvement are identified. For 

instance, plans are underway to incorporate more 

advanced energy-efficient air handling units and upgrade 

instrumentation at selected properties. 

Our current targets aim to reduce energy use intensity5 

by 45% from 2007 levels for office and industrial 

buildings, and 18% from 2010 levels for retail buildings, 

by 2030. We surpassed both targets, with a performance 

of 48% and 30% reduction respectively. CDL will update 

our energy targets for our managed buildings and 

corporate office to follow suit as we review our SBTi-

validated carbon targets to align with a 1.5°C warmer 

scenario-compliant business model. 

We monitor and drive energy efficiency and reduction 

improvements through target and performance tracking 

for development projects. Our current targets are to 

achieve an energy use intensity of 95 kWh/m2 or less 

by 2030, with an interim target of 105 kWh/m2 or less 

in 2020, for completed projects that have obtained TOP 

in the reporting year. In 2020, the energy use intensity 

of completed projects was 82.12 kWh/m2, surpassing 

our target. For all active construction sites in 2020, the 

energy use intensity was 108 kWh/m2. 

Due to COVID-19, all construction projects were 

halted for four to five months during Circuit Breaker. 

Subsequently, when Circuit Breaker ended, work 

progress was slow. During this time, energy was still 

used to maintain the construction projects. As energy 

use intensity is based on energy used per constructed 

area for that year, these disruptions contributed to higher 

annual energy use intensity in 2020.

Performance in 2020 was tracked and reported against 

interim targets in our Future Value 2030 sustainability 

blueprint.

5 

Energy use intensity is for purchased electricity, as base year levels were calculated using purchased electricity only.

is located, water supply to our core activities is 

especially vital as our operations are water-intensive. As 

Singapore’s national water agency, PUB is responsible 

for the collection, production, distribution and 

reclamation of water in Singapore. PUB’s Four National 

Taps strategy has created a robust and diversified 

water supply that has served the nation since 2005. 

Approximately 30% of Singapore’s water demand is 

currently met by water from local catchment areas and 

imported water, while NEWater and desalinated water 

make up the remaining 40% and 30% respectively6. CDL 

takes a holistic approach towards water management 

to maintain and enhance the efficiency, resilience, 

desirability and long-term value of our assets and 

developments. Responsible water management practices 

allow us to deliver value to our homeowners and tenants 

through water and cost savings. 

CDL draws both potable and NEWater (for non-potable 

use) from PUB’s utility network supplied through taps, and 

utilises the water for building operations and maintenance 

activities in our managed buildings. Most of the water 

consumption in commercial buildings is for cooling 

towers, toilets, pantries, water features, irrigation and 

washing activities. In our construction sites, potable water 

is used mostly by our contractors for sanitation purposes.

Singapore Water Story, PUB, Singapore’s national water agency. 

Notes:

• 

All potable water withdrawal comes from a single third-party water 

source supplied by PUB. The breakdown of water sources is based 

on PUB’s Our Water, Our Future report. 

• 

Based on PUB’s Our Water, Our Future report, all potable water and 

NEWater are categorised as freshwater with Total Dissolved Solids 

levels of ≤1,000 mg/L.

• 

Based on WRI’s Technical Note on Aqueduct Projected Water Stress 

Country Rankings, the entire area of Singapore is identified to be of 

high physical risk. The physical risk tool identifies areas of concern 

exposed to water risks (e.g. droughts or floods) that may impact 

short- or long-term water availability. As such, all water withdrawal 

is from water-stressed areas.

Lifecycle Approach to Water Management

As part of our robust water management strategy, CDL 

focusses on effective management of water quality 

and usage across every project’s development and 

management lifecycle stages. For instance, Amber Park, 

a BCA Green Mark GoldPLUS development, features an 

automatic water-efficient irrigation system that harvests 

rainwater for landscape irrigation. This, along with other 

water-saving features, will achieve an estimated reduction 

in 110,000m3 of potable water usage per annum. 

Water Reduction Initiatives

CDL also performs an annual review of our utility bills to better 

identify buildings that are high in water usage. Monthly water 

consumption by our key business units is closely tracked to 

detect any spikes in water usage that require attention. To 

reduce reliance on potable water, CDL uses NEWater wherever 

possible for operations that do not require potable water.

To date, 12 out of 13 CDL’s managed buildings (92% of 

our building portfolio) have been certified as “Water-

Efficient Buildings” by PUB for outstanding efforts in water 

conservation. Recognising that water conservation is a shared 

responsibility, CDL engages our tenants and homebuyers 

through initiatives such as our Green Lease Partnership 

Programme and Green Living Guide. These initiatives aim to 

promote good water conservation practices that complement 

CDL’s water-efficient design and features of our buildings. 

In 2007, CDL was one of the first recipients of the inaugural 

Watermark Award by PUB. Since the inception of PUB’s 

ABC Waters certification in 2010, CDL has attained the 

certification for eight developments. Our H2O Residences 

was the first private development to be ABC Waters-certified 

due to its seamless integration with surrounding water 

bodies and park.

Water Efficiency and 

Reduction Performance

Recognising that holistic water 

management enhances the 

long-term value of our assets 

and developments, we have 

continuously implemented 

water conservation initiatives and tracked our water 

performance since 2007. CDL achieved the 2020 CDP  

A List in water security, an affirmation of CDL’s robust 

water management strategy.

Notes:

• 

Water used and water use intensity are for potable water only. 

Tertiary treated NEWater usage is not included.

• 

Total amount of water withdrawn is the same as the total 

amount of water discharged into third-party water (i.e. PUB 

sewers) with negligible amounts of water consumed. Hence, the 

total amount of water used is reported here.

To maintain our strong track record, we regularly review the 

water management plans for all our properties and introduce 

initiatives where areas for improvement are identified. 

Due to decreased activities caused by COVID-19, there 

was a significant fall in water intensity for our managed 

buildings and corporate office in 2020 compared to 2019. 

Conversely, absolute water consumption increased for 

construction sites in 2020, as there were more project 

developments with deep basement construction that 

required more water for soil stabilisation measures.  

The disruption of construction activities during the Circuit 

Breaker period led to a fall in the completed GFA of each site 

compared to previous years, resulting in higher water use 

intensity. Despite the disruption to construction activities, 

water was still required for basic site maintenance.

WASTE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY  

AND PERFORMANCE

In land-scarce Singapore, general waste is sent to 

the waste-to-energy incineration plant, where energy 

is recovered. The resulting incinerated ash is then 

transported to our only landfill — Semakau Island — for 

disposal. CDL engages NEA-licensed vendors to collect, 

treat and recycle waste from our managed buildings and 

construction sites.

* 

Figures for CDL have been restated to include water consumption from corporate office pantries.

Recognising that Semakau Landfill is expected to run out 

of space by 2035, we are driven to effectively manage and 

reduce our waste generation7. CDL targets to reduce the 

waste intensity by 16% (from 2016 levels) for our office 

and industrial buildings and 12% (from 2016 levels) for 

retail buildings by 2030. We also intend to cap the waste 

intensity from our construction sites at 40 kg/m2 by 2030.

We continuously invest, innovate, and adopt leading-

edge technology such as PPVC to significantly reduce 

construction waste. As a real estate developer and asset 

manager, the bulk of our waste is generated by our 

contractors and tenants. All of CDL’s generated waste at 

both the construction sites and managed buildings are 

disposed of in accordance with local waste regulations.

Lifecycle Approach to Waste Management

CDL remains steadfast in managing our waste efficiently 

and seeks to reduce, reuse, and recycle our waste across 

every stage of our project lifecycle. Adopting the waste 

management hierarchy approach, we focus on reducing 

waste at the source before considering reusing and recycling.

Waste Reduction Performance

In line with the principles of a circular economy, CDL is 

committed to waste minimisation and efficient use of 

resources throughout the lifecycle of our construction 

sites and managed buildings. As part of our holistic EHS 

management system framework, we continually review 

our waste minimisation and recycling initiatives for all 

our properties. 

In 2020, general, non-hazardous waste generation 

declined by 3,074 tonnes from 2019 largely due to both 

WFH arrangements and the closing of non-essential 

services during the Circuit Breaker period that resulted 

in fewer employees in the workplace and fewer visitors to 

our retail properties. 

In the same year, about 567 tonnes of recyclable waste 

were collected from our managed buildings, 93% of 

which was paper. Since 2017, we have engaged tenants 

across all managed buildings to participate in our 

paper recycling programme. At our retail properties, 

recycling bins and facilities are provided to encourage 

the recycling of paper, plastic and metal by shoppers and 

tenants. In 2020, City Square Mall reported a recycling 

rate of 27%, which is above the national recycling rate of 

11.4%8 for large malls. Out of 515 tonnes of recyclable 

waste collected at City Square Mall, 11 tonnes were 

attributed to food waste composted.

8 

The latest publicly available recycling rate for large malls is 11.4% in 2019 from NEA’s Findings of the Mandatory Waste Reporting Exercise.

9 

The use of PPVC became mandatory for selected residential non-landed Government Land Sale (GLS) sites from 1 November 2014 onwards. Prior to this regulation, CDL voluntarily embarked on a pioneering effort to build 

Singapore’s first large-scale PPVC residential development (The Brownstone EC) in early 2014, setting the benchmark and world record of engaging close to 4,100 modules that were prefabricated offsite and assembled on-site.

In 2020, construction waste disposed of at all CDL active 

construction sites amounted to 3,452 tonnes, with a 

waste intensity of 54.5kg/m2. This is higher than waste 

intensities in 2018 and 2019 due to lower completed 

GFAs for our construction sites, as a result of COVID-19 

disruptions on construction activities.

MINIMISING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 

CDL is dedicated to mitigating the impact of our 

developments on the environment and surrounding 

communities. We are also committed to complying with 

all applicable EHS legal requirements enforced by local 

authorities, such as BCA, NEA, PUB, MOM and Singapore 

Civil Defence Force. Through constant monitoring, 

evaluation and auditing of our ISO 14001 and  

ISO 45001-certified EHS management systems, CDL 

actively ensures that all our activities and operations 

comply with existing regulatory requirements.

Managing Water Discharge at Construction Sites 

The discharge of wastewater into the public sewerage 

system and open drains, canals and rivers are strictly 

regulated by PUB and NEA. To ensure that Total 

Dissolved Solids (TDS) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) 

readings of the discharged water do not exceed the legal 

limit of 1,000 mg/litre and 50 mg/litre respectively10, 

CDL works closely with all our contractors to track the 

quality of water discharged into public sewerage and 

drainage systems. At all our construction sites, Earth 

Control Measures (ECM) are implemented to prevent 

silt from polluting our waterways. In the incidence of 

exceeded TSS readings, prompt corrective actions are 

taken to rectify the issue. CDL will continue to work with 

contractors to increase vigilance in the management of 

water discharge.

Managing Vector and Pest Control  

at Construction Sites 

Recognising that construction sites, if not well-managed, 

can become environments for mosquito breeding and 

rodent infestation, CDL works closely with our main 

contractors to ensure that effective systems are in place 

to prevent pests and curb dengue transmission amongst 

workers and residents around our worksites. 

The ISO 45001 occupational health and safety 

management system and CDL 5-Star EHS Assessment 

provide a risk management framework to identify and 

mitigate the risks associated with vector and pest control 

at construction sites. In addition to ensuring that our 

contractors schedule and conduct regular housekeeping 

on-site, we require that they maintain comprehensive 

pest surveillance and control programmes. We actively 

engage our contractors and their workers through 

awareness building and educational talks to ensure 

effective vector control and minimise incurring fines for 

vector breeding.

Managing Impacts on Communities 

We provide avenues for the public to raise enquiries or 

feedback on EHS-related matters. Hotlines managed by 

our appointed main contractors are set-up and made 

publicly available at all construction sites. Upon receiving 

EHS-related feedback such as noise or dust nuisance to 

the community, the sites will implement controls in the 

surrounding area to address the feedback and prevent 

further incidences. 

In Singapore, NEA regulates the noise levels from 

construction sites, with a set of permissible noise 

limits that vary depending on the time of day and type 

of neighbouring premises. To protect nearby residents, 

we emphasise our main contractors to comply with 

the construction noise limits at all our construction 

sites. To minimise noise-related complaints, our main 

contractors are encouraged to implement an active 

management programme and take all necessary action 

to address related complaints. As part of our efforts to 

keep the community informed about construction status, 

schedules of the progress at each site are communicated 

to inform the community about upcoming works.

Incidents of Non-compliance

In 2020, seven environmental fines were imposed on 

our main contractors across seven construction sites. 

Two were for performing construction activities above 

the noise limit, and the remaining five were for vector 

breeding. One stop-work order was received from NEA 

for vector breeding. There were two fines issued to our 

managed properties in 2020 – one for vector breeding, 

and the other for the delayed renewal of a building’s 

Fire Certificate (CDL had renewed the certificate on 

the previous portal without knowing the change in the 

platform). All issues were resolved immediately.

To prevent future occurrences of non-compliance, we 

have reviewed and streamlined our current processes 

to improve and tighten our EHS practices. Since 2001, 

the CDL 5-Star EHS Assessment – an independent audit 

tool used to assess, measure, and improve the main 

contractors’ EHS management and performance was put 

in place to ensure a comprehensive, audited, and appraised 

approach to manage and mitigate EHS risks. Details of the 

CDL 5-Star EHS Assessment can be found here.

Supply Chain and Supplier Risk Analysis

For many businesses, Scope 3 emissions can account 

for more than 70% of their carbon footprint.11 Measuring 

and managing these emissions can motivate a company 

to do business with more sustainable suppliers, improve 

the energy efficiency of its products, and rethink its 

sourcing and distribution network – measures that can 

significantly reduce the overall impact on the climate. 

To identify CDL’s sourcing risk, we commenced a Supply 

Chain Segmentation Study on our top 100 suppliers 

and top five raw materials in 2019 and completed the 

exercise in 2020. The study is an expansion of the supply 

chain scenario planning conducted in 2017, which 

helped strengthen the company’s understanding of 

how emerging trends, such as automation and climate 

change, presented risks and opportunities to our supply 

chain strategy.

In developing the risk segmentation matrix of suppliers 

and raw materials, environmental12 and social risks13 

were studied. These risk scores were blended to 

generate social and environmental risk segmentation 

matrices, with risk profiles of the suppliers and raw 

materials studied. Each supplier and raw material were 

evaluated for risk and leverage levels and placed within 

four categories within the risk segmentation matrices.

DRIVING SUSTAINABLE 

SUPPLY CHAIN AND 

SOURCING

Supply chain risk management is 

essential to prepare businesses for 

events such as natural disasters, 

extreme weather conditions 

and health pandemics that can 

lead to transport or supply chain 

disruptions. 

CDL proactively engages key 

stakeholders to embrace safe and environmentally-

friendly designs as well as best operational practices 

throughout the lifecycle of our developments. We achieve 

this by establishing clear procurement guidelines and 

specifications for our vendors to reduce the overall 

environmental impact of our projects and managed 

buildings, such as by using only sustainable and non-toxic 

building materials.

For CDL’s robust efforts in working with our supplier 

network to address climate change, we were the 

only real estate company in Southeast Asia and only 

Singapore company to be awarded the 2020 CDP 

Supplier Engagement Leader. The recognition places 

CDL amongst the top 7% of companies assessed by CDP 

for supplier engagement on climate change. 



11 World Resources Institute, 2016.

12 Environmental risk scores were derived from an index covering several environmental issues including wastewater, flood risk, water stress, environmental management and a carbon emissions intensity for each of the exporting 

countries identified.

13 Social risk scores were derived from human rights vulnerability and forced labour data for each of the product and raw materials studied.

From the study, around 19% of our top 100 suppliers, 

mostly our key contractors, fall under the “Priority” risk 

category due to potentially high social and environmental 

risks and high leverage. Furthermore, the study on raw 

materials revealed that eight raw materials and their 

source countries fall under the “Priority” risk category. 

Moving forward, CDL plans to glean further insights 

through targeted, issue-specific supplier engagement 

to understand and influence issues, including product 

sourcing and use and migrant workers management. As 

the company enhances diversification of raw material and 

source countries to minimise future supply chain risks, we 

will also continue to explore carbon emissions reduction 

solutions in building design and materials, such as the 

usage of innovative carbon-negative building materials.

A BCA Green Mark Platinum-certified building, the 

SSA is the first building in Singapore to have its 

construction materials, Cross Laminated Timber 

and Glued Laminated Timber, verified by the Nature’s 

BarcodeTM system as coming from responsible 

sources. The entire facility is built with over 80% 

of structural materials that come from sustainable 

sources.

As part of CDL’s efforts to support circular economy 

solutions, in November 2020, we retrofitted the SSA with 

an outdoor deck made from recycled resources. Made 

from 95% recycled materials comprising 65% reclaimed 

Forest Stewardship Council15 certified wood and 30% 

polyethylene, the deck is highly durable, safe, and has 

a low environmental impact. It has been awarded the 

highest-tiered certification by SGBC.

We also took the opportunity to retrofit the SSA 

partnership name plaques with recycled acrylic at the 

Using Sustainable Materials for the Singapore Sustainability Academy (SSA)



Procurement of Sustainable Materials

As supply chain issues progress up the rung of priorities 

for effective ESG integration and management, CDL 

continues to maintain high standards in our supply 

chain management through rigorous requirements and 

supplier engagement.

For more than a decade, CDL has been implementing 

sustainable procurement guidelines that contain clear 

specifications for responsible sourcing along our 

supply chain. This includes the implementation of the 

Responsible Procurement Guidelines14 since 2008, 

and the Green Procurement Guideline for property 

developments since 2009. In line with our corporate EHS 

Policy introduced in 2003, these guidelines encourage 

the use of eco-friendly and recycled materials that have 

been certified by approved local certification bodies, such 

as SGBC and SEC. In December 2020, to further advance 

CDL’s green building ambition, CDL developed a Smart, 

Sustainable and Super Low Energy (3S) Green Building 

Framework, which includes encouraging stakeholders to 

use low embodied carbon materials.

Our guidelines also indicate our preference for ISO 14001, 

OHSAS 18001, ISO 45001, and/or bizSAFE Level 3 certified 

vendors. In key operations like project development and 

property management, major suppliers and contractors 

must meet the EHS pre-qualification criteria. All suppliers 

are required to sign a Supplier Code of Conduct, which 

provides comprehensive guiding principles for our vendors 

and suppliers to comply with CDL’s expectations, including 

environment, health, safety, and ethical employment.

14 Renamed from Green Procurement Guidelines in 2020.

15 The Forest Stewardship Council provides certification of timber products that originate from forests that are managed responsibly and sustainably. 

16 These refer to suppliers appointed by AM, and main contractors and key consultants (architects, civil &amp; structural engineers, mechanical &amp; electrical engineers) appointed by PD.

17 Of the new suppliers appointed in 2020, 85% were certified by recognised health and safety standards (e.g. ISO 45001, OHSAS 18001, and minimum bizSAFE Level 3 certificates), and 4% were certified by recognised environmental 

standards (e.g. ISO 14001).

We have established a target to ensure 100% of appointed 

suppliers16 are certified by recognised EHS standards, 

by 2030. In 2020, 100% of our main contractors and key 

consultants for property development obtained recognised 

EHS certifications. Before awarding development project 

contracts, CDL reviews and evaluates the EHS culture 

and track record of potential suppliers and contractors. 

In 2020, 93%17 of suppliers appointed by the asset 

management department were certified by recognised 

EHS standards. Going forward, we will review our targets 

and deepen supplier engagement to progressively 

enhance our supply chain.

Embodied Carbon Emissions from 

Construction Materials 

Embodied carbon refers to the carbon dioxide equivalent 

or GHG emissions associated with the non-operational 

phase of a building. It includes emissions caused by 

extraction, manufacturing, transportation, assembly, 

maintenance, replacement, deconstruction, disposal and 

end-of-life aspects of the materials and systems that 

make up a building.

Building and construction industries are responsible 

for some 40% of all carbon emissions in the world, with 

operational emissions accounting for 28%. The remaining 

11% comes from embodied carbon emissions.18 As such, 

calls for a shift to a lifecycle thinking have intensified, 

and embodied carbon has become an increasingly 

important area for all sectors of the built environment to 

actively address.

As part of our SBTi-validated GHG reduction targets, CDL 

has committed to reducing the embodied carbon of our 

building materials by 24%, instead of their conventional 

equivalents, by 2030. Further, we anticipate carbon-

intensive construction materials such as steel and 

cement to become increasingly costly. 

We also monitor and report embodied carbon 

performance of our projects against our adopted 

targets to enhance CDL’s supply chain management and 

encourage the use of low-carbon alternatives. 

An interim target of a 7% reduction in embodied carbon 

of building materials compared to their conventional 

equivalents was set for all new projects awarded from 

2018 onwards. Several projects awarded from 2018 

are expected to obtain TOP by 2022. We will continue 

to track the performance of these projects against the 

current interim target19 and raise the next interim target 

as necessary to map our phased progress towards 

the 2030 target of a 24% reduction. Awarded in 2017, 

Forest Woods obtained TOP in 2020 and achieved a 

24.4% reduction in embodied carbon through the use of 

sustainable materials. 

Managing Impacts of Top Building Materials 

Globally, cement manufacturing and steel production are 

responsible for around 7%20 and 7-9%21 of global carbon 

emissions, respectively. Hence, we must reduce the use 

of these materials as we work towards achieving our 

embodied carbon intensity targets.

At CDL, we apply a circular economy approach to the 

materials used for our development projects. To close 

the waste loop, we use recycled construction materials, 

such as recycled steel and concrete, wherever applicable. 

On top of this, we encourage the use of alternative low-

carbon materials at our sites. We are also constantly 

on the lookout for innovative building materials and 

methods to facilitate the transition.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

To demonstrate our commitment towards excellence in 

corporate governance, CDL had, since 2010, joined the 

Securities Investors Association (Singapore) and its partners 

by making a Statement of Support. In 2020, CDL was 

ranked 3rd in the Singapore Governance and Transparency 

Index (SGTI) 2020, marking a steady improvement in CDL’s 

performance over the last three years. The SGTI assesses 

companies on their corporate governance disclosure 

and practices, as well as the timeliness, accessibility and 

transparency of the announcement of their financial results. 

For our full Corporate Governance Report, please refer to 

CDL’s Annual Report 2020. 

Diversity on the Board

Since 28 August 2015, our Board has supported the 

Board Diversity Pledge initiated by the Singapore Institute 

of Directors (SID) and SGX-ST. In 2017, the board-level 

Nominating Committee adopted a formal Board Diversity 

Policy, which sets out a clear policy and framework for 

promoting diversity on CDL’s Board. CDL has achieved at 

least 20% female representation in the Board since 2018, 

meeting the Nominating Committee’s target and Council for 

Board Diversity’s recommendation of having at least 20% 

female board representation by 2020. As of end-2020, CDL 

has two female directors (20%) out of 10 directors1.

1 

Ms Jenny Lim and Ms Carol Fong are independent non-executive female directors of CDL. Ms Tan Yee Peng resigned from the Board effective from 30 December 2020.



CDL’s commitment as a responsible business and employer 

of choice continues to guide us through the COVID-19 

pandemic. Our corporate policies and ESG commitments 

have built a strong foundation for corporate governance, 

earning the trust of our stakeholders to generate 

sustainable growth. We are dedicated to preserving and 

upgrading our workforce, as well as providing safe spaces 

for our building users amidst the crisis.

BUSINESS ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE

The Board and Senior Management remain steadfast 

in conducting business with integrity, consistent with 

high standards of business ethics and in compliance 

with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. 

In 2020, CDL had no incidents of non-compliance with 

socio-economic laws and regulations, including legal 

requirements of marketing and advertising practices, for 

which significant fines or non-monetary sanctions were 

issued to the Company. There was also zero incidents 

of anti-competitive behaviour or monopolistic practices 

within CDL.

Our business principles and practices regarding matters 

that may have ethical implications are embedded 

in the CDL Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. It 

communicates CDL’s stance for all staff to observe CDL’s 

principles such as honesty, integrity, responsibility and 

accountability at all organisational levels and when 

conducting official business, in dealing with customers, 

suppliers and colleagues. It is published on the staff 

intranet and easily accessible by all employees.

The code provides guidance on issues such as:

• Conflicts of interest and the appropriate disclosures 

to be made

• CDL’s stance against corruption and bribery

• Compliance with applicable laws and regulations, 

including those relating to the protection of the 

environment and the conservation of energy and 

natural resources

• Compliance with CDL’s policies and procedures, 

including those on internal controls and accounting

• Protection and use of CDL’s assets, confidential 

information and intellectual property rights, 

including the respect of the intellectual property 

rights of third parties 

• Competition and fair dealing in the conduct of CDL’s 

business, in staff’s relationships with customers, 

suppliers, competitors and employees.

In 2020, the CDL Conflict of Interest Guidelines was 

rolled out. It aims to prevent any unjustified appointment 

of vendors and reduce possible suggestions that 

unethical actions were taken by employees due to their 

relationship with an external vendor. Accessible to all 

staff through the staff intranet, it sets out guidance 

on identifying any deemed interest with a current or 

prospective vendor. In the event of conflict of interest, 

a staff declaration is mandatory, and the staff shall 

abstain from having any business dealing with the 

identified vendor.

Board Diversity Pledge 

The Board welcomes the push for greater diversity 

in the boardroom, which enhances business 

performance and decision making. CDL supported 

the Board Diversity Pledge initiated by SID and 

SGX-ST, pledging its commitment to promote 

“diversity as a key attribute of a well-functioning 

and effective Board” and sharing the view “that 

a diverse Board will enhance decision making 

by harnessing the variety of skills, industry and 

business experiences, gender, age, ethnicity and 

culture, geographical background and nationalities, 

tenure of service, and other distinguishing qualities 

of the members of the Board.”

CORPORATE POLICIES AND GUIDELINES 

The CDL corporate policies provide guiding principles 

on business conduct to ensure all employees and 

stakeholders across our value chain support the 

company’s commitment to sustainability. To enhance 

our corporate transparency, the corporate policies 

and guidelines are made publicly available on our 

corporate website (www.cdl.com.sg), dedicated 

sustainability microsite (www.cdlsustainability.com) 

and our staff intranet. 

Relevant policies have been disseminated to employees 

of CDL’s key subsidiaries and supply chain, where 

applicable. For employees in our subsidiaries outside of 

Singapore, the policies are translated into the required 

local languages. 

CDL is deeply rooted in our commitment to protect 

wildlife biodiversity and minimise the impacts of our 

developments on natural habitats. Since 2010, CDL 

has been voluntarily conducting Biodiversity Impact 

Assessment (BIA) on greenfield sites before construction. 

To advance biodiversity protection and urban greenery, 

we strengthened this approach by formulating a 

dedicated Biodiversity Policy in 2020 that takes reference 

from NParks’ and URA’s new BIA guidelines.

Building upon CDL’s long-established EHS policy and 

green procurement guidelines, we formalised a Green 

Building Policy to provide greener, safer, healthier and 

more inclusive environments for our building users. 

The Green Building Policy sets out the principles of 

integration, optimisation and cost-effectiveness in 

designing, constructing and operating smart, sustainable 

and SLE buildings. 

COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruptions, 

leading to increased scrutiny on sustainability matters. 

In particular, social and health issues have all seen 

increased attention by government bodies, finance and 

business communities. As such, CDL further reviewed 

and enhanced our EHS Policy (introduced in 2003), 

Human Rights Policy (introduced in 2016), and Supplier 

Code of Conduct (introduced in 2015), to mitigate the 

impact of COVID-19 and strengthen links to the CDL 

Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint. 

Board Oversight 

For good corporate governance, all corporate policies 

are reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors 

and/or the relevant board committees or the Senior 

Management. New directors are provided with an 

onboarding manual that includes all our corporate 

policies for their knowledge and compliance.

External Engagement and Due Diligence

With the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing 

of Terrorism Policy introduced in July 2016 to our 

employees in frontline sales and compliance job 

functions, we worked on aligning our policies and 

guidelines with the external marketing agents for CDL’s 

properties. This ensures our business is reasonably 

guarded against the risk of property transactions being 

used to finance terrorism or launder illicit funds.

As part of our due diligence, all direct suppliers of CDL’s 

core operations in Property Development and Asset 

Management are required to endorse their acceptance of 

and compliance with the ethical standards as outlined in 

our Supplier Code of Conduct.

Cybersecurity 

With cyber-attacks becoming more prevalent, targeted 

and complex, we are adopting industry best practices 

and moving beyond technology defence towards a more 

holistic and risk-based cybersecurity framework. The 

objective is to establish a robust foundation to identify 

and protect our critical assets and more importantly, be 

able to detect and respond to threats.

Using proven security solutions, we ensure sensitive  

data is encrypted to safeguard critical information.  

Data recovery strategies and measures, such as data 

backup, are in place to minimise downtime and ensure 

critical information can be made available quickly for 

business continuity.

CDL has established a Cybersecurity Framework to detect, 

protect against and respond to cyber-attacks and crimes, 

and the CDL Computer Security Policies and Standards were 

updated on cybersecurity compliance. Besides embracing the 

Next Generation Anti-Virus software, Advanced Email Security 

Protection solution, Enterprise-Class Firewalls and Intrusion 

Protection System to protect our information assets, our 

Information Technology (IT) department has also deployed the 

User Behavior Analytical solution to enable the identification 

of abnormal user computing behaviours or activities. At the 

same time, we have rolled out an Endpoint Detection and 

Response solution to enable the detection and containment of 

advanced persistence cybersecurity attack threats. 

On top of the above, CDL has also engaged a reputable 

Managed Security Operation Center (mSOC) service provider 

to provide 24/7 security monitoring and incident response

periodic phishing attack simulations were conducted to 

increase our employees’ IT security awareness and vigilance.

Employee Training and Communication

Annually, 100% of our full- and part-time employees are 

required to complete a compulsory online declaration to 

acknowledge that they are aware of, have read, and are 

compliant with CDL’s corporate policies and guidelines. 

Awareness bulletins are published on CDL’s intranet for a quick 

refresher anytime on key elements of CDL’s stance against 

corruption. Fraud risk awareness training and assessments 

covering topics such as bribery and conflicts of interest were 

also conducted for selected front-line business units.

As part of the orientation programme, new hires are 

required to learn about CDL’s Code of Business Conduct 

and Ethics, as well as other related corporate policies 

including Anti-Corruption, Fraud, Competition, and 

Whistleblowing. They are also required to complete a 

self-paced, interactive e-learning module (accessible 

to all employees as well) that provides information and 

guidance to recognise, address, resolve, avoid, and 

prevent instances of corruption. In 2020, 100% of new 

hires were educated with anti-corruption knowledge. 

To increase employees’ vigilance against cybercrime, which is 

exacerbated by the adoption of online working environments 

and operations, several data protection and cybersecurity 

awareness training sessions were conducted in 2020.

Human Rights 

CDL has always upheld the fundamental principles of human 

and workplace rights in places where we operate. Since 2005, 

we have been a signatory to the UNGC’s principles on Human 

Rights and Labour, and are guided by international human 

rights principles as derived from the Universal Declaration of 

Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation’s 

Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

DEDICATION TO OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH,  

SAFETY AND WELL-BEING

In line with our corporate EHS Policy, KPIs are identified 

with targets established and reviewed annually to monitor 

our EHS performance. This ensures that we achieve a 

consistently high EHS standard across the organisation.

Beyond caring for our direct employees, CDL also 

prioritises the health and safety of our workers at our 

construction sites and commercial. All workers at our 

construction sites and properties managed2 by CDL 

are protected under CDL’s stringent health and safety 

management policies and procedures. 

Due to our excellent WSH performance and leadership, 

CDL continues to be recognised as a long-serving 

bizSAFE Mentor3. In 2020, we successfully migrated to 

ISO 45001 occupational health and safety management 

system standard from OHSAS 18001. We will continue 

to leverage industry best practices to ensure that 

occupational health and safety is maintained at their 

highest levels. 

2 

Workers at our managed properties are contracted to provide 

maintenance, cleaning and security services.

CDL’s Approach to EHS Risk Management

EHS Working Committee. All CDL employees are 

represented in the EHS Working Committee through their 

department representatives. Staff can highlight their 

concerns, including WSH issues, directly to the EHS team 

in CDL. Initiatives and activities planned by this committee 

are part of a continual process to ensure and promote 

the health, safety, and well-being of all employees. The 

committee convenes at least once annually to review and 

discuss CDL’s approach to health and safety management.

EHS Working Committee members undergo risk 

management training to lead risk assessments for their 

respective operations. They also attend refresher sessions 

periodically to keep abreast with new developments.

Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk Control. 

CDL conducts hazard identification, risk assessment and 

risk control exercises across our corporate office, and 

100% of our managed buildings and construction sites, 

in line with ISO 45001 management system requirements 

and local legislation. 

As part of CDL’s risk management process, the trained 

EHS Steering Committee is tasked to lead these 

exercises within their department for routine and non-

routine activities, and also conducts cross-departmental 

reviews occasionally. In consultation with the EHS 

department, the members recommend risk mitigation 

methods that commensurate with a hierarchy of controls 

for identified hazards. 

As employees who conduct site visits and inspections are 

exposed to slip, trip and fall hazards, we strive to improve 

our safety and precautionary measures by adopting 

industry best practices. 

Responding to Incidents. Apart from the periodic reviews, 

any organisational changes, the occurrence of incidents 

or employee feedback would trigger ad-hoc reviews of 

our risk controls. By applying robust risk controls, we are 

pleased to report that in the year under review there was 

no hazard that posed a risk of high-consequence injury4. 

CDL has established an incident investigation and 

reporting procedure to promptly respond to health and 

safety incidents. When employees raise incident reports, 

an experienced group of personnel will investigate to 

determine the root cause of the incident and identify 

corrective and preventive actions.

As our employees’ safety is of utmost importance, 

employees are actively reminded to not engage in any 

unsafe work and to report any unsafe working conditions 

to either their representative or directly to the EHS 

department so that the issue may be resolved quickly and 

effectively. CDL views these as valuable feedback to drive 

safety enhancements in the workplace, and ensures that 

employees can provide input without fear of reprisal.

Training. In 2020, CDL’s EHS team organised a series 

of internal WSH Awareness Workshops and trainings 

to raise awareness of occupational health and safety 

issues amongst employees. These virtual sessions were 

attended by more than 160 employees, covering almost 

40% of staff strength at our corporate office in Singapore. 

Topics covered included health and safety-related trends, 

legislative requirements, reporting of incidents, and 

safety issues on- and off-the-job. 

This forms part of CDL’s educational efforts to inculcate 

a holistic safety mindset in our employees. Real-life 

incidents are used as discussion material for employees 

to gain a better understanding of existing and predicted 

risks within their work activities. Apart from their annual 

training, in 2020 employees were provided with quarterly 

reminders on relevant health and safety topics, such 

as good ergonomic practices and safety tips to observe 

during WFH arrangements. 

4 

A high-consequence injury is a work-related injury that results in a 

fatality or in an injury from which the worker cannot, does not, or is not 

expected to recover fully to pre-injury health status within six months.

Total Workplace Safety and Health (WSH)  

at Corporate Office

CDL places occupational safety and health at the 

forefront of our business processes. Since 2003, we 

have maintained our OHSAS 18001 certification that 

demonstrates our commitment to a holistic occupational 

health and safety management system. In March 2020, 

the previous OHSAS 18001 was migrated to the latest 

ISO 45001 standard5. It provides robust guidance for our 

integrated EHS Management System that covers 100%6 

of Singapore key operations.

In 2020, there was zero fatality, high-consequence injury7, 

and occupational disease involving our employees in our 

corporate office. There was no reportable8 injury that 

occurred within the CDL corporate office premises. 

By proactively tracking and taking accountability for 

reportable incidents, it helps to create awareness on the 

importance of a safe and healthy workplace to prevent 

future occurrences. CDL also implements a reporting 

system for near-miss and off-the-job incidents to promote 

a more holistic safety culture among our employees.

5 

OHS management system standard was revised in March 2018. The publication of ISO 45001:2018 has since replaced OHSAS 18001.

6 

100% of key operations (Corporate Management, Property &amp; Facilities Management and Project Management Services) are covered under our health 

and safety management system.

7 

A high-consequence injury is a work-related injury that results in a fatality or in an injury from which the worker cannot, does not, or is not expected to 

recover fully to pre-injury health status within 6 months.

8 

Reportable incident refers to a work-related accident, workplace accident, dangerous occurrence and occupational disease that require statutory 

reporting to MOM, as mandated by the Singapore Workplace Safety and Health Act.

9 

The SinBerBEST programme, funded by the National Research Foundation, is a five-year research programme with the Berkeley Education Alliance 

for Research in Singapore.

10 This incident involved a corporate office staff but occurred at a construction site. For consistency, it is reported under corporate office.



Healthy Buildings, Healthy People 

Since 2011, CDL has been conducting IAQ surveys 

for our employees in the Corporate Office. In 

2020, CDL supported a collaboration between 

the University of California, Berkeley, Center 

for the Built Environment and SinBerBEST9, to 

benchmark our head office at Republic Plaza’s  

IEQ responses to similar commercial buildings 

in Singapore. Over 140 CDL staff participated in 

this survey. In 13 out of 18 IEQ parameters, CDL 

staff expressed superior satisfaction in their 

work environment compared to occupants from 

other commercial buildings. We are glad to see 

the survey results were largely positive, and are 

committed to continued tracking and improving 

the IEQ of our office premises for the interest of 

our employees.

Total WSH at Managed Properties

Facilities management and maintenance are vital in 

delivering prompt and reliable services to our tenants, 

customers and building users, impacting our assets’ 

operational efficiency that contributes to our bottom 

line. As such, we place great emphasis on guiding 

our facility managers and contractors to uphold safe, 

healthy and productive work environments for workers 

in our managed buildings. Additionally, CDL engages 

our contracted workers through monthly meetings to 

develop solutions to mitigate WSH risks and reiterate 

the importance of health and safety issues that affect 

our workers and tenants11. Tenants are also engaged 

to provide feedback on unsafe conditions, which are 

addressed promptly.

CDL has always prioritised risk management at our 

managed properties using our robust risk assessment 

system, which is led by our trained personnel in 

operational risk management. For every facility 

management assignment in our properties, suppliers 

are required to perform a risk assessment to mitigate 

safety risks, such as falling from heights that may 

result in bodily injury or even fatality. One key training in 

managing this hazard is the ‘Working at Height Course’, 

which is mandatory for both supervisors and workers. In 

2020, risk management workshops were conducted to 

train and equip our operations managers on managing 

risks in their jobs.

11 Our scope of control for tenants is limited to common spaces only.

12 Key contractors in our managed properties provide cleaning, security services and mechanical and engineering support. Working hours disclosed covers CDL employees and workers of key contractors only. 

Staying Safe At Work 

When Singapore entered the Circuit Breaker 

period, we immediately stepped up precautionary 

safety measures at our managed properties—in 

line with governmental guidelines. When daily 

activities resumed in Phase 1 and 2, the EHS team 

conducted regular compliance checks at our key 

properties to ensure full compliance with our 

enhanced COVID-19 safety measures. In addition, 

we leveraged innovative disinfection technologies 

such as UVC disinfection robots and anti-microbial 

disinfectant coating to reduce exposure risk for 

frontline cleaning staff.



Anti-microbial disinfectant coating is regularly applied on 

high-touch surfaces such as elevator buttons.

For the year in review, there was zero fatality, high 

consequence injury and occupational disease involving 

the workers of our key contractors12 at CDL-managed 

properties. There were two reportable injuries sustained by 

our contractors’ workers which resulted in a loss of 20 man-

days. We have identified the root causes of these injuries and 

implemented controls to prevent a recurrence. Further, we 

are working closely with the contractors to strengthen the 

risk control measures of their daily operational activities.

Total WSH at Construction Sites

With CDL’s longstanding commitment to workers’ 

WSH, we prioritise their health and safety through our 

robust policies and practices. Measures to manage and 

minimise high-risk activities include:

• Implementation of robust risk controls, such as fall 

prevention plans and soil erosion prevention

• Frequent briefings on fatigue, heat stress, hearing 

conservation and respiratory protection

For close to two decades, as part of the tender 

shortlisting process, we require all our builders to have 

an accredited health and safety management system, 

such as OHSAS 18001, ISO 45001 or at least bizSAFE 

Level 3 certification. We also actively engage our 

business partners on health and safety matters through 

risk reviews, covering the whole lifecycle starting 

from pre-construction to TOP attainment. CDL uses a 

customised EHS risk register for each project to identify 

and mitigate EHS issues right from the design stage. As 

part of our EHS Policy and Project Development Green 

Procurement Guideline, we actively review the type of 

construction materials and methods to be adopted to 

minimise EHS risks.

Each development site has a dedicated workplace 

environment, safety and health committee, representing 

all workers on-site, including members from the main 

contractor’s management, construction workers and 

sub-contractors. CDL’s Project Manager actively tracks 

workplace safety, health and environment issues at 

meetings conducted on-site every two weeks with our 

main contractors and workers’ representative(s), amongst 

others. Through this, we maintain close oversight of 

issues on-site, ranging from technical challenges to 

Strengthening Support For Our Migrant Workers During COVID-19 Lockdown 

On 7 April 2020, all construction works ceased operations in Singapore to combat the outbreak of COVID-19. This was 

followed by a full lockdown of dormitories on 29 April 2020. During this period, CDL enhanced its 5-Star EHS audit 

standards in line with the national improved standards for the living conditions of migrant workers. Through an internal 

fundraiser, CDL also contributed an $88,000 donation for close to 1,500 migrant workers at our development projects. 

These funds aimed to provide them with necessities based on workers’ feedback, such as food rations, data SIM cards 

and hand wash. Surplus funds would be used to fund future migrant workers initiatives.





workers’ welfare. These meetings are also a platform for 

site coordinators to report unsafe work conditions and 

action plans for risk mitigation. Some of our sites further 

incentivise workers to identify and report risk, with the 

aim of raising overall safety awareness. 

For every project development, we institute a monthly 

joint safety inspection that is carried out in the presence 

of the main contractor, sub-contractors, and site staff 

representing consultants and CDL. The inspection 

highlights safety infringements and promotes better 

working conditions. Since 2001, on top of regulatory-

mandated audits, CDL also monitors the performance of 

the main contractor’s EHS management through our CDL 

5-Star EHS Assessment.

CDL and its subsidiaries raised funds during the Circuit Breaker period in a staff donation drive to purchase necessities for migrant workers at 

CDL’s development projects.

In 2020, close to 1,500 workers construction workers 

worked at our development sites. There was no high-

consequence injury, fatality and occupational disease at 

CDL’s construction sites. 

As elaborated in our enhanced EHS policy in 2020, 

we will continue to work with contractors to ensure 

that dormitories and facilities are equipped with basic 

amenities and all necessary measures. This is to provide 

safe, clean, healthy and dignified living and working 

conditions at on-site or off-site workers’ housing, 

including commercial purpose-built dormitories and 

factory-converted dormitories.

CDL 5-Star EHS Assessment and Awards

The Assessment and CDL EHS Excellence Awards 

have been instrumental in influencing CDL’s main 

contractors and consultants to monitor and improve 

their EHS performance. 

Since 2001, the CDL 5-Star EHS Assessment—an 

independent audit tool to assess, measure, and improve 

the main contractors’ EHS management and performance, 

has been in place to ensure a comprehensive, audited, and 

appraised approach. All CDL main contractors undergo 

quarterly EHS inspections and audits conducted by an 

independent audit firm recognised by MOM, and are 

appraised on a scale of one to five stars. Results are then 

presented to the management and site supervisors of the 

contractors and project consultants during the quarterly 

CDL 5-Star EHS Seminars. These seminars additionally 

serve as an invaluable platform to promote sharing of 

best practices and peer learning to encourage better 

EHS performance amongst our builders.

HUMAN CAPITAL AND DEVELOPMENT

COVID-19 has changed the future of workplaces. 

The prevalence of remote working presents a set of 

challenges and opportunities, including redesigning 

of job scopes and developing new communication and 

collaborative working methods. 

For CDL, maintaining employee engagement and 

development across online and offline work environments 

are key priorities. Through a three-pronged approach of 

developing, engaging and caring for employees, we are 

committed to driving productivity, employee satisfaction 

and talent retention for organisational excellence. For our 

continual efforts in improving human resource initiatives, 

CDL was awarded one of the “Best Companies to Work 

for in Asia” by HR Asia Magazine in 2020. Since 2018, CDL 

has been the only real estate company in Singapore to be 

included in the sector-neutral Bloomberg Gender-Equality 

Index (GEI), and is one of six Singapore companies listed 

on the 2021 index. 

CDL’s recruitment process adheres to the strict 

guidelines on non-discrimination and fairness, 

regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, or age. Beyond 

providing jobs and caring for our direct employees 

through comprehensive benefits schemes, we also invest 

significantly in training and upgrading employees to 

equip them with relevant skills for the future.

In end-2020, we launched the biennial employee 

engagement survey. Despite the challenging year, our 

2020 engagement score remained at 79%, above the 

Singapore norm by 7%.

Unless specified, the scope for this section on human capital 

and development covers the CDL Corporate Office only.

Job Creation and Employment 

CDL adheres to the Tripartite Guidelines on Managing 

Excess Manpower issued by MOM and its tripartite 

partners, Singapore National Employers Federation and 

the National Trades Union Congress. We support and 

share a similar philosophy as the Tripartite Guidelines, 

which strongly encourage companies to manage 

excess manpower and consider reorganisation as a last 

resort. The Guidelines also suggest providing company 

retraining programmes for workers, redeployment of 

workers to alternative areas of work, implementing 

shorter work weeks, temporary layoffs, flexible work 

arrangements, and managing wage costs through a 

flexible wage system. 

In the past five years, there has been no major 

reorganisation that resulted in job loss. Despite the 

challenging year in 2020 due to the pandemic, CDL is 

proud to have not undertaken any major reorganisation 

or retrenchment exercise, preserving the livelihoods of 

our workforce.

In the event of termination or employee resignation, a 

minimum notice period of one to three months needs 

to be fulfilled, depending on the employee’s job grade. 

Due to operational requirements, middle and senior 

management are required to provide a notice period of 

two and three months respectively.

Our Employees. As of 31 December 2020, CDL 

hired a total of 415 employees for its operations 

headquartered in Singapore where most of its business 

in property development and asset management is 

based, excluding hotel properties. Close to 4.8% of 

our employees were hired on a temporary basis with a 

tenure of more than one year.

Employee Retention. CDL takes pride that our 

successful employee engagement is evident from our 

employees’ length of service. The average tenure of our 

employees is about 8.8 years, and more than 54% of our 

employees have been with CDL for more than five years. 

Our employee resignation rate of 7% continued to remain 

significantly lower than the national average of 18.6% in 

2020. CDL experienced an involuntary turnover rate of 

about 4.1%, of which 1.2% is due to retirement.

Gender and Age Diversity

With women making up a significant 68% of CDL’s workforce, 

we have more females than males in both managerial* and 

non-managerial categories. In addition, 55% of our Heads of 

Departments (HODs) are females as of 2020. 

In 2020, the average pay of female employees is 96% of 

the average pay of male employees in non-managerial 

positions. For managerial positions (including HODs and 

Vice-Presidents), female employees were paid 87% of the 

average pay of male employees. 

CDL has a diversified workforce across all age groups. 

In 2020, 62% of recruits were millennials (born in 

1978 or later). About 43% of our current workforce 

now consists of millennials, injecting new ideas, 

enthusiasm, and energy into our organisation.

CDL Diversity and Inclusion Task Force. Recognising 

that creating and expanding opportunities for women are 

fundamental to CDL’s sustainable growth and beneficial 

to society at large, the CDL Diversity and Inclusion Task 

Force was established in 2017 to promote diversity and 

inclusion within our workplace and the wider community. 

Under the leadership of our Group CEO, the Task Force is 

co-chaired by the Sustainability and HR departments.

Public Commitment to Women Empowerment. In 2017, 

our Group CEO joined over 1,600 leaders globally in 

pledging CDL’s support for the Women’s Empowerment 

Principles. Developed through a partnership between 

the UN Women and UNGC, the principles offer practical 

guidance to the private sector on how to empower 

women in the workplace, marketplace and community.

Global Recognition for Gender Equality. CDL’s efforts 

in advancing gender diversity at the workplace has 

earned its inclusion in the sector-neutral Bloomberg 

Gender Equality Index (GEI) for the fourth year running 

since 2018. Out of six Singapore companies listed in the 

2021 index, CDL is the only real estate company to be 

included. 

The reference index measures gender equality across 

five pillars: female leadership and talent pipeline, 

gender pay and equal pay parity, inclusive culture, sexual 

harassment policies, and pro-women brand—allowing 

investors to make better-informed decisions and help 

companies better understand their progress towards 

gender equality.

Racial and Disability Inclusion

CDL embraces an inclusive workplace, with our 

multi-racial workforce from diverse backgrounds. 

Our workforce is nonetheless heavier on the number 

of Chinese employees as a reflection of Singapore’s 

predominantly Chinese population. Where possible, we 

also provide fair employment opportunities for the less 

physically-abled. As of 31 December 2020, CDL has one 

wheelchair-bound employee who has been with the 

company for 12 years.

Anti-bullying and Anti-harassment 

The CDL Workplace Anti-Harassment and Anti-Bullying 

Policy communicates CDL’s stance for all employees to 

be treated with respect and dignity. No employee shall be 

subject to any physical, psychological, verbal or sexual 

abuse. Our employees should be culturally sensitive, 

tolerant and respectful towards each other, taking into 

consideration the workplace environment and multi-

culturalism. This policy also extends to dealing with 

incidents involving external customers and stakeholders 

who conduct themselves in a manner that constitutes 

harassment of the employees, within and beyond 

company premises. In 2020, CDL had zero incidents of 

discrimination.

Human rights is one of CDL’s material ESG issues. With 

the need to raise awareness on this topic, particularly in 

light of the changing global landscape in the workplace 

and the advent of social media, a compulsory workshop 

on professional workplace boundaries was launched in 

January 2021 for all staff.

Fair and Competitive Remuneration

Fair and competitive remuneration attracts and retains 

talents to build strong human and organisational 

capital that enable CDL’s business growth. Aligned with 

internal parity and market benchmarks, our equitable 

remuneration packages are based on employees’ 

performance and their scope of work. We use a well-

structured and open annual performance appraisal 

system, which is reviewed periodically and enhanced to 

encourage two-way feedback between employees and 

their reporting officers.

Performance-based Appraisal. As a company committed 

to meritocracy, CDL’s compensation and rewards policies 

are performance-based. Employees are assessed not 

only on what they achieved during the year of review, but 

also on how the outcomes were achieved. 

Competitive Remuneration. Remuneration is 

recommended by the HR Department and approved 

by the Remuneration Committee which consists of 

members from the CDL Board of Directors. Salary 

benchmarks against market surveys are conducted to 

ensure the relevancy of CDL’s salaries with the industry 

and overall market. On a biennial basis, an external 

consultancy firm is engaged to conduct an Employee 

Engagement Survey to gather employees’ opinions 

and feedback, including their perception of CDL’s 

remuneration and reward system. 

ESG-linked Remuneration. CDL recognises that the 

inclusion of appropriate ESG issues within executive 

management goals and incentive schemes is an 

important factor in promoting greater recognition of and 

accountability in our sustainability practices. Since 2015, 

CDL established stronger linkages between employee 

and executive remuneration and our ESG performance. 

Performance indicators that are aligned with global 

standards such as ISO 26000, ISO 14001, GRI Standards 

and SDGs, to name a few, have been incorporated in the 

individual goals setting of all employees, including CDL’s 

senior management.

Respect for Collective Bargaining Rights. CDL 

respects all employees’ fundamental rights to freedom 

of association and the right to be members of trade 

unions. Although CDL is not an unionised company, we 

are guided by the Industrial Relations Act which allows 

trade unions to represent our employees for collective 

bargaining, providing our employees with an avenue to 

seek redress for disputes.

Our key subsidiaries—M&amp;C, CBM, and Tower Club—have 

staff who are trade union members, providing them with 

a channel for collective bargaining.

Benefits and Welfare

We care for our employees through comprehensive 

welfare and benefits schemes, including, but not limited 

to, insurance coverage, medical, and dental benefits 

for our full-time employees. Part-time employees also 

enjoy similar benefits on either a full or pro-rated basis, 

thereby promoting a conducive environment should 

employees decide to take on part-time arrangements to 

cope with their personal needs.

To better equip all employees against COVID-19 

transmissions, CDL distributed face masks, hand 

sanitisers and disinfection wipes.

Pro-family Benefits. We provide benefits and adopt 

welfare practices in line with the Singapore Government’s 

pro-family legislation. Mothers and fathers whose children 

are Singapore citizens at birth enjoy paid maternity leave 

of 16 weeks, as per legislation, and four weeks of paternity 

leave (two weeks above legislation) respectively. CDL also  

provides eligible employees with childcare leave and 

extended childcare leave. Male employees are entitled to 

shared parental leave whereby they can choose to share 

up to four weeks of the 16 weeks of maternity leave, 

subject to the agreement of the mother, if the mother 

qualifies for Government-Paid Maternity Leave.

CDL also provides employees with Family Event Leave 

of three days where employees may utilise the leave to 

care for family members who are ill, attend family-related 

activities, celebrate one’s birthday, or caring for one’s pet. 

In 2020, eight eligible female CDL employees utilised 

their maternity benefits and returned to work after their 

maternity leave. For eligible male employees, five utilised 

their paternity leave benefits. 





• 

Distribution of washable and reusable face masks, 

hand sanitisers and disinfection wipes to staff

• Advising unwell staff to visit the doctor and 

remain at home 

• Older employees, pregnant employees and 

employees who have underlying medical 

conditions are encouraged to WFH as far  

as possible

• Frequent email reminders on observing 

good personal hygiene at home and work, 

maintaining healthy eating and exercise habits

• Employees who require emotional support 

can tap on CDL’s Employee Assistance 

Programme (EAP), which provides support 

for issues concerning work, family matters, 

and interpersonal relationships. Employees 

can be assured of confidentiality when they 

call the EAP hotline manned by a third-party 

psychologist.

Supporting Employees’ Health 

and Wellness

80 CDL employees (31 male, 49 female) with at least one 

Singapore Citizen child under the age of seven were entitled 

to six days of paid childcare leave in 2020. In addition, 40 

employees (13 male, 27 female) with at least one Singapore 

Citizen child aged seven to 12 years was entitled to two days 

of paid extended childcare leave in 2020. 

Flexible Work Arrangements. To provide stronger 

support for employees who need to manage work 

responsibilities alongside personal commitments, we 

have four flexible work arrangements that an employee 

can choose from, subject to a mutual agreement with 

the department head:

• 

Flexi Time

 

– Flexible Start and End Times – employees can 

opt to start work earlier or later than the official 

working hours. 

 

– Flexible Lunch Hours – employees can go for a 

one-hour lunch break flexibly between 12.00pm 

and 2.00pm.

• 

Flexi Place

 

– Telecommuting – Employees can work at 

alternate work locations, for up to two days 

a month, on a fixed schedule once every two 

weeks. Since the introduction of this initiative, 

approximately 16% of employees opted to 

telecommute. The COVID-19 situation and 

Circuit Breaker measures implemented in 

early 2020 proved to be the catalyst for most, 

if not all of CDL employees to commence WFH 

arrangements. To ensure business continuity, 

CDL began the shift to digitalise more of our 

work processes. Since September 2020, at least 

50% of our headcount is on WFH arrangements 

at any one point in time. 

• 

Flexi Load

 

– Part-time Work – Full-time employees can 

convert to working part-time and enjoy similar 

benefits as full-time employees on a full or pro-

rated basis. In 2020, four employees worked on a 

part-time arrangement.

Flexible Benefits Scheme. CDL provides the Flexible 

Benefits Scheme for all regular and contract 

employees, affording them the flexibility to explore a 

range of health and wellness options covered under the 

company’s health insurance plan and select the ones 

that best suit their health needs and stage of life.

Pension Scheme and Contributions. In Singapore, 

the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is a comprehensive 

social security savings plan introduced by the Singapore 

government. It aims to enforce savings by salaried 

workers, including Permanent Residents, for a more 

secure retirement. CPF funds can be used in several 

schemes including retirement, healthcare, housing, and 

investment. Details of the various CPF schemes can be 

found here.

Under the CPF scheme, CDL and our staff make 

monthly contributions to the staff’s CPF account in 

accordance with Singapore’s statutory requirement. 

CDL also adheres to the respective social security 

contribution or pension plan obligations of the countries 

we operate in.

Training and Development 

The functional competencies within the Competency 

Framework were recently reviewed in 2020. This is to 

ensure that functional competencies are kept reflective 

to the current business needs to raise our employees’ 

learning and development capacity, yielding a capable 

and more agile workforce. We also carry out an annual 

training needs analysis to ensure there are adequate 

training interventions to level-up competencies and 

professional knowledge.

All new employees must attend the CDL Onboarding 

Programme, which aims to induct and integrate new 

hires into the organisational culture. 

Training Hours and Investments. In 2020, CDL invested 

over $450,000 into training and development for our 

Corporate Office staff; more than 2.5 times the amount 

invested in 2019 and over 16,800 training hours were 

clocked. Training sessions were offered to 100% of the 

CDL Corporate Office workforce, and an average of 5.8 

training days per staff was achieved. 

CDL also supports our employees in receiving 

sustainability-related training through EHS training 

and awareness programmes that cultivate a “Safe 

and Green” corporate culture. They are encouraged to 

attend relevant external conferences and workshops 

to strengthen their sustainability knowledge and EHS 

management skills. Over 75% of employees received 

sustainability-related training in 2020.



Stepping Up On Online Training Courses 

Amidst WFH Arrangements 

To continue to build up human capital and 

engage our employees during WFH measures, 

CDL launched a company-wide online training 

programmes as the workforce eased into WFH 

arrangements. At the start of Circuit Breaker, 

staff were encouraged to complete a minimum 

of 14 training hours from 3 April to 4 May 2020. 

Throughout the year, online workshops focussing 

on leadership building, digital tools, sustainability, 

occupational health and safety, and healthy living and 

mental resilience were well-received by our staff. 

Since 2004, CDL organises the Hong Leong and CDL 

Group Annual Sustainability Forum to keep the Group’s 

directors and senior management abreast of the 

latest sustainability trends and best practices. Held 

on 10 December 2020, the 7th edition was titled “ESG 

Integration: A Pathway to Business Resilience”. Around 

85 directors, senior management, and staff of the CDL 

and parent company Hong Leong Group’s companies 

attended the forum—some in person, while others 

virtually via Zoom.

Leadership Development and Succession Planning. 

Through the structured CDL Leadership Programme, we 

develop high-potential employees by sharpening their 

leadership and management skills to enable them to 

become more effective leaders.

Today’s employees have high expectations of personal 

development and career growth. To meet these 

demands, there is a need to put in place a well-designed 

job rotation programme to enhance employees’ 

competencies, as well as to increase job satisfaction 

through job variation. Structured talent deployment 

within CDL is part of HR planning, and it plays a major 

role in the following areas:

• 

Career Development

 

By providing employees with either exposure to the 

various business operations, or by expanding their 

skills and knowledge, employees will be able to build 

both breadth and depth of experience and learning, 

hence maximising their potential and enabling them 

to be more well-rounded in their careers in CDL.

• 

Succession Planning

 

Job rotation serves as an effective tool in developing 

the identified successors for various critical leadership 

positions. It allows them to provide them with a holistic 

view of CDL’s business, thereby ensuring that they are 

more prepared for impending leadership roles.

• 

Talent Retention

 

Job rotation motivates employees as it broadens 

their skills set, adds diversity to their job roles, and 

rejuvenates their interest to keep learning through 

tackling different challenges.

Management Trainee Programme. As it is vital to 

develop a talent pipeline, the Management Trainee 

Programme was introduced in October 2016 to nurture 

young talents and ensure the sustainability of leadership 

and management capacity in CDL. 

The 18-month programme provides opportunities 

for young graduates to learn about CDL’s various 

departments and respective operations, through a series 

of attachments to each department. This helps them to 

establish and build relationships between departments. 

The programme structure also allows Management 

Trainees to participate in additional special projects 

or overseas assignments to enhance their career 

development. Upon completion of the programme, 

individuals will be posted to one of the departments. 

Education Sponsorships and Scholarships. CDL 

sponsors part-time courses relevant to the employee’s 

work, conducted locally by recognised institutions and 

universities. In 2020, we sponsored two employees for 

a Master’s degree, one employee for a Post-Graduate 

Diploma and two employees for a Specialist Diploma.

Internships. CDL partners with local tertiary education 

institutions to offer internship opportunities for students 

interested in the property industry. In 2020, there were 18 

interns assigned to various departments in CDL.

Political Contributions. Under our Anti-Corruption 

Policy, CDL takes a corporate stance against using the 

Company’s resources to make donations to political 

parties and political associations, or candidates and/

or election agents in a parliamentary or presidential 

election. Additionally, employees who intend to be 

involved in any political party are required to declare and 

seek top management’s approval. 

In 2020, as with previous years, CDL made zero direct 

and indirect political contributions using the Company’s 

resources.

Shaping an Innovation Culture. CDL’s Enterprise 

Innovation Committee (EIC) plays an active role in 

shaping the organisational culture to raise staff 

capability, promote cross-departmental collaboration, 

and tap on invaluable expertise to accelerate our 

innovation journey. For details, please refer here.

Business as usual is no longer an option. The new climate 

and pandemic economy are testing the foundations 

of companies and challenging how economic value is 

generated and distributed. Businesses that can navigate 

successfully in the new normal will prove their resilience 

to adapt to the ever-changing economic, social and 

environmental landscape. For over two decades, CDL has 

built a strong foundation through effective sustainability 

integration. We will remain resilient against headwinds 

and continue to create sustained value for our business 

and stakeholders. 

MARKET REVIEW AND PERFORMANCE

The combination of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact 

on the global hospitality sector, losses in China 

resulting from a weaker operating environment and 

policy changes to the real estate sector have affected 

the Group’s performance. The Group reported a loss 

after tax and non-controlling interest of $1.9 billion for 

the year ended 31 December 2020 (FY 2020) (FY 2019: 

PATMI of $564.6 million). Excluding one-off, non-cash 

impairments of $1.78 billion for losses attributable 

to our joint venture investment in Sincere Property 

Group in China, impairment losses for CDL’s hotels and 

investment properties of $99.5 million and allowance 

for foreseeable losses for development projects of $35 

million, CDL would have generated a profit before tax of 

$120.8 million for FY 2020 (FY 2019: $805.5 million).

Revenue for FY 2020 declined by 38.5% to $2.1 billion 

for FY 2020 (FY 2019: $3.4 billion). Although the hotel 

operations segment accounted for 81% of the decline, 

the property development segment also reported 

lower revenue due to less contribution from high-end 

projects such as New Futura and Gramercy Park (both 

in Singapore), as well as Suzhou Hong Leong City Center 

(China) which was substantially sold in 2019.

The investment properties segment also registered a 

decline in revenue with the rental rebates granted to 

tenants, poorer performance for our retail malls and 

lower rental contributions from hotels owned by CDL 

Hospitality Trusts, an indirect subsidiary of the Group, 

which are accounted for as investment properties due to 

master lease arrangements.

Despite the unprecedented set of results, the Group’s 

financial position remains robust with sufficient liquidity  

to meet our operational needs and financial commitments.  

As of 31 December 2020, the Group had cash reserves of $3.2 

billion. We maintain a strong liquidity position comprising 

cash and available undrawn committed bank facilities 

totalling $5.2 billion. The Group is confident to weather this 

storm with our strong fundamentals and financial strength.

SUSTAINABLE FINANCE

Finance can play a powerful role in the transition to 

a sustainable and low-carbon economy. CDL’s strong 

foundation in sustainability has placed us in a prime 

position to tap into the thriving sustainable finance 

market. In 2020, we secured a $470 million green 

revolving credit facility for the refinancing of Republic 

Plaza and other eligible green projects. Such alternative 

financing streams enable us to accelerate the adoption of 

innovation and technology to design, build and maintain 

our assets towards a low-carbon built environment. 

Under the $250 million SDG Innovation Loan secured in 

2019, CDL has stepped up on green building innovation. 

We are shortlisting promising innovation projects that 

can qualify for the interest rate discount. Aligned with 

good practices, our Sustainable Finance Framework 

has embraced leading global frameworks including 

the Green Bond Principles, Green Loan Principles 

and Sustainability Linked Loan Principles. We believe 

that it will further illustrate the good governance of 

CDL’s sustainable financing and contribute to building 

sustainable and climate-resilient cities and communities. 

More than $1.3bn secured as of 31 December 2020

• $470m Green Revolving Credit Facility, 2020

• $250m SDG Innovation Loan, 2019

• $500m Green Loans, 2019

COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS

Activating Greater Collaborations

Our 2020 materiality assessment study showed that the ESG 

issues “Economic Contribution to Society” and “Stakeholder 

Impact and Partnerships” rose in their rankings. The annual 

study has been conducted since 2014 to ensure that our 

ESG priorities are aligned with our stakeholders’ views 

in the fast-changing business landscape. The change 

in priorities resulted from the global pandemic in 2020, 

which amplified the “S” pillar amongst ESG issues. It has 

re-affirmed our belief that building a sustainable future 

requires the collaboration of a larger ecosystem, and that 

corporates have a pivotal role in tackling adversities that 

stakeholders and disadvantaged communities face. 

Despite restrictions posed by COVID-19, CDL continued 

to step up our community engagements initiatives and 

efforts in 2020, utilising our digital media platforms to 

further our thought leadership and advocacy programmes 

on climate action and sustainable development. 

To bring about a multiplier effect on our sustainability 

efforts, CDL has long been galvanising the built industry, 

our supply chain, stakeholders, and the wider community. 

Key focus areas include but are not limited to:

• Promoting Environmental Awareness and Zero Waste

• Advocating Best Practices in Sustainability 

• Empowering Youths and Women as Sustainability 

Champions 

• Supporting Singapore’s Arts Scene 

• Caring for the Less Fortunate

In line with good governance, CDL exercises due 

diligence in evaluating every request for donation, 

sponsorship or partnership. We assess the track record, 

quality of management, and organisational governance of 

charities and community partners via various channels, 

which includes their annual reports, websites and social 

media platforms. For accountability, all charities and 

community partners are required to report on the social 

and environmental impact of their programmes, as well 

as the use of funds and resources contributed by CDL.

Two Decades of Active Employee Volunteerism

CDL has been engaging stakeholders through active 

employee volunteerism to complement our community 

investments and deliver a more meaningful impact 

in the public sphere. Volunteering not only allows our 

employees to develop their leadership and soft skills but 

also cultivates their sense of identity and belonging to 

CDL through a caring and cohesive work environment.

Since 1999, CDL’s dedicated employee-led volunteering 

body, City Sunshine Club (CSC), has been actively 

reaching out to the less fortunate and underprivileged, 

providing an avenue for CDL employees to serve the 

community. CSC organises monthly food distribution 

drives where CDL employees distribute household 

necessities to low-income elderly living in rental flats. 

During festive seasons, CSC collaborates with the North 

West Community Development Council (NWCDC) by 

distributing festive packs to families staying in one-

room rental flats and organises festive celebrations for 

terminally-ill patients and beneficiaries at Assisi Hospice 

and Arc Children’s Centre. In 2020, the pandemic made 

it challenging to organise and participate in outreach 

events. Notwithstanding the restrictions and strict 

adherence to social distancing and safety measures, our 

employees managed to achieve a participation rate of 

28.4% and clocked more than 320 volunteer manhours.

Key 3P and Community Initiatives in 2020

Full details of our activities can be found on www.cdlsustainability.com.

Promoting Environmental Awareness and Zero Waste

Key Initiatives

Outcomes and Impact

Australian Bushfire Emergency 

Response, 10 to 17 January 2020

At the start of 2020, Australia experienced a period of deadly heatwaves that caused unceasing bushfires. It resulted in the devastation of millions of 

hectares of land and decimated an estimated half a billion animals.

An internal fundraiser and a dollar-to-dollar matching by CDL raised more than $40,000, which was donated to the Singapore and Australian Red Cross to 

support disaster relief efforts.

Ecobank—An Annual CDL and  

Eco-Business Initiative

Launched in 2016, this annual initiative brings the 3P sectors together to break the typical “take, use and dispose” cycle and promote a mindset of 

responsible consumption. Through eight collection points and private donations over a month-long period in 2020, CDL collected approximately 20 tonnes of 

pre-loved toys, clothes, books and household items.

However, due to the restrictions posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual EcoBank Bazaar and all EcoBank volunteer activities were cancelled in 

2020. Instead, CDL partnered with our South Beach development to repurpose pre-loved clothes, accessories, toys and books into sustainability-themed 

Christmas decorations, comprising an actual spinning Ferris wheel, Christmas trees, and display boxes across the development. 

With close to 3,000 pre-loved items on display, South Beach was awarded the “Largest Christmas Decoration of a Building Using Recycled Materials” in 

2020 by the Singapore Book of Records.

From 2016 to 2020, about 75 tonnes of pre-loved toys, clothes, books and household items were collected, reducing about 34,000 tonnes of carbon 

emissions by diverting these items from the incinerator or landfill. 

Food Waste Minimisation Forum,  

16 January 2020

CDL organised a timely discussion on food waste minimisation in support of Singapore’s Year Towards Zero Waste in 2019 and ahead of the launch of “2020: 

Singapore Food Story”—the latter of which took place in February 2020. 

The forum featured expert speakers from across the 3P sectors who shared their varied perspectives on the food waste management system and chain. 

It attracted close to 100 participants, including students and representatives from the government sector, F&amp;B companies and sustainability-related NGOs. 

CDL Sustainability Quiz 2020,  

10 May 2020

Open to CDL and our key subsidiaries, the CDL Sustainability Quiz 2020 aimed to further enhance staff’s awareness and support of CDL’s sustainability and 

EHS practices and performance. Participants submitted ideas on concrete actions and decisions that could shape a better and greener future.

“A Thousand Trees for World 

Environment Day 2020”, 5 June 2020

In celebration of World Environment Day 2020 and its theme “Time for Nature”, CDL launched the “A Thousand Trees for World Environment Day 2020” 

initiative to plant one tree for every two photos submitted by staff from CDL and our subsidiaries.

We received a total of 2,760 photo submissions in four weeks. With these submissions, CDL worked with a non-profit organisation, One Tree Planted, to 

plant over 1,380 trees in Indonesia (Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in Lampung), and the Philippines (Sarangani and Tambobo Bays, and bamboo 

forests in Mindanao).

Supporting Trees of the World, 

December 2020

CDL celebrated the holiday season by sponsoring three trees at the Singapore Botanic Gardens’ Trees of the World 2020 display. Led by NParks, the Trees of 

the World display is a collaboration with the community to bring festive cheer to the public and raise funds for the Singapore Botanic Gardens.

Applying the 3Rs in the way we live, work, play and engage the community for a more sustainable future for all, CDL dedicated a tree each for Arc Children’s 

Centre (an independent charity centre dedicated to children braving life-threatening illnesses), CDL tenants and staff, and The Fashion Pulpit (a social 

enterprise that aims to promote environmental education and awareness in fashion).

All proceeds went towards the “Give to the Gardens” programme. Initiated in 2016, this programme supports the Garden’s work as a prominent botanical institution 

and contributes to the conservation of Singapore’s local and regional flora while inspiring a love for nature and environmental protection amongst the community.

Advocating Best Practices in Sustainability

Key Initiatives

Outcomes and Impact

Incubator For SDGs

In support of social enterprises with purposes that are aligned with one or more UN SDGs, the Incubator For SDGs is an initiative by CDL in partnership with 

UNDP, Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise (raiSE), and Social Collider. For 2021, CDL will seek the second intake of impact-driven businesses with its 

new partner GGEF, a well-connected impact investing accelerator, in addition to our founding partners UNDP and raiSE.

Singapore Sustainability Academy 

(SSA)—Hosted 86 events in 2020, 

including 17 Virtual SSA (VSSA) 

events 

Designed and built by CDL in 2017, the SSA is the first ground-up initiative and zero-energy facility in Singapore dedicated to advocacy, thought leadership, 

collaboration, and capacity building for climate action and green causes, involving an extensive partnership with six government agencies and 15 founding 

industry and NGO partners.

Since its opening on 5 June 2017 till the end of 2020, the SSA has hosted more than 450 sustainability-related training programmes and advocacy events, 

involving over 18,000 attendees. This year, despite restrictions posed by COVID-19, the SSA has continued promoting sustainable lifestyle practices 

through various virtual workshops. Under the new VSSA platform, we hosted a series of sustainability-related talks and sessions that were free and 

open to the public. It has provided the SSA with great opportunities to expand outreach beyond our shores. In 2020, the VSSA sessions attracted over 

1,200 participants from over 25 countries, including Malaysia, Nigeria, Switzerland, Thailand, the USA, and more. Recorded and posted on our  

CDL Sustainability YouTube channel, these sessions have been viewed by an additional 700 people.

Empowering Youths and Women as Sustainability Champions 

Key Initiatives

Outcomes and Impact

CDL E-Generation Challenge 2020

The CDL E-Generation Challenge is an annual youth competition in which young eco champions from Singapore and the ASEAN region are invited to 

propose ideas and action plans that address the urgency of climate change. 2020’s topic focussed on the impact of global deforestation and the importance 

of protecting biodiversity in Singapore and Asia. Due to the restrictions posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the winners’ trip to Tanzania to visit Jane Goodall 

Institute’s conservation sites has been rescheduled till further notice.

CDL-GCNS Young SDG Leaders  

Award 2020

Launched in 2011, this annual business case competition seeks to empower and cultivate youths into future sustainability champions, equipped with the 

skills and know-how to integrate SDGs into business strategy and operations. Formerly known as CDL-GCNS Young CSR Leaders Award, it was rebranded 

in 2018 to CDL-GCNS Young SDG Leaders Award in support of the SDGs. 

Despite the restrictions posed by COVID-19, CDL concluded the final judging for the 10th CDL-GCNS Young SDG Leaders Award virtually. The competition 

has attracted the participation of more than 2,400 youths over the past 10 years.

My Tree House—World’s First  

Green Library for Kids and Platform 

Featuring Young Eco Champions  

in 2020

Initiated by CDL in conjunction with NLB in 2013, My Tree House is the world’s first green library for children and was created to encourage and facilitate 

environmental literacy and love for nature amongst younger generations. In 2020, due to COVID-19 restrictions, My Tree House experienced a decrease in 

loans, visitorships, programmes and programme participants. Around 75,000 people visited My Tree House and borrowed approximately 304,000 books in 

2020. Close to 650 participants took part in 13 programmes, including the virtual Eco Storytelling Contest and VSSA Storytime @ My Tree House.

In the lead up to World Environment Day 2020 on 5 June 2020, CDL and NLB jointly organised My Tree House’s Eco Storytelling Contest for children from 

3 to 12 years of age. The inaugural contest with four different categories aimed to promote family bonding through storytelling during the Circuit Breaker 

period, as well as to encourage young eco champions and their families to develop their love for nature and to take action to protect the planet. The best entries 

and a selection of passionate submissions from the contest were used to create a special video titled “We Love Our Planet – Voices of Our Children.”

Nurturing Future Sustainability 

Leaders via Education

To equip students with relevant skills and knowledge to drive action towards a low-carbon future, CDL actively shares our business case for sustainability 

integration as inspiration to future generations. In 2020, CDL’s Senior Management was invited to deliver lectures to local and overseas students, e.g. the 

University of St. Gallen, National University of Singapore, Asian Institute of Management, Singapore Management University, and Nanyang Technological 

University.

Women4Green—Nurturing Women  

Eco Champions

Initiated by CDL in June 2017, the Women4Green network aims to empower female executives to adopt and champion a sustainable lifestyle and practices 

at work, at home and play. The initiative supports SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and 13 (Climate Action). Since its inception in late 2017, several engagement 

initiatives and events were organised, covering themes like sustainable diet, fashion and jewellery.

Our VSSA platform and Women4Green Network organised several virtual sessions in 2020 on topics such as digital media, and featured women leaders in 

smart and sustainable building industries.

CDL Young SDG Leaders Fund—

Supporting Local and Overseas Youth 

Development Programmes

For close to two decades, CDL has been actively supporting youth development through direct sponsorships and mentorships. These include the CDL Young 

SDG Leaders Fund (formerly known as CDL-SMU Young CSR Leaders Fund), which has supported close to 100 student-led overseas community investment 

programmes and more than 4,000 students since 2014. Due to COVID-19, the majority of overseas community service projects were suspended. In 2020, the 

Fund supported four projects and 112 students.

Empowering Youths and Women as Sustainability Champions 

Key Initiatives

Outcomes and Impact

Youth4Climate Concert 2020

Recognising that youths play a pivotal role in a sustainable future, the Youth4Climate Festival is one of CDL’s flagship programmes in support of youth 

empowerment, social good and the UN SDGs. Initiated in 2018 in partnership with the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) (now 

known as MSE), NEA, NParks and ActiveSG, the festival aims to provide Singapore’s youths with a platform to express their passion for the environment and 

green wishes for the future through musical performances and other exciting fringe activities. 

Due to COVID-19, CDL’s annual festival was conducted virtually in the form of an online concert. With close to 1,300 views on our CDL Sustainability YouTube 

page, this virtual concert featured six climate-themed acts that reflect youths’ concerns and aspirations for the future of our planet. To commemorate 

Singapore’s 55th birthday, the concert also rallied youths and the community to support a social cause through the 2020 President’s Challenge. Additionally, 

CDL conducted a dollar-for-dollar matching donation drive and raised an additional $40,000 from our employees’ remaining Flex Dollars from the 

company’s Flexible Benefits Scheme

8th CDL Singapore Young 

Photographer Award

The only national award for Singapore photographers between the ages of 13 and 25, the CDL Singapore Young Photographer Awards (SYPA) was initiated 

by CDL and spearheaded by CDL’s late Deputy Chairman, Mr Kwek Leng Joo, in 2005. 

The theme for the 8th edition of CDL SYPA was “ZERO”, which calls on contestants to rethink climate-related problems and how we can achieve a more 

sustainable future, linking back to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption and 

Production), 13 (Climate Action), 14 (Life Below Water) and 15 (Life on Land). 

Caring for the Less Fortunate

Key Initiatives

Outcomes and Impact

Assisi Hospice Charity Fun Day 2020

A longstanding partner of Assisi Hospice since 1999, CDL has been a strong supporter of the Assisi Hospice Charity Fun Day. The 2020 fundraising event 

attracted strong support from our subsidiaries, hotels and suppliers through an online carnival, which raised funds through e-stall sales. Also, in-kind 

sponsorship of lucky draw prizes and donations were raised by CDL to further support patients with cancer and terminal illnesses at Assisi Hospice.

Learning Space@Limbang and 

WeCare@NWCDC – Service Weeks  

at Limbang

Since 2017, CDL and Northwest CDC partnered to set up a conducive learning space at the Limbang Park Residents’ Committee Centre for students from 

low-income households in the vicinity. Besides providing library books and recreational games at the centre, CDL’s staff volunteers impart character-

building lessons to children from underprivileged families. The learning space had a total outreach of 530 young children and youths from January to March 

2020, before the start of Circuit Breaker. Prior to Circuit Breaker, CDL collaborated with the North West Community Development Council (NWCDC) in an 

annual project, WeCare@NWCDC – Service Weeks for the fifth consecutive year to distribute festive packs to more than 250 needy households staying in 

one-room rental flats in Limbang.

Arc Children’s Centre

CDL has been a founding corporate supporter of Arc Children’s Centre since its inception in 2011. Helping children with cancer and other life-threatening 

illnesses, the centre aims to be a sanctuary for the children and families in its care.

In December 2020, CDL staff volunteers brought festive joy to the children during Christmas. This first-of-its-kind “hybrid” party saw the children and 

several CSC volunteers attending on-site at the centre, while CDL’s staff volunteers joined virtually. It featured gingerbread pastry decorating, Christmas 

carolling and interactive games between the children and online volunteers.

CDL’s voluntary adoption of the TCFD recommendations since 2017 provides climate-related financial information for ESG investors to make 

informed investment decisions. It also complements our sustainability reporting, as “Climate Resilience” is one of CDL’s top material ESG issues.

As an early adopter of the International Integrated Reporting Council’s (IIRC) integrated reporting approach since 2015, which assesses our ESG impact through financial lenses,  

CDL has also embraced the TCFD framework since 2017 to better articulate climate-related risks that have a financial impact on our business. This section describes how we manage 

climate-related risks and opportunities, with reference to the four key pillars recommended by TCFD. References to CDL’s Integrated Sustainability Report 2021 have been made to 

provide further details.

Governance

Describe the board’s 

oversight of climate-

related risks and 

opportunities.

The Board is committed to strategically integrating sustainability across key aspects of CDL’s business and advancing our sustainability 

efforts. A Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) was set up to provide guidance to the Sustainability department. The current BSC comprises 

three independent directors and is chaired by Mr Sherman Kwek, CDL’s Executive Director and Group CEO. 

On behalf of the Board, the BSC provides advisory oversight to CDL’s sustainability strategy, initiatives and reporting on our environmental, 

social and governance (ESG) framework, as well as key ESG targets and performance.  

The BSC has oversight of climate-related risks, opportunities and initiatives that drive climate mitigation and adaptation strategies—these 

include the materiality assessment, Climate Change Scenario Analysis Studies and Supply Chain Risk Management Study. Apart from meeting 

biannually to review and advise on strategic climate-related issues and our low-carbon strategy and initiatives, the Chief Sustainability Officer 

(CSO) updates the BSC through the Quarterly Sustainability Report. In addition, the CSO communicates regularly with the BSC on ESG global 

and national trends, best practices, any changes in regulations and issues that require the BSC’s advice.

The progress against our climate-related goals and targets is tracked regularly. Since mid-2017, we have been reporting the performance 

of the CDL Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint through our online Quarterly Sustainability Report, in addition to the annual Integrated 

Sustainability Report. These reports are sent promptly to the BSC, the Sustainability Committee and all HODs. They are also publicly available 

on CDL’s dedicated sustainability microsite.

The CSO leads the Sustainability department and reports directly to the BSC. The sustainability portfolio engages all levels of the company’s 

operations across each operational unit. Chaired by the CSO, the Sustainability Committee is supported by an advisory committee comprising 

C-suites of all business units. The five sub-committees are led by the HODs of relevant business units and are accountable for CDL’s 

ESG performance through CDL’s remuneration and appraisal processes. Each sub-committee is supported by relevant management and 

operational staff across all departments and operational units. 

The primary responsibilities of the Sustainability Committee members are to execute the climate-related strategies, monitor the performance 

of their business units in meeting CDL’s sustainability goals and targets, and track and submit their performance to the Sustainability 

department. The Sustainability Committee is informed of climate-related issues related to the business and our progress against our ESG 

goals and targets through our online Quarterly Sustainability Reports, in addition to the annual Integrated Sustainability Reports.

Strategy

Describe the climate-

related risks and 

opportunities the 

organisation has 

identified over the 

short, medium, and 

long term.

CDL’s Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint sets long-term climate-related goals and targets towards 2030—a milestone year for the 

achievement of global goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), Paris Agreement and green building movement. Short-term 

interim targets are reviewed annually to monitor our progress.

We conducted our first climate change scenario analysis study in 2018 based on 2°C and 4°C warmer scenarios, where our climate risks, 

alongside potential financial impacts and opportunities, were studied. In 2019, the scope of the second climate change scenario analysis study 

focussed on 2°C and 1.5°C warmer scenarios, to align with the IPCC special report and the UN Global Compact’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C 

campaign. Though the target year for which the financial impacts are estimated is 2030, the study also considered longer-term implications 

and recommendations for 2050 and beyond. 

CDL was amongst the few pioneering companies in Singapore to adopt TCFD’s classification of climate-related risks and opportunities since 

2017, which outlines both transition and physical risks. Impact pathways were used to establish the causal links between changes in climate 

and weather patterns, related national and global policies and the financial impacts on our business. 

Accelerating Value

Alleviating 

Environmental 

Impact, pg 49 to 51

Describe the 

impact of climate-

related risks and 

opportunities on 

the organisation’s 

businesses, strategy 

and financial 

planning.

Based on global estimates by the International Energy Agency and UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the building and construction sector accounted 

for 36% of final energy use and 39% of energy and process-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2018. Out of total emissions, 11% is attributed to 

manufacturing building materials and products. This underscores CDL’s responsibility to mitigate the impact of our business on climate change. 

Since 2007, CDL has established ambitious targets to reduce energy intensity across our operations in Singapore. We established our first 

carbon emissions intensity reduction target in 2011 and voluntarily raised the target from 25% to 38% by 2030 (from 2007 levels) in 2017. 

Subsequently in 2018, we became the first real estate company in Singapore to have our carbon reduction targets validated by the Science 

Based Targets initiative (SBTi), raising our carbon emissions intensity reduction target from 38% to 59% across our Singapore operations by 

2030 from base-year 2007.

To meet these targets, CDL’s carbon mitigation strategy has been largely focussed on addressing Scope 2 emissions as electricity usage forms 

the largest source of emissions for CDL’s core operations in Singapore. Since 2012, CDL has invested in various energy reduction initiatives, 

including retrofitting our properties to be more energy efficient. In 2020, we have yielded an energy saving of about 16.1 million kWh, 

equivalent to $3.8 million of cost-savings across our managed properties.

In 2019, CDL implemented a Sustainable Finance Framework to leverage sustainable financing for funding eligible green and social projects 

that support CDL’s business and sustainability vision. Since CDL’s inaugural $100 million green bond issuance in 2017, we have accumulated 

over $1.3 billion of sustainable finance, as of 31 December 2020, the latest of which was a $470 million green revolving credit facility obtained 

in December 2020 for the refinancing of Republic Plaza (a BCA Green Mark Platinum building) and on-lending to other eligible green projects. 

CDL recognises that a business’s vulnerability to the impact of climate change extends beyond the physical exposure of its direct operations 

and sites. Disruptions to our supply chain, customers and markets have material impacts on our value chain and were considered in the 

climate change scenario analysis study as well.

Through the monitoring of our material ESG issues, which includes climate resilience, we have identified the impact of climate-related risks 

and opportunities on our business.

Strategy

Describe the 

resilience of the 

organisation’s 

strategy, taking 

into consideration 

different climate-

related scenarios, 

including a 2°C or 

lower scenario.

CDL is dedicated to strengthening the climate resiliency of our portfolio through setting targets towards carbon mitigation and environmental 

protection. Through the early adoption of Climate Change Scenario Analysis based on the TCFD recommendations, we have gained greater 

insight into climate-related risks and their potential impact on our business and financial bottom line under a 2°C and lower scenario. 

We continuously review our climate-related targets against global standards and best practices—in 2018, our carbon emissions intensity 

reduction target of 59% by 2030 was validated by SBTi to be aligned with a 2°C warmer scenario.

In 2019, we joined the pioneer batch of 87 global companies to pledge support to UN Global Compact’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign.  

To fulfil our commitment, we will be setting a more ambitious carbon emissions reduction target in line with a 1.5°C future by September 2021.

To complement this ambitious target, we have also joined the WorldGBC Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment in February 2021, pledging 

net zero operational carbon by 2030 for our new and existing wholly-owned assets and developments under our direct operational and 

management control, and advocate for all buildings to be net zero operational carbon by 2050.

In achieving these goals, CDL is committed to radically reducing our carbon emissions, including retrofitting our managed buildings to further 

enhance energy efficiency and accelerating the transition to renewable energy.

The CDL Enterprise Innovation Committee (EIC) was formed in 2018 to generate customer- and digital-centric ideas for the advancement of 

CDL’s business, focussing on areas like energy analytics and building occupant comfort. Ideas generated to improve operational efficiency can 

allow CDL to mitigate climate-related risks through savings in energy, water and waste.

In 2020, the Green Building and Technology Application team was formed as part of the Sustainability portfolio to explore innovative carbon 

reduction solutions and partnerships targeted at mitigating our climate-related risks for our developments and managed buildings.

CDL has been conducting biennial comprehensive materiality assessments since 2014 to identify and prioritise material ESG issues based on 

our stakeholders’ insights. Between comprehensive studies, an assessment was conducted to validate the material issues, which considered 

voluntary and regulatory requirements—both existing and emerging. These include the Singapore Government’s pledge to the Paris 

Agreement, enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution and the imposed carbon taxation from 2019.

In CDL’s climate change scenario analysis, climate-related risks were identified and categorised based on their explicit financial impacts as provided 

by TCFD. These risks are considered strategic business risks and managed under CDL’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.

Risk 

Management

Describe how 

processes for 

identifying, assessing 

and managing 

climate-related risks 

are integrated into the 

organisation’s overall 

risk management.

Beyond managing climate-related risks and opportunities under the ERM framework, we also manage operational risks pertaining to climate 

change, energy, water and supply of raw materials. We achieve this by adopting ISO management system standards that are internationally 

recognised and widely adopted. 

In 2003, CDL became the first private property developer in Singapore to have our environmental management system audited against ISO 

14001 for property development and project management. This provided a well-defined and clear framework through which we identified the 

environmental aspects and impacts associated with our activities, products and services, and allowed us to implement the necessary controls 

to manage these impacts.

Electricity consumption has long been identified as a significant climate-related risk for CDL, as it forms the largest source of emissions 

for CDL’s core operations in Singapore (reported as Scope 2 emissions). To systematically optimise energy performance and promote more 

efficient energy management, CDL became the first developer in Singapore to achieve the ISO 50001 energy management system certification 

for the provision of property and facilities management services in 2014.

process.

Since embarking on our sustainability journey more than two decades ago, CDL has put in place a comprehensive suite of policies, processes 

and systems to measure our efforts in environmental protection and conservation.

As an early adopter of sustainability and ESG reporting, CDL’s robust sustainability reporting has evolved into a unique hybrid model using 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards as its core since 2008, IIRC’s Integrated Reporting Framework since 2015, SDG Reporting since 

2016, TCFD framework since 2017, and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) since 2020. 

Our Integrated Sustainability Report 2021 is also assured against the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) framework, complementing 

CDL’s unique blended reporting framework that addresses the increasing and more diverse demands for corporate ESG disclosures by 

investors and stakeholders.

Key metrics on carbon emissions, embodied carbon, energy and water usage, and waste management are published in our annual Integrated 

Sustainability Report. Monitoring and reporting these metrics help us in identifying areas with highest climate-related risks so that we can be 

more targeted in our efforts.

To track the progress towards our over-arching goals set under the CDL Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint, metrics are provided for 

the last five years (from publication year).

Disclose Scope 1, 

Scope 2, and, if 

appropriate, Scope 

3 greenhouse gas 

(GHG) emissions, and 

the related risks.

CDL has been disclosing Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions of our core operations and six key subsidiaries since 2015. To ensure proper 

accounting of our GHG emissions, CDL scopes our emission streams in accordance with The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 

Reporting Standard.

To guide our focus on climate-related risk mitigation, CDL has set targets to reduce GHG emissions across all three scopes. In 2018, we set a 

carbon emissions intensity reduction target of 59% by 2030 for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which was validated by SBTi to be aligned with a 

2°C warmer scenario. In the same year, CDL committed to using sustainable building materials—instead of their conventional equivalents—to 

reduce embodied carbon (Scope 3 emissions) by 24% by 2030.

To further demonstrate that CDL’s environmental practices are aligned with international best practices, CDL became the first Singapore 

developer in 2016 to have our GHG emissions data externally validated against the stringent ISO 14064 on GHG verification.

In addition, CDL was the first company in Singapore to complete a carbon intensity calculation report in 2018 for our flagship building, 

Republic Plaza, where the carbon metric calculations were externally assured to be in accordance with ISO 16745-1 requirements.

Description of water management risks and 

discussion of strategies and practices to mitigate 

those risks

Headquartered in water-scarce Singapore, CDL recognises that water supply to the company’s core 

activities is especially vital as our operations are water-intensive and highly dependent on an effective and 

reliable supply of water. Therefore, CDL takes a holistic approach towards water management to maintain 

and enhance the efficiency, resilience, desirability and long-term value of our assets and developments.  

Our water management guidelines direct the strategies and practices throughout the lifecycle of our 

assets—from design and development to operation—and are embraced by the relevant business units. More 

details can be found in CDL’s Integrated Sustainability Report 2021, under “Alleviating Environmental Impact”.

Discussion of approach to measuring, 

incentivising and improving sustainability impacts 

of tenants

CDL’s Green Lease Partnership Programme encourages our tenants to reduce their environmental 

footprint and has achieved a 100% participation rate for retail and office tenants. Tenants also have 

access to a digital energy monitoring portal through a partnership with Tuas Power, which provides 

near real-time updates of energy consumption to tenants, allowing them to better track and manage 

their energy usage. Over the years, we have also been actively engaging tenants in CDL’s corporate 

sustainability and outreach programmes to raise the level of awareness and adoption of green practices 

at work and at home. One example is participation in the World Green Building Week 2020. More details 

can be found in CDL’s Integrated Sustainability Report 2021, under “Alleviating Environmental Impact”.

Description of climate change risk exposure 

analysis, degree of systematic portfolio exposure, 

and strategies for mitigating risks

Since 2018, CDL has been identifying and managing our climate risks and opportunities through a climate 

change scenario analysis study based on TCFD recommended disclosures. The first study was conducted 

in 2018 under 2°C and 4°C warmer scenarios by 2030 for our three core businesses—development 

properties, investment properties and hotel operations—in Singapore, China and the UK. In response to 

the IPCC special report on a 1.5°C warming future, a second climate change scenario study was initiated in 

2019 and completed in 2020, wherein the scope was extended to cover 1.5°C scenario. 

As a result of the analyses, the physical and transition risks, as well as the degree of each risk 

type, were assessed and classified into categories that are explicitly linked to financial impacts as 

provided by TCFD. Risk mitigation measures were identified and incorporated into our operations 

through business risk management under CDL’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, 

performance-tracking against our 2030 goals under the CDL Future Value 2030 sustainability 

blueprint, and continuous refinement of environmental management systems and carbon 

performance metrics in accordance with global standards including the GHG Protocol and ISO 14064. 

More details can be found in CDL’s Integrated Sustainability Report 2021 under “Alleviating 

Environmental Impact” and “TCFD Disclosure”.

As 100-year flood zones is a US definition and unavailable in Singapore, flood zones defined by the PUB, Singapore’s national flood and drainage management agency have been used instead. The flood zones are identified through 

referencing PUB’s live map of flood-prone areas, and latest updated lists of flood-prone areas and flood hotspots as at 31 December 2020.

REPORT PERIOD  

AND SCOPE 

This is CDL’s 14th Sustainability Report. It replaces the CDL 

Integrated Sustainability Report 2020 as our latest annual 

publication dedicated to providing information on financial, 

governance, social and environmental performance that 

are material to CDL’s business and stakeholders. 

This Report contains a full year’s data from 1 January 

to 31 December 2020 and focusses primarily on 

operations wholly owned and directly managed by 

CDL’s headquarters in Singapore. CDL’s operations in 

this Report cover corporate office, managed buildings 

and construction sites in Singapore, and exclude hotel 

properties, unless otherwise stated.

Following the inclusion of carbon emissions data 

from our key subsidiaries since 2015, we have further 

expanded the reporting scope to include their energy and 

water usage data. These six subsidiaries are:

• CBM Pte Ltd 

• CDL Hospitality Trusts

• City Serviced Offices

• Le Grove Serviced Residences

• Tower Club Singapore

• Hotels owned and managed by Millennium &amp; 

Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&amp;C)

The Group’s London-based hotel arm, M&amp;C, is one of 

the world’s largest hotel chains, with over 152 hotels 

worldwide, many in key gateway cities. It was delisted in 

October 2019 from the London Stock Exchange following 

a successful privatisation exercise by CDL. 

Monetary values in this Report are presented in 

Singapore dollars, which is CDL’s functional currency. 

Where possible, we have provided up to five years 

of historical data for comparison. CDL voluntarily 

discloses the information as we believe in upholding the 

principles of corporate transparency, disclosure, and 

communication with our stakeholders. 

For additional information on our comprehensive 

initiatives on sustainability, please refer to our 

sustainability microsite: www.cdlsustainability.com.

Report Content

In each reporting cycle, CDL’s Sustainability Committee 

reviews the content of the Report for accuracy, 

completeness and balanced reporting. Efforts are also 

made to ensure that current and emerging material 

issues pertaining to sustainability and the interests of 

our stakeholders are addressed. The BSC reviews and 

approves the Report before it goes into circulation.

Other operational committees oversee existing 

management systems and certifications such as 

the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System, 

ISO 50001 Energy Management System, ISO 45001 

Occupational Health and Safety (migrated from OHSAS 

18001 Occupational Health and Safety Assessment 

System in 2020), and Singapore Quality Class. Relevant 

targets and key performance indicators are established, 

tracked, and disclosed within this Report. In line with 

our steadfast commitment to align CDL’s environmental 

practices with international best practices, CDL became 

the first Singapore developer in 2016 to validate our 

GHG emissions data against the stringent ISO 14064 for 

GHG verification. 

Our Report continues to integrate ISO 26000:2010 

Guidance on social responsibility, and the Company 

actively promotes compliance with internationally 

adopted standards and regulations in the fields of 

occupational standards, environmental protection and 

the fight against corruption.

REPORT PERIOD  

AND SCOPE 

Reporting Boundaries and Standards

This report has been prepared in accordance with the 

GRI Standards: Comprehensive option. Its Reporting 

Principles for defining reporting content are:

• Stakeholder Inclusiveness: Beyond identifying our 

stakeholders and responding to their expectations 

and interests, we engage our builders and suppliers 

in the rigorous reporting process in line with the GRI 

Standards. This helps to raise the accountability of 

stakeholders along our supply chain.

• Sustainability Context: Presenting performance in 

the wider context of sustainability;

• Materiality: Focussing on issues that impact 

business growth and of utmost importance to our 

stakeholders;

• Completeness: Including full coverage of material 

topics and boundaries that are of significant 

economic, environmental and social impact to enable 

stakeholders to assess CDL’s performance in the 

reporting period.

This Report continues to adopt the IIRC’s Integrated 

Reporting Framework by connecting ESG performance 

with business and financial impact for more meaningful 

and all-rounded corporate reporting. Centred around 

six capitals—Financial, Organisational, Natural, 

Manufactured, Human, and Social and Relationship—

this approach aims to present a holistic picture to our 

investors and stakeholders on how the interrelation 

between our business and sustainability performance 

leads to long-term value creation. In stepping up our 

climate-related disclosures, CDL’s TCFD and SASB 

real estate sector disclosures have been expanded 

substantially in 2020 and are available in the annexes of 

this Report. 

In 2020, this Report was assured to be in conformance 

with the CDSB framework, with the exception of Principle 

1 on materiality. Environmental information in this 

Report has been prepared and reported according to 

the guiding principles and requirements of the CDSB 

framework. CDL’s 2020 materiality assessment was 

independently conducted by an external consultant, and 

“Climate Resilience” and “Energy Efficiency and Adoption 

of Renewables have been consistently ranked as one of 

CDL’s top material ESG issues.

This Report is prepared in accordance with the 

sustainability reporting requirements set out in the 

Listing Manual of the Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) (Rules 711A and 711B). 

Since 2005, CDL has been a signatory to the UNGC 

and has upgraded to ‘participant’ level in 2019. CDL 

is committed to UNGC’s Ten Principles. This Report 

also serves as our Communication on Progress (CoP) 

conducted by UNGC annually. Details are available at 

www.unglobalcompact.org. 

This Report is also aligned with relevant performance 

indicators of key sustainability benchmarks such as  

CDP, DJSI, FTSE4Good, Global 100, GRESB, and MSCI.  

Our carbon footprint is calculated in accordance with 

the GHG Protocol, developed by World Resources 

Institute and World Business Council on Sustainable 

Development. The GHG Protocol supplies the world’s 

most widely used greenhouse gas accounting standards. 

In addition to the GHG Protocol, our carbon emissions 

are also calculated based on The CarbonNeutral® 

Protocol, a set of guidelines to meet the global standard 

for managing our offset-inclusive programmes. The 

CarbonNeutral® Protocol includes requirements for GHG 

assessments, emissions reduction planning, carbon 

credit eligibility, management of carbon credits through 

registration and retirement, and communication of 

CarbonNeutral® programmes.

REPORT PERIOD  

AND SCOPE 

We use an operational consolidation approach to 

determine organisational boundaries. For example, our 

carbon and energy data include only the distribution 

impacts. Data is consolidated from a number of sources, 

including our project sites and fuel use information, and 

is analysed centrally. Our baseline year is 2007 and our 

emissions are independent of any GHG trades. 

External Assurance

This Report continues to be externally assured to validate 

the accuracy and reliability of its content. Ernst &amp; Young 

LLP (EY) was engaged to provide independent limited 

assurance of this Report against the GRI Standards for 

sustainability reporting and the Construction &amp; Real 

Estate Sector Supplement. The assurance covered figures 

and statements found in this Report that are related to 

the subject matters approved by CDL’s Chief Sustainability 

Officer and agreed upon as per the Assurance Statement. 

EY reviewed the underlying systems and processes that 

support the subject matters in this Report. The assurance 

is in accordance with ISAE 3000 Assurance Engagements 

Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 

Information. The assurance, including the scope of work 

and conclusions, can be found in the Assurance Statement 

on page 119 to 131.

In line with our steadfast commitment to align CDL’s 

environmental practices with international best 

practices, CDL’s 2020 GHG emissions data continue 

to be verified against ISO 14064 by Lloyd’s Register 

Quality Assurance Ltd. (LRQA) in accordance with 

the requirements of ISO 14064-1. LRQA’s Assurance 

Statement on the GHG report prepared by CDL, can be 

found on pages 116 to 118.

Estimated numbers were used for Corporate Office water usage in 2018 and January to March 2019 due to the ongoing efforts of installing water meters in CDL Corporate Office, having relocated from City House to Republic Plaza. 

Water consumption data from April 2019 was taken from installed water meters. 

5 

Since Corporate Office’s water use data is reported separately, the water use figures for Corporate Office have been separated from managed buildings to avoid duplication.

ASSURANCE STATEMENT

Management Responsibility

The management of CDL was responsible for preparing 

the GHG report and for maintaining effective internal 

controls over the data and information disclosed. LR’s 

responsibility was to carry out an assurance engagement 

on the GHG report in accordance with our contract with 

CDL. Ultimately, the GHG report has been approved by, 

and remains the responsibility of CDL.

LR’s Approach

Our verification has been conducted in accordance 

with ISO 14064–3:2006, ‘Specification with guidance for 

validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions’ 

to provide reasonable assurance that the GHG data 

as presented in the GHG report has been prepared in 

conformance with ISO 14064–1:2006, ‘Specification with 

guidance at the organizational level for quantification and 

reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals’.

To form our conclusions, the assurance engagement 

was undertaken as a sampling exercise and covered the 

following activities: 

• conducted verifications of the following: “Corporate 

Office”, “Commercial Buildings”, “Industrial 

Buildings” and “Property Developments Sites”

emissions data and records; 

• reviewed the GHG report for conformance with ISO 

14046-1:2006; 

• interviewed key personnel responsible for the 

management of GHG data and information and the 

preparation of the GHG report at the above facilities; 

• verified, on a sampling basis, the historical GHG 

emissions data and records included in the GHG 

report back to the source for the calendar year 2020; 

• verified the emission factors used that included 

‘average operating margin for electricity grid’ 

factoring upstream fugitive methane emissions, 

transmission &amp; distribution losses, purchase of 

renewable energy certificates, water supply and 

water treatment, diesel, petrol, refrigerant gases, 

business air travel (excluding the influence of 

radiative forcing), overseas hotel accommodation and 

employee commuting with the source reference and

emissions, energy indirect GHG emissions (Location-

based &amp; Market-based) and other indirect GHG 

emissions [Indirect emissions arising from construction 

main contractors’ activities (fuel used in power 

generators and heavy vehicles, purchased electricity, 

electricity upstream emissions and transmission 

losses and water usage) for property development 

operations, electricity upstream emissions, distribution 

and transmission losses, local and international courier 

services, employee commute, overseas business 

travel (excluding the influence of radiative forcing) and 

overseas hotel accommodations, water supply and water 

treatment for corporate office and asset management 

operations.] as disclosed in the GHG report and as 

summarized in Table 1 below are materially correct, and

This Assurance Statement is subject to the provisions of 

this legal section: 

This Assurance Statement is only valid when published 

with the Report to which it refers. It may only be 

reproduced in its entirety. 

Lloyd’s Register Group Limited, its affiliates and 

subsidiaries, including Lloyd’s Register Quality 

Assurance Limited and their respective officers, 

employees or agents are, individually and collectively, 

referred to in this Legal Section as ‘Lloyd’s Register’. 

Lloyd’s Register assumes no responsibility and shall not 

be liable to any person for any loss, damage or expense

signed a contract with the relevant Lloyd’s Register entity 

for the provision of this information or advice and in that 

case, any responsibility or liability is exclusively on the 

terms and conditions set out in that contract. 

Due to inherent limitations in any internal control, it is 

possible that fraud, error, or non-compliance with laws 

and regulations may occur and not be detected. Further, 

the verification was not designed to detect all weakness 

or errors in internal controls so far as they relate to 

the requirements set out above as the verification 

has not been performed continuously throughout the 

period and the verification carried out on the relevant 

internal controls were on a test basis. Any projection 

of the evaluation of control to future periods is subject 

to the risk that the processes may become inadequate 

because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 

compliance with them may deteriorate.

INDEPENDENT LIMITED 

ASSURANCE STATEMENT

Criteria applied by CDL 

In preparing the report, CDL applied the Global 

Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards’ 

(‘GRI Standards’), SASB Real Estate Industry Standard 

and CDSB Framework (‘Criteria’).  Such Criteria were 

specifically designed for sustainability performance; 

as a result, the subject matter information may not be 

suitable for another purpose.

Management’s and Board of Directors’ 

responsibility 

Management is responsible for selecting Criteria, 

and for presenting the Subject Matter Information in 

accordance with that Criteria, in all material respects. 

This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining 

internal controls, maintaining adequate records and 

making estimates that are relevant to the preparation 

of the subject matter, such that it is free from material 

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

The Board has ultimate responsibility for the 

company’s sustainability reporting. For the purpose 

of the Integrated Sustainability Report 2021, there 

are no legally prescribed requirements relating to the 

verification of sustainability reports. 

Auditor’s responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the 

presentation of the Subject Matter Information based on 

the evidence we have obtained. 

We conducted our engagement in accordance with the 

International Standard on Assurance Engagements 

Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 

Information (‘ISAE 3000’) and the terms of reference for 

this engagement as agreed with CDL on 07 September 

2020. Those standards require that we plan and perform 

our engagement to obtain limited assurance about 

whether, in all material respects, the Subject Matter 

is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to 

issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the 

procedures selected depend on our judgment, including 

an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, 

whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the 

evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 

a basis for our limited assurance conclusions.

Our review was limited to the information on the select 

indicators set out within the Report from 01 January 2020 to 

31 December 2020 and our responsibility does not include:

• Any work in respect of sustainability information 

published elsewhere in CDL’s annual report, website 

and other publications,

• Sustainability information prior to 01 January 2020 

and subsequent to 31 December 2020, and

• Management’s forward looking statements such as 

targets, plans and intentions.

Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and other 

ethical requirements of the Accounting and Corporate 

Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional 

Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and 

Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), which is founded 

on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 

professional competence and due care, confidentiality 

and professional behaviour.

Our firm applies Singapore Standards on Quality Control 

1 of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants 

and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system 

of quality control including documented policies 

and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 

requirements, professional standards and applicable 

legal and regulatory requirements.

We have the required competencies and experience to 

conduct this assurance engagement. Our professionals 

have experience in both assurance skills and in the 

applicable subject matter including environmental, social 

and financial aspects.

Description of procedures performed 

Procedures performed in a limited assurance 

engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less 

in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. 

Consequently the level of assurance obtained in a 

limited assurance engagement is substantially lower 

than the assurance that would have been obtained had 

a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. 

Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level 

of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not 

provide all the evidence that would be required to provide 

a reasonable level of assurance.

Although we considered the effectiveness of 

management’s internal controls when determining the 

nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance 

engagement was not designed to provide assurance on 

internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing 

controls or performing procedures relating to checking 

aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.

processes for data aggregation and reporting, with 

relevant personnel to understand the quality of 

checks and control mechanisms, assessing and 

testing the controls in relation to the concerned 

subject matters in the Report

4. Interviews with employees and management 

(Sustainability committee, human resources, property 

&amp; facilities management, environment health &amp; safety, 

internal audit, enterprise risk management, projects) 

to understand key sustainability issues related to the 

select indicators and processes for the collection and 

accurate reporting of performance information

5. Obtain documentation through sampling methods to 

verify assumptions, estimations and computations 

made by management in relation to the concerned 

subject matters in the Report

concerned subject matters in the Report

We also performed such other procedures as we 

considered necessary in the circumstances.

Observations and areas for improvement

Our observations and areas for improvement will be 

raised in an internal report to CDL’s Management. These 

observations do not affect our conclusions on the Report 

set out below. 

Conclusion

Based on our procedures and the evidence obtained, we 

are not aware of any material modifications that should 

be made to the Subject Matter Information as of 12 April 

2021 for the year ended 31 December 2020, in order for it 

to be in accordance with the Criteria.

Restricted use 

This report is intended solely for the information and 

use of the Management of CDL and is not intended to 

be and should not be used by anyone other than those 

specified parties.
