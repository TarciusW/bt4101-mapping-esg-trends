BOARD MESSAGE ON SUSTAINABILITY

As the Board of Directors (“BOD” or “The Board”) of the 

Manager of CIT (“CITM” or the “Manager”), we recognise 

that creating sustainable value for all of our stakeholders 

remains at the heart of our business. As one of Singapore’s 

pioneer Real Estate Investment Trusts (“REITs”), we aim 

to be amongst the first to adopt progressive sustainability 

practices. We believe that for us to prosper, the communities 

we serve and operate in have to prosper as well. We are 

committed to being an active contributor in elevating society 

and minimising our environmental footprint. We recognise that 

exceptional environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

performance will bring us a host of advantages in the long 

term – driving operational performance excellence, managing 

risks, discovering opportunities, protecting the assets of CIT 

and the interests of its unitholders (“Unitholders”).

Guided by our beliefs and our commitment, we have actively 

sought to align our business strategies, policies and practices 

with our sustainability objectives. Our sustainability approach 

remains focused on value creation for all our stakeholders.

 

The Board has set a strategic direction to achieve CIT’s 

sustainability goals through ensuring good corporate 

governance, complying with regulations, managing of enterprise 

risks, exercising prudence in financial management, providing 

quality assets and services, achieving tenant satisfaction, 

upholding health and safety standards, ensuring diversity 

and equal opportunity of workforce, limiting environmental 

impact, utilising resources efficiently and engaging with the 

communities in which CIT operates in. We are proud that our 

sustainability efforts have earned us a position in the inaugural 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) 

Sustainability Leaders Enhanced Index in 2016.

Supported by the Sustainability Committee and the Management 

team, the Board continues to identify, manage and address 

ESG factors material to our business.  We are confident that our 

continued efforts will have an impact on overcoming society’s 

sustainability challenges of today and tomorrow.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

Following the first materiality assessment in early 2016, the Manager conducted a review of all material issues in November 

2016 to evaluate the relevance of the material sustainability issues. Material issues remain relevant across the two sustainability 

reporting years. Figure 4 presents the list of material issues identified and mapped against the GRI-G4 Aspects.

FIRST FORMAL MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT  

(EARLY 2016)

•	 Conducted	the	Four-Step	Process	–	Identification	of	

Issues, Prioritisation, Validation and Review – which 

took reference from GRI G4 Reporting Guidelines.

•	 This	consisted	of	identifying	an	exhaustive	list	of	

governance, social and environment issues through 

peer benchmarking, desktop review, discussion with 

stakeholders, etc.

•	 Through	an	unbiased	anonymous	electronic	voting	

exercise, issues were prioritised – material issues 

identified

•	 Material	issues	were	presented	and	approved	by	

the Board members

•	 Approved	list	of	material	issues	were	later	mapped	

to the GRI G4 reporting framework and aspects

SELECTED ISSUES FOR REPORTING 

•			Nine	material	sustainability	issues

•			Eight	not	material	issues	but	selected	for	reporting	as	these	are	significant	

in the context of Singapore and the real estate industry

REVIEW OF MATERIAL ISSUES  

(NOVEMBER 2016)

•	 Guided	by	independent	sustainability	consultants,	

the review saw all CITM and CIPM department 

heads contributing their internal and external 

perspective in determining the relevance of the 

material issues

•	 These	issues	were	categorised	into	four	main	

categories – Environment, Social, Governance 

and Economic

•	 We	will	continue	with	our	efforts	in	these	categories	

in the years to come

ABOUT THE REPORT

CIT’s second annual sustainability report has been prepared 

in accordance with the ‘Core’ option of the internationally 

recognised Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) G4 Guidelines, 

and the GRI Construction and Real Estate Sector Supplement 

(“CRESS”). Reference has also been made to the primary 

components of sustainability reporting as set out by SGX-ST’s 

“Comply or Explain” requirements for sustainability reporting 

(http://rulebook.sgx.com/net_file_store/new_rulebooks/s/g/

SGX_Mainboard_Practice_Note_7.6_July_20_2016.pdf).

Unless otherwise stated, the report covers the ESG performance 

of	CIT’s	properties	in	Singapore	from	1	January	2016	to	 

31 December 2016, with 2015 data stated for comparison, 

where available. Environmental performance pertains only to 

the common areas in CIT’s multi-tenanted properties, where the 

Manager has the ability to monitor and influence the efficiency 

of utilities. The Manager is in the process of engaging master 

lessees on sustainability issues and appropriate data collection 

for future reporting. The Manager has not sought external 

assurance for this reporting period and will look to have the 

report verified as reporting and data systems mature over time.

GOVERNANCE

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

Good corporate governance is the cornerstone of sustainability. 

The Manager believes that upholding high standards in 

corporate governance protects the assets and the reputation 

of CIT and in the process enhances the value of Unitholders’ 

investment. 

Responsible leadership is the key to upholding the highest 

corporate governance standards. Qualified and experienced 

professionals are appointed at both CITM and CIPM, who 

are tasked to ensure the long term business continuity that 

in turn creates stability in the markets in which CIT operates.

The Manager’s objective is to provide Unitholders with a 

secure and stable distribution and achieve long-term growth

in net asset value (“NAV”) per unit through the successful 

implementation of the following strategies: 

•	 Acquisition	of	value-enhancing	properties;	

•	 Proactive	asset	management;	

•	 Divestment	of	non-core	properties;	and

More details on CIT’s approach to corporate governance, 

including how Board Members are appointed and remunerated 

can be found in the Corporate Governance section of CIT’s 

Annual Report 2016 on pages 76 to 95.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUSTAINABILITY

Formed in 2015, the Sustainability Committee, guided by the Board, is responsible for integrating sustainability principles and 

policies throughout the business in the coming years. The Sustainability Committee is also tasked to supervise the Sustainability 

Reporting Team in the annual reporting efforts.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

The business world is constantly evolving. CIT recognises 

that Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) is a systematic and 

extensive approach that enables the organisation to identify, 

measure, prioritise and respond to the risks that arise and 

threaten its business-critical objectives and operations. ERM 

is about recognising opportunities as much as it is about 

identifying threats. To capitalise on opportunities, the Manager 

has to take risks. Risk management is not about pursuing risk 

minimisation as a goal but rather about optimising the risk-

reward relationship, within known and agreed risk appetite 

levels. The Manager therefore takes risks in a prudent manner 

for justifiable business reasons.

7

CAMBRIDGE INDUSTRIAL TRUST SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016




GOVERNANCE

COMPLIANCE

Any form of non-compliance could potentially damage CIT’s 

reputation and affect the confidence of the Unitholders and 

potential investors. It may also result in penalties (e.g. fines, 

public warnings or reprimands from the Authorities) or even 

the revocation of CIT’s capital markets services license. While 

compliance is mandatory, CIT also views laws and regulations 

as critical to its role in maintaining Singapore’s reputation as 

a fair and efficient economy and marketplace.

The Manager has established relevant regulatory related policies 

and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable legislation 

and regulations. Regulatory compliance is monitored via regular 

attestations, routine compliance monitoring programs, reporting 

of regulatory breaches and internal / external / regulatory 

inspection findings to ensure that CIT, the Manager and the 

Property Manager are adhering to regulatory requirements. 

The Manager maintains a good compliance track record. In 

2016, there were no reported cases of non-compliance with 

any laws and regulations.

ENERGY AND CARBON EMISSIONS

On 4th November 2016, the Paris Agreement entered into 

force – a momentous milestone in the global battle against 

climate change. As part of the Agreement, Singapore has 

formally ratified its commitment to reduce emissions intensity 

by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030 on an emissions per $GDP 

basis. Projecting from 2005, Singapore’s business-as-usual 

(“BAU”) emissions are expected to reach 77.2 million tonnes 

CO2 by 2020 with an approximately 13.8%6 contributed by 

the building sector. 

In 2015, the Singapore Government’s Inter-Ministerial 

Committee on Sustainable Development (“IMCSD”) produced 

the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint which solidifies Singapore’s 

goal to be a leading green economy with eco-smart towns. 

To that end, the Building Construction Authority (“BCA”) has 

focused on improving energy efficiency of the buildings in 

Singapore and targets to have 80% of buildings in Singapore 

achieve the BCA Green Mark standard by 2030.

CIT aspires to be one of the greenest Industrial REITs in Asia. 

The Manager believes that it has to play its part by adopting 

greener practices and initiatives to reduce the collective 

environmental impact over the long term.

As a result of the Manager’s investments, the following 

has been achieved: 

•	 Doubled	cost	savings	as	compared	to	2015	(S$750,000	

for FY2016 vs. S$300,000 for FY2015)

•	 Three-fold	increase	in	solar	energy	harvested	in	FY2016	

as compared to FY2015

•	 Reduction	of	carbon	emissions	by	927,237kg

To demonstrate the Manager’s commitment to be one 

of the greenest Industrial REITs in Asia, to date we have 

equipped eight of CIT’s properties with solar energy 

harvesting facilities, many of which were commissioned 

in 2015. The Manager is currently working with head 

tenants at several more buildings with an objective to 

install similar systems in order to increase the clean 

energy usage.

CASE STUDY

COMMITMENT TO 

SUSTAINABILITY:  

OFFICE RELOCATION  

TO CAPITAGREEN

After 10 years at Robinson Road, the corporate 

offices for both the Manager and the Property 

Manager relocated to CapitaGreen in October 2016, 

after a thorough comparison of options based on 

cost efficiency.  The new office has better indoor 

environmental quality, which supports the company’s 

views on health and safety of employees and overall 

sustainability. The office unit is GreenMark Gold 

Plus Certified (under the landlord’s name) and the 

building, CapitaGreen, is certified with Green Mark 

Platinum (2012) and Universal Design Gold (2013). 

The following are some of the office space highlights: 

•	 Energy	efficient	fluorescent	T5	with	e-ballasts	and	

LED	lights	fitted	throughout	the	office,	operated	

by motion sensors and photocells

•	 All	windows	are	fitted	with	GreenGuard	Certified	

blinds

•	 Temperature	and	humidity	sensors	are	installed	

in the server room

•	 Meeting	rooms	are	equipped	with	acoustic	echo	

panels to reduce internal noise levels

•	 Floor	finishes	are	made	from	recycled	fishing	nets

•	 All	printers	have	built-in	systems	to	monitor	energy	

usage to optimise savings

In less than two months after the office relocation in 

October	2016,	the	Company	has	saved	52	kg	in	carbon	

dioxide equivalent emissions as at 31 December 2016.

The Manager and the Property Manager have a strong 

commitment to waste management and follow the 

following guidelines:

•	 Active	recycling	by	segregating	plastics	and	cans	

from general waste

•	 Disposal	of	electrical	and	IT-related	hardware	

through	the	building’s	e-waste	collection	bins

•	 Default	printing	set-up	on	black	ink	and	double-

sided pages to minimise the use of paper

The total electricity consumption of CIT’s properties remained 

stable	 in	 FY2016.	 Total	 grid	 electricity	 consumed	 was	 

8,421.3	MWh,	a	minimal	increase	of	0.19%	as	compared	to	FY2015	

levels.	Energy	used	on	sqm	basis,	“energy	intensity”,	has	however	

decreased by 33% to 131 kWh/m2, indicating greater use of 

alternative energy – solar energy – despite expansion in operations 

(Figure	9).	The	slight	increase	in	carbon	emissions	and	decrease	

of	carbon	intensity	corresponds	to	these	statistics	(Figure	10).

ENVIRONMENT 

WATER STEWARDSHIP 

Only an estimated 2.5% of the world’s water supplies is fresh 

water. Access to clean, fresh water is recognised as a human 

right and is becoming increasingly scarce in today’s world. 

The Singapore government places great importance on the 

efficient use of water, as reflected in one of the key goals 

in its sustainability blueprint targets by 2030. In addition, 

Singapore is internationally recognised as the world’s model 

city for managing water and often known as the world’s hydro 

hub – a leading centre for expertise in water technologies. 

 

In line with the nation’s efforts towards water conservation, the 

Manager too has embarked on water efficiency initiatives and 

targets to achieve Water Efficient Building (“WEB”) Certification 

for all upgraded toilets in its properties by the end of FY2017. 

In	FY2016,	two	CIT	properties	–	30	Toh	Guan	Road	and	128	Joo	

Seng Road – were upgraded and its fittings and fixtures were 

converted to two-tick PUB Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme 

(“WELS”). As at the end of FY2016, ten MTBs (representing 

40% of all MTBs in CIT’s portfolio) have been upgraded. Eight 

of these MTBs have already been awarded with WEB, and two 

are still in the process of obtaining the certification.

In 2016, total municipal water consumption was 55,079m3, an 

approximate decrease of 28% from 2015 levels (Figure 12).

WASTE MANAGEMENT

Singapore is a small city-state and prudent use of land is 

necessary for its continued economic growth. Sustainable 

waste management practices are vital in helping Singapore 

conserve land for productive uses and continued economic 

growth. The Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015 has set a 

national recycling rate target of 70% by 2030. 

In support of the nation’s targets, the Manager believes in the 

importance of inculcating amongst employees, tenants and 

visitors the values of recycling, reusing and reducing waste. 

Such values not only ensure effective waste management in 

our properties, but also encourage individuals to act as change 

agents in the community. 

All of CIT’s properties are served by National Environmental 

Agency (“NEA”) registered public waste collectors and NEA-

licensed general waste collectors. NEA adopts waste-to-energy 

(“WTE”) incineration which reduces the volume of Singapore’s 

waste by approximately 90%7.  

In FY2016, there were no incidences of non-compliance with 

waste disposal laws and regulations. 

The Property Manager will consider measuring its waste 

disposal in future years, and is looking towards the viability 

of a dedicated comprehensive recycling or waste programme 

for all CIT properties.

The Property Manager has also been actively engaging with 

tenants on recycling programs. A total of 4.4 tonnes of waste, 

comprising of paper, plastics, cans and glass, have been 

recycled in FY2016. The Property Manager will continue to roll 

out more awareness programmes and highlight the importance 

of recycling in all CIT properties.

SINGAPORE ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND LAND TENURE

According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), 

Singapore’s economy grew by 2% in 2016 (as compared 

to 2015: 2.0%), as a result of the economic restructuring. In 

response to this, the government has implemented several 

policies and initiatives to ensure the sustainability of the property 

market. Since 2013, Seller’s Stamp Duty (“SSD”) on industrial 

properties and Total Debt Servicing Ratio (“TDSR”) framework 

and Assignment Prohibition Period were implemented. With 

the release of Industry Transformation Map (“ITM”) in 2016, 23 

industries are expected to benefit from the potential growth 

and competitiveness of this strategy. The Logistics Industry 

Transformation Map (“LITM”) (part of the ITM), serves as a 

mechanism to reinforce Singapore’s position as regional and 

global logistics hub, enabling industry to achieve a value-add 

of S$8.3 billion and create 2,000 new quality jobs by 2020. 

Other policies such as The Industrial Government Land Sales 

Programme were implemented and will take effect in 2017. 

To better understand its performance in the midst of the 

economic outlook, the Manager has appointed an independent 

consultant to conduct a study of the industrial property market 

in Singapore. More details on the industry study are found on 

pages 48 to 62 of CIT’s Annual Report 2016.

CAPITAL AND ASSETS MANAGEMENT

The Manager continues to focus on its long-term objective of 

providing Unitholders with a secure and stable income stream 

and achieving long-term growth in net asset value. Strong 

governance structure, appropriate access to capital and due 

consideration for broader economic and business environment 

in Singapore are all key to the execution of this strategy. 

The Manager aims to meet its commitment to its Unitholders 

through the following strategies: 

1.	 Acquisition	of	value-enhancing	properties;

2.	 Pro-active	asset	management;

3.	 Divestment	of	non-core	properties;	and

4. Prudent capital and risk management.

The Manager believes that tenants, individual Unitholders, 

institutional investors and the broader stakeholder community 

will have increasingly high expectations for CIT to make positive 

contributions to society and the environment. These four key 

strategies also reflect CIT’s long-term sustainability objectives. 

CIT has been proactive in upgrading assets by progressively 

installing solar panels on its portfolio properties. By utilising 

renewable energy to complement electricity from the grid, CIT 

is achieving considerable cost savings, while also improving 

environmental outcomes in the long-term and creating shared 

value for tenants and Unitholders alike through sustainable 

financial returns. 

More information on CIT’s energy initiatives can be found at 

the ‘Environment’ section of this report.

Quality of Assets and Services 

Capital value and income generation of CIT are determined 

by the quality of CIT’s assets and services. Ensuring quality of 

CIT’s assets is critical to the interest of Unitholders. 

Vendors and suppliers are subject to an annual assessment 

which seeks to enhance the Manager’s position on quality of 

services and processes. In addition, the Manager seeks to 

attain appropriate certifications and awards that synchronise 

with these efforts (Figure 14).

Tenants And Visitors – Health, Hygiene and Safety

 

Health and safety remains as the highest priority for the Manager 

and	the	Property	Manager.	Keeping	tenants	and	visitors	safe	

and healthy requires prudent management of hygiene practices 

and the anticipation, evaluation and control of environmental 

stressors and hazards that may affect the well-being of people 

in the workplace. 

 

The Property Manager consistently monitors and manages 

exposure to potential risks and liabilities that may be detrimental 

to its operations and abides by the requirements of Occupational 

Health and Safety Management Systems (OHSAS) 18001:2007.

Singapore may be subjected to seasonal haze and flu 

pandemics. The Manager follows closely with updates by 

the local authorities on the environmental updates and 

recommended courses of action during any heightened health 

risks. The Property Manager reviews regularly all properties to 

ensure that they are equipped with the necessary protocol and 

kits should such any health and safety hazards occur.

Tenant Satisfaction

The Manager seeks to maintain high overall tenant satisfaction 

through regular communication, timely resolution of issues 

and progressive upgrading of facilities.  

Communication with tenants is maintained through several 

channels including periodic site visits, email correspondence, 

tenant events and the annual Tenant Satisfaction Survey.

In the Tenant Satisfaction Survey 2016, the overall tenant 

satisfaction achieved was 73%, an increase from 2015. Feedback 

gathered centered around the following aspects:

1. Service quality provided by various teams – Asset, Leasing, 

Property and Finance

2. Service quality provided by external vendors

3. Tenant’s environmental policies (if any)

In 2017, the Manager targets to achieve higher survey 

participation and improved satisfaction rate. The feedback 

received has helped CIPM to target facilities for improvement 

programmes in the coming years. Some planned improvement 

programmes underway are lift modernisation, façade 

enhancement, landscape improvement and greenery in the 

common spaces.

are based on a meritocratic approach. As at December 2016, 

CITM’s gender composition was 73% female and 27% male. In 

addition, the composition by employment category remained

The Manager has put in place a succession plan for its key 

team members to minimise disruption in its operations. 

Consistency in its implementation allows smooth transition 

of responsibilities and ensures minimum impact on business 

operations. During the year, Mr David Mason resigned as 

Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer (“COO

Mr Shane Hagan, an experienced real estate professional

The entire transition was smoothly carried out. Also in the 

same year, Mr. Philip Levinson resigned as CEO and Executive 

Director to pursue other opportunities and Mr. Shane Hagan 

was appointed as Acting CEO, resulting in negligible impact 

on business operations. Recently, Mr Adrian Chui was 

appointed as the new CEO and Executive Director, while  

Mr Shane Hagan resumed his original role as COO and CFO.

Talent Attraction and Retention

 

CIT’s sustained growth is dependent on the quality of the 

human capital at its Manager and Property Manager, who in 

turn aim to attract good tenants, build strong relationships and 

maintain business continuity. The Manager and the Property 

Manager take full ownership of attracting and recruiting, 

managing professional development and building a pipeline 

of future leaders in an environment that embraces equal 

opportunity and quality growth, while constantly reviewing 

the adequacy and competitiveness of its employee benefits 

and engagement programs. 

Feedback through surveys such as the Annual Satisfaction 

Survey among employees helps the Manager and the Property 

Manager to identify areas for improvement. 

Retaining top performers begins with hiring the right talent. 

During the talent acquisition process, the human resource team 

identifies prospective candidates through careful analysis of 

knowledge, competency, attitude and cultural fit. An effective 

onboarding process is a vital link to forming first impression. 

The line manager continues to motivate, guide and evaluate 

their team members with a view to retain them. 

Visibility and alignment of corporate and personal goals help 

team members to increase their interest and commitment 

to the success of CIT. Goals form the basis for performance 

evaluation and job satisfaction, and their transparency and early 

communication is linked to greater retention. Management 

empowers team members to plan their own career development. 

Turnover levels are actively monitored, adapting strategies 

to improve retention performance. The Manager and the 

Property Manager strive to provide an environment aligned 

to its team members’ lifestyle wherever possible. Provision 

of additional leave days and flexible working arrangements 

allow team members to concentrate on personal commitments 

when needed. During the year, seven team members took 

parental leave and all have returned to work in the same role.  

The Manager continues to develop and put in place a holistic 

talent management strategy across the entire employment 

lifecycle for the long-term objective of the organisation. As 

at 31 December 2016, retention rate is reported to be at 70% 

with an average Employee Tenure of 3.3 years.

Diversity and Equal Opportunity

Diversity is a key driver of internal innovation and growth.  

A good blend of cultural background, perspective and 

experience are critical for an organisation’s ability to adapt in 

today’s dynamic environment. The Manager embraces diversity 

and upholds equality and inclusiveness in the workplace. 

 

The Human Resource Management (“HRM”) policy and 

practices are aligned with the key principles defined by the 

Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (“TGFEP”) 

and the Ministry of Manpower’s Fair Consideration Framework. 

As a Capital Market Services (“CMS”) license holder, the 

Manager endeavours to hire candidates who pass the rigorous 

due diligence checks on integrity, educational background 

and financial stability. The Manager also continues to conduct 

reviews to ensure that team members remain fit and proper  

throughout employment minimising potential risks affecting 

the business.

In addition, all employees are given ample opportunities to 

continuously upgrade their skills. All employees are required to 

have at least 20 training hours every year. As at 31 December 

2016, each employee has benefitted from an average of 35 

hours of training.

21

CAMBRIDGE INDUSTRIAL TRUST SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016


The Manager also works with suppliers and contractors to advocate equal opportunity in their employment, to the extent 

possible. Potential concerns related to suppliers and contractors and risk mitigating measures have been implemented over 

time (Figure 20).

False employment relationships (workers disguising as 

self-employed or illegal)

All contractual arrangements undergo due diligence process, 

and potential conflicts of interests are identified prior to 

formalising any contractual arrangements

Work performed without issue of legal contract

Team members are required to seek approvals in writing in order 

to facilitate payment to contractors after work is completed

Work performed without legal contracts or signed agreements 

are considered invalid. Team members are reminded to follow 

the approval process to avoid such situations

TEAM MEMBERS’ WELLNESS AND ENGAGEMENT

The Manager understands that team members’ wellness is 

important to the sustained success of the organisation. 

Initiatives addressing health concerns, work-life balance and 

flexibility in working arrangements are provided whenever 

possible. Initiatives such as the “Helping Employees Achieve 

Lifetime Health” (“HEALTH”) Charter and the Physical and 

Mental Health Programme are vital in ensuring that these 

matters are addressed. As part of HEALTH Programme, the 

Manager organises activities to enhance the health and well-

being of team members through providing opportunities to 

take part in exercises, health talks and annual health screening. 

For instance, in 2016, the Manager partnered with Virgin Active 

(“VA”) to encourage team members’ use of the gym facilities 

and fitness programs at any time of the day. Team members 

who have not signed up for the fitness program are encouraged 

to utilise the blocked timeslot on Thursday afternoons to jog 

around the Central Business District or pursue other alternative 

forms of exercise.

It is also important for the management to ensure that

organisation are always kept open. This minimises potential 

conflicts or misunderstandings that can affect work performance.

Annually, the Manager conducts a Team Member Satisfaction
