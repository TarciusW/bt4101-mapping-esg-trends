DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

We are pleased to present PRIME’s inaugural SR for FY2020. 2020 was a 

challenging year for all businesses globally but one which demonstrated the 

resiliency of PRIME’s financial and operational performances, where PRIME 

continued to exceed IPO financial forecasts for the second consecutive year. 

The pandemic has impacted global economic activity and it underscores the 

importance of companies to assess their long-term risks and to implement 

robust business continuity plans. PRIME is fully committed to sustainable 

business practices and has considered material ESG factors to enhance 

stakeholder value and trust. The Manager considers sustainability issues an 

integral part of its strategic formulation process and works closely with the 

Board of Directors for strategic direction in shaping PRIME’s future growth.

In FY2020, the Manager focused on monitoring and reviewing the 

management of five material ESG topics: Sustainable Economic Value, 

Energy and Carbon Abatement, Diversity and Inclusion, Health, Safety 

and Satisfaction of Stakeholders, and Ethical Behaviour and Compliance. 

The Board has maintained oversight of the management and integration 

of ESG issues into PRIME’s business operations and strategies, and will 

continue to do so. 

As we progress from year to year, the Manager will continue to seek 

opportunities with the purpose of long-term value creation for a more 

sustainable future.

Climate change is one of the most significant and urgent challenges today, and with 35% of REITs exposed to climate hazards1, 

the Manager recognises the critical importance of enhancing energy efficiency and reducing overall greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 

emissions. To that extent, the Manager is pleased to report that 11 out of the 12 properties in PRIME’s portfolio are U.S. Green 

Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) and Energy Star certified, demonstrating the Manager’s 

commitment to investing in properties that integrate sustainability into design and operations:

In FY2020, as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, global primary energy demand dropped by nearly 4%, and energy-related GHG 

emissions fell by 6.8%2  In line with the general decrease in energy demand, PRIME’s property managers have made the 

following adjustments to ensure energy efficiency: 

PRIME’s Energy Savings Initiatives in Response to COVID-19

Tower I at Emeryville

• Optimised heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (“HVAC”), with monthly assessments 

to assess tenant needs

• Monitored daily usage with Gridium, a tool for organising building operations such as 

energy use, in order to review the rate structure strategies for 2021 usage

222 Main

• Optimised HVAC and lighting usage on unoccupied floors by setting them to on 

demand during daytime hours

Village Center Station II

• Optimised HVAC and lighting usage expanding HVAC set points, allowing for maximum 

outdoor air circulation 

Tower 909

• Reduced chiller operation and run time to reflect the building load

• Optimised lighting usage with installation of sensor lighting with auto shut-off  

Promenade I &amp; II

• Optimised HVAC and lighting usage on unoccupied floors by adjusting the setpoints and 

exercising demand response 

Park Tower

• Optimised HVAC and lighting usage on unoccupied floors by setting them to on 

demand 

Considering the temporary positive impact of COVID-19 on energy demand, the Manager has a responsibility to ensure that 

energy efficiency remains a priority when business operations return to their normal occupancy rate. As such, PRIME’s property 

managers have implemented the following long-term initiatives:

PRIME’s Long-Term Energy Savings Initiatives

Tower I at Emeryville

• Forming trial partnerships with companies such as CORTEX and STEM to explore new technology with a focus 

on identifying areas where energy efficiency may be improved

• Investing in technological upgrades such as floor controls to ensure they are tied to Building Management 

System equipment and use Direct Drive Control to ensure the floors and zones are mapped such that they 

may be controlled and automated 

• Documenting improvements in efficiency measures for each tenant and submitted to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric 

Company for rebate consideration  

222 Main

• Participating in the Blue Sky programme with Rocky Mountain Power, which aims to reduce carbon footprint 

associated with energy usage

Tower 909

• Operating HVAC on Saturday business hours upon tenant’s request 

• Retrofitting LED lighting for speculative suites which offer move-in ready spaces, common corridors and 

restrooms 

• Utilising Energy Management System for remote management, optimal start operations and after hour 

temperature selections to reduce energy consumption

• Sound and motion activation for all stairwell lighting and parking garage

• Web-based irrigation system that adjusts watering schedule for landscaping according to real time weather data

Promenade I &amp; II 

• Participating in demand response during the Summer months. Demand response refers to voluntarily reducing  

electricity consumption during conservation events, when statewide demand for power use is at its highest

One Washington 

Center

• Purchasing renewable (wind) energy certificates equal to energy consumption 

• Participating in demand response

171 17th Street 

• Organising annual lunch and learn programme for tenants, to motivate and educate them on measures to 

reduce their carbon footprint 

• Conducting annual review of the building’s utility rate and energy tracking 

• Sharing energy knowledge and training with case studies and best practices across the project manager 

platform routinely

In addition to these initiatives, most properties have put in place recycling programmes for used batteries and fluorescent 

bulbs, as well as weather proofed window panels. 

The Manager also works to ensure that PRIME’s stakeholders are actively engaged in its community activities as part of the 

sustainability effort. One of the ways in which the property managers have involved stakeholders is through Earth Day celebrations. 

(1) Four Twenty Seven and GeoPhy, ‘Climate Risk, Real Estate and the Bottom Line’ (2018).

(2) International Energy Agency, ‘Global Energy Review: CO2 Emissions in 2020’ (2021)..

(3) Emissions factors are obtained from the U.S. Government Energy Information Administration’s latest available State Electricity Profile 2019 data across the 

respective States.

EARTH DAY AT CROSSPOINT

The Earth Day celebration at CrossPoint was held before the COVID-19 

pandemic. At this annual event, tenants, vendors and local groups have the 

opportunity to discuss green practices. 

Additionally, tenants are introduced to the latest technology related to 

renewable energy, from electric vehicles to home products.  



PERFORMANCE

In FY2020, the total electricity consumption of landlord-controlled areas across PRIME’s 12 properties is 52,138.1 MWh. This 

translates to energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions of an estimated 24,409.76 tonnes CO2.3

Diversity and inclusion in the workforce encourages innovation and increases employee satisfaction. The Manager therefore 

views diversity and inclusion as an important key to PRIME’s success and is committed to developing a workplace culture 

where people with a variety of skills, backgrounds, knowledge and industry experience can thrive. 

Currently, the Manager employs five people on a full-time, permanent basis. Each individually-selected employee is highly 

valued, and the Manager places an emphasis on providing equal treatment and opportunities for growth. The Manager does 

not tolerate any form of racial and ethnic, gender, or age discrimination. There were no reported incidents of discrimination 

in FY2020. The Manager aims to maintain this record going forward.

The health, safety and satisfaction of employees is of utmost importance to the Manager, and the Manager aims to achieve 

zero workplace injuries and fatalities every year. There were no workplace injuries and fatalities in FY2020.

The health and safety of tenants is also of the highest priority at all of PRIME’s properties.  

To ensure the safety of stakeholders, each of PRIME’s properties has robust policies and practices in place, and these policies 

and practices are reviewed regularly. They include building safety inspection and assessments, incident response and 

investigation procedures as well as reporting guidelines. Training is also provided for the property manager team to ensure 

that the property managers are able to identify and respond to health and safety threats, such as Fire Safety Training and 

Asbestos Awareness Training.

RESPONDING TO COVID-19

FY2020 was an exceptional year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure the health and safety of employees and tenants, 

each property has put additional precautions and measures in place. For example, at each property, the following initiatives 

were taken:

Initiatives in Response to COVID-19 at PRIME’s Properties

Providing hand sanitisers

• Installed at all main building entrances and main elevator lobbies and refilled daily by 

janitorial staff

• Provided individual bottles to tenants

Upgrades to equipment 

• Upgraded air filters to MERV 13 air filters, currently the highest quality air filters available 

• Installed NanoSeptic self-cleaning button covers in elevators to help keep high-touch 

surfaces disinfected 

Ensuring social distancing

• Leveraged technology such as Maptician software to analyse risks associated with 

develop socially distanced layouts for seating within the offices, facilitate work schedules 

for space planning, and assist with proximity contact tracing 

• Monitored building occupancy and controlled foot traffic throughout buildings 

• Put up signs reminding tenants and employees that social distancing must be enforced

Increased cleaning frequency 

• Arranged for additional cleaning staff during the daytime shift to focus on disinfecting 

high-touch areas such as door handles, elevator buttons, restrooms, etc.

• Dedicated one full-time staff to COVID-19 measures 

• Used UV sterilisation as required in common areas and upon request in tenant spaces.

Communication of updates related to 

COVID-19  

• Sent regular memos on all practices followed by building employees as well as links to 

CDC and WHO websites for COVID-19 updates 

At the Board level, each director is also selected for their extensive diverse experience and expertise. The Manager’s Board 

Diversity Policy provides clear guidance for merit-based appointments, and the provision of equal opportunities regardless of 

age, gender, culture, nationality, ethnicity, and tenure. Under the Board Diversity Policy, the Board’s structure, size, balance, 

and diversity are reviewed annually to assess the objectives and progress made in achieving an appropriately diverse board 

composition. Please refer to PRIME’s Corporate Governance Report in Annual Report FY2020 for more details on PRIME’s 

Board Composition, and the Board Diversity Policy. 

At the property level, all of PRIME’s buildings are built with the intention of being accessible to tenants who may require 

additional support. PRIME’s buildings are all ADA compliant4,  with ADA requirements varying according to the building’s needs. 

Examples of how PRIME’s buildings have been equipped according to building requirements are:

Examples of Compliance With ADA Requirements at PRIME’s buildings

Fire and Life Safety

• Equipped buildings to administer both sound and visual flashes to accommodate both 

visually and hearing impaired individuals

Restrooms 

• Installed ADA restrooms, where restroom stalls provide space for wheelchairs and sinks,

TENANT WELLNESS DURING COVID-19 

To engage with tenants specifically, the property managers at PRIME’s properties regularly held events with overall wellbeing 

in mind, such as Ice Cream Socials, Lemonade Stands, Hot Dog Events, Holiday Breakfasts, Puppy Therapy, Friday Popcorn, as 

well as fitness classes. These activities help to provide time for tenants’ employees to destress, as well as for tenants to build 

rapport with each other, and with their property managers. 

In light of COVID-19, PRIME’s property managers switched all engagements to virtual platforms as tenant health and wellbeing 

remained the focus. Examples of such activities include virtual social events such as Zoom events featuring renowned chefs, 

wine tastings and holiday parties, along with additional contests and raffles held throughout the year.

URBAN BEEHIVES AT CROSS POINT

PUMPKIN CARVING CONTEST AT RESTON SQUARE 





At Cross Point, the Manager partnered with Alveole to install an urban 

beehive and run interactive workshops with tenants on sustainability 

through interacting with the beehive. 

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the in-person workshops have been 

substituted with live-footage of the beehives and streaming video of 

the monthly beekeeper maintenance. Online beekeeping workshops 

have also been planned, and will be made available to all tenants. 

Furthermore, in order to keep tenants engaged, the property managers 

held a “Name the Queen” contest for building employees at Cross Point. 

The winning name for the queen bee at Cross Point is Queen Petunia. 

Before the pandemic, tenants were invited to participate in caring for 

the beehive, extracting honey and making candles out of beeswax. 

The honey from the beehives that was harvested at the end of the 

season was either shared with the tenants or donated. For tenants 

who did not wish to work directly with the beehives, there were other 

initiatives such as an educational introduction to honey bees, their 

role in people’s lives, and sustainability efforts to halt the rapid decline 

in the bee population. The feedback received from tenants was very 

encouraging. 

Keeping in mind COVID-19 safety measures, a virtual 

Pumpkin Carving Contest was organised in lieu of the 

annual Halloween party celebration at Reston Square.  

Tenants emailed pictures of their carved pumpkins for 

prizes, which were awarded based on the originality, 

details and creativity of the designs and craftwork. 

Similar events were held throughout December, such 

as virtual meet-and-greet sessions with Santa Claus, 

Spiderman, and Elsa, in order to keep the festive spirit 

going for Christmas and the New Year as social distancing 

continued.  

Good corporate governance is the cornerstone of long-term success for companies. Having a robust corporate governance 

system ensures that the Manager is well-placed to address any potential risks to the company’s reputation and promotes 

investor confidence. 

In FY2020, the COVID-19 pandemic posed unique challenges for PRIME. During the course of the year, the Board worked 

closely with the Manager in monitoring the situation as it developed. The Manager implemented its business continuity 

plan to address the impact of the pandemic on business operations, with all employees working remotely. The Board 

was regularly consulted on developments that required impact assessments and mitigation measures, as well as regularly 

updated on relevant legal and regulatory requirements in light of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation. 

The Manager takes a zero-tolerance stance towards bribery, corruption and non-compliance with relevant laws and 

regulations and adopted the Singapore Code of Corporate Governance issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. 

Please refer to PRIME’s Corporate Governance Report in Annual Report FY2020 for more details. 

In order to ensure that PRIME maintains its culture of responsible and ethical behaviour, the Board sets out a code of conduct 

and ethics, with a set of clear policies and procedures in place for dealing with conflicts of interest. The code of conduct 

sets out expectations and guidelines for employees of the Manager on matters of ethical concern, and is communicated 

to all employees with annual mandatory refresher training on our rules and ethics. To support the effectiveness of these 

policies and procedures, the Manager has in place appropriate risk control processes and undergoes regular internal and 

external audits to ensure those controls remain effective. 

To ensure that the Manager’s employees are well-positioned to contribute to its culture of responsible and ethical behavior, as 

well as keep abreast of legal and regulatory developments, the Manager ensures that each employee receives the necessary 

training. In FY2020, each employee received an average of 13 hours of training. At the C-Suite level, employees received 

an average of 10.6 hours of training, while employees at managerial level received an average of 14.7 hours of training.

To ensure that PRIME’s stakeholders have a safe and confidential avenue to raise concerns about possible improper behaviour 

observed in the course of business, the Manager has put in place a Whistleblowing Policy, which can be accessed at  

https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/71338/index.html.

The Manager also ensures that full compliance is achieved with the relevant laws and regulations that apply to PRIME. The 

Manager closely monitors changes in legislations and regulations, as well as significant developments in the operating 

environment.  Significant changes are promptly communicated to stakeholders.

related to COVID-19. To comply with the social distancing rules, the Manager’s employees were all instructed to work from 

home, and meetings with unitholders and stakeholders moved fully online. 

In terms of support for tenants at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Manager provided assistance for tenants by 

way of lease deferrals on a case-by-case basis. 

In FY2020, the Manager is pleased to report zero confirmed incidences of bribery or corruption, and no significant fines or 

non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws and regulations. The Manager aims to maintain this track record 

moving forward. 

For its efforts in upholding high standards of corporate governance, PRIME placed in the Top 10 in the Governance Index 

for Trusts (“GIFT”) 2020.
