About iX Biopharma 

GRI 102-2 | 102-3 | 102-4 | 102-5 | 102-6 | GRI 102-7 | 102-8 

 

 iX Biopharma is listed on the Singapore Exchange and is a limited 

liability company.  Our corporate office is in Singapore and we 

have operations in Australia and China.  

 

We are a specialty pharmaceutical and nutraceutical company, 

operating a fully integrated business model from drug 

development and manufacturing to sales and marketing. Our 

Company and our subsidiaries (the Group) are focused on the 

development and commercialisation of innovative therapies for 

improving the quality of life of those suffering from pain and other

Sustainability at iX Biopharma 

GRI 102-11 | 102-18 

 

Sustainability is integral to iX Biopharma’s business to achieve the lasting commercial success of iX Biopharma. We have embarked on the sustainability journey by looking at our responsibility for the environment 

we are operating in, people in our workforce and innovative products for the healthcare industry. At iX Biopharma, we understand the importance of reducing our environmental impact and are committed to 

conducting business in a responsible manner by supporting the precautionary principle. 

 

 

Sustainability Governance  

GRI 102-18 

Corporate governance is at the heart of our efforts in 

achieving our sustainability goals. We uphold the belief 

that good corporate governance practices are essential in 

building a sound corporation with an ethical environment, 

thereby protecting the interests of all stakeholders. We 

strive to put in place a robust governance framework to 

maintain the integrity, transparency, accountability and 

discipline in all our practices. 

 

The Board provides guidance on the social, ethical and 

environmental impact of the Group’s activities and 

oversees the monitoring and management of material 

sustainability issues and their performance indicators.  We 

consider sustainability issues relating to the environment 

and social factors as part of the Group’s strategic plans.  

The Management under the guidance of the Board is 

committed to integrating best sustainability practices into 

the Group’s working environment and business operation. 

 

Supply chain 

GRI 102-9  

As we are accountable to our stakeholders, we endeavour to ensure 

that appropriate risk management, key internal controls and 

procedures are in place during the procurement of goods and 

services. 

 

As at end of FY2020, we have a pool of approximately 260 active 

suppliers, including contractors, clinical research organisations, 

professional consultants, and financial institutions which are mainly 

based in Singapore, Australia, China and USA. In the future, we aim 

to embed sustainability measures into our value chain and integrate 

environmental factors wherever possible and appropriate. 

 

As 

an 

essential 

business 

supplying 

pharmaceutical 

and 

nutraceutical products, we continue to operate our manufacturing 

plant during the global COVID-19 pandemic with sustainable and 

robust supply chains to ensure uninterrupted supply to our 

customers.

Stakeholder Engagement 

GRI 102-40 | 102-42 | 102-43 | 102-44 

 

 

At iX Biopharma, we firmly believe in regularly engaging our 

stakeholders to understand the issues most important to them and 

our business impact. We have identified our key stakeholders based 

on importance, representation, dependency and proximity to our 

business. 

We are committed to integrating our stakeholders’ concerns in our 

business strategies and policies. Therefore, we continuously seek to 

explore effective communication channels and 

strengthen our relationships with them.

Materiality Assessment 

GRI 102-46 | 102-47 | 103-1 

 

 

Informed by GRI Standards, iX Biopharma has undertaken a 

detailed process to identify, prioritise and validate the 

environmental, social, governance and economic issues that 

matter most to our organisation. Our 2020 Sustainability Board 

Statement and peer research have also been referenced in this 

assessment.  

 

We conducted a materiality assessment workshop with our 

internal stakeholders. They were given a list of material 

sustainability topics identified by peers in their sustainability 

reports as well as working definitions to aid in the identification 

process.  

 

This was subsequently assessed for relevancy to both our 

stakeholders and the environmental, social and governance impact 

of our business operations.

Why is this a material issue? 

The Company’s core business is focused on the development and 

commercialisation of innovative therapies for improving the 

quality of life. This is aligned with the objectives of the government 

to develop innovative products. The Group has received 

recognition and support from the Singapore and Australia 

governments in various ways mentioned below.  

 

 

Our approach to managing  

We have proper practices in place to administer the 

grants and funds received. We consistently provide 

updates on the outcome of the programmes and how 

the funds were utilised to the necessary parties.  

 

 

 

Environment 

Energy 

GRI 103-1| 103-2 | 103-3 | 302-1 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

We are aware of our responsibility towards the environment. Our 

choice of efficient and clean sources of energy has the potential to 

the minimise the impact of our operations to the environment. As 

climate change continues to be one of the most pressing global 

issues, it is our duty as responsible corporate citizens to do what 

we can towards the global agenda of protecting our planet.  

 

As we transition from a R&amp;D centric organisation to a business that 

includes manufacturing and supply, we expect our environmental 

footprint to increase accordingly.  

 

Our approach to managing  

In our daily operations, electricity, which is used to power our office 

buildings, manufacturing plant and laboratory, contributes to the 

majority of our energy consumption. We use fuel for our backup 

generators; however, the consumption is negligible.  

 

We look forward to sourcing for more energy efficiency 

improvements that will help to cultivate good practices across our 

organisation to save energy.  

 

During the year, we commenced a programme to replace old or 

retired lighting and devices with energy saving models.  We will 

also seek to invest in practical solutions to mitigate and prevent 

adverse environmental impacts. 

 

Lower energy consumption during the year despite increase in our 

manufacturing activities was mainly due to a milder summer 

experienced and active energy management by our Australian 

operation.

GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 416-1|416-2 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Our aim at iX Biopharma is to develop products of the highest 

safety and quality standards. 

 

One of our top priorities is the safety and wellbeing of our 

customers. To ensure the quality and safety of our products, we 

have integrated quality standards, procedures and monitoring 

systems across our operations. All of our products are continuously 

assessed for health and safety impacts across our value chain. 

 

Our approach to managing  

As a pharmaceutical company, we comply with all relevant and 

material regulations and applicable industrial standards. We have 

incorporated procedures throughout the manufacturing process 

from raw materials sourcing to rigorous product testing. 

 

We have a dedicated Quality Assurance team to ensure that all 

materials used meet the necessary specification for all products. 

Some products undergo clinical trials, where the safety and efficacy 

aspects are assessed. We have also invested in the implementation 

of a pharmacovigilance monitoring system to handle feedbacks and 

recall events. We have in place an adverse effect events 

management programme. 

 

We adhere strictly to government regulations such as Therapeutic 

Goods Regulations 1990 of Australia, PIC/S Guide to Good 

Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products, Australian Code of 

Good Manufacturing Practice for Veterinary Medicines, and 

Therapeutics Advertising Code. This is made possible by having a 

robust Quality System that is focused on on-going monitoring.  Our 

Quality Assurance team constantly reviews our procedures, 

processes and quality of our products to ensure quality and 

compliance. 

 

We also review our compliance with Therapeutic Goods 

Administration (TGA) requirements from manufacturing to product 

and labelling standards for our pharmaceutical and nutraceutical 

products. As at the end of FY2020, two of our pharmaceutical 

products for erectile dysfunction are registered with the TGA.  In 

addition, all our nutraceutical products are listed on the Australian 

Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). 

 

During FY2020, we filed for marketing approval for Wafesil with the 

European Medicines Agency. Our application is currently being 

evaluated. We had also filed and obtained marketing approval for 

Silcap from Health Sciences Authority of Singapore in October 

2020. 

 

As for our medicinal cannabis product range, our medical science 

liaison team has been actively engaging with doctors and the 

industry to educate and train them on this product range and the 

WaferiX sublingual technology. This communicates our competitive 

advantages, imparts scientific and clinical knowledge on our 

products, and through practical interaction, helps us to understand 

and meet the needs of the market.  

 

We plan to carry out clinical research in certain conditions such as 

anxiety, pain and insomnia amongst others to contribute to the 

body of scientific understanding about therapeutic cannabis use. 

We will continue to train and support physicians using the results 

of such clinical investigations with the goal of improving the quality 

of prescriptions.  

 

As part of our commitment to our customer health and safety, we 

strive to achieve:  

• 

zero cases of non-compliance with regulations and/or 

voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of 

products 

• 

full assessment of health and safety impacts of all our 

products for improvement 

 

FY2020 and FY2019 

 

No cases of non-compliance with regulations 

and/or voluntary codes concerning the health and 

safety impacts of products 

 

All products (pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals) 

are tested prior to release and assessed for 

improvements

Social 

Training and Workplace Diversity 

GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 404-1 | 405-1 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

We value our employees as the key pillar for our long-term 

success. As an equal opportunity employer, we aspire to be the 

workplace of choice for our staff. We strongly believe in being 

inclusive with regard to hiring policies.  

 

We recognise that our employees are instrumental in the success 

and growth of our Group, and we are dependent on the quality and 

skill of our employees to resolve issues raised by our customers. 

 

Our approach to managing  

We employ the best talent, without discrimination on the basis of 

race, gender or age. We have policies and practices in place to 

ensure fair hiring and equal opportunity.  

 

Diversity is an integral part of engaging with the communities we 

work in.  In addition, merit and competency of employees are also 

key factors for the success of our business. We have in place 

multiple training manuals and systems for all our employees. 

 

The training systems ensure that all personnel are trained and 

deemed competent as required by their position description, 

assigned roles and responsibilities, and where a training gap exists, 

a plan is in place to close the gap. 

 

Safety, Health and Environment  

GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 403-2 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Our employees are our most valuable asset. Therefore, our success 

depends upon ensuring a safe and conducive work environment for 

them. Our goal is to improve the work environment for our people 

by reducing risks, preventing occupational hazards and fostering 

their physical and psychological well-being. 

 

At our manufacturing facility, we work with active ingredients some 

of which may be highly potent. In case of lack of understanding and 

awareness, improper management of these substances in large 

volumes can be dangerous for our workers and their surroundings. 

 

The onset of the global pandemic has placed health and safety in 

the workplace as a central concern for all businesses. We recognise 

that we have a responsibility to provide a safe and healthy work 

environment for all our employees.  

 

Our approach to managing  

To ensure the safety of our employees we have put in place 

standard operating procedures.  

 

The Group operates a site-based approach to Safety, Health and 

Environment (SHE) to ensure that offices and facility operate to 

national recognised standards. These include complying with 

government regulations and commitments to continuous 

improvements to health &amp; safety of our workforce at a minimum 

impact to the environment.  

 

A site SHE committee, comprising personnel at our Croydon site, 

oversees the implementation of policies and work practices, and 

reviews all reportable incidents and actions being taken. They are 

responsible for reviewing all reported incidents, assessing the root 

cause, addressing safety gaps and ensuring that corrective as well 

as preventive measures are taken. 

 

The results of the incidents are reviewed during monthly 

management meeting and at the site with the SHE committee 

quarterly.   

 

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken every step to 

ensure that our employees are protected from the risks of the virus. 

We implemented temperature monitoring, enhanced cleaning 

regimes and other safe workspace protocols across all locations.  

 

We also provide face masks and a daily dose of glutathione wafers 

to our employees. Glutathione is the most powerful antioxidant 

and has been shown to defend against viral infections and protects 

lung cells and other organs.  

 

During the year, no reportable incident has been recorded.

Innovation 

 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Innovation is the cornerstone of the Group and continues to be an 

important driver of future growth. WaferiX is a unique and versatile 

drug delivery platform that allows pharmacologically active 

compounds to disintegrate quickly under the tongue, reducing the 

effect of first-pass metabolism, and resulting in higher 

bioavailability, as compared to conventional methods of 

administration.  

 

At the date of this report, we hold patents for WaferiX in 5 

continents and all key markets including the United States, China, 

Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, India, 

Malaysia, and Indonesia, countries in the European Union and 

others. 

 

Patents: 56 patents granted, 1 patent allowed, 14 patents pending  

 

We have strong R&amp;D capability and collective experience in drug 

formulation, clinical pharmacology and drug delivery &amp; safety. Our 

R&amp;D activities are vital to our efforts to maintain our 

competitiveness in the industry as well as to further develop better 

and improved products.   

 

Our approach to managing  

We seek to identify areas of unmet or under-served therapeutic 

need and focus our research and development efforts on 

formulations of pharmaceuticals aimed at addressing such needs.  

 

Ongoing product developments 

 

▪ 

Wafermine 

What it is: Sublingual ketamine wafer for the treatment of 

acute moderate to severe pain 

Active compound: Racemic ketamine 

Clinical development status: Concluded End-of-Phase-2 (EOP2) 

meeting with the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) at 

end of 2019 and reached an agreement with US FDA and 

European Medicines Agency on key aspects of pivotal Phase 3 

clinical trial programme. 

 

▪ 

Xativa 

What it is:  Sublingual cannabidiol (CBD) wafer  

What is CBD: CBD is one of the primary compounds found in 

the cannabis plant 

Potential indications: Promising research suggests that CBD 

can help with chronic pain, certain inflammatory and motor 

diseases, appetite, anxiety and inflammatory bowel disease, 

among others. 

Sublingual delivery of CBD: CBD is known to have poor oral 

bioavailability. As a result, taking cannabis sublingually has the 

benefits of a faster onset of action and higher bioavailability. 

WaferiX, being a validated sublingual wafer, provides a more 

elegant and convenient way to administer CBD, giving users a 

better experience. 

Clinical development status: Supplied through Special Access 

Scheme and Authorised Prescriber pathway in Australia. 

Formulation currently being evaluated for use in the treatment 

of anxiety, pain, insomnia and other conditions. 

 

▪ 

BnoX 

What it is: a sublingual buprenorphine wafer for the treatment 

of moderate to severe pain 

Active compound: Buprenorphine 

Target patient population market: Buprenorphine has been 

shown to provide longer-lasting pain relief with fewer side 

effects compared to other opioids. It also exhibits a ceiling 

effect – higher doses do not result in unwanted additional 

opioid effects, including euphoria and respiratory depression. 

Patients are therefore less likely to develop addiction and

We believe that our WaferiX drug delivery platform is suitable 

for the development of other products that incorporate active 

pharmacological compounds. During the year, we commenced 

development on a number of new pharmaceutical sublingual 

wafer products with potential therapeutic indications including 

analgesia and sedation. 

 

We strive to combine innovative formulations and delivery 

systems to produce next-generation nutraceuticals which bring 

visible and perceptible change to improve our customers' 

health on a cellular level.
