BOARD  

STATEMENT





The Outpost Hotel Sentosa, Singapore

Hollingbury House, Brighton, United Kingdom

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

To ensure the long-term success of the Group, we have 

intensified our efforts to incorporate sustainability goals 

into our strategies and operations in 2019. We believe 

that building a sustainable business goes beyond the 

financials, and involves managing ESG issues that arise in 

the course of our operations.

By setting the tone from the top, we seek to create 

a sustainability-focused culture. At the Board level, 

sustainability issues have been and will continue to 

be considered in the development of the Group’s 

strategy. With the help of the Audit &amp; Risk Committee 

and Management Risk &amp; Sustainability Committee, 

sustainability-related risks and opportunities across 

various business functions were assessed in 2019. 

As a Board, we are also involved in the materiality analysis 

to identify ESG factors that are important to our key 

stakeholders and/or significant to our business. Working 

closely with management, we will ensure that the Group’s 

material ESG factors are monitored and managed 

appropriately. For the benefit of our stakeholders, we 

will also continue to inculcate good reporting habits to 

enhance our sustainability reporting.

Sustainability is a continuous journey. We look forward 

to continuing our efforts to build a sustainable business 

model that creates long-term value for the Group, while 

generating positive economic, environmental and social 

returns for the communities in our areas of operations.

In 2019, the Group participated in the Nanyang 

Technological University-WSH Institute (“NTU-WSHI”) 

Research Collaboration Project to identify key success 

factors in the inculcation of WSH ownership amongst its

ownership, drive mindset changes and improve WSH 

practices.

Commitment to Safety

In its pursuit of high WSH standards, the Group also 

monitors and evaluates “near-misses” in addition to the 

mandatory reportable incidents. Lessons learnt are shared 

with all employees to increase awareness and prevent 

reoccurrences.

5. TRAINING AND EDUCATION

Far East Orchard’s commitment to the development of its 

employees is underscored by its belief that building the 

capabilities of its employees allows it to retain its competitive 

edge and enhance its brand profile.

Far East Orchard has cultivated a learning culture where 

employees feel valued, motivated and confident. In turn, 

this enhances overall performance and productivity, while 

reducing employee turnover. This reduction in employee 

turnover further contributes to operational efficiency 

The Group’s designated L&amp;PD team monitors and evaluates 

the development of its employees. This is done through the 

Learning Management System, which records the impact 

of training programmes on employees and reviews training 

investment in terms of time and cost on a monthly basis.

In line with SkillsFuture and Workforce Singapore, the Group’s core training 

modules and programmes centres around customer service and enhancement of 

employees’ technical skills

All employees are trained in leadership skills beginning with self-leadership at the 

rank and file level. This allows the Group to drive and sustain success with an aligned 

approach towards financial performance and an “Acts of Grace” work culture for 

both employees and customers

Launched in 2018 and further enhanced in 2019, the Group’s Managers Development 

Programme focuses on the development of its future leaders by equipping them with

The Annual Performance Review conducted at the end of 

the year, serves to review the employees’ achievements 

and overall contributions to the Group for the year. It also

6. CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

As a property developer, hospitality assets owner and 

operator with a diversified property investment portfolio, Far 

East Orchard is committed to providing its customers with a 

safe and healthy environment.

The Group has identified potential risks, established 

mitigating safety measures, and set up Standard Operating 

Procedures (“SOPs”) which are regularly updated to ensure 

that its employees are well-equipped and prepared to 

respond appropriately and promptly in various situations.

Hospitality

Comprehensive measures undertaken to ensure the health 

and safety of hotel guests on-site include:

• Conducting operations and internal compliance audits 

with remedial actions taken immediately, if gaps are 

identified

• Conducting regular and detailed maintenance checks on 

equipment and facilities, including occasional inspections 

from local authorities

• Identifying and mitigating hazards that customers may 

encounter at an early stage e.g. devising a pool rescue plan

• Equipping buildings with closed-circuit televisions

Property Development

Upholding its commitment to ensure the health and safety 

of occupants in properties developed by the Group, Far East 

Orchard chooses to work with contractors and suppliers 

that have health and safety-related accreditations in the 

various operating jurisdictions. 

The Group only works with companies that voluntarily 

register with the Considerate Constructors Scheme and 

agree to abide by the Code of Considerate Practice. These

is issued to all students. During the year, students are kept 

abreast of health and safety matters via email newsletters 

and notice boards in the properties.

A well-being strategy is also in place to monitor and engage 

students, aimed at helping them adjust to the student 

accommodation property and university life.

unify a safety culture across business divisions.
