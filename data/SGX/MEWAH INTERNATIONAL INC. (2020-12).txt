Sustainability Report 2020

Mewah International Inc.

From innovating

to offering

STAYING 

RESILIENT


Reporting Scope 

and Boundaries: 

1. Mewah International Inc (“Mewah” or the “Group”) has worked 

unswervingly to integrate corporate sustainability across every 

aspect of our business and to make a difference. This is our forth (4th) 

sustainability report since we first published our first sustainability 

report in year 2017. Through the sustainability report, we endeavour 

to provide our stakeholders with updates and insights of the Group 

sustainability performance. We want to reiterate the commitments 

we made in our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy, the understanding of 

our approach towards building a more sustainable business as well as 

the key sustainability measurements that we have put in place at our 

operating sites. 

2. We have sought to seek guidance from the Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI) Standard index for boundary settings, focusing on performance 

data and reporting on aspects which are most significant, as reflected 

in Mewah Sustainability Framework and the Group Sustainable Palm Oil 

Policy. We also support and integrated the 17 United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) into the Group’s business strategies.

3. In this Sustainability Report 2020, we stay focus in the five (5) focus 

areas and twenty (20) core areas as defined in Mewah Sustainability 

Framework. We seek to strengthen this framework by continue 

promoting sustainability and putting sustainability at the heart of our 

business and leadership. In order to define the contents of this report, 

we have worked with all the relevant stakeholders in our supply chain 

to identify key risk areas. Such data is collected and analysed to further 

discern, and design improvement plans qualitatively and annually. We 

believe that sustainability development can only achieved through 

working together to create a better shared future for our people, our 

communities, and our planet. 

4. The focal points of this report are our upstream and downstream palm 

oil processing and manufacturing plants in Indonesia, Malaysia, and 

Singapore. It covers performance data for the calendar year 2020 and 

historical numbers are shared to facilitate performance analysis as well 

as the measurement of key performance indicator &amp; milestones that we 

set for 2020. In relation to the Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and Crude Palm 

Kernel Oil (CPKO) supply chain, the reporting will be based on policy 

implementation, traceability milestones and progress in Traceability 

to Mill (TTM) &amp; Traceability to Plantation (TTP). The performance data 

will also focus on identifying material ESG (Environmental, Social, and 

Governance) factors in all our manufacturing sites. We believe that we 

must continue to improve our ESG performance in tandem with our 

business growth and that is the cornerstone of the Group’s long-term 

success. 

5. There has been no restatement of information in the scope of our 

reporting from the previous report. We commit to progressively extend 

the scope of our reporting to cover other business segments more 

comprehensively in forthcoming reports as we increase our reporting 

capacity and understanding of our new businesses.

Board of Directors’ 

Statement for 2020

We are pleased to introduce the 

2020 Mewah Group Sustainability 

Report. This is the fourth (4th) 

annual sustainability report since 

we first published the Group’s 

Sustainability performance in 2017. 

The purpose of this report is to 

provide a comprehensive, thorough, 

and transparent overview of our 

on-going Sustainability efforts in 

our 

business, 

measured 

against 

objectives and targets we have set 

based on the identified material 

Environmental, Social &amp; Governance 

(ESG) factors where we have direct 

impact on environments, societies, 

and economies. 

The 

framework 

of 

Mewah’s 

sustainability reporting is consistent 

with Singapore Exchange’s (SGX) 

Guidelines and Rule on Sustainability 

Reporting. These guidelines are in line 

with increasing investor demand for 

sustainable returns. We are cognizant 

of our responsibility to use our global 

scale and influence for betterment 

of this ecosystem. We strive to use 

leadership towards achieving positive 

change in every part of the world we 

operate in, towards delivering on our 

commitment to make sustainable 

palm oil a commonplace and towards 

building a more sustainable future 

for our communities and our planets. 

The theme of this Sustainability 

Report is “Staying Resilient”. We are 

at a key moment in the evolution of 

sustainability in global businesses. 

The COVID-19 pandemic is a wake-

up call for all businesses having 

revealed that markets and supply 

chains are fragile and susceptible to 

disruptions. The COVID-19 induced 

crisis are creating new and unfamiliar 

stressors such as challenges for the 

students in underdeveloped region 

to access education, unprecedented 

mental health consequences due 

to lockdowns, and increased risks 

to 

maintaining 

healthy 

natural 

ecosystems that are essential to 

human health. The Board is conscious 

towards the importance of ESG 

initiatives, particularly in a post-

pandemic era and acknowledge that 

any shortfall in the adoption of ESG 

practices by businesses can create 

significant 

impediments 

towards 

larger objective of achieving United 

Nations Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs) by 2030. For Mewah’s 

leaders and managers, the true 

symbol of resilience is the ability 

to withstand such stresses and 

to bounce back from adversity. 

Given the close link between the 

environment and human health, 

livelihoods, 

water 

and 

food 

security, the Board is determined 

to endure key sustainability efforts 

in 

environmental 

protection, 

conservation as well as sustainable 

management in all our levels of 

our operations. Our post Covid-19 

recovery plans include alignment 

with long-term emission reduction 

goals factoring in resilience to 

climate change and catalysing the 

shift towards sustainable sourcing. 

Environmental 

Protection 

&amp; 

Stewardship has been the top 

priority under Mewah’s Sustainability 

Framework. We believe that a more 

resilient business also depends on 

successful adoption of sustainability 

practices. Articulating our ambitions 

for sustainable energy, we took a 

strategic step 2 years back to invest 

in cogeneration plants to support 

our major refineries. The investment 

in cogeneration technology at our 

refineries has significantly reduced 

our 

consumption 

of 

externally 

generated energy and as a result 

reduced 

Greenhouse 

Gas 

(GHG) 

emission footprint of our operations. 

Furthermore, it has presented the 

Group with a valuable opportunity 

to strengthen our commitment to 

energy conservation and effective 

climate change mitigation. 

This year we are pleased to observe 

zero fatal accidents and lower 

lost time injury rate (LTIR) in our 

operations. We recognize the need 

for more people-centred recovery 

plan that focuses on safety, health, 

and well-being. In accordance with 

our Health &amp; Safety policy, we aim to 

maintain and improve the health of 

our employees. The long-term goal is 

to create a safe and comfortable work 

environment in which each employee 

can reach their full potential. We 

want to make Mewah an attractive 

workplace for our employees by 

ensuring every employee is healthy 

and safe both physically and mentally. 

Looking ahead, the Board is fully 

committed to continue working 

closely 

with 

Management 

by 

doing more to increase economic, 

environmental, and social resilience 

for ensuring long-term sustainable 

success of Mewah. We continue 

to maintain our commitment to 

support and contribute towards the 

17 SDGs that are closely integrated 

to 

the 

identified 

material 

ESG 

factors defined under the Group 

Sustainability Framework. We have 

achieved success during a challenging 

2020 and we aim to continue staying 

resilient in 2021. We are fully 

committed to work together with 

the Management ably supported 

by the Group Sustainability Team in 

our journey towards continuously 

shaping a more sustainable business 

and enriching lives through positive 

influence 

on 

our 

people, 

our 

environment and our society that 

underpin 

Mewah’s 

sustainability 

strategy.

COVID-19, as a pandemic is impacting 

institutions around the world. Its 

scope and areas of influence e.g., 

economic dimensions also mean 

that it poses a major threat towards 

achieving 

the 

UN 

Sustainable 

Development 

Goals 

(SDGs). 

It 

has transformed the consumers’ 

attitudes and willingness to respond 

to environmental challenges and 

sustainability factor. Having said 

that, the pandemic has underlined 

the importance of critical ESG 

factors and more concerted efforts 

are 

needed 

to 

ensure 

further 

adoption of ESG initiatives at all 

levels. 

At Mewah, we strive to keep 

our 

business 

resilient 

without 

compromising 

the 

people 

and 

planet 

needs. 

We 

are 

taking 

cognizance of the importance of 

sustainable investments among our 

socially conscious investors, and we 

have continued to putting emphasis 

on the implementation of ESG 

initiatives that outline in Mewah’s 

Sustainability Framework. 

Materiality 

Assessment

Materiality assessments are formal exercises aimed at engaging stakeholders to find out how important specific 

environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are to them. The materiality assessment outcome allows us to 

identify key economic, social and environmental issues that will help us in our planning in designing our sustainability 

agenda and program. There are 7 steps in our materiality assessment process: 

The pandemic, as the most wide-

reaching public health crisis has 

enables 

us 

to 

reexamine 

our 

priorities in business strategies. We 

always keep continuous dialogue 

with our stakeholders and receive 

feedbacks from our stakeholders 

with regards to our business strategy 

as well as to review the materiality 

assessment matrix annually. During 

the review, we take into account the 

four (4) Principles of Reporting of the 

GRI standard, namely stakeholder 

inclusiveness, sustainability context, 

materiality and completeness. 

In 

2020, 

we 

made 

several 

adjustments 

to 

the 

materiality 

assessment matrix. We put the 17 UN 

SDGs at the center of our materiality 

assessment, pinpointed goals that 

are relevant to our business conduct 

and are analyzing our impacts in 

achieving these goals. 

The matrix below illustrates the 

specific topics that we and our 

stakeholders 

deem 

important. 

Issues plotted towards the top right 

corner are the most material issues, 

while the ones in the bottom left 

section are seen as less important 

in relative terms. We have identified 

SDG 

9 

(“Industry, 

Innovation 

and Infrastructure”) and SDG 12 

(“Responsible 

Consumption 

and 

Production”) as the top priorities to 

our business. The SDG 9 and SDG 12 

are concerning quality and safety 

of our products. We also identified 

SDG 8 (“Decent Work and Economic 

Growth”) as one top priorities for our 

internal and external stakeholders. 

As a global agri-business in edible 

oils &amp; fats, SDG 3 (“Good health and 

Well-being”) has become the central 

to our business resiliency and we 

are adopting to a Sustainable Palm 

Oil Policy that act as the backbone 

in our raw material sourcing. Our 

stakeholders have assigned greater 

importance to SDG 1 (“Eradicating 

Poverty”) and SDG 2 (“Improving 

food security and end hunger”) which 

we believe deserves more emphasis, 

given the current circumstances 

where the pandemic has led to loss 

of income and leading vulnerable 

segments of society and families to 

fall below poverty line.

At Mewah, sustainability is part of 

everything we do and building a

anecdotal evidence suggests that 

Companies that are ESG compliant 

tend to behave in a more responsible 

manner, 

protect 

stakeholders’ 

interest in terms of governance 

structure and care for environment 

as well as community that a company 

serves.

Mewah is committed to building 

sustainable and long-term business 

growth, while leading and shaping 

positive change for our marketplace 

and customers, our employees, the 

communities we operate in and 

the environment. We believe that

Mewah’s COVID-19 

Response: 

The COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 is 

an unprecedented event that will 

in some way touch everybody on 

the planet. It has brought a wave of 

grief, uncertainty, and fear to the 

world. This was heightened with 

the imposition of a lockdown in 

dozens of countries across the world 

while keeping social distancing and 

leading isolated lives is an additional 

risk factor for the mental stress 

that many of us are going through, 

particularly for the younger and 

older generation.

At Mewah, we are people first. 

Wherever and whenever we can, we 

are actively supporting those who 

continue to have their lives changed 

or impacted by COVID-19. As an agri-

business and being recognized as an 

essential service in the countries that 

we operate, we have an important 

role to play in this crisis. Our highest 

priorities are the safety of our 

employees, customers, partners and 

products health and safety. Since 

the start of the pandemic outbreak, 

we 

have 

implemented 

best 

practice precautionary and hygiene 

measures at all our operating sites. 

At the same time, we rolled out 

a 

stricter 

sanitation 

protocols, 

social distancing, travel restrictions 

and making the arrangement of 

remote meetings and work-from-

home (WFH) arrangement for our 

employee. 

With these precautionary measures 

and 

necessary 

government 

approvals in place, our production 

continues as normal. Our employee 

on-site continues to work closely 

with our customers to ensure 

fulfilment of our sales obligation 

and continue to support our local 

communities in such demanding 

circumstances. 

COVID-19 Management 

and Enforcement 

Since the start of the pandemic, our 

Business Continuity Committee (BCC) 

has been continuously assessing and 

appropriately responding to the crisis 

as it develops. Safe management 

briefings among employees and 

local 

communities 

have 

been 

conducted regularly to support the 

government’s direction to control 

this spread of disease. 

Free face masks and sanitizers are 

made accessible at all manufacturing 

sites. At the same time, regular 

cleaning 

and 

disinfection, 

temperature 

checks, 

and 

social 

distancing procedures are adopted 

across all business operation. We have 

reinforced hygiene and exposure 

guidelines with our employees. If 

we become aware that an employee 

is ill or had direct or indirect contact 

with someone with COVID-19, we will 

immediately implement our isolation 

and sanitization protocols and will 

begin any necessary quarantines, in 

line with guidance from local health 

officials.

Prevention Procedures 

at Workplaces

Cognizant of the unprecedented 

circumstances and the challenges 

presented, we decided that the 

welfare of our workers was of 

paramount importance and that we 

would take all necessary measures 

to find equitable solutions for our 

people. To keep our workforce safe, 

half of our employees are taking 

turn to work remotely to minimize 

workplace exposure. The use of 

various 

digital 

communication 

channels, 

including 

emails, 

conference calls, automation, and 

process improvements have helped 

us to overcome the demanding 

situations. To ensure a safe and 

smooth transition to the workplace, 

we introduced team split, staggered 

working, and break hours plan. 

Our employees are permitted to 

return to office in accordance with 

the designated workweek. It has 

been proven that our employees’ 

productivity is remarkably resilient 

despite the reduction of on-site 

headcounts.

The welfare of our employees is our 

top priority. We will always respect 

our people’s rights and ensure that 

everybody is able to work safety 

on-site and return home safely, 

regardless of the circumstances. We 

have increased the significance of 

sanitation in the workplace. Hand 

sanitizers are available throughout 

the workplace, cleaners were asked 

to perform routine disinfection at 

high contact points frequently, and 

hand-washing posters with catchy 

messages were placed at all common 

areas to promote better health and 

hygiene at work. Safe distancing 

is also heavily emphasized, the 

mandatory 1-meter social distance is 

marked with tape and notice paper 

at various locations such as meeting 

room, lift, and pantry. The BCC is 

assigned to take accountability to 

conduct inspections and checks to 

ensure compliance, remedy non-

compliance, and keep records of 

inspections and checks.

“The first fear that we have is whether the business can sustain and whether we can keep our workforce. 

Our employees fear the same. While we need our production team to continue attending to work on-site, 

we are also concerned about their health &amp; well-being. It is very contradicting and confusing particularly for 

human resource (HR) department as we are responsible to keep the employees stay engaged, productive, 

and resilient. 

Communication is important. Action team was set up and a few small teams established to support every 

section. All communications, whether big or small is mentioned in the action team so that the same will be 

circulated to the small teams. We mention mental health from time to time so that the respective manager 

can look for symptoms and offer help when needed. 

We make it simple for all employees by introducing QR code feedback form to collect feedback and 

suggestions for our employees. At the same time, various policies are introduced, some are extensions from 

the government requirements such as social distancing, movement restriction and group screening. We have 

also integrated COVID-19 protocols into our working culture by providing free masks and sanitisers to all 

employees and making it mandatory for employee’s health self-declaration before entering workplace. Every 

reported symptom is handled with care so that we take prompt precaution measure to contain potential 

virus spread. 

In line with recommendations to reduce large gatherings and increase social distancing, we have asked most 

of office-based employees to work remotely. We are promoting virtual meeting and training to limit face-to-

face interaction. It turns out that the average training hours per person increased by 20% in 2020 as compared 

to the previous year, as virtual training are easy to access and capable to reach more. 

Today, we have been fighting this threat for slightly over a year, and not a single soul was being retrenched. 

We believe that our people are the core value of our organization. We will not be able to manage better 

without the support from everyone. We will continue to increase the support to our people who have work 

tirelessly and around the clock to keep our business running smoothly in this demanding circumstances.’’

Mewah’s Covid-19 

Response: 

Food Security and Availability 

The concern about food security due 

to COVID-19 pandemic is escalating. 

World Food Programmes (WFP) 

estimates that COVID-19 pandemic 

has 

dramatically 

increased 

the 

number of people facing acute 

food insecurity in 2020. Due to 

the remoteness of plantation and 

palm oil mill operation in Indonesia, 

we recognize our role in ensuring 

the employees and communities 

have ready access to stable food 

and nutrition supply even during 

travel restrictions. Our strategies 

to support the community include 

provision of basic dietary needs, 

adequate 

medical 

supplies, 

educational awareness campaigns, 

and support in food crop cultivation. 

Aside from oil palm cultivation, the 

local communities depend other 

food crops and freshwater fish 

farming to support their livelihoods. 

In commemoration of 2020’s World 

Environment Day, PT ADS released 

2,000 Patin fish seeds into the 

Tempino River and planted Penang 

trees on the edge of the reservoir. 

The release of fish seeds into 













the Tempino River is an effort to 

preserve and revive the ecosystem 

of the Tempino River as many of the 

locals in Desa Tanjung Pauh village 

are dependent on fish farming 

as a source of food and source of 

income. As results, it enhances the 

locals’ fish farming production and 

establish a stronger food resilience 

amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2020, Sabah had the 

third-highest number of confirmed 

cases nationwide while Tawau was 

declared as one of the COVID-19 

“red zone” cities in Malaysia. 

Our subsidiary company, Mewah 

Datu Sdn Bhd, at Lahad Datu, 

donated 2 units of Life-Support 

Ventilators that worth more than 

RM100,000 

to 

Tawau 

General 

Hospital in response to the acute 

shortage of medical supplies faced 

by the hospital. The ventilator is a 

lifesaving breathing machine for the 

critically ill patients of COVID-19. 

Embraced the Use of Face Mask

Face masks block the spread of 

respiratory 

droplets 

that 

can 

carry the novel coronavirus. It is a 

disease-control personal protective 

equipment (PPE) that has been 

proven that, when used properly, 

it 

can 

reduce 

transmission 

by 

somewhere between 50% and 85%. 

Since April 2020, our subsidiary 

company, PT Angso Duo Sawit 

made continuous contribution of 

face masks for the 280 villagers 

in Tanjung Pauh Village, Jambi 

Province, 

battling 

the 

ongoing 

pandemic outbreak in Indonesia. 

The masks were handed over to the 

Head of Village at its office and had 

been allocated to the communities.

greenhouse gas emissions. 

Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

During the pandemic, population living in rural areas face higher risk of exposure to 

COVID-19 that mainly due to poor sanitation conditions. We recognize the important 

role that we are playing, and we have invested in building public infrastructure to 

ensure communities in our surrounding are inclusive, safe, and resilient. 

Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

Urgent actions are needed to combat climate change and its impacts. We have a strict 

monitoring against every aspect of our operations, which include GHG emission, 

efficient use of water, waste generation, fire and peat management as to minimise 

environmental impacts that are detrimental to the planet and people health.









At 

Mewah, 

Environmental 

Management has been a key focus for 

us for many decades as we strive to 

optimise productivity and long-term 

sustainability in our business. We 

focus our efforts on key areas where 

our portfolio and business scale 

allow us to have the biggest impact 

that offer the biggest opportunities 

for our business. Over the years, we 

have initiated several sustainability 

initiatives aimed at minimizing our 

manufacturing footprint. At our 

upstream operations, we are also 

implementing a number of programs 

aimed 

at 

forest 

conservation, 

protecting 

biodiversity 

and 

minimising adverse impact on the 

environment. 

Our efforts in this area help 

contribute to UN SDG 6, 7, 11 and 13 

which aim to promote sustainable 

use of energy and combat climate 

change &amp; its impacts. We drive 

collaboration throughout our supply 

chain to reduce our climate impact 

associated with our raw materials 

processing 

until 

delivering 

our 

products to the hands of our buyers. 

This focus area covers our impact on 

various environmental footprints in 

terms of: 

1) Carbon Management 

2) Water management

3) Waste management 

4) Biodiversity Management 

5) Fire management

6) Pest management 

 

The processing of edible oils is 

complex 

and 

energy 

intensive. 

Mewah’s processing plants differ 

in capacity, capability, and range of 

products. This brings about different 

environmental footprint in different 

facilities. Therefore, each plant has 

different greenhouse gas (GHG), 

water and waste emissions. 

17

Sustainability Report 2020


Focus Area 1: Environmental Protection and Stewardship

Core Area 1:  

Carbon Management 

Carbon footprint is defined as the 

total amount of greenhouse gases 

(GHG) that is produced directly and 

indirectly with our manufacturing 

activities. The standard unit of 

measurement for carbon footprint 

is 

carbon 

dioxide 

equivalents 

(CO2e). GHG Emissions is an all-

encompassing 

measurement 

for 

the carbon footprint and energy 

efficiency in our production. 

At Mewah, we are mindful that 

increasing 

carbon 

footprint 

has 

profound 

effects 

on 

the 

environment. We are committed to 

progressively reduce greenhouse 

gas (GHG) emissions by identifying 

significant pollutants and emissions 

and implementing plans to mitigate 

or minimise them. 

The primary contributing factors 

of GHG emissions in our production 

sites are: 

i. Electricity consumption, 

ii. Chemical consumption, 

iii. Fuel consumption. 

Our 

GHG 

emissions 

from 

our 

production activity are calculated 

using the ISCC methodology and 

RSPO PALM GHG Calculator. It 

includes data from all processing 

facilities under Mewah Group, i.e. 

refineries, biodiesel plant, consumer 

pack plants, palm oil mills and 

plantation. 

These 

numbers 

are 

compiled monthly, evaluated and 

projects are in place to further 

improve these consumption figures.

1.1.1 GHG EMISSIONS IN OUR 

PRODUCTION SITES

Our 

greenhouse 

gas 

emissions 

(GHG) index depicts the results 

of quantity of GHGs emitted per 

metric-ton of product processed 

or packed in our manufacturing 

premises. 

The 

measurement 

is 

in kilograms of carbon dioxide-

equivalent per metric ton of product 

(kg CO2e/MT). In 2020, the GHG 

emission intensity achieved in our 

downstream operation is 38.63 

kgCO2/MT production. On the other 

hand, the electricity consumption 

has reduced by 34%, down from 

11.37 kWh/MT production to 7.54 

kWh/MT production. 

In our palm oil mill operation, the 

average 

annual 

GHG 

emission 

intensity is measured at 614.02 

kgCO2/MT CPO produced.

In 

plantation 

operation, 

the 

most significant GHG emissions 

sources are land-use change and 

peat subsidence. The overall net 

GHG emissions at our plantation 

is measured at 65,446.95MT CO2 

equivalent in 2020.

As we keep expanding our business 

and investments, we are mindful 

that minimizing GHG emissions in 

our operations is the top priority 

within our sustainability framework. 

As such, in managing our day-to-day 

business, we remain committed to 

low carbon operations and evident 

from our target for GHG emissions. 

We seek to reduce our GHG 

emissions by being more efficient 

in our production abilities as well 

as seeking more environmentally 

friendly sources of energy.

1.1.2 ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN 

OUR PRODUCTION SITES

Articulating our ambitions for a 

sustainable future, energy efficiency 

has been one of the top priorities 

of Mewah Group in the way we 

develop and manage our business. 

For the past two decades, we have 

continuously innovated, invested 

in green technology and improved 

our operating efficiencies. Since 

2018, driven by our commitment to 

play integral part in mitigating the 

effects of climate change, one of our 

refineries introduced high efficiency 

air-cooled compressor and high 

efficiency natural circulation high 

pressure boiler to our palm oil 

refinery plant. These projects are 

part of our low carbon strategies 

with the aim to achieve higher 

energy and resource efficiency.

The Group made a bold move in 

2019 to invest in cogeneration 

plant replacing packaged boiler in 

our major refineries. Cogeneration 

technology is an energy-efficient 

solution for facilities that require 

both thermal energy and electricity. 

The operational efficiencies realized 

by cogeneration plants provide 

great benefits to both industries and 

consumers. It uses less fuel and emits 

lower amounts of pollution when 

producing electrical and thermal 

energy than stand-alone electrical 

and thermal energy facilities. The 

new cogeneration plant investment 

is an example of our action in using 

energy more efficiently.

1.1.3 AIR EMISSION 

MANAGEMENT

The first palm oil refinery under the 

Group was established in 1980s. 

it situated near to Kampung Hulu 

Rinching, Semenyih. Over the years, 

Ngo Chew Hong Oils &amp; Fats (M) Sdn. 

Bhd. (NCHM) has contributed to the 

economic growth by providing job 

opportunities and bringing spin-off 

advantages to more than 92,000 

populations in Semenyih. 

In 1990s to 2000s, the town of 

Semenyih 

has 

developed 

from 

heavy industrial area to a mix of 

residential and light industrial area. 

NCHM is within the close vicinity 

of 

residential 

area, 

Kampung 

Hulu Rinching. As such, we are 

determined to play our role to 

minimize 

environmental 

impacts 

from our operation to safeguard 

our neighbours’ health. One of the 

key efforts in air management is by 

carrying out regular odour emission 

assessment. 

During refining process, volatile 

smell composites might be released 

to the air. The volatile matter is 

commonly identified as Palm Fatty 

Matter Vapour, a non-hazardous 

substance contained in palm oil. 

The 

odour 

intensity 

level 

in 

surrounding areas of NCHM is 

assessed by an independent air 

quality and odour management 

specialist. To minimize odour from 

the generation of Palm Fatty Matter 

Vapour, NCHM has installed an 

Alkaline Closed Loop (ACL) Vacuum 

system in its physical refining plant 

in 2019. The outcome from this 

investment is promising as we have 

observed a significant reduction of 

odour intensity level in surrounding 

factory areas. 

* D/T – Dilution to Threshold 

The results illustrated a significant reduction of the perceived odour 

intensity. Overall, the perceived odour concentrations reduced to 0 D/T with 

just one count of 4 D/T at NCHM’s Visitor Parking Area. The implementation 

of the ACL Vacuum has proven to effectively minimize odour emission to our 

neighbours.

Water Management

1.2.1 OUR FOCUS &amp;  

ACTION PLAN 

Water is a vital resource for our 

operations and the communities in 

our supply chain. We acknowledge 

the clean and assessable water 

is critical for the well-being of 

communities, wildlife, and aquatic 

ecosystem. We also recognize that 

water availability is becoming an 

increasingly 

important 

issue 

in 

the face of climate change and we 

are constantly looking at ways to 

improve our water management &amp; 

minimize our water footprint.

The water footprint maps and 

measures how, when and where we 

use freshwater resources. In Mewah, 

we have put in place integrated 

water footprint assessment as part 

of the group sustainability initiative 

and business strategy through: 

I. Setting 

quantitative 

water 

footprint reduction targets in all 

manufacturing sites 

II. Apply standard terminology &amp; 

calculation methods

III. Monthly assessment on quality &amp; 

quantity of wastewater discharge

Our action plan in reducing our 

water consumption includes: 

I. Consistently 

assessing 

water-

related impacts and risks across 

our supply chain. 

II. Identify uses of water in our 

factories and set targets to 

reduce freshwater use.

III. Continue 

to 

improve 

conservation 

efforts 

(water-

saving efforts) at our factories. 

We are implementing various water 

saving initiatives to improve our 

water footprint across our factories. 

The efforts made so far recorded 

consumption efficiency at 0.21m³/

product for all the manufacturing 

sites in year 2020. 

In 2017, we set a long-term goal and 

formulate strategy to improve water 

intensity from 0.19 m3/ MT product to 

0.15 m3/ MT product by year 2025. 

Protecting Our Water Source

Water is a vital resource for our 

operations and the communities 

in our supply chain. We strive to 

continue to improve our water 

efficiency by recycling and reusing 

where appropriate in the palm oil 

production process. The quality of 

water discharged from our refineries 

and palm oil mill are constantly 

monitored to make sure the discharge 

quality in within compliance of 

national environmental limit.

Palm Oil Mill Operations 

The palm oil milling operation 

accounts for most of the water 

consumption in palm oil processing 

life cycle. A palm oil mill usually draws 

water supplies from local waterways 

and wells for FFB processing and 

household use. 

In 2020, the water consumption 

intensity at our palm oil mill is 

reported at 1.29 m³ per MT FFB 

processed. The water intensity is 

significantly lower than what was 

reported in 2019 at 1.75 m³ per MT 

FFB. This is owing to multiple water 

conservation initiatives introduced at 

the palm oil mill.

The 

wastewater, 

palm 

oil 

mill 

effluent (POME) is released into 

local 

waterways 

after 

treated. 

The discharged water quality is 

strictly in compliance with the local 

environmental limits that has been 

regulated with purpose to minimise 

the risk of disturbance to the aquatic 

environment as well as the pollution 

of ground water. The annual average 

BOD and COD level in our palm oil mill 

operation are reported at 48ppm and 

144ppm respectively, that follows all 

relevant local thresholds in 2020. 

We 

are 

consistently 

exploring 

options to improve carbon footprint 

and water footprint in our palm oil 

mill operations. One of the key plans 

is to install a methane gas capturing 

plant in the palm oil mill to reduce 

GHG emission from our operation.

Provision of Safe and Clean Water

Availability and access to clean water, 

sanitation, 

and 

hygiene 

(WASH) 

services is fundamental to fighting 

the virus and promoting the health 

and well-being of our employees and 

our neighbouring communities. Our 

mill subsidiary, PT Angso Duo Sawit 

(PT ADS) adopts comprehensive 

measures to ensure the availability 

of 

clean 

groundwater 

for 

the 

surrounding communities of Tri Sakti 

sub-village of Tanjung Pauh village 

KM 30. We make efforts in providing 

infrastructure 

development 

and 

amenities such as bore well and 

providing clean drinking water for 

our employees and locals. We work 

to ensure everyone within and 

surrounding our business operation 

has access to clean water and practice 

water best management practices to 

reduce wastage. 

Freshwater Quality Sampling at 

Plantation Operations

We are committed to protect natural 

waterways through buffer zones.

Through 

the 

Monitoring 

and 

Measurement Program (MMP), our 

subsidiary, PT Jambi Batanghari 

Plantations carried out freshwater 

biota survey (e.g., Plankton Survey 

and Benthos Survey) at upstream, 

center, and downstream of Sungai 

Batanghari, 

Sungai 

Jebus, 

and 

Sungai Paluh. The purpose of this 

program is to assess whether there 

is an indication of pollution in these 

rivers. We did it by measuring the 

plankton and benthos communities 

in the water bodies. These tiny 

organisms usually are commonly 

used as indicators of the biological 

condition of waterbodies. They are 

reliable indicators of water quality 

because they spend all or most of 

their lives in water, and they are easy 

to collect and differ in their tolerance 

to pollution.

Waste Management 

Sustainable 

waste 

management 

planning is a massive task that 

involves 

scientific 

knowledge, 

logistical 

planning, 

and 

understanding in order to balance 

the impact on our environment 

and the cost effectiveness of the 

process. 

In recent years, waste problem in 

ASEAN particularly plastic waste 

gained global attention. Annually 

hundreds of millions tonne of 

indecomposable 

plastic 

waste 

ended up in landfill, worldwide. 

Environmental pollution, as well 

as health effects arisen drastically 

followed 

by 

the 

uptrend 

of 

irresponsible disposal of waste. 

We are taking waste management 

seriously in our estate.

At Mewah Group, we are adopting a 

comprehensive waste management 

blueprint that outline action plan 

to understand our waste streams, 

to measure/baseline current waste 

generation and to complete a 

facility-wide 

waste 

operations 

assessment. The objective of our 

water management 

plan 

is 

to 

assure a sustainable waste material 

management in our production 

sites by putting in place effective 

measures. 

1) Our waste is divided into 4 main categories:

Category

Type of Waste

A

General Waste

B

Scrap Waste

C

Production Waste

D

Schedule Waste

2) The amount of waste generated by each category is monitored and 

attention is brought to the amount generated. 

3) Identify the 5 Rs’ components in managing waste: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, 

Recover and Recycle. 

i. Refuse: Refuse to receive unnecessary materials will help to eliminate 

waste from the very beginning. It is simply about saying no and looking 

into reusable alternatives.

ii. Reduce: Focus to improve efficiency. To establish practices that are 

capable to reduce the amount of waste we generate to help the 

environment.

iii. Reuse: Practice to reuse materials without change whether for the 

original or a different application instead of throwing them away or 

pass those unused materials on to others who could use them.

iv. Recover: To set up ways to recover the energy values contained within 

the waste material.

v. Recycle: Many of the things we use every day can be recycled. 

Recycled items are put through a process that makes it possible to 

create new products out of the materials from the old ones.

1.3.1 REFUSING PLASTIC 

WASTE

In Malaysia, a “Roadmap towards 

Zero-Single Use Plastics 2018 -2030” 

was launched by Ministry of Energy, 

Science, Technology, Environment 

and Climate Change. The roadmap 

spells out Malaysian government’s 

plans to phase off single-use plastics 

in the nation by 2030.

Since 

2019, 

Mewah 

introduced 

“plastic-free campaign” in all our 

operating sites with the purpose 

to bar the use of plastic bags and 

polystyrene food ware. A practical 

guide was set up and awareness 

campaign was built to educate 

our employees on the presence of 

plastic and its harmful effects on the 

environment.

1.3.2 REDUCING GENERAL 

WASTE

The concept of waste minimization 

is 

fundamental 

in 

our 

waste 

management. We encourage our 

employees to use recyclable and 

bio-degradable bags and containers, 

e.g., reusable cloth bag.

Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (3R 

Programme) of domestic waste is 

currently implement in PT JBP. Waste 

segregation, 

trainings, 

signage, 

collection points and workshops 

are incorporate into our operations. 

Recyclable domestic waste collected 

such as plastic and cardboard will 

then undergo careful segregation 

and measure before sending to 

authorised waste collector. 

Reusable cloth bag is one of the 

initiatives introduced in our estate, 

to reduce single-use-plastics and 

disposal of these materials. At 

time, a total of 38kg of plastic, 39kg 

of cardboard and 12kg of other 

recyclables are saved from landfill. 

1.3.3 REUSING SCRAP WASTE

We have a program in place to 

first reuse all possible scrap waste 

produced, including mild steel, tin, 

zinc, etc., before being sold for 

recycling. This cost-effective practice 

ensures that these natural resources 

are 

fully 

utilized 

before 

being 

disposed.

1.3.4 RECYCLING 

PRODUCTION WASTE

At refineries, Spent Bleaching Earth1 

(SBE) is the major source of waste 

generated 

from 

production. 

It 

contains 20-25% of residual oil. Due 

to the high oil content in the Spent 

Bleaching Earth, its disposal can be 

considered an environmental hazard, 

as it is highly flammable. 100% of 

SBE generated from our refineries 

are recycled either as raw material 

for another manufacturer or used as 

biomass. 

At our palm oil mill operations, the 

common waste generated from FFB 

milling process are solid biomass 

waste and liquid waste. Solid waste 

comprises 

empty 

fruit 

bunches 

(EFB) of oil palm, fibre, and shells. 

Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) is the 

liquid waste generated from mill. 

Both solid and liquid waste is either 

being recycled or reused as organic 

fertilizer or fuel. We aim to achieve 

zero waste by 2023 – that is to have 

100 percent of solid and liquid waste 

from FFB milling process reused and 

recycled. 

1.3.5 RECOVERING 

SCHEDULE WASTE 

Spent nickel, hydraulic oil, lubricant 

oil, and waste solvent are some of 

the examples of waste which are 

generated 

from 

our 

production 

activities. These by-products are 

highly regulated and they have to 

be disposed of at recovery sites 

as designated by the Department 

of Environment (DOE). We have 

complied 

with 

these 

schedule 

wastes, which are recovered and 

treated by licensed contractors. The 

recovery of such schedule wastes 

involves the removals of harmful or/

and contaminated substances, in 

certain instances, the recovery of 

valuable resources.

Biodiversity Management 

Biodiversity is the foundation of the 

ecosystem services that humans 

rely on.

Across the world, biodiversity has 

been significantly altered by human 

pressure, including land- and sea-

use change, direct exploitation of 

organisms, climate change, and 

pollution. 

According 

to 

World 

Economic Forum’s 2020 Global Risk 

Report, “biodiversity loss” has been 

rated as the second most impactful 

and third most likely risk for the 

next decade. The current rate of 

extinction is tens to hundreds of 

times higher than any other time in 

human history. Biodiversity loss has 

serious implications for humanity, 

from the collapse of food and health 

systems to the disruption of entire 

food supply chains. 

Biodiversity conservation and forest 

protection have been a major focus 

of our environmental efforts in 

our estate. Under our High Carbon 

Stock (HCS) and High Conservation 

Value 

(HCV) 

commitments, 

we 

focus on maintaining and restoring 

riparian buffer zones throughout 

all our operations in recognition of 

its importance in our ecosystem. 

We have identified and conserved 

lands made up of HCV and HCS 

areas. We have taken a landscape 

approach to conservation (beyond 

the boundaries of our concession) 

through community conservation 

partnership with external partner. 

Riparian Buffer at our Plantation

HCV 

assessment 

have 

been 

performed to identify the key 

conservation areas. Subsequently, 

a monitoring plan is developed in 

accordance with the outcome of 

HCV assessment. 

A total of 35.82ha of riparian is set 

aside in our estate as buffer zone, 

where development is prohibited. 

Demarcation 

and 

signage 

are 

set along the designated areas, 

together with awareness training for 

our workforce. Natural vegetation is 

maintained alongside both riverbank 

and serve as erosion control and 

natural filter form surface runoff or 

sedimentation. Wildlife is known to 

utilise riparian buffer zone as prime 

habitats and encourage healthy river 

ecosystem. 

High Conservation Areas

A total of 79.63 ha of HCS areas is set 

aside in our estate. These HCS areas 

are made up of riparian areas along 

the major rivers and pocket jungles 

and these areas are forbidden from 

further development and hunting. 

The pocket jungles can regenerate 

and 

gradually 

encourage 

the 

utilisation of its natural inhabitants. 

Signage are being placed in the 

surrounding areas and awareness 

trainings are conducted to our 

employees and local community to 

further imprint the importance and 

management of this area. 

Water Table Monitoring on Peatland

Peatlands 

are 

important 

natural carbon storage and play 

significant roles in the ecosystem. 

To ensure efficient land use on 

existing plantation on peatland 

and 

safeguard 

the 

long-term 

productivity of land, we adopt Best 

Management Practices (BMPs) in 

the oil palm cultivation. Peatland 

planting without proper water table 

monitoring would increase drying of 

organic matters and hence escalate 

the fire potential. Water table in 

our estate is currently managed 

in accordance to local regulations, 

at 40-60cm below soil surface to 

prevent rapid decomposition rate 

of peat. Peat subsidence is also 

constantly monitor in blocks that are 

planting on peat.

Zero Burning

Transboundary haze in the past 

affected number of Southeast Asia 

countries, caused poor visibility, 

schools closure, business stunted 

and health complications. We are 

committed to ensure peat fire and 

its environmental impacts are being 

taking seriously in our estate.

At PT JBP, we have put in place an 

effective fire prevention plans and 

control measures at our operations 

and the surrounding landscapes. We 

commit to conduct replanting using 

environment 

conscious 

method 

and adhering to the ASEAN’s Zero 

Burning Policy at the same time. 

The traditional method of slash-

and-burn is strictly prohibited and 

is replaced with chipping, which 

promotes nutrient recycling. 

We actively socialize the importance 

of zero burning practices with 

adjacent local communities while 

ensuring safeguards are in place 

to address risk of fires at our oil 

palm 

plantation. 

Through 

our 

empowerment 

programme 

and 

trainings, our staffs form a team 

of in-house fire fighters (with 15 

personnel per 1,000 ha of land) 

namely Team Elite Damkar. This 

will enable immediate and quick 

response in occurrence of fire.

Firefighting: Everybody’s 

Responsibility 

Multi-stakeholder Collaboration

Smouldering peat fire is a challenge 

to be put off, the combustion 

might spread unknowingly to the 

neighbouring 

peatland 

without 

realise. We recognize that it is a 

collective effort by all stakeholders 

in prevention of peat fire (Karhutla). 

PT 

JBP 

collaborates 

with 

our 

neighbouring communities - Kades 

Jebus, Sungai Aur and Gedong 

Jaya, to form a fire prevention 

team (Masyarakat Peduli Api). The 

purpose of collaboration between 

local authorities i.e., Polsek and 

Danramil is to instil education and 

training for the local community in 

fire emergency response.







Fire Prevention and Monitoring

Driven to ensure effective fire 

prevention measures, PT JBP is 

vigilant in implementing systems 

and intensifying efforts at fire prone 

areas. Fire hotspots and occurrences 

are being monitored in PT JBP. 

Physical 

precautionary 

measures 

include fire watch towers, portable 

fire pumps, water conservations, 

and fire patrols are introduced 

during dry season.

The hotspot forecast, weekly weather 

forecasts and warnings, are received 

to enable early detection of any fire 

risks and occurrence and suppression 

to avoid disastrous fire occurrence. 

In addition, fire alert system with 

technology, such as LIVE CCTV by 

Regional Police of the Republic of 

Indonesia (Polda) and satellite image 

from Indonesian National Institute 

of Aeronautics and Space (“LAPAN”), 

are helping us in fire management.

Towards Full Traceability 

The palm oil supply chain is complex 

and fragmented. The same applies 

to coconut oil supply chain. Every 

tier in the supply chain plays its 

essential role in forging a path to 

full traceability. Transparency in the 

supply chain is a critical aspect of 

sustainability since it increases the 

visibility of suppliers and it allows 

us to trace and identify the origin of 

our raw material. 

For every ton of palm oil and coconut 

oil received into our factory, we trace 

to the exact location of the palm oil 

mills/crushers and the particulars of 

raw materials suppliers to the palm 

oil mills/crushers that supplying to 

us. Traceability data is necessary as 

it allows us to evaluate our suppliers’ 

performance against our Sustainable 

Palm Oil Policy and Sustainable 

Coconut Oil Policy. At the same time, 

we are establishing engagement 

with our suppliers with the objectives 

to 

improve 

the 

sustainability 

standards in our supply chain. This 

is done through traceability data 

collection, suppliers’ assessment, 

and educational workshops.

2.2.2 MEWAH’S 

TRACEABILITY APPROACH 

Since we rolled out the Sustainable 

Palm Oil Policy in 2014, we have 

been focusing greatly on supplier 

engagement 

initiatives 

to 

raise 

sustainability 

awareness 

across 

our 

suppliers 

to 

make 

certain 

that everyone is improved. As an 

independent palm oil refiner, we are 

fully aware that a large part of our 

footprint contributed by activities 

beyond 

our 

own 

operations. 

Therefore, our suppliers are playing 

an important role in forging a path 

towards in sustainable palm oil 

production. 

How we do it?

Part A: Palm Oil Supply Chain

We actively trace raw materials 

supply flows from refineries back 

to palm oil sources to map our 

supply base, evaluate suppliers’ 

performance against our Sustainable 

Palm Oil Policy and to initiate 

engagement with our suppliers to 

make improvements whenever is 

needed. 

Today, we are proud to announce 

that 100% of our CPO and CPKO 

are Traceable to Mill (TTM). The 

definition of “traceable to mill” refer 

to the fulfilment on 5 key traceability 

criteria 

i.e., 

Parent 

Company 

Name of Mill Party, Mill Name, Mill 

Address, GPS coordinates of Mill 

Party and Volume of CPO received 

into our refinery. We are determined 

to make sure that all our suppliers 

must fulfil the same condition as the 

fundamental entry requirement into 

our supply chain. 

Part B: Coconut Oil Supply Chain

We actively trace raw materials 

supply flows from refineries back 

to coconut copra mills to map our 

coconut oil supply base. We are 

measuring suppliers’ performance 

against our Sustainable Coconut Oil 

Policy. The coconut oil sustainability 

is rather immature at this stage; 

hence, we are gearing up our 

resources to proactively engage with 

our suppliers to make improvements 

wherever is needed. 

Today, we are proud to announce 

that 100% of our crude coconut oil 

(CCNO) are Traceable to Copra Mill 

(TTM). The definition of “traceable 

to copra mill” refer to the fulfilment 

on 5 key traceability criteria i.e., 

Parent Company Name of Copra Mill 

Party, Copra Mill Name, Copra Mill 

Address, GPS coordinates of Copra 

Mill Party and Volume of CCNO 

received into our refinery. We are 

actively socializing the traceability 

requirement with our suppliers and 

to set the traceability requirement as 

the fundamental entry requirement 

into our supply chain. 

Evaluation 

of 

suppliers’ 

sustainability performance 

With the purpose to evaluate and 

validate 

sustainability 

progress 

of our suppliers, we kick-started 

supplier verification program as 

early as November 2014. Over the 

years, we completed assessment 

to more than 130 CPO suppliers 

across different states in Malaysia 

and the reports are published on 

Mewah Sustainability Dashboard. In 

Mewah’s Traceability to Plantation 

(TTP) approach, a comprehensive 

field assessment will be carried out 

at every supplier’s mills to assess 

its Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) supply 

base and to evaluate its compliance 

to 

Mewah’s 

Sustainable 

Palm 

Oil Policy using our pre-defined 

Supplier 

Assessment 

Guidelines. 

In general, a palm oil mill’s fresh 

fruit bunch (FFB) may be supplied 

by hundreds of estates, growers, 

smallholders 

and 

dealers. 

TTP 

assessment is an educational tool 

as well as a “bridge” for Mewah to 

support the transformation of our 

suppliers. The primary objective 

of our TTP initiative is to lift up the 

sustainability standards of all our 

suppliers to a higher level. So far, 

there is no common definition of 

TTP in the palm oil industry. Our 

current approach on traceability to 

plantations establish on ensuring the 

availability and validity of Malaysia 

Palm Oil Board (MPOB) operating 

license from FFB suppliers. The 

rationale behind our requirement is 

to make sure that all FFB supplied to 

the palm oil mills are sourced legally.

TRACEABILITY SCORE 

The launch of our Traceability to Mill 

(TTM) exercise in 2014 and Traceability to 

Plantation (TTP) exercise in 2016 enabled 

us to reach out to a greater number of 

suppliers including millers, estates’ owners, 

dealers, and smallholders. The traceability 

data collected from TTM and TTP exercise 

allowed us to map all the palm oil mills that 

supply CPO and CPKO to our four refineries 

and the estates, dealers and smallholders 

that supply FFB to the mills. 

In 2020, we maintain 100% TTM in our CPO 

and CPKO supply chain. Moving forward, 

we aim to continue working closely with all 

our esteemed suppliers for improvement 

in TTP score.

Stakeholder Engagement 

Focus Area 2: Responsible Supply Chain

“Supplier Empowerment for a Resilient Tomorrow

This is the fourth Mewah Group Sustainability Report. The palm oil industry has transformed more in the last 

5 years than it has in the past 20 years, particularly the expectations on supply chain sustainability. Today, 

most of the large palm oil companies and consumer groups have adopted a Sustainable Palm Oil Policy (or 

No Deforestation, No Peat, and No Exploitation policy). The palm oil consumer groups are demanding for the 

highest transparency in the supply chain and assurance on deforestation-free palm oil. The need for unity 

from all relevant stakeholders in the palm supply chain in overcoming environmental and social challenges 

has never been more urgent. 

As one of the largest independent refiners in Malaysia, we know that we have a critical role to play in 

safeguarding reputation of Malaysia’s palm oil regarding sustainability. One of the Mewah’s core values is 

the focus in stakeholder engagement and empowerment. We have put in place a robust system to make 

certain that all our suppliers are adequately engaged, and everyone is aware of the latest sustainability 

requirements. From the outset of our sustainability journey, we have consistently aimed to set the highest 

example in the industry and at the same time, increasing the ability and confidence of our suppliers to adopt 

good sustainable practices and access opportunities relating to sustainable development. Today, we are 

pleased to see that we have marked physical presence in more than 150 suppliers’ palm oil mills. On a side 

note, we are the first company who has publicised public summary reports of individual suppliers’ mills that 

captures key findings from our traceability to plantation (TTP) mill assessments. 

A strong collective commitment within the industry and along the palm oil supply chains is critical for 

achieving transformation and to sustain the true values of sustainability agenda. Our imperative for the 

future is to continue support and engage our suppliers and peers in collective action across the full spectrum 

of sustainability.’’

2.3.1 ASSESSMENT TO  

HIGH-RISK SUPPLIERS’ MILL 

On a yearly basis, we will identify 

several high-risk suppliers and carry 

out assessment base on guidelines 

define in Mewah’s High Importance 

Mill Engagement Program (HIMEP). 

The major audit areas during our 

assessment to the high-risk supplier’s 

mill are: 

A. Chemical 

stores 

– 

Storage, 

herbicide mixing areas, personal 

protective 

equipment 

(PPE), 

ventilation and security. 

B. Field

sites, 

fertilizing operations, first aiders 

and boxes, and field observation 

of all operations are following the 

SOP. 

C. Workshop 

– 

Safe 

working 

environment, 

environmental 

waste management. 

D. Worker interviews – Safety and 

Health, religious, wages/pay and 

contracts, forced and child labour, 

first aid. 

E. Line sites – Wastewater quality 

monitoring &amp; improvement plan, 

align with BOD requirement BOD&lt; 

100 ppm, inspection of water 

discharge points. 

F. Social impact audits – through 

contributions made, employment 

opportunities 

and 

grievance 

procedure. 

G. FFB Traceability Data – to verify and

Environmental Risk Analysis

We initiated environmental risk 

assessment 

to 

our 

suppliers 

since 2017. Today, we completed 

assessment on more than 250 CPO 

suppliers present in our supply 

chain. We adopt online forest 

monitoring and alert system – Global 

Forest Watch (GFW) and Global 

Forest Watch Pro (GFW Pro) in the 

environmental risk assessment.

The GFW platform enables us to 

identify potential deforestation risks 

in our own plantation operations 

as well as our supply chain. The 

desktop assessment is done through 

overlapping the TTP data of each 

supplier (collected during our TTP 

assessment) and other source of 

information such as peatland map, 

intact forest landscapes, tree cover 

loss etc.  

Deforestation Monitoring 

Since monitoring began in 2019, 

we 

have 

recorded 

zero 

illegal 

deforestation in our own plantation 

operation. We commit to restoration 

and reforestation activities in areas 

where there has been historical 

degradation on HCV or any non-

compliant land clearing as well as to 

restore riparian areas and peatland 

within our concession following 

our commitment in the Sustainable 

Palm Oil Policy. 

At the same time, we are working 

with multiple stakeholders including 

the NGOs in assessing our supply 

chain compliance to no deforestation 

commitment. All grievances raised 

are being handled in accordance with 

the grievance procedure. Suppliers 

that were found non-compliant 

in deforestation commitment are 

required to execute an acceptable 

recovery plan(s) to address non-

compliance(s). 

Focus Area 2: Responsible Supply Chain

Mill Priority (based on GFW Pro PALM Risk Analysis)

We began mill assessment exercise 

to high-risk suppliers’ palm oil mills 

since 2015. Through sustainability 

assessment 

program, 

we 

have 

achieved numerous success stories 

in our supply chain. Our capacity 

building programs were conducted 

on multiple channels such as field 

visitation, face-to-face meeting with 

Senior Management of suppliers’ 

group, sustainability workshop and 

collaboration program with Malaysia 

Palm Oil Board (MPOB). 

As of December 2020, we have 

assessed to around 190 palm oil 

mills in our supply chain. Out of 

190 palm oil mills, there are around 

30% high-risk suppliers which is 

around 57 palm oil mills. Our aim 

is to achieve 100% on-site field 

sustainability assessment to all palm 

oil mills located in high-risk areas by 

year 2022.

In relation to respecting human 

rights 

and 

labour 

rights, 

Malaysia has ratified a total of 18 

International Labour Organisation’s 

(ILO) Conventions. On top of the 

ratification, these conventions have 

been domesticated into national 

laws 

and 

regulations, 

including 

Employment Act 1955, Child and 

Young Persons Act 1966, Housing 

and Amnesties Act 1990, Trade 

Union Act 1959, Sabah Labour 

Ordinance 1950, and etc.  

The 

Mewah’s 

Sustainable 

Palm

Policy 

conveys 

our 

strong 

commitment to protect the rights of 

workers. All our workers are the core 

of our business. Hence, to further 

strengthen our position, we have 

developed and put in place policies, 

guided by international standards as 

set out in the United Nations (UN) 

Guiding Principles on Business and 

Human Rights, ILO conventions, UN 

Global Compact (UNGC) and the 

Universal Declaration of Human 

Rights and its covenants.

Sustainability Report 2020


Core Area 3:  

Stakeholder Engagement 

We understood that our workers 

are the backbone of our company, 

to which we have the responsibility 

of ensuring that we provide them 

with a decent and safe place to live 

and work. We have invested into 

systems and facilities to promote a 

more harmonious work and social 

relations in our operations. Apart 

from there, we are devoted to 

improving the infrastructure in our 

neighbourhood and communities 

such as housing, power supplies, 

water, roads, mosques, and schools. 

The purpose is to create a motivated 

workforce in our companies.

In order to making sure our suppliers’ 

mills are legally responsible and 

accountable to advocate human 

and labour rights in Malaysia, we 

have also developed our own set 

of assessment checklist to address 

social challenges and identify gaps in 

our suppliers’ site and supply chain.

At the same time, we also make 

mandatory for our suppliers to 

consider food security as part of FPIC 

and SIA processes. All our suppliers 

must commit to mitigate impact on 

food security and to demonstrate 

individual 

initiatives 

taken 

to 

improve livelihood for neighbouring 

communities.

2.3.2 SUPPLIER GROUP 

LEVEL SUSTAINABILITY 

ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM 

As part of our NDPE Implementation 

Program, we introduced Supplier 

Group Level Engagement Program 

since 2019. We selected 10 critical 

supplier groups in our supply chain 

that responsible for the supply of 50 

palm oil mills that account for 20% 

of palm oil production volume in our 

supply base. The program serves as 

a platform for us to communicate 

mill assessment findings with our 

supplier. The targeted audience for 

this program is, i.e., owners or senior 

management, group sustainability 

department 

and 

other 

relevant 

leaders in the organization. It allows us 

to raise prompt awareness to the mill 

to undertake responsibility of its own 

supply chain’s transformation, as well 

as to stand in as the leader in leading 

transformation within its supply base.

2.3.4 MEWAH’S SUPPLIER 

ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM

Supplier engagement is beyond 

the traceability exercise. The main 

objectives of supplier engagement 

are to create awareness to our 

upstream suppliers, to increase 

interaction between our suppliers &amp; 

buyers, to spread responsible palm 

oil practices and to build up supplier 

capacity to adapt sustainability 

practices. 

Our focus is to continuously raise 

the standard of the palm oil 

industry by sharing our experience, 

technical expertise, and knowledge 

by providing training and technical 

assistance 

to 

ensure 

that 

our 

suppliers have the right skills and 

motivation to deliver our goals. 

We see three crucial benefits from 

Supplier Engagement Program: 

i. Multi-stakeholders approach - 

The opportunity to socialize our 

Sustainable Palm Oil Policy with 

our direct suppliers. 

ii. A 

platform 

to 

discuss 

the 

implications and requirement of 

adopting similar policies. 

iii. A platform to create awareness 

of the market demands for the 

need to delink our palm oil supply 

chain from deforestation, oil 

palm development of peatland 

and human rights abuses. 



Supplier Engagement Program

“Suppliers 

are keys in the 

journey to improve 

sustainability 

standard.”

Supplier Engagement Workshop on 

ISPO

We 

introduced 

the 

Indonesian 

Sustainable 

Palm

(ISPO) 

Certification to our suppliers through 

a training workshop hosted in Jambi. 

During the workshop, we focus on 

the role and importance of ISPO and 

provide technical guidance to our 

suppliers in pursuing ISPO certification. 

We sought to raise awareness among 

suppliers that ISPO is a critical puzzle in 

improving sustainability performance 

in the Indonesian palm oil industry.

2.3.5 SMALLHOLDERS –  

BIG IMPACTS 

Smallholders 

are 

important 

stakeholders in our sustainability 

journey as they account for 40% 

of world’s palm oil production. 

Improving smallholder inclusiveness 

in our supply chain is one of the 

top 

priorities 

in 

our 

sourcing 

strategy. Our strategy centralizes 

in empowering smallholders as an 

essential prerequisite for increased 

inclusiveness. 

This 

is 

achieved 

through cooperatives, training, and 

financial support. 

Today, PT ADS sources about 5% 

FFB 

directly 

from 

independent 

smallholders 

surrounding 

Jambi province. In line with our 

sustainability commitment, we seek 

to enhance engagement with our 

smallholder suppliers to provide 

knowledge 

and 

assistance 

in 

implementing sustainable practices 

in their operation. 

2.3.6 MULTI-STAKEHOLDERS 

ENGAGEMENT APPROACH

SASPO 

(Support 

Asia 

for 

Sustainable 

Palm 

Oil) 

Green 

Member

Since 2018, one of our subsidiaries, 

Ngo Chew Hong Edible Oils Pte 

Ltd collaborated with SASPO to 

promote demand for sustainable 

palm oil. 

SASPO (Support Asia For Sustainable 

Palm Oil) was founded in 2016 by 

seven founding members: ASEAN 

CSR Network, Ayam Brand, Danone, 

IKEA, Unilever, Wildlife Reserves 

Singapore and WWF-Singapore. The 

alliance is the first business initiative 

in ASEAN focusing on sustainable 

palm oil. Through capacity building, 

workshops 

and 

educational 

resources, SASPO aims to lower 

the barriers for businesses to adopt 

sustainable sourcing policies. 

Aside from hosting workshop to 

increase sustainability awareness 

among smallholders, we educate 

the smallholders in adoption of 

sustainable agricultural practices in 

oil palm cultivation. 

We 

assist 

more 

than 

1,200 

independent 

smallholders 

surrounding 

us 

in 

improving 

their livelihoods, providing them 

with 

knowledge 

and 

resources 

in 

improving 

productivity 

while 

mitigating 

the 

negative 

environmental and social impacts. 

Mewah 

has 

made 

substantial 

investment 

in 

infrastructure 

improvement, 

i.e. 

road, 

bridge, 

drainage, etc, to improve the market 

access from smallholders’ estates. 

In addition, we provide free supply 

of seedling and organic fertilizers 

to encourage more sustainable 

cultivation of oil palm surrounding 

the palm oil mill.

Mewah International Inc. 


Focus Area 2: Responsible Supply Chain

We 

initiated 

the

chain 

Grievance 

Procedure 

on 

our 

Sustainability Dashboard since Jun 

2016. The Grievance Procedure serves 

as a platform for stakeholders in our 

supply chain to address concerns or 

to reports a complaint with regards 

to violation of our Sustainable 

Palm Oil Policy implementation. 

It defines the process of handling 

grievances made against Mewah’s 

palm business, including all direct &amp; 

indirect suppliers. 

Our intention is to provide a positive, 

clear-cut, 

and 

comprehensive 

response 

to 

any 

reported 

sustainability grievances that are 

relevant to our Sustainable Palm Oil 

Policy implementation to ensure a 

transparent and open investigation 

process. We value the input of 

stakeholders in helping to achieve 

the objectives of the policy and in 

enhancing transparency throughout 

our supply chain.

responsibility. At Mewah, we are committed to improving the sustainability of our shipping operations and to 

moving the maritime industry towards a sustainable future.

Since year 2019, we announced compliance to a Sustainable Shipping Policy. In this policy, we reinstate our 

commitment to relevant laws and regulation, security, occupational safety and health, human and labour rights, 

ethical business conduct as well as confronting climate change. A Labour Compliance Checklist has been put in 

place in our ships to ensure compliance with Maritime Labour Convection 2006.

Our initiatives in driving sustainable development in shipping operation includes:

1. Reducing GHG emissions and other air pollutants, notably (SOx and SO2), nitrogen (NOx) and particulate 

matter (PM) emissions;

2. Providing safe, healthy working environments on ships 

3. Promoting human and labour rights 

We support the measure taken by International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce permissible SOx from 

3.5% m/m (mass per mass) to 0.5% m/m beginning in January 2020. Starting from August 2019, all our ships have 

converted to only consume low-sulphur fuel oil.

Good Milling Practices

Freshly harvested FFB are usually 

delivered to the mills for processing 

within 24 hours in order to preserve 

the quality of the fruits. In the milling 

process, the FFB are first going 

through sterilization process by 

applying high-pressure steam, upon 

which the enzyme lipase in FFB will 

be deactivated and the palm fruits 

will be detached from the palm 

bunches. The palm fruitlets will then 

be crushed in a pressor to yield CPO 

and palm kernel. The biomass waste 

and wastewater are then cleared and 

separated from the CPO through 

centrifugation technique. The pure 

CPO emerging from the centrifuge 

is then transports to storage tank 

before delivering to a refinery for 

further processing. 

Core Area 2:  

Quality Management System 

Good quality FFB can be achieved 

through implementation of Good 

Agricultural Practices (GAP) in the 

plantations. A 100% ripe grade 

FFB will contributes to a significant 

increase in mill oil extraction rate 

(OER) and improves the quality of 

CPO produced. 

Quality of CPO can be determined 

by its physical properties (i.e., odour, 

colour, 

viscosity) 

and 

chemical 

characteristics such as iodine value 

(IV), free fatty acids (FFA), moisture 

&amp; impurities contents (M&amp;I) and 

deterioration of bleachability index 

(DOBI). The quality control of CPO 

at palm oil mill relies primarily on 

the quality of FFB. Sorting out the 

unsuitable FFB (i.e., under-ripe fruit, 

over-ripe fruit, empty bunches, 

and long stalks) will maximize the 

extracted CPO yield and kernel yield. 

We have also introduced several 

others quality improvement and 

quality control strategies at our palm 

oil mill, that includes maintenance 

of machinery (timely corrective 

maintenance and strict follows in 

preventive maintenance schedule) 

and upskills of our workers

Production of Low 3-MCPD and 

low GE Palm Oil

3-monochloropropanediol 

(3-

MCPD) 

is 

becoming 

a 

major 

concern in the palm oil industry as 

it is classified as food processing 

contaminant 

and 

probably 

carcinogenic to human. In year 

2018, the European Food Standards 

Authority (EFSA) revised the safe 

intake of contaminant 3-MCPD and 

Glycidyl Esters (GE) levels. Mewah 

is aware of consumer concerns 

about the food safety and health 

aspects of our palm oil products. 

We have been actively addressing 

the 3-MCPD/GE issue through our 

efforts in minimizing the occurrence 

of MCPD precursors and optimising 

our refining techniques. We aim 

to tackle the issue holistically so to 

provide assurance to our consumers 

in our products and to safeguard our 

consumer health. 

Mineral Oil Hydrocarbon (MOH) in 

Palm Oil

The levels of mineral oil hydrocarbon 

(MOH) namely, mineral oil saturated 

hydrocarbons (MOSH) and mineral 

oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) 

are a concern in agricultural raw 

materials. Such contaminants are 

found across several food products, 

including vegetable oils, such as 

soy and sunflower, and it can enter 

food through packaging materials, 

additives or during storage. 

Since 2018, European Governments 

have been considering regulating 

the levels of MOSH and MOAH in 

palm oil. At the same time, some 

food companies have established 

limit in the palm oil starting from 

2020. 

Although 

there 

are 

no 

European regulations on MOSH and 

MOAH at present, our objective is to 

ensure levels of MOSH and MOAH 

are as low as feasibly possible in the 

raw materials we source as well as in 

the product we produce. 

MOSH 

and 

MOAH 

cannot 

be 

removed 

by 

physical 

refining 

process. Therefore, the only way we 

can limit its presence is to enforce 

control at source. One key solution 

is to work with our suppliers to 

conduct an overview of all lubricant 

use on site and to explore feasibility 

to convert all lubricant/special fluid 

i.e. great oil, hydraulic oil and engine 

oil from non-food grade to good 

grade.

Focus Area 3: Product Quality and Safety

“Edible oils processing will potentially lead to mineral oils hydrocarbon (MOH) contamination. MOH 

contamination may occur at all stages of supply chain, from cultivation, transportation, milling, refining, 

storage, to packaging. The concern on food safety is gaining prominence particularly in post-COVID-19 era. 

The policy makers alongside the health specialists are constantly stressing the importance in minimizing 

MOSH/MOAH content in edible oils and fats. Even though the MOH level is not regulated, a few of our 

buyers have reached out to Mewah on the approach to control and mitigate MOH level in our palm/lauric oil 

processing. 

To address the issue and control at source, we engaged closely with our palm oil/lauric oil suppliers to increase 

awareness and seek collaboration in adopting MOH mitigation plan. We shared educational materials, and 

Code of Practices (CoP) for mitigating MOH contamination in palm oil/lauric oil processing. Additionally, we 

carried out Supplier Compliance Survey to assess, review, and evaluate suppliers’ commitment. 

We recognized that conversion of food grade lubes might not be the only solution, but good milling practices 

are also the critical pieces of puzzles. Besides, good lube/grease management and timely preventive 

maintenance at all critical control points (CCPs) during milling/crushing process could significantly mitigate 

the risk of lube oil leakages and contact with products. In year 2020, we commenced MOSH/MOAH assessment 

at suppliers’ sites. At the same time, several rounds of quality testing were carried out to distinguish quality 

of raw materials. 

We believe our approach will yield longer term benefits by bringing suppliers and customers together to 

improve the quality of our products and by shaping a resilient supply chain."

4.2.1 RECRUITMENT AND 

RETENTION

Hiring 

and 

retaining 

talented 

employees are crucial to the success 

and growth of any business. Today, 

with the competition for talents 

growing 

more 

intensive, 

our 

recruitment focusses not only on job 

skills but also on positive personal 

attributes such as leadership. 

Retention is also the key to a 

successful healthy work culture 

of 

any 

vibrant 

and 

dynamic 

organisation. 

Retention 

means 

less disruption and more stability. 

This translates to a sustainable 

workforce who creates a sustainable 

work culture and a successful 

organisation orientated towards its 

workforce.

These practices include listening 

to and respecting our employees’ 

feedback on their concerns and 

ideas, setting up performance-based 

rewards and a direct engagement 

platform by assisting them with their 

career development. We recognize 

too that our employees must feel 

engaged, valued, and appreciated.

4.2.2 RECOGNIZING AND 

REWARDING PERFORMANCE 

We recognize every employee is 

vital to the growth and progress of 

the company. Our recognition and 

reward framework aim to retain and 

motivate the talent needed to grow 

and sustain our business. 

We constantly seek to establish clear 

communication between managers 

and employees about what they 

are expected to accomplish. The 

performance-based 

system 

is 

a 

continuous process where managers 

and employees set goals through 

annual tasks &amp; objectives (T&amp;O) 

exercise. The T&amp;O set is then 

translated into departmental T&amp;O 

and individual employee T&amp;O so 

that every employee is aligned to 

our overall objective of building a 

sustainable business. 

4.2.3 TRAINING AND 

EDUCATION 

Training 

and 

education 

are 

investments in human capital that 

delivers benefits to both employee 

and employer. We support our 

employees in their work and career 

goals by identifying training needs 

and development opportunities. The 

most important form of development 

is on the job training whereby the 

supervisor will identify key stretch 

goals and regular sit-downs with 

the employee to ensure consistent 

feedback on their key objectives. 

We have designed training and 

education program which aim to equip 

our employees with relevant skill sets 

and competencies for their roles and 

responsibilities. For instance, all our 

employees are given opportunities to 

attend monthly “Brown Bag Lunch” 

session and the 7 Habits of Highly 

Effective People® Programme that 

are specifically designed to develop

“Brown Bag Lunch” sessions deliver 

series of training topics ranging

cyber security, safety, and health to 

sustainability awareness. We aim to 

give opportunities to every employee 

to realize their potential in order to 

pursue their careers with Mewah.

Workplace safety is everybody’s 

concern. Any work-related injury 

or loss of life is unacceptable to us. 

At Mewah, health &amp; safety of our 

employees is always our top priority. 

We want Mewah to be an attractive 

workplace for our employee by 

ensuring all employee is healthy 

and 

safe 

both 

physically 

and 

mentally. With over 3,000 people 

employed in our palm oil operations, 

we understand that we should 

take this opportunity to provide 

good 

livelihoods 

and 

develop 

opportunities to all our workers and 

their families. 

In addition to our Sustainable Palm 

Oil Policy, we have put in place 

Group Health and Safety Policy, 

Human Rights and Labour Policy, 

and Gender Equality Policy. We 

expect all our own operating sites to 

adhere to all of these policies. 

Core area 3:  

Safety, Health and Well-being 

Focus Area 4: Valuing Our People

To ensure that safety is properly 

addressed, we have a specific Group 

Safety Policy in place in all our 

operating sites with the following 

guidelines: 

1. Comply with the current legal 

and other related and applicable 

health &amp; safety requirements, 

regulations, 

approved 

codes 

of 

practice, 

standards 

and 

guidelines 

in 

countries 

we 

operate;

2. Establish an Occupational Safety 

and Health Management System 

at all operating units; 

3. Formulate, 

establish, 

communicate, implement and 

maintain 

safety 

management 

systems at work;

4. Provide 

employees 

with 

adequate 

knowledge 

and 

training to ensure competency 

in performing their tasks to 

maintain a safe and healthful 

working conditions;

5. Prevent 

and 

minimize 

any 

potential 

adverse 

safety 

&amp; 

health impacts arising from our 

operations, product and services;

6. Ensure 

continuous 

improvements in total safety &amp; 

health management system.

All our policies are set out to ensure 

that our business is conducted in an 

ethical manner, that our employee’s 

human rights are respected, that 

everyone are treated equally and 

work in a safe environment. Most 

importantly, 

all 

our 

employees 

return home to their family as 

healthy as they were when they 

arrived at work. 

The 

factory 

managers 

in 

our 

manufacturing sites are focusing 

on 

efforts 

and 

initiatives 

to 

strengthen our safety culture. Key 

performance indicators that tie 

employees’ performance bonus and 

remuneration to their health and 

safety performance have been set 

to instill a behavioral-based safety 

culture, support increased safety 

awareness, 

and 

improve 

safety 

practices.

Improving 

Workplace Safety

Improving health and safety at 

our workplace has been our key 

performance plan in 2020. We have 

unveiled a number of new initiatives 

to further strengthen our safety 

culture. This includes implementation 

of a robust safety framework to 

identify, correct and control hazards 

on an ongoing basis, a more inclusive 

health, 

safety 

and 

environment 

(HSE) program and evaluation of 

the effectiveness of overall factory 

safety management practices. 

Ergonomic Risk

Ergonomic risk factors are the aspects 

of job that lead to a biomechanical 

stress on the worker. At Mewah, 

we are actively engaging with our 

workers 

to 

address 

ergonomic 

risk factors at our workplace. We 

have 

taken 

multiple 

measures 

including mandatory occupational 

ergonomics training to support our 

workers from ergonomic risk that 

cause wear and tear on body and 

injury that resulting from repetition,

Group Safety Portal 

In October 2020, the Group rolled out 

an automated and centralized Safety 

Portal. The Safety Portal serves as 

one-stop portal as to boost safety 

awareness among our employees. 

The purpose is to provide an easy-

to-use, highly accessible and real-

time statistic platform. The Portal 

encompasses a wide range of safety 

information that includes accidents 

&amp; near misses’ statistic, accident 

reports, training material and other 

important safety-related materials. 

To ensure successful implementation 

and making sure we gain maximum 

value from the Safety Portal, a 

Group 

Safety 

Committee 

was 

established to review effectiveness 

of the content and make necessary 

recommendation for improvement.

 

Today, the employees across the 

organization can now access a full 

range of safety knowledge via the 

Group Safety Portal. The safety 

officers at respective operating 

sites are taking the opportunity 

to 

socialize 

safety 

news 

and

with

Aside from Group Safety Portal, 

we 

have 

implemented 

“Merit 

and De-merit Point System” at all 

manufacturing sites since 2019. 

This system is to reward good 

behaviour while penalize safety non-

conformances at the same time. 

The objective is to urge everybody 

that we are all accountable and 

responsible to oneself and as a 

collective unit to create a safe, 

healthy, and conducive working 

environment. At the same time, we 

discourage any forms of actions that 

may lead to workplace hazard.

Another program that we have 

embarked on is the Observation 

Card program. Safety observations 

are counts of the number of safe 

and unsafe actions or conditions in a 

work area at a specific time. In this 

program, we empower all employee 

to play a part in promoting safe 

and healthy working environment 

with routine safety behavioural 

observations. The primary goal is to 

identify the positive and negative 

behaviour of our employees and 

utilizing the data to apply corrective 

action plan and improve safety at 

our workplace. 

In year 2020, a total of 394 safety 

observation has been reported 

across 

our 

factories. 

Each 

observation card is logged into 

centralized system, Safety Poral, for 

all employees’ notice. By utilizing 

this data, our safety department can 

develop and implement correction 

action plans by addressing trends 

and areas that require improvement 

from the observation reports.

Every accident case is followed by a 

root-case analysis to review its cause 

and actions to prevent reoccurrence. 

The reviews are reinforced with 

continued efforts in training and 

PPE use to minimize, if not eliminate 

risks. Safety Committee is formed at 

every factory to oversee the factory’s 

production safety management and 

employee safety and health. The 

Safety Committee is responsible for 

ensuring that practices are in line 

with Mewah’s Group Safety Policy. 

To support this safety framework, 

we are implementing numerous 

major workplace safety programs 

to improve workplace safety. To 

measure the effectiveness of these 

programs, we have adopted a 

measurement of both leading and 

lagging indicators. We choose to 

focus not only on lagging indicators 

(e.g. Lost time injury rate) that 

report on the outcomes of safety 

initiatives, but also give equal 

consideration to leading indicators 

(e.g. training, safety audits, safety 

suggestions) 

that 

measure 

our 

employee safety behaviour and 

mind-set. By engraining safety as 

a part of a culture and habit, we 

hope to minimise unsafe employee 

behaviour.

 “A good Safety Manager is also a good Safety Mentor.

For over 29 years, I have spent virtually all of my life and career associated with Health and Safety portfolio. 

Employees form the backbone of our company and as a SHE Manager, I share the responsibility of assuring a 

safe workplace for my colleagues. 

It was not easy to instil safety culture from ground up. Often, it is challenging influence everyone to change 

their perceptions towards safety. A successful safety culture starts with implementation of a robust safety 

policy and a solid health &amp; safety framework. The mindset of “That’s the way we always do it” must be 

eliminated for good reason.

Throughout my working experience, the functions of a SHE Manager is as if a roller-coaster ride that embraces 

all different modes of feeling such as excitement, happiness, fear, and anxiety which are hidden somewhere. 

Every now and then, we observed “unnecessary” accidents that can be avoided at a renowned factory 

despite having the most qualified SHE Manager. As the saying goes, “You can lead a horse to water, but you 

can't make him drink”. The logic of a successful safety program is simple that - when safety procedures and 

policies are operating effectively, and everyone is working together to minimize risk, the number of incidents 

at workplace will be greatly reduced. 

In 2020, the total number of reported major accidents in the group had reduced by 56% and the lost-time 

injuries (LTI) days had down significantly by 51% y-o-y. We are proud of the improvement, but our good work 

will not stop here. We know that there are still a lot can be done to strengthen safety culture and enhance 

safety awareness in the group. 

My aim in the coming years is to continue working hard to provide coaching for the co-workers and to share 

my life experiences with the juniors. As the Chinese Proverb says, “Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for 

a Day. Teach a Man To Fish, and You Feed Him for a Lifetime”. I want to bring out the best from the next 

generation and to sustain Mewah as a decent and safe place to work.’’

CAMPAIGN IN ALL 

PRODUCTION SITES

To keep abreast of the health &amp; 

safety awareness in our employees, 

we periodically conduct both in-

house and external safety trainings 

in all production sites. In addition, 

every site will hold a week-long HSE 

Campaign Program annually. The 

primary objective of this campaign 

is 

to 

create 

organized 

efforts 

and 

procedures 

for 

identifying 

workplace hazards that aims to 

reduce accidents and exposure to 

adverse situations. 

It also provides training of personnel 

in accident prevention, accident 

response, emergency preparedness, 

and use of protective clothing and 

equipment. 

We maintain our focus on safety 

and are following through with 

our efforts to strengthen our

We commit to keep our people safe

their productivity and satisfaction 

to work with us. The pursuit of 

workplace wellness accelerates in 

light of COVID-19 pandemic. The 

changes to new lifestyle, and physical 

safety measures in place across 

the world, can lead to both work 

and 

non-work-related 

emotional 

stress, as we experience disruption 

from normal routines and colleague 

interactions. Working remotely or 

working from home blurs the line 

between workplace and home. 

Despite physical health programs 

and company sport events are 

disrupted during the pandemic, 

we offer a suite of online health 

initiatives to prevent burnout and 

keep our employees motivated. We 

invite speakers to give virtual fitness 

class, virtual stress management 

workshop, healthy diets guidance, 

and quality sleep to boost mental 

and physical health of our people.

Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

We commit to fight hunger and eliminate food waste in the communities surrounding 

our operation. When we stop food waste, we take a big step toward ending hunger. 

We have put in concerted efforts primarily through community support programmes 

to instil good habits to reduce food waste. One example, our refinery in Pasir Gudang 

is working with local authority to recycle food waste from our factory by way of 

compositing food waste scraps into organic soil nutrients. 

Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

Education is an essential catalyst for positive change in society. We support local 

schools with educational materials as well as provide free tuition for children from 

underprivileged families. We are endeavour to do our best to enable all children in our 

communities for an opportunity to access to mainstream education. 

Our Key Sustainability Efforts:

The Global Goals can only be met if we work together. Over the years, we built 

effective partnership with a number of local non-profit organizations so as to enable 

us to reach out more people in need and extend greater impact to the societies.

B. SUPPORTING OUR NEXT 

GENERATION

The year 2020 has not been easy 

for today’s young generation. The 

education has been disrupted in 

most of the places and children 

have been separated from their 

family and friends. After COVID-19 

pandemic, we know that we cannot 

simply hope that things will go back 

to the normal. In this regard, our 

CSR initiatives focus in supporting 

our next generation to realize their 

potential and to enable them an 

opportunity to help shaping the 

future, and that their efforts and 

input are valued and supported. 

The fundamental belief in our 

community objective is the believe 

that every child deserves a chance 

at a life filled with love, laughter, 

friends, and family. We often hear 

the obstacles face by the young 

people in reaching their full potential 

– due to a lack of access to resources, 

finance, education, information, and 

communication technologies. Our 

works primarily focus in improving 

access to inclusive and quality 

education for all, we strongly believe 

that education is a cornerstone 

for empowering individuals and 

communities to break out of poverty 

and build meaningful lives in long 

term. 

This year, a number of activities 

have been held internally e.g., fund-

raising activities and externally e.g., 

foods, groceries and stationaries 

distribution to the children charitable 

organization. Our employee also 

using their knowledge to support 

the 

underprivileged 

students 

through free tuition classes. From 

time to time, we were heartened to 

see the passion and perseverance 

among the young generation at 

rural communities who are working 

at its best to change their life 

through education. We know that 

this is where we can play our role 

in supporting them through our 

endeavors to help them in alleviating 

the disablement and at the same 

time, giving the less fortunate 

children a hope for a brighter future. 

C. DISASTER RELIEF 

Giving a helping hand to disaster 

victim is always one major part of 

the Mewah’s CSR strategy. Although 

we never want to see disaster 

happen, we often get ourselves 

prepare for the unexpected. A 

disaster occurring can disrupt our 

neighbouring 

communities 

and 

where our employees work and 

live in. Looking back at the past 

events, our people have been 

always 

reacting 

compassionately 

in donations and activities to aid 

disaster relief and rehabilitation. 

In our disaster relief strategy, we 

have proactively put together a 

fast aid “disaster relieve plan” that 

aim to alleviate the suffering of 

our neighbourhood at soonest in 

the event of unexpected disaster. 

At the same time, we are ready to 

go above and beyond to ensure 

resources will be available to keep 

our employees safe, protect their 

facilities and perform recoveries 

during a disaster response. On 

a side note, within the company 

itself, we are adopting to a Business 

Continuity Plan that intends to 

work diligently to ensure that all 

our operation units are aligned, 

leadership has signed off on the 

processes, and the right support 

is allocated should an unexpected 

event occur.

"The hunger for love is much  

more difficult to remove than  

the hunger for bread."

Ramadan 2020 – Practicing Faith 

in Times of COVID-19

Ramadan has always been a time 

of the year that the fellow Muslim 

community looks forward to. In 

2020, with all the fear, isolation and 

uncertainty, a heavy shadow looms 

over a period of awaited peace and 

joy. Our Muslim employees and 

communities are making greater 

than usual sacrifices in the Ramadan 

2020, with movement control/ travel 

restriction compliant with safety 

measures imposed nationwide to 

curb the spread of COVID-19. 

The CSR initiatives rolled out by 

Mewah during the Ramadan have 

positively influenced hundreds to 

thousands of people in Malaysia and 

Indonesia. The highlight of the CSR 

activities held in Jambi, Indonesia 

during Ramadan was its contribution 

of meal and nutrition distribution 

to the Sailun Salimbai Orphanage 

in Tempino, Jambi. Additionally, 

our 

employees 

in 

Mewah-Oils 

Sdn Bhd volunteered for a 2-days 

CSR program to raise fund and 

distribute free groceries to address 

poverty at several rural areas in the 

Selangor state. The prime focus 

of the donation is to support the 

unprivileged including the single 

parent, low-income families who 

have lost sources of incomes during 

the pandemic and the disabled. 

With an innovative approach in 

executing CSR initiatives, Mewah 

is proud of our Ramadan CSR 

initiatives that are part of our long-

term CSR strategy.

Program – Giving a Hand to Fire 

Victims

On 23rd January 2020, there was two 

massive fire outbreaks happened 

at Kg. Sepagaya &amp; Kg. Sri Aman 

Bumiputra, Lahad Datu. The fire 

Department took more than two 

hours to control the blaze at each

of 

rebuilding 

houses 

for 

the 

villagers as well as supported the 

victims through in-kind sponsorship

Rekindling the “Gotong-Royong” 

Spirit in Our Communities

The “Gotong-Royong” program is a 

concept of “mutual cooperation” 

between our employee and the local 

communities. It aims to promote the 

culture of cooperation, collective 

work and social justice. It goes hand 

in hand with the spirit of community 

and 

neighborliness 

to 

improve 

the quality of living environment, 

provide basic housing infrastructure 

and support the local economy as a

Gotong 

Royong 

programme 

in 

Kampung 

Hulu 

Rinching, Semenyih. It was not only 

a CSR program but a chance for 

our employee to be with the local

provide a universal standard of 

measurement against which the 

impacts 

of 

releasing 

different 

greenhouse gases can be evaluated. 

Effluents 

Water discharged from one source 

into a separate body of water, such 

as the refinery plant process water. 

Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB)

measurements. 

Each 

vegetation 

class is validated through calibrating 

it with carbon stock estimates in the 

above-ground tree biomass.

Completeness 

This report provides a complete 

overview of our core businesses 

within the established scope. The 

data in this report covers 1 Jan – 31

sought to include historical data as a 

benchmark. We believe that the data 

presented are a fair representation

Assurance 

This is the fourth Mewah Group’s 

Sustainability report. We have carried 

out extensive review with both 

internal and external stakeholders 

to identify gaps since the production 

of our first Sustainability report in 

Dec 2018. Materiality assessment 

has 

been 

incorporated 

into 

our report. The outcome from 

materiality assessment enables us 

to recognize the economic, social 

and 

environmental 

issues 

that 

shape our business success. Moving 

forward, we will continue to use this 

report to engage our stakeholders 

and to understand what form of 

assurance they would like to see in 

our subsequent reports.
