POLICY, PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE 

REPORTING 

 

 

STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGEMENT  

An important starting point in our sustainability 

journey is to identify our stakeholders and material 

factors relevant to our business. The interests and 

requirements of key stakeholders are also taken into 

account when formulating corporate strategies. 

These key stakeholders include, amongst others, 

shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and 

authorities. We adopt both formal and informal 

channels of communication such as face-to-face 

meetings and supplier visits to understand the needs 

of key stakeholders and incorporate these into our 

corporate strategies to achieve mutually beneficial 

relationships.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT  

Our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant factors. Relevant factors are then 

prioritised to identify material factors which are validated internally. The end result of this process is a 

list of material factors disclosed in the Sustainability Report. Process of which is as shown below: 

 

We have previously conducted a materiality assessment with the help of an external consultant to 

identify and determine the material EESG factors. EESG factors were identified and prioritised through 

internal workshops, peer reviews and social impact assessments at site level. Thereafter, materiality 

review is conducted every year by the Senior Management, incorporating inputs from the stakeholder 

engagements. 

 

To determine if an EESG factor is material, we assessed its potential impact on the economy, 

environment and society and the influence on the various internal and external stakeholders of Ocean 

Sky. Applying the guidance from GRI, we have identified and maintained the following material EESG 

factors:

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

Ocean Sky firmly believes that focusing on financial sustainability is critical. The Company’s basic 

principle is that long-term profitability and shareholder value is ensured by taking into account the 

interests of stakeholders, such as shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and society as a 

whole.  

 

FY2020 had been an exceptional year. It was the year of COVID-19. This disease started to spread in 

late 2019 and quickly became a pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, affecting almost every country in 

the world. As this virus is spread through close contact, many countries are forced to limit movement, 

commuting, gathering, crowding, travelling, etc. Majority of businesses that require human interaction 

and movement have been severely affected by such measures. 

 

In Singapore, the virus infection outbreak in the worker dormitories in the first half of 2020 had affected 

the manpower availability for the construction sector, thus affecting the progress of the Group’s 

construction projects. As the situation improved in the second half of 2020, workers were progressively 

allowed to resume work at the construction sites, with safe management measures in place. 

 

The Group recorded a revenue of S$23.95 million for FY2020 compared with S$23.82 million for 

financial year ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”).  

 

Revenue from Construction and Engineering Business decreased by S$7.86 million to S$15.70 million 

for FY2020 from S$23.56 million for FY2019 due mainly to the suspension of construction work during 

Covid Circuit Breaker and the subsequent slow restart of construction activities after Phase 1 re-

opening.  

 

Revenue from Property Business increased by S$7.99 million to S$8.25 million for FY2020 from S$0.26 

million for FY2019 due to the sale of development property at 6 Nim Drive in Singapore and the 

additional rental income arising from the acquired investment property in Melbourne, Australia with 

effect from March 2020. 

 

Other income, comprising mainly government grants and interest income, increased by S$1.34 million 

to S$1.79 million for FY2020 from S$0.45 million for FY2019 due mainly to the Job Support Scheme 

payout and the Foreign Worker Levy rebates provided by the Singapore Government during the 

financial year.

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

Ocean Sky does not tolerate any form of corruption. This has been made clear to all of our employees, 

suppliers and business partners. We have achieved the target we set last year. There were no incidents 

of corruption reported in FY2020 (FY2019: Nil). We will continue to remind our staff regarding our anti-

corruption policy and strive to ensure that there will be no incidents of corruption in the Group for the 

financial year ending 31 December 2021 (“FY2021”). 

 

Whistle-blowing policy 

The Company has put in place a whistle-blowing framework whereby staff of the Group may, in 

confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other 

matters. The framework includes arrangements for independent investigation and appropriate follow-

up of such matters. 

 

To ensure independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up action, all whistle-

blowing reports are addressed and sent to the Audit Committee Chairman. A whistle-blower email 

address has been created for reporting suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest practices or other similar 

matters. Details of the whistle-blowing policy and arrangements have been made known to all staff. In 

addition, new staff is briefed on the policy during the orientation programme. No whistle-blowing report 

was received during FY2020 (FY2019: Nil). 

 

 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL 

 

 

ENERGY AND WATER 

The Group is fully aware of its responsibility for nurturing the environment and lessening negative 

environmental consequences at our worksites and the environment where we operate. We monitor our 

energy (both electricity and diesel) and water consumption at our work places to ensure that we use 

our resources economically, meaningfully and responsibly.  

 

Ang Tong Seng Brothers Enterprises Pte Ltd has been awarded BCA Green and Gracious Builder 

(SMC) Award in the category Certified in 2016.  

 

Below are our performance indicators in FY2020 compared to FY2019: 

 



 

2019 

2020 

Electricity consumption (kWh) 

146,495 

127,702 

Diesel consumption (litres) 

633,495 

398,786 

Water consumption (Cu M) 

2,284 

2,703 


 

10 

 

 

Our electricity and diesel consumption decreased by 13% and 37% respectively due to work from home 

arrangement for all office staff, reduced fabrication activity for construction-related materials and no 

construction activity carried out at site by the Group for approximately 4 months during the Covid Circuit 

Breaker and Phase 1 re-opening periods. 

 

We have obtained an approval for the setup of temporary living quarters in the office premise from June 

2020 to March 2021 for our stranded Malaysian workers. Together with the discovery of an underground 

water leakage, which had been resolved in December 2020, led to a 18% increase in our water 

consumption. 

 

To achieve cost reduction and improve service delivery, ATSC fabricated the supplies of construction-

related materials and undertook the maintenance of machinery to support ATS projects. We target to 

maintain or lower our energy and water consumption in FY2021.  

 

In 2020, we obtained a 4.5-star rating from National Australian Built Environment Rating System 

(NABERS) by the Australian Government for our investment property in Melbourne, Australia. We target 

to maintain or improve the 4.5-star NABERS rating in FY2021. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

Similar to FY2019, there were no incidents of non-compliance with environmental-related laws and 

regulations resulting in significant fines or sanctions in FY2020, and we endeavour to maintain this track 

record in FY2021.  

 

To help the environment in our own little ways, we strive to continue the following initiatives: 

✓ Only print when necessary and/or double-sided printing to reduce paper wastage 

✓ re-using water for washing to reduce water wastage 

✓ switching off lights and air-conditioners during lunch break 

✓ recycling materials from one project to another where possible.

SOCIAL 

 

 

EMPLOYMENT 

Every employee plays an essential role in our Group. We achieve success by promoting a collaborative 

work environment in which everyone is committed to achieve our corporate goals based on open and 

honest communications while showing care and support for each other. Our employees are the drivers 

of our business and we believe in creating a respectful, rewarding and safe working environment for 

our people. We support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights.  

 

We respect human rights, support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour, 

especially child labour, and do not tolerate any discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.  

 

We provide competitive remuneration based on merit to all our employees. Our employees are not 

covered by collective bargaining agreements.  

 

The Group has a total of 203 employees in FY2020 (FY2019: 233) with 16% (FY2019: 29%) new 

recruitments over 31% (FY2019: 18%) resignations.  

 

During Covid-19 period, control measures in both Singapore and Malaysia were implemented to prevent 

the spread of the virus which led to our Malaysian staff not being able to travel back to Malaysia. We 

provided accommodation to our Malaysian staff who travel daily between Singapore and Johor Bahru 

during the Covid Circuit Breaker. 

 

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY  

We do not discriminate employees according to their race, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, facial 

attractiveness, physical impairments, sexual preference, political viewpoints or nationality. We strive to 

achieve a fair proportion of diversity in terms of gender, age and nationality in our workforce. We aim 

to provide equal opportunities to all employees based on their individual skillset and competencies.  

 

We have achieved the target we set last year. There were no cases of discrimination (FY2019: Nil) 

reported in FY2020.and we will continue to ensure to be fair with our employees as well as no 

discrimination in our company throughout the years.

We enjoy major festival celebrations with our employees. However, due to Covid-19 pandemic, we only 

managed to celebrate Chinese New Year in 2020. Nevertheless, long service awardees were given 

cash rewards for their continuous support and contribution.  

 

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

We are also committed to safeguarding our employees’ health and safety against any potential 

workplace hazards. The focus on health and safety is important for Ocean Sky. It is not only a 

fundamental right for our workers to be able to work in a safe environment, but when our employees’ 

wellness is attained, our productivity increases, and our best is given to our customers. By implementing 

job safety guidelines, we are committed to provide a hazard-free workplace to ensure the well-being of 

both our employees and environment.  


 

13 

 

 

Ocean Sky employs a variety of measures to ensure the health and safety of all our staff. Daily onsite 

work briefing, including risks assessments, required safety measures, designed personal safety 

protections, and most importantly, the spirit of teamwork, are strongly emphasised on each individual 

project site, by our designated competent safety coordinators. Lead safety coordinator and safety 

officers are always on random site checks to ensure safety compliances and put-up necessary 

discussions and comments to the respective teams, so as to further improve on the safety measures 

and well-being at the ongoing project.  

 

We have achieved the target we set last year. There was no reported incident of work-related accident 

in FY2020 (FY2019: Nil). We endeavour to maintain this track record and target to have zero reportable 

incident of work-related accident to the Ministry of Manpower in FY2021.  

 

Given that we value our employees’ health and safety as a priority within our organisation, achieving 

these required certifications and implementing the framework of systems is vital to our organisation. 

The implementation of the framework has enabled us to systematically identify, reduce and mitigate 

risks involved in the operations within the Group. 

 

We currently have the following certifications:

Covid-19 Control Measure 

The Group has implemented Covid-19 control measures in accordance with those set by the Minister 

of Manpower such as work from home arrangement for office staff, segregation of the employees, 

restricting of physical meetings at the workplace and safe distancing. We also provided face mask to 

all our employees to ensure they are protected from Covid-19 virus. 

 

TRAINING AND EDUCATION 

It is in the interest of Ocean Sky that career development programmes are set for individual employees 

on an on-going basis based on their individual needs and goals. We have achieved the target we set 

last year. 22% (FY2019: 21%) of employees attended trainings in FY2020. A total of 38 training 

programmes were provided to our employees in FY2020 (FY2019: 34 programmes) averaging 1 day 

(FY2019: 2 days) per employee who attended. We will continue to provide trainings to our employees 

for their development and will target at least 5% of our total employee to attend trainings annually.
