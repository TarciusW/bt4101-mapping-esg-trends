• We derived Core PATMI from “Profit Attributable to Owners of the Parent, Net of Tax” by excluding a) changes in fair value of 

biological assets (net of tax), other than gains/(losses) from the sale of beef in China, b) changes in fair value of derivatives, and c) 

any extraordinary items, attributable to the owners of the parent.

• “Core PATMI without Forex” is an estimate derived from Core PATMI by excluding foreign exchange gains/losses (before tax) 

attributable to the owners of the parent. We have not made an estimate of the tax impact on foreign exchange gains/losses. This is 

because the majority of the gains/losses are unrealised and arise from the translation of USD bonds in PT Japfa Tbk and USD loans 

in Dairy, which have no tax implication.

2020 will be a difficult year to forget as it was the year 

when the Covid-19 pandemic swept across the globe 

and spared no nation. The virus had a destructive 

impact on people and businesses, putting human and 

corporate resilience to the test.

For Japfa, our role as a leading staple food producer 

became critical at a time when supply chains were 

disrupted and there were widespread fears of food 

insufficiency. Looking back, I am incredibly proud 

of how our entire workforce rose to the challenge to 

ensure that our Group continues to safely produce 

and deliver staple proteins to millions of people.

We believe that by empowering our people, motivating 

and equipping them with the necessary knowledge 

and skills helped the Group address challenges. As 

the future of food production and food security lies in 

the hands of the younger generation, it is an ongoing 

commitment for Japfa to inspire the next generation 

to take up farming and agriculture, and adopt new 

technology to increase efficiency and reduce waste.  

We witnessed the nimbleness and adaptability of 

our people in response to the impact from Covid-19. 

Changes were promptly effected to protect our staff 

and to take full advantage of technology to minimise 

work disruption, collaborate remotely and engage 

stakeholders across several geographies. Operational 

changes included the immediate freezing of non-

essential capital expenditure in markets experiencing 

a demand drop for our products. These operational 

limitations did not deter us but instead, spurred us on 

to be more innovative and productive. 

Our successful performance in FY2020 is a testament 

to these efforts. Despite the Covid-19, Japfa delivered 

a solid bottom-line, with a 63.3% increase in Core 

PATMI without Forex¹  to US$195.4 million compared 

to US$119.7 million in FY2019. Our diversification 

strategy across proteins and markets, where we 

produce locally for local consumption, has proved 

effective in cushioning market challenges including 

the pandemic.

The resilience of our business model was only made 

possible with the relentless commitment from our 

people. I believe that by producing nutritious protein 

sustainably, we can bring long term value for future 

generations while doing good for the environment 

and our society.

I thank you, our people and all our stakeholders, for 

your support and am excited to see how Japfa will 

evolve over the next 50 years.

Foreword from Our

Sustainability Committee

Living through one of the worst public health crisis 

in history has made many of us re-examine our long 

term priorities and values. The pandemic exposed 

vulnerabilities in both human and corporate life, 

highlighting the importance of sustainability to ensure 

resilience into the future.

Sustainability requires us to go beyond traditional 

thinking of being purely profit-driven and to take into 

consideration global responsibilities and stakeholders. 

At Japfa, we strive to embrace ESG aspects as part of 

everyday decision-making so as to achieve long-term 

value for the Group and our stakeholders. We have 

established strong sustainability pillars to guide us 

on this journey and we will continue to review and 

improve on our efforts to Feed Emerging Asia, while 

nurturing sustainable, growth orientated relationships 

with all our stakeholders.

The completion of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 

our Indonesian poultry operations, that commenced 

in 2019, was one of the most significant milestones 

in our sustainability journey. It provides the metrics 

for our sustainability pillars and science-based 

information for decision making. The quantitative 

analysis from our environmental LCA provides insights 

into environmental hotspots and to focus our ongoing 

efforts on water and wastewater management, waste 

minimisation and resource efficiency.

Clean water is essential to a healthy life. Today the 

world is facing a water crisis where many people do not 

get enough fresh drinking water and water for washing. 

As a business that uses water to feed its animals and 

for its operations, we have a responsibility to minimise 

our water use as well as to properly manage animal 

waste and wastewater emissions.

In addition to the environmental LCA, Japfa is 

participating as a road tester in the Social LCA 

Project initiated by the United Nations Environment 

Programme Life Cycle Initiative and Social LC Alliance. 

Japfa’s project aim is to assess the livelihood of our 

contract farmers and measure the social contribution. 

Throughout the years, we have been supporting our 

farmers through technical assistance to promote 

animal welfare and the adoption of good farming 

practices, all of which should ultimately enhance 

their well-being. Japfa is the only company from the 

food and agricultural sector and from the Southeast 

Asian region that is included as a road-tester in this 

UN programme.

We take this opportunity to thank all sustainability 

champions for their continuing efforts in implementing 

our on-going initiatives. As we take the next steps 

on this sustainability journey, we are  pleased how 

everyone throughout Japfa has shown their support.  

Our aim is to instill sustainability through initiatives 

that go beyond compliance and to take the lead in 

sustainability within the agri-food space.

About Our Theme

SDG

R

esilience is the theme for our 2020 Sustainability Report. People 

around the globe are fighting to adapt and overcome the adversity of 

the Covid-19 pandemic. The same spirit in Japfa helped us to continue our 

commitment to produce safe and affordable staple proteins for emerging 

Asia, where over 40% of the total world’s population live. 

As the outbreak spread to different countries at different times, our 

diversification across 5 proteins in 5 countries has helped us to cope with 

the pandemic. We operate an integrated business model that provides 

greater traceability, security and safety by emphasising domestic 

production for local consumption. This allows us to continue to deliver 

high-quality proteins from “farm to table” while managing our impacts 

on stakeholders and the ecosystem, and to operate sustainably.

The cover of this Sustainability Report represents the formal life cycle 

assessment (“LCA”) over our poultry supply chain. This LCA provides us 

with robust information and results to better manage our impacts. The 

LCA reflects our commitment toward sustainability and aligns our vision 

of Growing Towards Mutual Prosperity with UN Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs).

Headquartered in Singapore, we employ over 40,000 

people across an integrated network of modern 

farming, processing and distribution facilities in 

Indonesia, China, Vietnam, India and Myanmar. 

We specialise in producing quality protein staples 

(poultry, beef, swine and aquaculture), dairy and 

packaged food that nourish millions of people.

Our business is vertically integrated from animal 

feed production and breeding to commercial 

farming 

and 

food 

processing. 

This 

creates 

tremendous opportunities for us to capture value 

at different points along the agri-food value chain 

while providing our customers with greater food 

security and traceability.

Today, we are one of the largest poultry producers 

in Indonesia¹ and we have successfully replicated 

integrated industrialised business model for 

poultry operations in India, Vietnam and Myanmar 

and for swine in Vietnam.  We leverage on the high 

quality of our raw materials to produce premium 

and mass-market consumer branded food products 

under leading brands such as So Good in Indonesia. 

We are one of the leading producers of premium 

raw milk in China, with one of the highest milk 

yields and nutritional standards in the market.

With the growth in protein consumption in emerging 

Asia expected to continue, we forge ahead with our 

strategy across multiple protein segments in the 

major high growth markets of emerging Asia where 

Japfa operates.



About

Our Company

We pride ourselves on our 

ability to produce high-quality 

products through our large scale 

vertically integrated operations 

by implementing advanced 

technologies and best farm 

management practices.

In line with our purpose of Feeding Emerging Asia, 

Japfa’s growth strategy is to diversify and expand 

across multiple protein segments in multiple 

emerging markets in Asia, building a portfolio of 

uncorrelated revenue and profit streams. We focus 

on staple animal proteins: poultry, swine, beef, 

aquaculture and dairy. Our strategy is based on 

capturing the high growth potential for protein 

consumption in five key markets namely Indonesia, 

Vietnam, Myanmar, India and China, which together 

account for more than 40% of the world’s total 

population.

Prudent Growth

We drive expansion by replicating our integrated 

industrialised business model, which covers the value 

chain of protein production: from animal feed and 

breeding to fattening and consumer products. We 

leverage our strength in feed, which is the backbone 

of our business, as well as our core competencies in 

large scale operations, technology, animal health, 

standardisation and replication. We build solid 

breeding pyramids through a scientific approach 

and leverage our strong farming mentality, strict 

biosecurity protocols and operational expertise to 

consistently produce high-quality proteins.

Tbk 

operates our animal protein operations 

in Indonesia, our 54.5% - owned¹ 

subsidiary.

Under 

this 

business 

segment, 

we 

produce quality animal proteins, namely 

poultry, beef and aquaculture, branded 

package food, and we are also a large-

scale producer of specially formulated 

animal feed. We partner with world-

leading genetics companies to breed 

high performance parent livestock in 

modern farm facilities using advanced 

management systems.

In 2020, PT Japfa Tbk acquired PT So 

Good Food (“SGF”) to strategically 

expand its downstream business through 

the increased capacity of its processed 

meat facilities and also enhancing 

marketing and direct sales of processed 

food products to consumers.

Animal Protein - 

PT Japfa Tbk

As the second largest integrated industrialised 

farming company in Indonesia², we produce 

quality animal feed for our own poultry 

operations and also for sale to third parties. We 

also provide other quality poultry products, 

including high performance Day-Old-Chicks 

(“DOCs”) through our collaboration with 

Aviagen and animal health products such as 

vaccines.

Tapping on our strong expertise in agri-food 

production, we are a pioneer in protein based 

processed food in Indonesia. Our downstream 

consumer food products are manufactured 

mainly using our own animal proteins as raw 

materials, which ensures consistency in the 

food safety, quality and reliability. As  such, 

our ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook processed 

food products under the So Good and So Nice 

brands are widely enjoyed by families across

We have published our Sustainability Report 

annually since 2017. Our last report was published 

on 9 April 2020 and covered poultry and aquaculture 

operations. This is our fourth report, covering the 

period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. Similar 

to our 2019 Sustainability Report, the scope of the 

current report is poultry and aquaculture operations.

The Sustainability Report is produced to communicate 

our sustainability efforts and strategies and acts 

as our internal audit and assessment system. This 

report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI 

Standards: Core option. GRI’s Food Processing Sector 

Guidelines are also used for our sector disclosure 

requirements. GRI stands for Global Reporting 

Initiative, an international independent standard 

organisation that helps businesses, governments and 

other organisations understand and communicate 

their impacts on issues such as climate change, 

human rights and corruption. Disclosures figures 

are available in the relevant sections to improve 

readability and the GRI Content Index, which is a list 

of disclosures is provided at the end of this report.

Quantitative data provided in this report were 

collected through our Japfa Sustainability Reporting 

System (“JSRS”). After JSRS was successfully 

implemented in Indonesia in 2019, we rolled out the 

system in Vietnam, Myanmar and India in 2020.

It is important to note that although in November 

2020, PT Japfa Tbk acquired PT So Good Food (“SGF”) 

under its poultry operations, however, specific 

environmental and social data presented in this 

report do not yet include data from SGF operations as 

it is still in the process of data integration. To support 

Japfa’s commitment to the improvement of water 

wastewater treatment at our poultry operations in 

Indonesia, only SGF data on wastewater is included in 

this report. [GRI 102-49]

This report is published in English and is available for 

download on our official website. We welcome any 

input and feedback from our stakeholders. We also 

accept enquiries, recommendations and reviews, 

as well as requests for information through written 

submissions sent to the Company Secretary at our 

headquarters [GRI 102-3, GRI 102-53]:

Japfa  Ltd |  Sustainability Report 2020


In preparing this report, we applied the 10 reporting 

principles based on the GRI Standards to define the 

content and quality of the report. The four reporting 

principles that must be met when defining the content 

of the report are stakeholder inclusiveness, the context 

of sustainability, materiality and completeness. The 

quality of the report is determined by the remaining 

six principles, which are accuracy, balance, clarity, 

comparability, reliability and timeliness. 

To understand what matters most to our Group, we 

started by listening to both our internal and external 

stakeholders. We held an internal meeting between 

the Sustainability Committee, Sustainability Sub- 

Committee, and management to start identifying the 

materiality topics for the report. This was followed 

by focus group meetings and a materiality survey 

to stakeholders. Finally, we compiled the meeting 

and survey results, and used quantitative analysis 

to construct the materiality matrix and define the 

material topics for our report. As the report was 

prepared in the midst of the pandemic, all activities 

were conducted through online platforms.

Similar to previous years, poultry remains the 

focus of our report, being the largest protein 

business. Although the poultry operations produce 

insignificant amounts of environmental footprint 

per unit product, their large scale and sales volumes 

make them the main contributor of environmental 

impact  for the Group, compared to other protein 

operations. We have gained a greater understanding 

of our environmental impact since implementing 

the Life Cycle Assessment (“LCA”) for our poultry 

products from 2019 to 2020. The information about 

our LCA can be found in Chapter 3.

Key Priorities and 

Topic Boundaries

GRI 102-44, GRI 102-46, GRI 102-47

In this report, we also focused on the progress in 

our aquaculture operations to communicate our 

journey towards sustainable aquaculture practices. 

Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production 

industry in the world. The rapid expansion of the 

global aquaculture industry has raised society’s 

awareness on the impacts of the industry on wild 

fish populations, marine habitats, water quality and 

society. As we work to feed emerging Asia, we aim 

to be a sustainable provider of quality and trusted 

aquaculture products, while at the same time 

protecting the environment, in line with our mission 

of Growing Towards Mutual Prosperity.

Although this report was constructed amid the 

Covid-19 pandemic with movement restrictions, 

we managed to engage our stakeholders via digital 

platforms, to identify what topics are material 

for them. There were 282 internal and external 

stakeholders who participated in our materiality 

survey, resulting in 10 material topics that were the 

focus in this report.  

The materiality topics were then linked to GRI 

Standards. Each topic was designated within our 

supply chain and given its own set of boundaries. The 

topic boundaries describe where the impacts occur  for 

a material topic and Japfa’s involvement. Japfa could 

be directly involved through the Group’s own activities 

or indirectly through its business relations with other 

entities. The impacts are classified into: caused by, 

contributed by, and linked to activities through a 

business relationship. These topic boundaries provide 

insights for risk assessment and implementing a 

precautionary approach for the business.

10 Material Topics and Boundaries

• Caused by 

: The cause of the topic which has direct control to avoid or mitigate impacts

• Contributed by : Contributor to the topic, have influence but no direct control to avoid or mitigate impacts

• Linked to 

: Related to the causes and/or contributor of the topic due to business relationships, 

thus only has indirect influence to avoid or mitigate impacts

= Caused by

= Contributed by

ustainability is a journey for us. Sustainability 

has been ingrained in our operations since the 

founding of our Group. As we provide affordable 

essential proteins, we continually strive to improve 

the efficiency of our production system, in accordance 

with our sustainability pillars. In 2019 we commenced 

a Life Cycle Assessment to quantify and understand 

the impact of our products and operations on the 

environment and improve what really matters.

Interpretation

LCA Framework:

We 

started 

monitoring 

and 

reporting 

our 

sustainability practices in 2017. In the following 

year, we established the Sustainability Committee 

to spearhead our efforts. We also developed 

sustainability strategies and pillars which guide 

the sustainability practices in our operations. 

To enhance the data collection and quality, we 

developed an internal platform, Japfa Sustainability 

Reporting System (“JSRS”), in 2019. The JSRS not 

only helps us to effectively collect data throughout 

our operations, but also monitors and improves our 

sustainability effort. We implemented JSRS initially 

in Indonesia and in 2020 it was fully applied across 

our operations.

We continue to show our strong commitment 

toward sustainability through green initiatives, 

innovations, communication and quantification 

of the impact of our operations and products. We 

believe that having an efficient production system 

means that we are able to manage our resources 

and minimise the environmental impact, in line with 

the Sustainable Development Goal 12: Responsible 

Consumption and Production. To collect science-

based 

information 

for 

decision-making, 

we 

commenced a Life Cycle Assessment (“LCA”) 

screening in 2019. LCA is a robust methodology 

based on ISO 14040/44:2006 to quantify the inputs 

and outputs of our product system and its potential 

environmental impacts throughout its life cycle.

To date, the poultry industry in Indonesia is 

not required to conduct an LCA by government 

regulations. However, as part of our commitment 

to sustainability, we had taken the initiative to 

conduct an LCA.

Impact Assessment

���������

���������

We initiated the LCA for a number of our poultry 

units in Indonesia, as  the poultry segment is the 

major contributor to our revenue. The LCA covered 

the entire vertically integrated chain, from the 

production of feed to the end product, whether it is 

a live bird or raw chicken carcass. The quantitative 

analysis took into account inventory within the 

cradle-to-gate boundary from raw materials, 

energy, transportation, packaging, waste and 

emissions, which are then calculated into impact 

values of our production system [GRI 102-15]. Our 

LCA results are intended for internal analysis.

The LCA covered a number of poultry units 

representative of the life cycle  of the poultry 

operations. We aim to review and refresh the 

assessment of the environmental impact of our 

products on a periodical basis.

We are the first vertically integrated 

poultry producer in Indonesia to 

formally conduct an LCA by engaging 

an independent technical expert to 

measure the potential environmental 

impact of our products throughout  

the supply chain

Chapter 3 | Life Cycle Assessment

39 


The LCA allows us to look beyond the traditional 

approach in evaluating our processes and provides 

perspectives from environmental and even social 

aspects, in addition to the financial performance. The 

LCA screening we conducted provides preliminary 

insights on our potential environmental hotspots as 

a basis for decision-making on potential resource and 

energy efficiency, waste minimisation and process 

efficiency improvements. 

The identification of our environmental hotspots 

helped us to manage our resources effectively and 

focus on those that really matter which following our 

sustainability pillar, “Efficient Use of Resources”. We 

aim to manage our resources efficiently in line with 

the UN SDG 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and 

production patterns. 

By conducting an LCA, we are one step closer to the 

ecolabel environmental product declaration (“EPD”), 

which will enable us to provide transparent, reliable 

information to our commercial customers (e.g. hotel, 

restaurant, and catering) and to consumers. We 

believe that our initiatives will allow us not only to 

ensure the quality of our products but also foster a 

cleaner and healthier environment for our livestock 

and our surrounding communities.

During the reporting period, we complied with the 

applicable environmental laws and regulations in 

each jurisdiction. [GRI 307-1]

Water 

Management

Water is a basic, yet crucial 

resource in human life, as well 

as in our operations. As it is a 

shared resource, we are committed 

to conscientiously manage our 

water consumption through 

various initiatives to contribute 

in conserving its availability for 

future generations

Poultry

Within our poultry operations, water is mostly 

consumed by our chickens as drinking water, boiler 

water for steam production and sanitation. Although, 

our activities are generally not water intensive, it is an 

essential resource that we rely on for its availability 

and quality.

Since 2017, our feedmill in Cikande, Indonesia has 

been significantly affected by water scarcity issues. 

A water availability assessment was conducted by 

GRI 102-11, GRI 102-48, GRI 303-1, GRI 303-3, GRI 303-5

geologists and local authorities, and the results 

showed drought prone water sources. To address 

this challenge, we have been harvesting rainwater, 

instead of buying water from third parties, which 

has increased our efficiency in water consumption. 

In 2020, our water efficiency increased by 10.2%. In 

addition to this feedmill in Indonesia, this rainwater 

harvesting system has also been utilised in India and 

Vietnam.

For some of our operations, we also recycle the 

water at our wastewater treatment plants, mainly for 

domestic purposes or cooling water. This allows us to 

reduce freshwater consumption.

Other than drought, water scarcity could also be 

caused by bad water quality e.g. high total dissolved 

solids and high levels of bacteria. In such cases, we 

treat the water before use to meet the standard of 

quality for our production. This is important as we 

have to ensure animal welfare and food safety.

Aquaculture

In Indonesia, polluted waterways are our main 

challenge, especially in relation to aquaculture 

operations. To mitigate this potential impact, we 

replaced chlorine and disinfectant in the water 

purification system at our shrimp hatcheries with 

an ozone water treatment system. To maintain 

the supply of good quality freshwater, we create a 

customised water pretreatment process, adjusted to 

the water conditions in each of our units. In our Anyer 

unit, we use Polyaluminium Chloride (PAC) to treat 

the water intake.

We continuously explore opportunities in other units 

for better water management initiatives. To carefully 

monitor our water management, our internal Japfa 

Sustainability Reporting System (“JSRS”) plays an 

important role. Through the monitoring of water 

scarcity, we can continuously assess the water 

availability and water quality in our operations. 

• Installing rainwater harvesting system, 

specifically in operations within water 

stressed areas, e.g. poultry feed unit 

(Indonesia and India), two poultry 

commercial farms (Vietnam)

• Installing water flow meters for accurate 

monitoring

• Utilising nipple drinking systems in poultry 

farms

• Utilising advanced water treatment 

technology to improve water quality

• Recycling water using reverse osmosis 

system, Recirculating Aquaculture System 

(“RAS”) and Semi-RAS

• Establishing water use guidelines for both 

production and domestic use

• Educating contract farmers on the efficient

Energy Management

In 2020, we successfully reduced our coal consumption 

by nearly half from the previous year. This means that 

99% of our poultry and aquaculture operations are run 

coal-free. Some units still use coal due to lack of access 

to alternative energy sources. 

During the reporting period, we increased the utilisation 

of cleaner energy sources including natural gas, and 

those that were renewable i.e. biomass and solar. In 

Myanmar Poultry, battery-free solar panel systems were 

installed in two commercial farms at Nyaung Napin and 

Phugyi which supply energy during the day. The system 

reduced our electricity consumption in the units up to 

32%. Similarly, in Vietnam Poultry, seven rental farms 

were powered by solar panels which contributed to 40% 

of its energy.  We are assessing the feasibility of rolling 

out the system to other units.

Apart from switching energy sources to improve 

efficiency, our efforts include replacing old machineries, 

installing inverters and implementing strict operating 

procedures. 



Movement restrictions during Covid-19 pandemic 

spurred us to be more efficient. We focused on 

increasing efficiency across our production units and 

offices. As much as possible, meetings were held online 

which reduced travelling, thereby increasing the 

efficiency of fuel use while also decreasing emissions. 

We constantly improve how

we operate as we strive for a better

efficiency to maximise results

while minimising unnecessary

outflow of resources.

Japfa  Ltd |  Sustainability Report 2020


We calculate the amount of potential GHG emissions 

using SimaPro software and IPCC 100a method, based 

on our energy consumption.

We also initiated a facility optimisation process in India 

to eliminate unnecessary facilities. We transformed 

one of our breeding farms into a commercial farm that 

improved our productivity.

Improving Resource Efficiency while Reducing Emissions

In India Poultry, we created a small integrated cluster, 

where we located a feedmill, breeding farms and 

commercial owned farms in one geographical area within 

a 50 to 100 km radius. This improved our productivity 

in the country, by reducing the distance and duration 

of transportation. This contributed to our lower fuel 

consumption as well as emissions from transport.

Greenhouse Gases (GHG) Emissions

Environmentally Friendly Refrigerant

In our poultry cold storage unit of Tbk Poultry in 

Mojokerto, we changed the source of our refrigerant 

from the conventional one that uses CFCs to ammonia 

and carbon dioxide. These two substances are 

considered more environmentally friendly as these 

natural refrigerants require lower energy consumption. 

They did not only improve our energy efficiency but 

also reduced the emissions of our ozone-depleting 

substances.

Dust Management

Fine particles or dust from the raw materials in feedmills 

are easily released into the air if they are not handled 

with a proper system, which may harm not only the 

workers but also the environment. In our feedmills, we 

use a dust collector technology that prevents the dust 

from escaping to the air. The dust collected is usually 

distributed to a third party to be utilised for other 

purposes that make our waste useable. 

In the feedmills of Poultry Myanmar, we also surrounded 

our operation area with bamboo and eucalyptus trees 

to prevent any leak of particulates to the surrounding 

community. These trees are able to strongly regulate 

atmospheric dust through capture or retention. We plan 

to apply this initiative in other units since it provides 

huge benefits with less investment.

Responsible 

Waste Management

Our waste management includes products 

modification, waste sorting and utilisation 

where we aim to reduce harm to the 

environment, whilst creating value from 

the waste we produce

Waste Utilisation

Through waste sorting, we aim to maximise our 

reuse and recycling efforts to minimise the waste 

we released to the landfill. This approach allows us 

to generate value from the waste we produce in the 

course of our operations. 

As an animal proteins producer, the solid waste we 

produce are mostly from the livestock, including 

manure and carrion. During the reporting period, 

this category of waste accounted for over 90% of our 

total waste, of which approximately 89% was poultry 

manure alone. As manure is rich in nutrients, we 

distribute this waste to third parties, especially crop 

farmers, to be utilised as fertiliser. In general, our 

waste treatment activities include the following:

POULTRY

• Manure is utilised as fertiliser by crop farmers

GRI 301-3, GRI 306-2, GRI 306-4, GRI 307-1

• Corn dust is utilised by duck farmers for mixing 

materials to produce their livestock feed

• In cooperation with a third party, Myanmar 

Poultry utilised black soldier flies technology to 

process part of its organic waste

• Our woven plastic bag unit in Tbk Poultry 

recycles rejected woven bags by reprocessing 

them to reduce consumption of virgin material. 

AQUACULTURE

• Dead fish, bones and scales are usually processed 

by third parties into fertiliser and fish meal

• Fish heads are used by restaurants to make 

dishes

• Fish skins are used by the local community to 

make fish skin snacks

Japfa  Ltd |  Sustainability Report 2020


To reduce our waste from DOCs cardboard box 

packaging, we utilise reusable plastic boxes where 

possible. Approximately 80-90% of our hatchery 

operations packed the DOCs in the reusable 

packaging. Cardboard boxes are still used for a long-

distance travel or remote customers. 

In 2020, the hazardous waste produced within our 

poultry and aquaculture operations was less than 

1% of our total waste. In general, such waste are kept 

in our designated temporary storage before being 

transported and treated by licensed third parties.

Several units also use creative means to reduce or 

utilise the hazardous waste. For example, in one of 

Reusable Packaging &amp; Product Modification

Hazardous Waste Management

In Myanmar Poultry, reusable plastic is only used 

within internal operations at the moment. Cardboard 

boxes remain the main option for our customers 

when they pick up the DOCs themselves instead of 

being delivered.

Tbk Poultry’s commercial farm unit, we improved our 

pen washing process in the unit to reduce damage 

TL (Tube Luminescent) pen lamps which resulted in 

the reduction of hazardous waste. Another example 

is in India Poultry, where we utilised bottom ash 

from incinerators at our feedmills for levelling in 

Kharagpur unit.

Traceable

Supply Chain 

Our vertically integrated 

business model allows us to 

have traceable processes which 

are essential for a sustainable 

supply of nutritious food

Supplier Code of Conduct

Product Traceability

Our raw materials are selected through strict 

qualifications. All suppliers are subject to the Supplier 

Code of Conduct and Japfa Code of Conduct. 

In the aquaculture operations, suppliers are also 

required to comply with Best Aquaculture Practice (BAP), 

Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or International 

Fishmeal and Fish Oil Organisation (IFFO) certification. 

The certification including the following principles in 

their requirements:

• Control of escapes and use of Genetically Modified 

Organisms (GMOs)

• Sustainable fish stock

• Minimising environmental impact

• Effective fisheries management

We have 300 vans which are integrated into our 

SAP system for tracking purposes. To provide more 

transparency to our customers, we use a barcode 

system to allow traceability of our poultry from 

supplier to customer. The barcode is electronically 

stored in our system and provides complete trace-

forward (plant to customer) and trace-backward 

(customer to plant) capability.

In Vietnam Poultry, since 2018 we are also enrolled in 

TE-Food Vietnam to support government initiatives 

on food traceability. The TE-Food provides the 

information of our processed chicken, from breeding 

to slaughtering processes.

Local Sourcing

In sourcing our raw materials, we always prioritise local 

suppliers within the countries we operate in. This is to 

support local businesses and also to mitigate our indirect 

impact on the environment that arises from importing 

raw materials from other countries.



In 2020, Tbk Poultry increased the percentage of raw 

materials from local sources by approximately 63%. 

Corn, our primary raw material, is entirely sourced from 

local farmers, and is non-Genetically Modified Organism 

(GMO) following the government regulation. Similarly, in 

India Poultry we also optimised local sourcing, especially 

for plant-based materials.

In Vietnam and Myanmar, it is more difficult to procure 

raw materials locally due to limited local supply. Our 

aquafeed mill operations face the same issue. To fulfil 

the requirement of essential proteins for our aquafeed 

and the limited local supply, we procure some of our raw 

materials from the global market.

Development and 

Succession Planning

We constantly encourage all our employees to upgrade 

their skills, competencies and capabilities. During 

the pandemic, we adopted new workplace learning 

strategies to replace on-site training programmes.

All employees in Japfa are given equal opportunities 

to pick up skills that will help them in their career 

progression and also prepare for retirement. We 

performed a wide range of training and career 

development programmes. In addition to standard 

training provided across the Group, some training 

programmes are developed in accordance to the 

specific conditions in the various countries.

In 2020, we conducted e-learning and e-training. In 

Myanmar, we also created learning videos on farm 

related topics to make it easier for our employees to 

visualise the real conditions at the farms. When on-

site training is required, we applied strict Covid-19 

protocols.

In Japfa, we also encourage knowledge sharing 

within our teams. Exchanging information allows 

workers to motivate each other and sparks creativity 

and innovation. Some programmes initiated by our 

Aquaculture Division include the “Lunch and Learn” 

and “NGOPI – Ngobrol Pagi” programme. These 

programmes are designed to be less formal where 

employees can share inspiring stories outside of 

work, thus the discussion could be more casual and 

improve team bonding.

Animal  

Welfare

As a leading poultry producer, one of our key success 

factors is the commitment in upholding the welfare 

of the animals we raise. Our vertically integrated 

operations from feed manufacturing, breeding and 

fattening to further processing, have allowed us to 

ensure animal welfare along the supply chain. 

Consumers today are more concerned about how their 

food is produced and sourced, including whether the 

animals were humanely treated and bred in healthy

conditions, with the belief that healthier animals 

mean safer food and better nutrition. Our traceable 

production system allows us to trace all processes 

from the material sourcing to production, and provide 

transparency across the entire operation.

Traceability across the food value chain enhances 

food security and food safety. We are committed 

to maintain the traceability of our supply chain 

and treat our animals properly by following the 

principles of five freedoms of animal welfare, so that 

we can produce happy and healthy livestock. We 

believe that by standing on these principles, we are 

able to operate efficiently and consistently provide 

affordable nutritious proteins for all. 

This is in line with the UN Sustainable Development 

Goal No. 2: End hunger, achieve food security 

and improved nutrition and promote sustainable 

agriculture, and Goal No. 12: Ensure sustainable 

consumption and production patterns.

troughs to avoid the risk of 

cross-contamination.

To protect our animals, we uphold strict biosecurity 

policies and practices to prevent pests and infectious 

diseases from entering and spreading within our 

operations. Our biosecurity is measured based on 

three major components namely isolation, traffic 

control and sanitation, which are implemented along 

with good animal husbandry practices. People, goods 

and vehicles entering our premises are required to go 

through our biosecurity procedures. 

In the breeding units of our poultry and aquaculture 

operations, we apply the three-zone biosecurity

system. The system classifies a production area into 

three zones based on the level of risk:

• High disease risk (external areas)

• Medium risk

• Low risk, a highly secure area where the animals 

are located. 

In Tbk Poultry, we also conduct regular Salmonella

Indonesia (MUI) which asseses animal welfare aspects. 

Halal certifications also include requirements on 

technical aspects of veterinary public health and animal 

welfare, in addition to Islamic Law compliant practices.

In 2020, we complemented our biosecurity practices 

with Covid-19 health protocols at the workplace to 

conform with government regulation and to prevent 

disease spread in our operations, including increasing 

the frequency of sanitation practices, increasing 

disinfectant dosage for facilities cleaning and utilising 

digital technology to minimise human interactions.

We regularly vaccinate our livestock as needed, to 

boost their immune systems and to protect them 

from contagious diseases. The vaccines we use are 

produced by PT Vaksindo Satwa Nusantara (Vaksindo), 

our subsidiary under PT Japfa Tbk. Vaksindo is 

the leading poultry vaccine research producer 

in Indonesia actively doing research on endemic 

diseases in the Asian and African regions. Our vaccines 

are produced in facilities with Biosafety Level (BSL) - 

3 certification, where the production process follows 

the Good Manufacturing Practices principles and ISO 

9001:2015 requirements.

We conduct thorough research to formulate vaccines 

that are suitable for the needs of our animals. Through 

Vaksindo, we also collaborate with national and 

international institutions in Asia, Europe, Australia 

and America. We are building a science &amp; innovation 

centre to strengthen our research capabilities.

• In Myanmar, as importing vaccine from 

overseas was prohibited by the government, 

we utilised our high technology diagnostic 

laboratory to develop our own vaccine working 

together with Vaksindo

• In Vietnam, we started to implement in-ovo 

vaccination that increases animal welfare by

Through continuous research, we endeavour to 

provide the finest balanced diet that optimises the 

growth and development of animals and which also 

efficiently uses resources by reducing wastage of 

nutrients. We focus on producing competitive and 

innovative feed products that fulfil animal nutritional 

needs through an efficient production system.

By considering the digestive abilities of the animals, 

we formulate balanced feed that promotes optimal 

performance. 

To create a balanced composition, we carefully identify 

nutritional contents of our raw materials using Near 

Infrared Reflectance (NIR) technology which provides 

precise information. 

Our poultry feed and aquafeed are free from Antibiotic 

Growth Promoter (AGP) and we use alternative 

substances 

as 

substitutes. 

For 

poultry 

feed, 

substitutes include enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics, 

synbiotics, Medium Chain Fatty Acids (MSFA), essential 

oils and/or herbs. In our farms, antibiotics are only 

provided to chickens for medication as prescribed by 

veterinarians. For aquafeed, we use specific functional 

feed ingredients and additives, while for medication, 

we use natural ingredients and harmless chemical 

substances.

Our feed is produced with advanced technologies 

that follow good manufacturing practices. The 

feed is packed in woven plastic bags with clear and 

comprehensive labels, which comply with labelling 

regulations. The labels include information about 

ingredients, nutritional values, quality, freshness, 

direction of use and expiry date. We always 

comply with the regulations related to marketing

Housing

Poultry Houses

We apply two types of poultry houses, namely open-

house and closed-house systems, with most of our 

own facilities using the closed-house system. The 

closed-house system allows better control over the 

environment where we raise our poultry, so that we 

can maintain a favourable, comfortable, and stable 

environment for the poultry. Our comprehensive 

ventilation system includes automated rotating fans 

to maintain high air quality as well as appropriate 

humidity and consistent temperature and eliminate 

stress from our chickens caused by either poor 

ventilation or unpleasant natural factors that 

influence the thermal quality in the house. A proper 

thermal quality will prevent bacteria from growing, 

thus also protecting our poultry from diseases.  

Whether on land or in the water, 

we commit to always provide 

comfortable and safe living 

conditions for our animals that 

fulfil the five freedoms of animal 

welfare. We continuously improve 

our housing systems to enhance 

comfort and cleanliness.

GRI 301-3, FP13

5.1

Animal Welfare

In Vietnam and Myanmar, we use custom heaters to 

accommodate temperatures and climate conditions 

following changes in seasons.

For both open- and closed-houses, we ensure an 

adequate poultry stocking density that allows them 

to roam freely. We also provide sufficient feeders and 

drinkers, and space them appropriately following 

the stocking density. To prevent contamination on 

drinking water, we use a nipple watering system, 

which also prevents wet manure and wasted water.

Japfa  Ltd |  Sustainability Report 2020


Aquaculture Ponds

Water quality is essential in aquaculture as it can 

affect the health and growth of the fish and shrimp. 

One of our breakthroughs to maintain water quality 

is through feed innovation. We successfully produced 

aquafeed with the optimum digestibility rate of 

nitrogen and phosphorus, thus reducing the release 

of nutrient wastage into the water which affects water 

quality. This approach is especially important for our 

tilapia ponds which are located in Lake Toba to ensure 

a balanced ecosystem in the lake.



Our shrimp ponds are mostly located at the seaside, 

where the conditions of water sources vary. To fulfil 

the water requirements for our shrimps, we treat 

the water before it is used in the ponds. Through a 

comprehensive check, including microbiology testing, 

we ensure the water is safe for our shrimps.

We closely monitor the physical and chemical 

conditions of the water in our aquatic ecosystem to 

maintain the optimum range of our aquaculture needs. 

Controlling water quality is a practical approach to 

reduce stress and prevent diseases, which results in 

better performance.

Slatted flooring is the preferred system used in our 

poultry houses to avoid birds stepping on their 

manure, hence reducing the risk of infection. To 

minimise contamination, in Vietnam we also reduced 

human intervention inside the breeding house by 

utilising automatic nest systems.

In India, as part of our precautionary approach in 

response to the country’s extreme weather conditions, 

we enhanced our farm management and adopted 

advanced technologies that included: 

• Integrated automation system for farm 

management

• Installation of automatic inlet or window

• Conversion from conventional fans to inverter 

controller fans

• Conversion from manual to automatic pan feeders

Handling and Traceable 

Distribution

Appropriate animal handling is conducted throughout 

our entire operations. This practice is well-supported 

by our vertically integrated business model which 

enables traceability and comprehensive monitoring. 

Starting from the receipt of grandparent Day-Old-

Chicks (“DOC”) or broodstock, to growing period, 

distribution and slaughtering process, we strive 

to handle our animals with care, so that they are 

protected from any injuries while freely expressing 

their natural behaviours.

Safe Handling and Traceable 

Distribution

In the breeding stage of our poultry operations, the 

selected best genetic DOCs are handled with care. 

Together with our suppliers, we ensure they are 

free from hunger and thirst, as well as get optimal 

comfort enroute to farms. Our breeding units in 

Indonesia have been certified with Avian Influenza 

(AI) - free zones. Stringent biosecurity practices are 

implemented at all breeding units across the Group. 

The hatching process is conducted hygienically 

with modern technology which avoids excessive 

handling, thus maintaining the quality of the DOC.

We perform beak trimming to our parent stock 

DOC using infrared laser, to anticipate the natural

pecking behaviour of poultry that generally leads to 

cannibalism, mortality and high stress levels among 

them. A trimmed beak also facilitates better comfort 

for feeding and mating. In addition to beak trimming, 

we carefully manage the male and female ratio inside 

poultry houses to prevent cannibalism.

Our final stock DOC are packed either in reusable 

plastic boxes or cardboard boxes for long distance 

remote destinations. During the distribution to 

commercial farms, our DOCs are transported using 

specialised chick vans. Each van is equipped with an 

air conditioning system, thermometer and GPS that 

allow for a real-time monitoring of the well-being of 

the poultry during the delivery process.

Since 2015, the government of Ho Chi Minh City, 

Vietnam, implemented a farm-to-retail traceable 

supply chain system “TE-Food” to combat food-

bourne disease and improve food safety. Japfa 

Vietnam participated in this government initiative 

since 2018. 100% of our rental farms in South Vietnam 

are certified and granted food safety licenses. This 

high-tech programme enables traceability across the 

supply chain through the QR Code on the packaging 

of our products.

Japfa  Ltd |  Sustainability Report 2020


The handling process in our aquaculture operations 

depends on thorough monitoring from pre-spread 

until harvesting. Through the advancement of 

technology, we developed our own applications 

namely Quality Control Shrimp Hatchery Accurate 

Rapid Programme (QC Sharp) and TKT mobile. These 

applications help us easily monitor the cultivation 

process, including the conditions of our aquaculture 

ponds such as the temperature and quality of the 

water. Thus if there is any abnormal parameters we 

will receive an early warning and can act immediately. 

Growth, feed consumed and performance are also 

well monitored through these apps. 

The processes both in poultry and 

aquaculture ensure food safety 

through hygienic handling and 

strict biosecurity, certified with 

Food Safety System Certificate 

(FSSC) 22000 4.1. 

All our slaughterhouses and 

processing units for both poultry 

and aquaculture in Indonesia are 

Halal certified by the Indonesian 

Ulema Council (MUI) that also 

covers animal welfare practice 

Our QC Sharp application is comprehensive and 

integrated with the other systems which create 

synergy across our operations. Data on water quality 

and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing for 

the shrimp health check are also recorded in this 

application. 

The technology we applied together with our good 

farming practices, advances our commitment to 

promote sustainable aquaculture. We are honoured 

that our efforts are recognised through certifications 

such as Best Aquaculture Practice and Aquaculture 

Stewardship Council Certification.

In our poultry operations, most of our live birds are 

sold to various agents, distributors, and traditional 

markets, while a small portion is further processed 

in slaughterhouses and processing facilities that we 

closely manage. In the processing units, we follow 

ethical and humane methods in the slaughtering 

process by minimising  the pain and stress of our 

animals. Before slaughtering, we stun the chicken to 

free them from unnecessary pain. The slaughtering 

process can be only done by well-trained workers. 

Processed chickens are then packaged and distributed 

in cold chain.

Our aquaculture operations operate its own 

processing, cold storage and value added product 

facilities for tilapia fish in Janggir Leto North Sumatra.

After harvest, the fish are transported live to our own 

cold storage and processing facility located near Lake 

Toba. We use modern equipment and processes such 

as tunnel congelation to maintain optimal freshness 

of our goods. This integrated production structure 

allows us to meet the requirements of best practice in 

traceability and food safety for domestic and global 

food service companies.

and economic returns. We remain committed to 

enhance the sustainable supply of nutritious proteins, 

while contributing to UN SDG 1: End poverty in all its 

forms everywhere, and UN SDG 8: Promote sustained, 

inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and 

productive employment and decent work for all.

2020 was a challenging year for all 

of us, especially small farmers, as 

demand decreased due to Covid-19 

movement restrictions. This difficult 

time highlighted the importance 

of Japfa’s presence among these 

farmers to help them cope with the 

new situation, thus maintaining 

their contribution to food security.

GRI 413-1

In the commercial farm business units, apart from 

operating our company-owned commercial farms, we 

also work with contract farmers under a profit sharing 

programme. The terminology and arrangement of 

the programme in each country may differ, hence we 

use “Contract Farmer” as the generic term to address 

these farmers. In Indonesia, contract farmer refer to 

farmers under partnership arrangement (kemitraan) 

with Japfa.

Integrated Commercial 

Poultry Farm

Most farmers in the regions where we operate 

experienced losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Therefore, we encouraged our contract farmers to 

stay resilient together with us through our integration 

approach. Pioneered by Tbk Poultry, this long-

established approach has proved to help farmers 

maintain financial stability during times of market 

uncertainty in Indonesia. In 2020, we started a 

similar approach with different schemes in Myanmar 

and India. It is called Joint-Venture Partnership 

Programme (JV) in Myanmar, and Integration Contract 

Farm in India.

Despite the challenges arising from the pandemic, 

we remain closely engaged with our farmers and 

help them to continue conducting good agricultural 

practices for better productivity and efficiency.

In poultry operations, we provide technical expertise 

to facilitate our poultry contract farmers in Indonesia 

to upgrade their farms from open- to closed-house 

systems. The closed-house system allows farmers 

to provide greater comfort for their animals through 

a well-controlled environment, which results in 

healthier chickens and improved productivity. We 

provided consultation during the transition process.

For the aquaculture farmers, in 2020 we started 

to provide them with spatial data from the 

Within the programme Japfa supplies farmers with 

DOCs, feed as well as technical assistance, while the 

farmers provide the manpower and farm buildings. 

This approach provides mutual benefits both for the 

farmers and Japfa. Farmers continue production and 

obtain income. In addition, they improve their skills 

and knowledge. In Indonesia and Myanmar, incentives 

and market rewards are also given to high performing 

farmers. For Japfa, the partnership programme allows 

us to reduce the investment costs and manpower 

management of farms, and maintain stability in the 

quantity and quality of our poultry.

Geographic Information System (GIS) to complete 

their assessment data for pond renovation or new 

locations. The spatial data helps farmers to design 

better ponds that minimise the risk of natural 

disasters such as flood and upwelling.

Beyond our contract farmers, Japfa also aims to 

empower other farmers particularly the small-scale 

ones. Through our KAVAS programme (Kawasan 

Vannamei STP or STP Vannamei Area), we provide 

technical assistance to small shrimp farmers, 

including mobile laboratory and knowledge transfer 

to improve their farming methods, either by utilising 

a better technology or feeding regime optimisation to 

promote sustainable fishery.

We provide strong technical 

assistance for both our contract 

and customer farmers through 

a programme that continuously 

monitors their operations to provide 

feedback for improvement. Our 

objective is to support and encourage 

them to improve their productivity

Knowledge Development 

and Management

We are aware that knowledge is important to support our 

farmers in implementing sustainable farming practices. 

Therefore, we proactively create activities aimed at 

building up the competencies of our farmers.

In poultry operations, we have regular internal 

technical training programmes, including those 

that are covered in Ciomas Commercial Production 

Academy in Indonesia. The academy that was 

established by the commercial farm division of Tbk 

Poultry and focuses on catering to the skill needs of 

our in-house farmers.

can facilitate knowledge sharing and discussion to 

solve local farming issues. In addition, at PT Japfa 

Tbk, we also have a joint-operation programme where 

we provide opportunities to new contract farmers 

to learn and involve directly in the implementation 

of good farming practices at our company-owned 

commercial farms, so that later on they can apply it 

on their owned farms.

O

ne way to reinforce the communities’ development 

is by improving their economic and social 

conditions. Our approach has always been focused on 

building a healthy society that we believe is fundamental 

to build a strong nation. As the Covid-19 pandemic 

struck, this became even more relevant. This year, we 

continued our commitment to contribute in community 

development, along with providing assistance for the 

communities to adapt to the new normal.

In line with our ability to provide affordable nutritious 

proteins, we believe that educating the community 

about the importance of a balanced diet can contribute 

towards ending global malnutrition, as one of the 

main causes of malnutrition lies with inappropriate 

dietary choices. In collaboration with the agents of 

change within the community such as students and 

teachers at school, we strive to educate groups in 

communities about healthy and safe eating habits 

that are tailored to their needs and local conditions.

In addition to our commitment in building a healthier 

society, we also aim to empower the community 

by unlocking and optimising their individual and 

communal potential for sustainable development. 

By sharing our expertise in the agricultural sector, 

we provide not only infrastructure support but also 

knowledge sharing.

In the light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have 

extended our support to our communities and 

assisted them, to the best of our abilities, in staying 

resilient and coping with challenges. The execution 

of our programmes during the reporting period was 

adjusted and whenever possible, we conducted 

the programmes remotely and/or virtually. We 

continuously engaged with our communities while 

still prioritising every individual’s safety.

We believe that our approach will contribute to the 

improvement of the health and well-being of the 

population, as it is key to foster social and economic 

development in the countries where we operate.

Our target is to maintain the health and safety of the communities 

around us and to think about the future development for the 

countries we operate in. Education lies at the heart of our community 

development programmes, as we believe it will drive the effectiveness 

of our programmes in the long-term

for Kids



Japfa for Kids is implemented in Indonesia and India, 

where specific programmes are tailored to the needs 

of each country. In Indonesia, the emphasis is on a 

balanced diet and healthy living behaviour. While in 

India, we focus on providing proper learning facilities, 

including the buildings and study materials.

At School

In Indonesia, our approach to cultivate clean and 

healthy living behaviour was through a nine-month 

mentoring programme to establish healthy schools 

that uphold clean habits, nutritious balanced diet and 

5S implementation. In 2020, however we adjusted our 

approach following the schools closures due to the 

Covid-19 pandemic. Instead, we focused on assisting 

teachers to adapt to remote learning methods, so that 

they can be more creative and interactive in delivering 

their online lessons.

At Health Centres

Japfa for Kids in Indonesia implemented a programme 

for health workers to raise awareness and educate 

parents on clean and healthy living. To align with 

Covid-19 protocols during the pandemic, we grouped 

parents in small clusters for these sessions.

Teaching Farms

Teaching Farms are provided for graduate researchers 

to do research on cultivation and animal health. We 

have been cooperating with Gajah Mada University 

(since 2003) and Brawijaya University (since 2013). 

In 2020, we started a collaboration with Syiah Kuala 

University. Activities within the teaching farms were 

adjusted following Covid-19 protocols.

Japfa Green School

We developed this programme to promote green 

schools through classroom learning and hands-

on practice. Our focus was on waste management 

and development of schools gardens to produce 

food ingredients. The programme was successfully 

implemented in ten elementary schools near our 

operations in Cikande and Cikupa, Indonesia. In 2020, 

we conducted the programme virtually, following the 

school closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

In the South, 54 hours of English classes were held for 

almost 90 participants in Long An and Dong Nai. In 

support of the campaign “For the future generation”, 

Binh Dinh donated four sets of computers to a high 

school and built a roof for a kindergarten while Long 

An donated 27 bicycles to the students.

In India, our commitment to promote education also 

included the construction of ZP Primary School’s 

hall and class rooms to provide children with better 

facilities that engage them in learning. We also 

constructed toilet blocks, urinals and wash basins for 

boys at New English School.

Japfa Healthy School

The Healthy School Programme is carried out by PT 

Japfa Tbk by fostering improvements in behaviour 

towards clean and safe behavior and the consumption 

of healthy nutrition in four elementary schools in 

Tambun Raya and Tigaras, Indonesia. The 9-month 

programme is carried out through a series of teacher 

skill building exercises and encouraging students to 

become role models for their peers.

Forest’s Canopy Walk

In cooperation with Brawijaya University, Japfa 

constructed a canopy walk in the conservation forest 

area managed by the university. This is to support 

activities in observing flora and fauna in the forest 

more comfortably and safely. The completed canopy 

walk is 20m long and about 15m above the ground.

Sragen Town Forest

In Indonesia, together with the local regency 

environmental services, we conducted a revitalisation 

of the Sragen urban forest in Plumbungan village. In 

2020, the programme was completed and was handed 

over to the local government in September 2020. The 

programme emphasised our belief in the importance 

of urban forests as green open spaces to maintain the 

balance of urban ecosystems.

This urban forest is integrated with our KECIK waste 

bank, thus enabling us to analyse the solid waste 

generated in the forest. See page 104 for information 

on KECIK waste bank.



Trees Planting Programme for 

the Community

Since 2017, through our subsidiary PT Japfa Tbk 

in Indonesia, we had a mangrove trees planting 

programme at Gebang Village, Lampung. The 

programme was intended to turn the village into an 

eco-tourism area. Our efforts to restore this 5,000m2 

area are still ongoing. In 2020, we added 100m of 

mangroves tracking, raising the total tracking length 

by 400m. Moreover, we released 100 mangrove crabs 

to support the ecosystem balance. 

In Myanmar, we collaborated with the Government 

for our trees planting programme spanning area of 

approximately 60 hectares. The area will be planted 

with various types of plants, including hardwood 

trees and sunflowers.

Japfa has been a dedicated patron of chess 

since 2000 when it established the Japfa 

Chess Club as part of its quest to create and 

nurture Grand Masters (“GM”) in Indonesia. 

Since then, the Club has grown into one of 

Indonesia’s most prominent and respected 

chess clubs, giving support to some of the 

most talented players in the country. One of 

Indonesia’s top players, GM Utut Adianto, is 

the current Chairman of the Club.

Working in close cooperation with the 

Indonesian Chess Federation (Percasi) for 

the past 20 years, Japfa has paved the way 

for professional chess players in Indonesia 

to hone their skills to achieve their GM titles 

and attain global renown. Japfa’s strategy is 

to promote chess in Indonesia from as early 

as elementary school through the Japfa for

Farming for the Nation  

(Bertani Untuk Negeri)

This programme focuses on improving the productivity 

of farmers and the technical skills pursued by 

university graduates. Japfa Foundation has recruited 

16 new graduates from various universities for the 

pilot programme. For the youth, Japfa Foundation 

incorporates multi-disciplinary training including soft 

skills, business management and broiler breeding 

techniques. The Foundation also equips our farmers 

with effective broiler chicken management techniques 

to improve productivity.

The younger generations is reluctant to farm and raise 

livestock, even though agriculture is “the future”. 

The demand for food is growing and the volume is 

increasing, whereas farmers are dwindling. This occurs 

globally, as it is also the case in Indonesia, therefore 

the Japfa Foundation seeks to improve nutrition, the 

quality of education and socio-economic well-being 

through agricultural farming.

In 2020, we were faced with various challenges due 

to Covid-19, especially with the implementation of 

movement restrictions. Consumer purchasing power 

in several of our markets arising was affected not only 

from the temporary closures of public places and 

hospitality industries, but also from layoffs and loss of 

incomes that caused the Gross Domestic Production 

levels (GDP) to contract. A false rumour in India that 

the Covid-19 can be spread by chickens also slashed 

poultry sales in the country. These issues changed 

people’s behaviour, which affected the consumption 

patterns.

In spite of the challenges, we remained steadfast 

in our commitment to produce safe and affordable 

staple proteins. We focused on resource efficiency 

to maintain the stability of our daily operations. As 

a staple proteins producer, we were not significantly 

impacted by the prolonged lockdowns or social 

restrictions in the areas we operate. However, we 

challenged ourselves through innovation that aim 

to restore people’s confidence to restart economic 

activities and together work towards economic 

stability.

Amid the challenges of the Covid-19 

pandemic, we focused on upholding the 

best management practices by deploying 

resources appropriately and adjusting 

our investment strategy

Procurement strategy to 

secure materials supply

Expanding Downstream 

Market

We swiftly adapted our purchasing strategy to 

anticipate the fluctuations of raw material supply. For 

example in Vietnam Poultry, we immediately stocked 

up and purchased from local suppliers in the early 

phase of the pandemic. While in Myanmar Poultry, we 

concentrated on the purchasing time as the prices of 

raw materials continuously fluctuated throughout the 

year.

One of the most important steps taken during 

the reporting period was the acquisition of PT So 

Good Food (SGF) by PT Japfa Tbk. This has further 

strengthened our synergies from upstream to 

downstream within Indonesia.

In 2020, we expanded our poultry downstream 

operations, including through opening a number 

of new meat shops in Indonesia, Vietnam and India. 

These meat shops provide easier access for consumers 

to our products, and support convenient shopping for 

fresh products despite of movement restrictions.

In aquaculture operations, we launched a brand new 

consumer seafood product line “Seafood Lovers”. 

This step was taken following the growing demand 

for frozen food and also the development of the retail 

segment.

Supporting Local Economy

The pandemic caused a slowdown in the global 

economy in 2020. To spur the recovery of economic 

activities, we pressed forward with our  efficiency 

strategy as well as encouraged our contract farmers to 

improve their farming practices, which would lead to 

enhanced performance and income. 

We also started a Joint-Venture (JV) partnership 

programme in Myanmar Poultry which is quite similar 

to the farmer partnership programme in Tbk Poultry. 

Through the programme, we had the opportunity to 

improve the competencies of local farmers through 

knowledge sharing and technical assistance based 

on our farming expertise. The JV helped boost the 

confidence of local farmers to continue their business 

despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic. 

As a part of our strategy to assist the local government 

to maintain the stability of Indonesia’s economy 

amidst the pandemic, we remained consistent in 

exporting our products.

In line with the Government’s vision to grow national 

shrimp production, Tbk Aquaculture established a 

joint venture with Hendrix Genetics in Indonesia. This 

is to build a shrimp Broodstock Multiplication Centre 

(BMC) in the country, which aims to support the 

availability of high-quality local shrimp broodstock.

Performance

Embedding sustainability efforts in our business strategy 

boosts our confidence to maintain healthy economic 

growth in the long-run. The 3P (People, Planet and Profit) 

approach helps us to ensure balance in our operations 

where we minimise harm to people and the planet while 

creating the optimum value for all stakeholders.

Risk Management

Internal Audit and Control

Japfa has an Internal Audit (IA) function to review 

and monitor operations to ensure adequacy and 

effectiveness of internal controls, adherence to the 

Company’s policies and procedures, and compliance 

with laws and regulations. 

The head of IA reports directly to Japfa’s Chief 

Executive Officer and to the Audit and Risk 

Committee (ARC) of the Board of Directors of Japfa 

Ltd. A quarterly report is prepared and presented 

to the ARC by the head of IA. Audits are selected 

and prioritised based on IA’s risk assessment 

process, which continually assesses and calibrates 

operational risks within the company.  IA Plan for 

the year and changes to the plan are approved by 

the ARC. In 2020 despite the pandemic and travel 

restrictions Japfa IA managed to perform all the ARC 

approved audits using the remote auditing process. 

There were 34 internal audits performed in 2020
