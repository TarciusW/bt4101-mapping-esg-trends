About our Report 

 

The Sustainability Report 2020 presents the annual sustainability performance of the Group which 

primarily includes the material Environmental, Social and Governance aspects of our business 

operations for the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). The Report has been 

prepared in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. The reporting boundary 

includes the Group’s operations in Singapore, Myanmar and Malaysia. The entities have been selected 

on the basis of our level of control and nature of operations; hence, the Report has excluded the 

performance data of the Group’s joint ventures.  

 

The Group have commenced its precast and prefabrication business in 2019. Correspondingly, we have 

included the precast and prefabrication business within the scope of reporting since FY2019.  

 

Data presented in this Report has been sourced directly from the operations included within the 

reporting boundary. This Report covers the material issues of the Group’s operating subsidiaries as 

shown in the section Our Sustainability Approach.  For any clarifications and suggestions related to this 

Report or Soilbuild’s sustainability initiatives, please reach out to us at sbcg_ir@soilbuild.com. 

 

The GRI Standards Content Index is included at the end of the Report. We have not obtained any 

independent assurance on the information being reported this year, but will continue to strengthen our 

reporting processes, and consider obtaining independent assurance in future.

The Group is well positioned to deliver regionally across Singapore, Malaysia and Myanmar. The Group 

recognises the importance of establishing resilient relationships with business partners and local 

authorities to keep abreast with changes in statutory and regulatory requirements in the countries we 

operate. Organisationally, the Group have invested in training and sharing sessions for employees to be 

updated with the latest regulatory changes and the potential impact these changes may have in the way 

we build. This strengthens our efforts towards mitigating any potential non-compliance with regulatory 

requirements in the course of business. We are a statutory member of Singapore Business Federation 

(“SBF”), the Singapore Green Building Council and full corporate member of Access Solution Industry 

Association (f.k.a. Access &amp; Scaffold Industry Association) (“ASIA”). The Group's internal auditors 

conduct an annual review of the effectiveness of the Group's material internal controls, including 

internal financial, operational and compliance controls.  

 

Figure 1 Key strengths and value proposition 

 

From 2020, arising from the coronavirus outbreak that has spread rapidly around the world, the 

economy of many countries, including the countries that Soilbuild operates in, have been significantly 

impacted. Stepping into 2021, we continue to face resurgent waves of COVID-19 transmissions, more 

uncertainties and further downside risks in the global economy. We expect the construction industry 

will face greater headwinds amidst resources constraints and demand for construction works in the near 

term will be challenging. Correspondingly, competition in tender for new construction contracts will 

still be stiff with tighter margins. 

 

As Soilbuild operates in a highly competitive market, we will continue to adopt a strategic approach in 

our tender bids. To strengthen our core business and enhance returns, we will focus on a) investing in 

productivity improvements, b) further developing our position in the public housing sector and c) 

strengthening our position as a key and reliable supplier for precast and prefabricated building 

components. In tandem with these efforts, Soilbuild will continue to review the overall cost structure 

and remain disciplined in capital management.

Stakeholder engagement 

 

Stakeholders are defined as groups of people or entities that are directly or indirectly influenced by our 

business operations and outcomes, or that can significantly influence our businesses. Feedback from 

our key stakeholder groups forms a crucial part of our strategic and business planning, and is viewed as 

a valuable insight for the Group to continuously improve our sustainability performance. 

 

Through internal discussion and review with external consultants, key stakeholder groups are identified 

across the entire value chain and each stage of our business life cycle. Engagements with key stakeholder 

groups are planned annually. 

 

Understanding the stakeholders’ expectations and allaying concerns is an essential part of Soilbuild’s 

sustainability approach. Through regular formal and informal engagements, we develop mutually

Materiality assessment 

 

Materiality is a critical input into our corporate sustainability strategy because it ensures we provide 

our stakeholders with the sustainability information most relevant to them and our business. To 

determine this, we conduct formal materiality assessment on a regular basis. In 2020, we have revisited 

our materiality assessments for three regions: Singapore, Myanmar and Malaysia. The assessment 

process included interviews with internal stakeholders such as employees and management and 

internal workshops, to identify the most material sustainability issues. The boundary of material topics 

is restricted to our operations in Singapore, Myanmar and Malaysia and to our business partners 

comprising contractors, subcontractors and suppliers. 

 

Soilbuild adopted a systematic four-step approach in determining the material topics for our operations.  

 

 

To illustrate degree of importance to internal and external stakeholders, the material aspects have 

been plotted on a materiality matrix. Figure below provides an overview of our material topics.

Environmental performance: resource conservation  

 

As an organisation that is committed to sustained growth and shared value creation, we adopt 

responsible practices across our supply chain. These are encapsulated in the various policies which 

govern our business practices and environment stewardship.  

 

(a) Energy efficiency and management 

 

Soilbuild believes in building a greener future and creating a friendlier environment for all our 

stakeholders by minimising the usage of natural resources and the waste in our business operations. 

We have implemented an environmental management system to identify and manage 

environmental impacts arising from our business operations. These environmental aspects are 

managed by setting targets and implementing programmes to achieve these targets. As an 

endorsement of our environmental management system, Soilbuild has obtained the ISO 

14001:2015 certification for the scope of building and civil engineering construction services, as 

well as ISO 14001:2015, ISO 45001:2018 and ISO 9001:2015 certification for design, manufacture 

and supply of precast concrete products. 

 

Soilbuild has been awarded the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) “Green and Gracious 

Builder Award” (GGBA) in recognition of its efforts in promoting environment protection and 

gracious practices during the construction phase of projects. In 2020, we continued our push for 

digitalisation and technology adoption for our projects which covers the different construction 

methods including DfMA. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is underpinning the industry’s 

digitalisation journey with Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) proving to be a necessity for 

sustainable project execution.  

 

We believe improvements in energy efficiency will enable our Company to reduce cost and improve 

overall operational efficiency. Integrating energy efficiency considerations into the design and 

construction of our assets can also help to reduce operational electricity costs of our customers.  We 

endeavour to maximise energy efficiency across all business units and at different stages in the 

building’s lifecycle. At Soilbuild we have diesel-use policy which ensures efficient use of diesel in 

operations such as in cranes, welding machine, diesel generators and air-conditioners. 

 

Examples of on-going energy initiatives include: 

 

Table 1 Energy management initiatives at Soilbuild 

 

Energy Initiatives 

✓ Start to install Solar Panel on the Group’s ICPH rooftop to generate electricity, which have been 

commissioned in Q1 2021. 

✓ Monitoring and analysing energy usage in construction sites for all projects under construction 

for any abnormality and immediate rectification 

✓ Implementing various measures to reduce energy consumption, including using energy efficient 

equipment with the Energy Star logo 

✓ Using energy efficient lightings and green label photocopiers in the site offices 

 

Soilbuild’s commitment to environmental stewardship is to minimise negative environmental 

impact as well as to constantly educate employees on sustainability. We apply the precautionary 

principle to our environment management to ensure that we minimise any impact on the 

environment and related risks to the organisation. As a growing company, we know our footprint is 

expanding, so we use strategies and practices to gain operational efficiencies, thereby reducing 

energy and water consumption, emissions and waste. At Soilbuild, employees are encouraged to 

promote energy and fuel efficiency to reduce carbon emissions.  

 

The Group’s ICPH was completed in 2018. During the design and construction phase of the ICPH, 

the Group had planned and incorporated sustainable features into the building. These measures 

and considerations include (i) the use of energy efficient LED lighting for offices, production areas 

and dormitory, (ii) double glazed glass used for all fenestration to reduce solar heat gain and 


 

 

13 

 

improved noise control, (iii) sustainable products with recycled content used during construction, 

(iv) use of energy efficient air-con system, (v) passive design considerations and environmental 

friendly products, (vi) use of water-efficient fittings and etc. The Group’s ICPH was awarded ‘Green 

Mark Award – Gold” by the BCA. 

 

 

Performance for FY2020 and Target for FY2021 

The Groups’ electrical energy consumption has increased in 2020, mainly attributable to the ramp 

up of operations of the prefabrication and precast division and in our own dormitory operations. 

Nevertheless, the Group has continuously held campaigns at various construction sites to inculcate 

and raise sustainable awareness to all employees working at the sites.  As disclosed in last year’s 

report, the Group has started to install solar panels on the ICPH rooftop to generate electricity to 

reduce the carbon footprint. The solar facility has been commissioned in Q1 2021. With the 

expected completion of our Malaysia expansion in first half of 2021, we have concurrently started 

to study the potential of installing solar panels on the factory building rooftop as well.

Figure 7 Energy – Diesel consumption (m3) by region 

Prefabrication and precast segment 

 

 

As the reduction in Diesel consumption in the construction segment was mainly due to the 

suspension of construction activities across the COVID-19 circuit breaker period, it may not be 

representative. Nevertheless, we will continue to monitor the energy consumption in all our 

construction projects.  The significant increase in diesel consumption in prefabrication and precast 

segment was attributed to increased production capacity and ramp up in the production output, we 

will continuously seek to improve on our practices to enhance energy use efficiency. 

 

(b) Water efficiency and management 

At Soilbuild we are conscious of the increasing scarcity of water and aim to further strengthen our 

water management policies. Both water quantity and quality are important aspects of water 

management. We recognise the vital role the provision of a sustainable water supply plays in 

Singapore, Malaysia and Myanmar, which is critical for our own future prosperity and development. 

 

At Soilbuild we acknowledge the significant operational benefits that arise from a strategic approach 

to water management. We monitor and manage water consumption and emphasise the need for 

water efficiency for the business but critically for the environment and society at large. Water 

efficient equipment and processes are encouraged across Soilbuild’s operations. Employees are well 

informed on the issues relating to water scarcity and are advised to reduce water consumption across 

operations. At Soilbuild, treated water is used for multiple purposes such as for cleaning 

construction sites and other activities. 

 

Table 3 Water management initiatives at Soilbuild 

 

Water Initiatives 

✓ Monitoring and analysing water usage in construction sites for all projects under construction. 

✓ Using rainwater or recycled water to wash vehicles before they leave the construction sites, and 

using recycled water for washing before casting. Water saving devices like thimbles in taps are 

also installed wherever possible in our project sites and our corporate office.  

 

Performance for FY2020 and Target for FY2021 

Total water consumption for both construction projects and prefabrication and precast operations 

was 210,402 m3 during 2020 (2019: 122,294 m3). The increase in water consumption in 2020 is

mainly due to the expansion of operations of the prefabrication and precast division. At Myanmar 

construction sites, water is extracted from tube wells, which is allowed within Yangon City 

Development Committee (“YCDC”) legislation for construction project sites with no charges. The 

measurement of water consumption was undeterminable due to lack of data. For our 2021 targets, 

we aim to reduce our water consumption across the key operational activities using innovative water 

efficiency and reduction measures. We will continue to monitor our water consumption of our 

construction projects and prefabrication and precast operations and promote water efficiency 

initiatives.

Social performance: collaborating with our 

employees and wider community 

 

We appreciate that our employees are invaluable to the success of our Group. We offer workplace 

diversity and equal opportunities to our employees. For workplace diversity, we value everyone’s 

differences. We learn from each other regardless of cultural background and bring those 

differences into the workplace to broaden experience and knowledge. Diversity includes not only 

race but gender, ethnicity, personality, age, education and background.  All employees are treated 

equally and are not disadvantaged by prejudices or bias. Performance dictates an employee’s 

qualification for promotion and rewards regardless of their race, gender, ethnicity, personality, 

age, education and background. We are committed towards cultivating a balanced work-life 

environment for all our employees, as well as to developing the new workforce in and for our 

industry. 

 

(a) 

Training and development   

 

The Group signed ‘The Pledge for a Better Built Environment Workplace” developed by the BCA 

and Construction Industry Joint Committee (“CIJC”) to signify the Group’s fundamental 

support to transform the built environment sector into a workplace of choice for our young 

talents as well as retaining existing talents within the sector. By endorsing the pledge, we are 

committed to adopt good human resource practices by providing a conducive work 

environment and better employee management.   

 

We provide training and guidance to groom employees towards realising a higher level of 

competency and safety standards, in order to enhance the quality of our services and products. 

Such training also strives to build a well-motivated and stable workforce with a high level of 

camaraderie. A key objective of training is to develop competencies which would enable our 

employees to perform their current or future jobs successfully. All our training programmes are 

geared towards the following objectives: 

 

i) 

strengthening the job skills and knowledge of employees; 

ii) 

improving operational efficiency and productivity; and 

iii) 

developing and maximising the potential of employees for the mutual benefit of both

As on 31 December 2020, total numbers of employees at Soilbuild are 716 (2019: 740). We have a 

diverse mix of employees across various age groups. The ratio of female employees in the Group is 

relatively low but this is not unusual for our industry due to the nature of the business. To build a 

more gender inclusive work environment, we aim to further improve gender diversity across various 

levels in the organisation.

At Soilbuild, potential employees will be groomed to be the next generation of leaders. Competency 

building trainings for the next level such as for project managers are provided. We develop training 

plans based on career development plan for middle management. We also provide mentoring for 

selected employees by senior staff and management as part of organisational development. Soilbuild 

also encourages and where appropriate, arranges for training courses to supplement and keep 

directors updated on areas such as accounting, financial management, legal and industry-specific 

knowledge. Soilbuild is responsible for funding the training of directors. The directors are also kept 

updated on revisions to relevant laws and regulations through presentations and workshops organised 

by the Management. The Board supports directors receiving relevant training in connection with their 

duties, particularly on relevant new laws and regulations.  

At Soilbuild, we believe in providing trainings based on need and strength assessment to all eligible 

employees. As part of our FY 2021 ESG targets, we aim to roll-out new training programme for all 

employees, as well as professional conversion programme and new leadership course for managers 

and above. 

 

(b) Talent Attraction and Retention 

 

In the current competitive landscape, talent attraction and retention remain as a key concern for 

Soilbuild. Soilbuild is committed to develop human capital for the built environment through 

various programmes. 

 

To develop a healthy pipeline of talent for the Group’s continuous business expansion, we have been 

participating in the BCA – Industry Build Environment Undergraduates Sponsorship/Scholarship 

programme to offer opportunities to potential awardees to scale up their career in the built 

environment. Sponsorships or scholarships are provided to students from NTU, NUS, 

ITE/Polytechnic as part of our talent attraction initiative. The following are the initiatives that 

Soilbuild has taken to promote people development:

We believe in keeping people motivated as it directly influences their performance. Every year 

performance assessment is conducted to guide our employees on their strengths and weakness and 

provide necessary direction to grow their career. We develop our employees to their full potential by 

offering training and staff development, a fair and equitable system, and a safe working 

environment. We will continue to provide relevant training and development courses to constantly 

equip our people with key competencies and skills so that they can perform efficiently in their current 

job functions.  

 

As part of Soilbuild’s FY 2021 targets, we will continue to implement new programmes to secure 

fresh talent into the Company. As part of our future initiatives, we will explore new participation in 

sponsorship or scholarship programme with educational institutions to bring in young and fresh 

talent into the organisation and ensure our current employees meet technical and functional 

competencies to fulfil the current and future requirements of the Group's business. The Group will 

also identify opportunities for senior employees to upskill and continue employment.

The rate of employee turnover during the reporting period was 18% and 17% (2019 : 31% and 24%) 

in Singapore and Myanmar respectively in construction segment;  and 7% and 6% (2019 : 16% and

Overall, the rate of employee turnover was 18% (2019 : 30%) in construction segment; and 9% (2019 

: 18%)  in prefabrication and precast segment during FY2020.  The turnover of employees in 

construction sector is particularly subject to the market and economic condition.  

 

In 2020, BCA accepted Soilbuild ‘s written  Engineering Capability Development (CED Journey) 

proposal which describes its goals and plan to achieve the organisational values that Soilbuild 

intends to create, as well as how it will go about doing so over the next 3 years to build up its 

construction engineering capability by the adoption of Design for Manufacturing and Assembly 

(DfMA) technologies through a detailed implementation plan. Being part of the BCA CED 

programme will enhance our ability to attract and retain talent, and also allows us to tap on certain 

CED Incentives schemes from BCA.  

 

 

(c) Occupational Health and Safety 

 

Health and safety at our workplace are of critical importance to Soilbuild. We manage Quality, 

Environment, Safety and Health effectively by establishing, implementing, and maintaining a best 

practice and process oriented integrated management system. 

 

In FY2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in additional safety measures introduced to ensure a 

safe working environment for our staff. We appointed Safe Management Officers (SMO) and Safe 

Distancing Officers (SDO) to ensure that we comply with the Ministry of Manpower regulations 

Safe Management Measures (SMM) in relation to COVID-19. The SMO will monitor the health of 

our staff and workers daily and the SDO will ensure that we keep to the safe distancing measures. 

We have adequately prepared required personal protection equipment and medical equipment (like 

thermometers, hand sanitisers, gloves, and surgical masks) at both our offices and worksites.  

 

During this period, we conducted a comprehensive safety risk assessment and briefed all staff and 

workers on the SMM. We ensured strict compliance and enforcement. In particular, we have 

fulfilled the SMM introduced under the COVID-Safe Restart Criteria under the BCA. Some of these 

SMM include, safe distancing, bi-weekly testing of workers at worksites, segregation of workers

between different worksites and dedicated transport for workers. We are constantly monitoring the 

evolving COVID-19 situation and keeping abreast of updates by the relevant authorities 

 

Besides the additional measures for COVID-19, we have put in place comprehensive safety 

measures to provide a safe and healthy working environment for all our staff. Our safety committee 

is responsible for ensuring that the safety measures are adhered to. Such measures include: 

a) conducting periodic and necessary risk assessments for all our projects to identify the risks and 

gaps, and implement mitigating procedures to achieve an accident-free environment or 

minimise risks to an acceptable level; 

 

b) conducting regular safety meetings and providing sufficient management support and 

resources to plan, implement and execute safety measures in compliance with workplace health 

and safety legislations and other requirements which include directives, guidelines and 

standards prescribed by our Group; 

 

c) conducting regular tools and equipment checks; 

 

d) improving the competency of our staff and cultivating good safety habits through proper 

training, instruction and guidance and ensuring that workplace safety and health matters are 

effectively communicated to all employees; and  

 

monitoring the effectiveness of risk control measures which have been implemented and 

conducting a third-party audit or an internal review to ensure that safety measures are being 

adhered to. 

 

Soilbuild is actively promoting work safety and good environmental awareness by continuously 

upgrading the skills of our employees to increase their knowledge and efficiency in operational 

safety supervision and management. Planned events like “The Safety Time Out” are conducted 

regularly on construction sites, as well as on the precast plants. The Safety Time Out is an on-going 

event initiated by the Workplace Safety and Health Council. The key objective of this event is to 

increase awareness of the workers on individual hazards and demonstrate the consequence of poor 

housekeeping. Due to COVID-19, “The Safety Time Out” was conducted with safe distance 

measurement in place.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

During Safety Time Out, Soilbuild employees take time off from their routine operations to take 

stock and review particular work activity or system to ensure safe operations. The WSH officer 

conducts the training together with the safety team members. Firstly, the WSH officer briefs the 

workers on the reason for carrying a Safety Time Out and explains the near miss that were captured 

regularly. After which, the safety team member enacts the scenario based on the common findings. 

Through this enactment, workers’ awareness will be increased. At the same time, they become more 

conscious of their surrounding when they work.  

 

 

 

 






 

 

29 

 

Soilbuild adopts the Carrot and Stick Approach in promoting safety awareness at sites, including 

self-imposed safety time outs. The Management would take time to conduct site visits and would 

take the project team to task should there be any safety lapses. On the other hand, the Management 

would also reward project team members, suppliers and contractors should the team manage to 

maintain a good safety record during the project timeline. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Soilbuild has also implemented appropriate procedures and policies to prevent and mitigate the 

spread of communicable diseases for the corporate office, construction sites and precast plants. 

Furthermore, Soilbuild is committed to managing occupational health and safety issues. Preference 

is given to engage OHSAS 18000-certified or bizSAFE-certified vendors/ contractors. Soilbuild has 

been certified by the Workspace Safety and Health Council to have fulfilled the requirements to 

attain bizSAFE Level Star and obtained the ISO 45001 certification for the scope of building and 

civil engineering construction services; and Green Concrete FL50H 022-146-3335 and SSEN206 – 

Ready-Mixed Concrete Certification for the prefabrication and precast operations. 

 

 

 

 

Performance for FY2020 and Target for FY2021 

 

Soilbuild pays a lot of emphasis on ensuring that work environment is safe for workers. There have 

been no workplace fatalities during the reporting period (2019 : Nil). In additional, Soilbuild have 

performed better than the national’s average for Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) in FY2020. For 

2020, our Accident Severity Rate (ASR) of 82 and AFR of 2.7, compared with the national average 

of 115 (ASR) and 1.5 (AFR) respectively which was last available statistics in 2018.  

 

We aim to further strengthen our reporting on the key performance indicators relating to 

occupational health and safety of our employees. Soilbuild implements compulsory safety induction 

to educate new staff on the importance of workplace safety and risk management procedures.  

 

Soilbuild have embarked on technological route to improve the safety standards on sites. There are 

several projects in the pipeline to improve the Quality, Safety and Health standards for our people, 

our partners and our clients.  

 

Our target is to achieve accident-free person-hours for all projects that the Company operates in 

both Singapore and Myanmar markets. 

 

 

(d) Fair labour and human rights 

 

We recognise that our employees are invaluable to the success of Soilbuild and we place a high 

value on the contribution of each of our employees. We look towards nurturing familial ties among 

colleagues. while continuously reviewing policies to sustain their aspirations and concerns at the 

workplace. This includes engaging our employees so that they feel a sense of belonging to the 

Group, motivating them to take ownership of their roles and responsibilities, respecting the need 

for work-life integration, and paying attention to their well-being.  

 






 

 

30 

 

To advance our organisation and to meet the challenges in the course of our business, we believe 

in employing the right people with the right skill and experience to plan and execute projects 

competently. Our human resource strategy and programmes are developed to attract new 

workforce in our organisation and industry and to retain competent employees to entrench the 

Groups’ organisational ethos while enhancing the desired productivities in our day-to-day 

operations. We are committed to foster a conducive work environment by adhering to rules, 

regulations and guidelines issued by relevant authorities. We adopt fair employment practices, 

respect and uphold the fundamental principles for equitable treatment to all.   

 

To cultivate a strong sense of job satisfaction amongst our employees and to provide opportunities 

for employees to achieve their full potential, we conduct employee performance review annually. 

During the performance review, the performance of each employee will be assessed by their 

immediate superior by using a set of key performance indicators based on the core and functional 

competencies. The results of the performance assessment will then be discussed between the 

employee and their immediate superior, whereby the employee’s achievement and their concern, 

areas of strength and weakness, training and career advancement plan will be agreed upon and 

documented. The performance assessment will then be submitted to Senior Management for 

endorsement and will be considered in the formulation of the Group’s human resource planning. 

 

Performance for FY2020 and Target for FY2021 

 

As COVID-19 impacted and limited social interactions much of the year, we did not manage to do 

any Sports &amp; Recreation Club (“SRC”) activities. We aim to host more of such bonding activities in 

the company in 2021 when the situation allows after the abatement of the COVID-19 pandemic and 

the restriction measures are lifted. 

 

BCA launched the Green and Gracious Builder Scheme (GGBS) in February 2009. The scheme was 

introduced to raise the environmental consciousness and professionalism of builders. It is also a 

benchmark of a builder’s corporate social responsibility to the environment and the public. 

Soilbuild has consistently briefed all the employees during GGBS campaigns and carried out 

Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (3R) campaigns at all the respective project sites. 

 

 

 

In the subsequent years, we will roll out a series of health and wellness programmes for all 

employees, while actively and progressively enhancing our social responsibilities. 

 

Governance: growth with purpose 

 

In today’s management environment, integrity and ethics have become a demand of the times as well 

as a universal value for all companies. Also, as companies become more exposed and vulnerable to risk 

factors such as adopting technology advancements to improve productivity, there could be a  recurrence 

of design errors, it is critical that we continue to improve our quality management system to remain 

vigilant through in-built internal audit processes to remain competitive while  sustaining growth.

(a) Service and Product quality and safety 

 

Soilbuild strives for excellence in all aspects of our operations. This includes consistently delivering 

unmatched service and product quality to our customers, including inculcating a proactive 

approach towards managing environment, health and safety practices. Our customers rely on our 

brand and reputation for safe, high quality services and products that they can trust. We use 

international standards to ensure the quality and safety of our services and products. In this section, 

we will reflect on the periodic assessment of the health and safety impacts on our services and 

products. At Soilbuild, we seek to effectively identify, assess and treat all quality &amp; safety related 

risks associated with Soilbuild’s business activities, services and products in a responsible manner. 

 

Soilbuild takes pride and places great emphasis on the delivery quality of all projects. We strongly 

believe in delivering high standards of quality and service levels to our customers which are critical 

and fundamental to maintaining customer satisfaction. 

 

Soilbuild has established the following quality objectives: 

 

i. 

to comply while continually improving the effectiveness of the quality management system 

which satisfies all ISO 9001:2015 standard requirements, or any relevant statutory and 

regulatory, customer or other obligations to which the organisation subscribes; 

ii. 

to provide total customer satisfaction and encourage repeated patronage by consistently 

exceeding customers’ expectations with reliable quality for all services and products 

delivered; 

iii. 

to deliver projects on time and operate within the allocated budget; and 

iv. 

to consistently provide training to all staff and upgrade work processes to improve our work 

quality procedure so as to improve efficiency and reduce wastage of resources. 

 

As an endorsement of our quality management system, Soilbuild has obtained the ISO 9001:2015 

certification for the scope of building and civil engineering construction services, and for design, 

manufacture and supply of precast concrete products. The attainment of the above certification will 

strengthen our customers’ confidence in the quality of our products and services and differentiate 

us from our competitors who may have not attained such certification. 

 

Performance for FY2020 and Target for FY2021 

There have been no significant incident concerning the health and safety impacts of our products 

and services in FY2020. Soilbuild’s FY2020 target is to continue to incorporate and improve health 

and safety considerations in our construction projects, as well as in the prefabrication and precast 

operations.

(b) Ethics &amp; Anti-corruption 

 

At Soilbuild, our corporate philosophy is to conduct business in a transparent and ethical manner. 

We strongly believe that corruption and fraudulent acts are severe detrimental factors to the 

sustainability of our organisation and society.  In the course of our business, our engagement with 

customers, consultants, sub-contractors, suppliers, business partners and associates, business 

representatives and agents may expose us to the risk of corruption, fraudulent and unethical 

practises. We have established policies and procedures to prevent such practices. Our policies and 

procedures are communicated to all our employees, customers, consultants, sub-contractors, 

suppliers, business partners and associates, business representatives and agents, as we expect full 

compliance and adherence to our policies and procedures in the business dealings with our Group.  

 

We have established and formalised, as part of our human resource management, Employees’ Code 

of Ethics policy, which sets out the guidelines of acceptable codes of ethics in a workplace. These 

guidelines also include dealing with potential areas of conflict of interest between Soilbuild 

Construction Group Ltd.’s employees, associates, vendors, consultants, suppliers and sub-

contractors. As part of a yearly exercise all staff are required to read and understand the policy and 

complete the Conflict of Interest Declaration form. All employees of the Group are expected to work 

with integrity and demonstrate professionalism in their course of work by always acting in an 

honest, fair and ethical manner.  

 

The Group’s Employees’ Code of Ethics includes the following aspects: 

✓ Declaration of potential conflicts upon commencement of employment and subsequent 

yearly declaration by all employees 

✓ Managing conflicts when receiving gifts from vendors, consultants, suppliers and sub-

contractors 

✓ Entertainment 

✓ Interested person transaction and business with family and friends 

✓ Financial interest in an outside company 

✓ Fraudulent financial reporting 

✓ Asset misappropriation 

✓ Aiding and abetting 

✓ Insider trading and dealings in securities 

✓ Money laundering

The policy also covers areas such as Discrimination free and Harassment free workplace, Conflict 

of Interest, Managing Conflicts, Outside Employment, Fraud and Intellectual Property.  

Guidelines on ethical legal responsibilities are also provided under a Gift and Entertainment 

Declaration policy. The policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees, and other persons 

working for Soilbuild.  Types of gifts cover cash or cash equivalent instruments and non-cash gifts 

above a pre-determined commercial value. Depending on the type of gifts the necessary procedures 

and the need for declaration form is determined as per the policy.  

The Group have also put in place a whistle-blowing policy to provide employees, vendors, 

consultants, suppliers and sub-contractors with an avenue to raise concerns about possible 

improprieties in financial reporting or other matters, and we believe that arrangements are in place 

for the independent investigation of such matters and appropriate follow-up action. A dedicated 

email address is created for reporting suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest practices or other 

similar matters. Details of the whistle-blowing policies and arrangements have been made available 

to all employees of the Company. The policy is also provided as part of the letter of awards to all 

sub-contractors.  

 

Performance for FY2020 and Target for FY2021 

 

In FY2020, there were no cases of bribery and corruption. As part of our future initiatives, we will 

continue to review and improve our internal policy on the prevention and management of bribery 

and corruption. Our target is to provide training on all ethics and anti-corruption related policies 

and practices to 100% of our employees and ensure the Company meets high levels of standards on 

anti-corruption. 

 

With effect from 1 January 2020, Soilbuild implemented a new policy, Ethical Legal 

Responsibilities — Social Media Policy. With internet and technology widely available, it has 

become convenient for us to use social media platforms, such as WeChat, Weibo, Twitter, 

LindkedIn, YouTube and Facebook, to send and exchange information and content at any time and 

in any way. This policy outlines the corporate guidelines or principles of communicating in the 

online world.
