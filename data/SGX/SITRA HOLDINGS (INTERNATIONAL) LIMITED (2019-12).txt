SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019  

 02 

BOARD’S 

STATEMENT 

As we continued to develop our strategy over the course of 2019, a decision was made to retain Sitra 

Holdings (International) Limited (“Sitra” or the “Group”) name to account for the fact that we have always 

focused on distributing the high quality wood-based products from sustainable resources. This sustainability 

report reflects that focus, and includes relevant facts and figures pertaining to the economic, governance, 

social and environmental impacts of our work within this industry. 

The Group has on 4 October 2019 acquired 54% interest in Mapur Rocky Resort Limited, stands out as the 

key highlight. Of all the progress we made so far, with this acquisition, the Group plans to build its own first 

foray into resort and holiday homes development. Thus, adding the Group’s core business into property 

development in Bintan Island, Indonesia. Not only will it provide new quality jobs, it will also give employees

opportunities to learn new skills.

With big challenges comes great opportunity and undoubtedly there is huge potential for Sitra to bring 

innovative solutions to the market place. We have transformed and broadened our business with a platform for 

significant and sustainable growth, keeping our eye on our customer’s needs. We are committed to 

focusing on delivery and fully unlocking our potential to achieve solutions to sustainability goals. Our aim is to 

inspire with inventiveness, partner with swiftness and create new possibilities.  

Sustainability forms a foundation across the Group’s business, touching every aspect of our strategy from 

what we do to how we do it. To be truly sustainable, which I believe this is an imperative, every decision must 

be made with an eye on our future. The Company’s core business remains in distribution of wood products. 

Within this industry, there is increasing attention to sustainable forestry hence ensuring sources of raw 

material are derived from sustainable supplies is a major concern, great emphasis is placed on “FSC” 

certification which the company strives to maintain. In addition, the company is conscious about variable 

aspects, hence a focus on water and energy conservation as well as efficiency driven by experience and 

staff retention. With the business diversification into property, attention to these factors of sustainability 

will remain a key pillar of the business policy going forward. Sustainable growth is delivered through fair

and equitable bahaviour which drives talents retention, repeat customer activity and confidence amongst 

our shareholder base. Hence, it is not just about what services we offer to the market but also the way that 

we deliver them. Having considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation and determined the 

material ESG factors, the Board continues to oversee the management and monitor material ESG factors.

Moving forward, sustainability remains our top-of-mind consideration when it comes to decision making. I 

would like to thank the entire Group team for contributing to the development of this report. Sustainability will 

always remain at the heart of the Group’s business. I sincerely believe that it is key to a healthy growing 

business and will be the differentiator to carry Sitra into the long term. 

Yours Sincerely, 

CHEW HUA SENG 

Non-Executive Chairman 


CORPORATE 

PROFILE 

Sitra Holdings (International) Limited (“Sitra” or the “Company”) and its Subsidiaries (the “Group”) is an international 

distributor of high-quality wood-based products and premium lifestyle outdoor furniture. The Group markets its products 

under its proprietary Comcia, decKING and Pacific brand ranges. The Group’s products can be categorised into two main 

Groups, namely (l) high-value wood-based products such as decks and deckings systems, flooring, a full range of fences, and 

other DIY products; and (II) premium lifestyle furniture such as outdoor garden furniture, garden accessories and contract 

furnishings. 

Sitra was awarded the Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) Chain of Custody aimed towards responsible forestry management 

since 2007. The timber used to manufacture its products can be traced throughout the supply chain from the source of timber 

to the sale of Sitra’s products. The Group serves a network of over 290 corporate customers in 58 countries spanning North 

America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand and the Asia. 

With its lifestyle furniture, Sitra developed its own products and brands and have gained a following amongst customers 

in Europe. 

OUR BRANDS 

Comcia 

decKING 

Pacific 

Under the Comcia brand, we provide a wide 

variety of highvalue wood-based products 

such as decking, flooring, fencing, door and 

window components and other moulded 

products. Each category of our wood- 

based products offer different designs, 

specifications and dimensions to suit the 

varying requirements of our customers. 

As our decking products gain in momentum, 

the “decKING” brand name was developed in 

2004, to reflect our vision – that is to be a 

leader in this growing segment. 

The “Pacific” range of brands was developed 

in 2003 as we embarked on a new segment 

of businessoutdoor lifestyle furniture. The 

word, Pacific, signifies peace and the feeling 

of being at one with nature. 

On 4 October 2019, the Group acquired a 54% equity interest in Mapur Rocky Resort Limited. With this acquisition, the Group intends to make 

its first foray into resort and holiday homes development. The Group’s core businesses now include distribution of wood-based products and 

property development in Bintan, Indonesia. 

SUSTAINABLE DESIGN 

We aim to promote a message of sustainability for the future and this will also ensure longevity and sustainability in the supply of 

hardwood. In addition, the Group has put in place a Responsible Wood Purchasing Programme to ensure that timber is sourced only from 

forests engaged in responsible forest management. 

FOREST STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL (“FSC”) 

FSC is an international organization that brings people together to find solutions which promote responsible stewardship of the world’s 

forests. FSC is also set out to promote environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable management of the world’s 

forests. 

Through consultative processes, FSC sets international standards for responsible forest management. It accredits independent third party 

organisations which can certify forest managers and forest product producers to FSC standards.

ECONOMIC 

ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY 

At present, we operate in Singapore, Indonesia and 

France, with global distribution network extending to 

Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. We manage our 

operations in accordance to our sustainability principles. 

We work closely with our management and key 

operation staff to identify and consider any sustainability 

opportunities and risks that may arise. 

Sustainability trends such as climate change, 

resource scarcity and demographic changes shape the 

competitive environment in which companies like 

Sitra operate by introducing long term sustainability 

opportunities. We, therefore view our business 

performance beyond short term gains and financial 

bottomline. Our conviction is to achieve a balanced 

triple bottomline (People, Planet, Profit) that allows 

us to clearly demonstrate the key risks and 

opportunities we face, how our strategy aims to tackle 

these issues and how we link these to the global 

agenda and our contribution to the wider economy. 

Our strategy embeds sustainable practice into every 

aspects of our business, ensuring our approach 

aligns to global priorities and the part plays in a 

sustainable future for us all. 

The success of our business is highly dependent on the 

commitment of our Board of Directors, management 

and staff. Their knowledge, professional expertise and 

their job satisfaction are key to our economic 

sustainability. 

More importantly, we strive to contribute positively to 

the society through our economic presence by 

serving as Asia   Pacific’s leading wood-based 

products and lifestyle furniture and accessories 

industry globally, while maintaining good stewardship 

of the resources we manage and generating good 

shareholder values. 

Our business model focuses on cost leadership 

without compromising on product quality. We place 

our customers' interest as the highest priority. We 

seek organic growth from the existing operations as 

well as growth through acquisition of new businesses 

that can reap good returns growth. 

We strive to maintain our market position by ensuring 

we gain the trust of our customers, and continually 

build our reputation and brand name in the wood-

based 

products 

and 

lifestyle 

furniture 

and 

accessories industry in Asia Pacific. 

In today’s highly volatile business environment, Sitra 

has, 

beyond 

sustained 

earnings, 

diligently 

embraced 

prudent 

financial 

management, 

capitalised on our assets and investments, and 

remained focused on growth strategies, to enhance 

shareholder value.

GOVERNANCE 

 

COMPLIANCE WITH CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 

Why is good governance important in sustainability? 

Corporate governance is essential to embedding 

sustainability into the heart of Sitra. Corporate 

governance is about 

leadership; 

it sets the 

parameters in decision making with accountability, 

transparency, responsibility and ethical behaviour. 

Sitra’s governance practices translate the culture 

behind which decisions are taken in our Company. 

 

Our approach is to weave sustainability throughout 

our governance structures with the aim of making

regulations and the proposed resolutions will be 

reported to the Board of Directors. 

 

The Group has put in place policies and procedures 

to ensure compliance with the relevant laws and 

regulations in all the jurisdictions we operate in.  At  

 

 

a corporate level, we also ensure that we are in 

compliance, with the Listing Manual Section B Rules of 

Catalist ("Catalist Rules") of the Singapore Exchange 

Securities Trading ("SGX-ST"), Securities and Futures 

Act and Singapore Companies Act. 

 

The Company has not received any correspondences 

or notifications in relation to any non-compliance of 

legal and regulatory requirements from any government 

and regulatory agencies in FY2019. The Audit 

Committee did not receive any whistle-blowing letters 

during the year. 

 

While we seek to leverage our data to serve our 

customers responsibly, we adhere and uphold the 

Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”). We have put 

in place policies to ensure we are in compliance with 

PDPA and we respect our customers’ choices in respect 

of their personal data and the protection of our 

customers’ privacy. 

 

There is no incidence of product and service 

misinformation 

and 

labelling 

or 

marketing 

miscommunications. 

ETHICS &amp; INTEGRITY 

 

We promote an ethical and act with integrity culture 

throughout the Company and our outlets. We seek 

to conduct our business in an ethical manner and 

uphold best practices in the wood-based products 

and lifestyle furniture and accessories industry. All 

Directors, operations and management staff are 

required to fully comply with our principles set in our 

Employee Handbook and employment contract. 

The 

Employee 

Handbook 

details 

our 

expected 

standards of employee’s professional behaviour towards 

our business partners whom we have business 

dealings with, to the people in the society whom we 

serve as customers and towards each other as 

employees of the Company. Above all, we are inculcated 

with strong corporate values to act with integrity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 


GOVERNANCE 

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-FRAUD 

Sitra is committed to ethical and fair conduct, as well 

as the prohibition of corruption, including bribery and 

fraud. The Company strives to uphold these 

commitments by implementing the corporate best 

practices and adhering to the definitions and put forth 

guidelines. 

The Company believes that protecting whistleblowers 

is integral to safeguarding public interest, promoting a 

culture of accountability and integrity in both private 

and public institutions, and encouraging individuals to 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The Group recognises the importance of risk 

management and how business risks may adversely 

affect Sitra’s business performance. 

While it is the responsibility of the Audit Committee, as 

report on any corruption, misconduct and fraud. We 

believe that a person raising concerns should be 

supported and protected against reprisals. We will not 

tolerate the victimisation of an employee who has raised 

a concern, or any adverse treatment of an employee as 

a result of raising concern. A direct whistle-blowing 

channel through e-mail and letters has also been 

implemented to enable our employees to get direct 

access to our CEO. Our stakeholders also can reach 

our Chairman of Audit Committee via the same channel 

of communication.

SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY &amp; DESIGN 

Forest stewardship council 

Since 2007, Sitra has been a member of the 

Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) which is an 

international 

organisation 

that 

promotes 

responsible stewardship of the world’s forests. By 

consulting with businesses, NGOs, communities, 

workers and indigenous people, they continually 

develop and strengthen, FSC forest management 

and chain of custody standards. FSC forest 

management 

standards 

are 

developed 

at 

an 

international level, and are then adapted to individual 

countries’ 

legal, 

social, 

and 

geographical 

settings, through national standards. 

Some elements of FSC certification, for example, 

controlled wood, have standards of their own. It 

accredits 

independent 

third-party 

organisations 

which can certify forest managers and forest product 

producers to FSC standards. 

As a member of FSC, we adhere to the FSC 

standards, 

policies 

and 

procedures 

for 

forest 

management, controlled wood standards and risk 

assessments in our endeavours to play an active part in 

maintaining forest ecosystems and local communities.

GOVERNANCE 

SUPPLY CHAIN &amp; PROCUMENT PRACTICES 

As a large global business, we recognise the 

important of managing our sustainability impacts. As 

well as our own impact, our supply chain is also a vital 

element in Sitra successfully delivering to our 

stakeholders; it is important for us to extend our 

management of environmental, social and economic 

impacts to our portfolio of approved suppliers and 

strategic partnerships.  

Our supply chain constitutes mainly the suppliers for 

our wood-based products and lifestyle furniture and 

accessories for all our global clients. We have 

maintained a strong partnership with the suppliers for 

our wood-based products and lifestyle furniture and 

accessories businesses. 

We believe in transparency in our supply chain and 

seek to provide transparent insight into how we 

manage the risks and opportunities associated with 

climate change into practices. 

Our aim is to promote sustainable supply chain and 

product design for the timber furniture and accessories 

industry that will ensure the sustainability in the supply 

of hardwood. Towards our Responsible Wood 

Purchasing Programme, we committed to only source 

third party timber FSC certified suppliers.  

Our commitment to enhance our level of adoption of 

FSC products in our own mills is made in keeping with 

the FSC principle of forest stewardship. 

Since 2019, Sitra has made significant increase in the 

use of FSC products from our own Sitra’s mills. 

No. of Active Suppliers = 28 




ENVIRONMENT 

Sitra strives to embrace environmental sustainability by managing environmental conservation through 

adopting ‘Reduce’, ‘Re-use’, ‘Recycle’ and energy efficient practices. We have focused on the Singapore 

operations for our environmental reporting for the first three years.

WATER &amp; ENERGY CONSERVATION 

In Singapore, we tap on the water supply provided by 

Public Utilities Board and disposed used water into 

the public sewage system. Energy consumption 

increased  due  to  increase  business activity  during 

the year  and  management  will  continue its effort in  

monitoring this. While 

we 

take 

conscientious

efforts to conserve water and electricity, we are 

currently reviewing our utilisation rates and will 

implement 

measures 

to reduce the utilisation 

rates. 

PAPER USAGE 

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

We have launched our Go-Green initiatives across 

all our operations and corporate office. The 

implemented initiatives aim to encourage the ‘Re-

use’, ‘Recycle’ and ‘Reduce’ of papers through the 

following ways: 

•

‘Reduce’ the use of papers by sending the

printers to print on double-sides of each piece of

paper and print only when necessary.

•

‘Re-use’ single-side printed papers for non-

conﬁdential and draft documents.

We are looking into recycling all used papers, printed 

materials and collaterals. 

Proactive mitigation of the environmental impact and 

protection is deeply embedded within our business 

model, as aptly demonstrated by our waste 

management system. 

As a strong green advocate for “Reduce, Reuse and 

Recycle”, we have put in place a waste management 

process to ensure proper disposal of waste and 100% 

recycling of our wood waste for the manufacturing of 

our products. 

We have set for ourselves the mission to (1) review 

and implement new waste management processes to 

minimize wastage; and (2) to protect water bodies 

from being affected by contaminated water and 

waste discharge in the next 1-3 years. 



Target: 

We target to align and finetune on the amount of consumption and expenditure in both water and electricity with regards to 

our environmental performance in our Singapore and Indonesia operations in year 2020.
