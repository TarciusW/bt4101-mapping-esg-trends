CONTENTS

1.	We	 sought	 to	 apply	 the	 guidance	 of	

Global	 Reporting	 Initiative	 (GRI)	 index,	

G4	 Guidelines	 for	 the	 boundary	 settings,	

focusing on performance data and reporting 

on	 aspects	 which	 are	 most	 significant,	 as	

reflected	in	Mewah	Sustainability	Guidelines	

and	Mewah	Sustainable	Palm	Oil	Policy.		

2.	As	a	start,	we	have	chosen	to	concentrate	

on	 our	 Group’s	 refinery	 business	 in	

Malaysia,	which	is	the	core	business	of	the	

Group,	where	relevant	data	is	more	readily	

available.	We	expect	to	extend	the	scope	of	

reporting to cover other business segments 

and	 jurisdictions	 more	 comprehensively	

in forthcoming reports on a progressive 

basis	as	we	build	up	our	reporting	capacity.	

Ultimately,	 our	 aim	 through	 this	 report	

is	 to	 provide	 our	 stakeholders	 with	 a	

comprehensive 

understanding 

of 

the 

essence	of	our	sustainability	commitments,	

particularly	on	our	approach	in	handling	all	

relevant	material	issues	in	our	business.	

3.	To	ascertain	the	contents	of	this	report,	we	

conducted	 an	 informal	 survey	 around	 our	

stakeholders	 and	 identified	 our	 main	 risk	

areas.	We	then	started	collecting	data	and	

came	up	with	improvement	plans	so	as	to	

improve our performance year after year. 

4.	In	relation	to	our	Crude	Palm	Oil	(CPO)	and	

Crude	Palm	Kernel	Oil	(CPKO)	supply	chain,	

we	 are	 reporting	 at	 policy-level	 on	 our	

policies,	traceability	milestones	and	progress	

in	 Traceability	 to	 Mill	 (TTM)	 &amp;	 Traceability	

to	 Plantation	 (TTP).	 The	 performance	

data	will	focus	on	identifying	material	ESG	

(environmental,	social,	governance)	factors	

in	our	refinery	operations.

SUSTAINABILITY


FOCUS AREA 1: 

MINIMIZING OUR 

ENVIRONMENTAL 

FOOTPRINT

This	focus	area	covers	Mewah’s	impact	on	various	environmental	

footprints	in	terms	of	carbon	dioxide	emissions,	water	consumption	

and waste management in our manufacturing premises. 

Through	 the	 years,	 we	 proactively	 work	 to	 minimise	 our	

manufacturing	 emissions	 and	 improved	 our	 environmental	

footprint	 per	 metric-ton	 of	 product	 produced.	 We	 also	 drive	

collaboration	throughout	our	supply	chain	in	an	effort	to	reduce	

emissions	 associated	 with	 our	 raw	 materials	 processing	 till	

delivering	our	products	to	the	hands	of	our	buyers.	

The	three	identified	core	emission	areas:

1) 

Energy efficiency/ Carbon footprint

2) 

Water management/ Water footprint

3) 

Waste management/ Waste footprint 

 

The	 processing	 of	 edible	 oils	 is	 both	 complex	 and	 energy-

intensive.	Mewah’s	processing	plants	differ	in	capacity,	capability	

and	range	of	value-added	products.	This	will	bring	about	different	

environmental	footprint	in	different	facilities.	However,	we	continue	

to	relentless	drive	reduction	of	greenhouse	gas	(GHG),	water	and	

waste emissions within our own manufacturing operations. 

08

MEWAH INTERNATIONAL INC. 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017


CORE AREA 1:  

ENERGY	EFFICIENCY/	 

CARBON FOOTPRINT 

Carbon	footprint	is	defined	as	the	total	amount	

of	 greenhouse	 gas	 (GHG)	 emission	 that	

associated with our manufacturing activities. 

The standard unit of measurement for carbon 

footprint	

is	

carbon	

dioxide	

equivalents	

(CO2e).	GHG	Emissions	is	an	all-encompassing	

measurement for the carbon footprint and 

energy	efficiency	in	our	production.	

At	 Mewah,	 we	 are	 mindful	 that	 increasing	

carbon	 footprint	 is	 having	 profound	 effects	

on the environment. The rising temperature in 

our	planet	can	possibly	lead	to	rising	sea	levels	

where warmer water occupies more space 

than	cooler	water.

The primary contributing factors to GHG in 

our production sites are:

i.	

Electricity	consumption,	

ii.	

Chemicals	consumption,	

iii.	

Fuel	consumption.		

All	Mewah’s	production	sites	actively	identify	

their GHG emission sources and have a 

standard	 methodology	 to	 measure	 our	 GHG	

emissions from our production activity.  These 

numbers	 are	 compiled	 on	 a	 monthly	 basis,	

evaluated	and	projects	are	in	place	to	further	

improve	these	consumption	figures.

1.1.1 GHG EMISSIONS IN OUR PRODUCTION 

SITES

Our	 greenhouse	 gas	 emissions	 (GHG)	 index	

shows the quantity of GHGs emitted per 

metric-ton	of	product	processed	or	packed	in	

our manufacturing premises. This is measured 

in	kilograms	of	carbon	dioxide-equivalent	per	

metric	 ton	 of	 product	 (kg	 CO2e/MT).	 In	 year	

2017,	we	saw	a	minor	increase	in	the	overall	

GHG	 emission	 that	 was	 mainly	 driven	 by	

increase	in	our	production	capacity.	Our	goal	

is to reduce the carbon footprint of Mewah’s 

production sites by 10% by year 2025.

1.2.1 OUR FOCUS &amp; ACTION PLAN

We	focus	our	efforts	on	key	areas	where	our	

portfolio	and	business	scale	allow	us	to	have	

the	 biggest	 impact	 that	 offer	 the	 biggest	

opportunities for our business.

Our	 action	 plan	 in	 reducing	 our	 water	

consumption	includes:

i.	

Consistently	

assessing	

water-related	

impacts	 and	 risks	 across	 our	 supply	

chain. 

ii. 

Identify uses of water in our factories and 

set targets to reduce fresh water use.

iii.	

Continue	to	improve	conservation	efforts	

(water-saving	efforts)	at	our	factories.	

There 

was 

a 

rising 

trend 

on 

water 

consumption between the years 2013 to 2017 

in	 our	 production	 sites	 that	 primarily	 driven	

by	our	business	growth.	In	our	refinery	plants,	

proactive	 projects	 have	 been	 implemented	

to improve our water footprint. The water 

consumption	 efficiency	 has	 improved	 from	

0.39 m3/MT	product	in	year	2015	to	0.18	m3/MT	

product	in	year	2017,	through	recycling	of	water	

in	 the	 refineries.	 We	 also	 capture	 rainwater	

that	 fall	 onto	 our	 refineries	 and	 utilise	 the	

water in various parts of the factories.

At Mewah-Oils, our main focus in reducing water 

usage is through utilization of condensate water or 

condensate recovery. We are constantly working 

to increase condensate return to boiler, instead of 

disposing it to drain. Condensate is the treated hot 

water produced as saturated steam releases its heat 

energy. It’s a valuable resource that contains around 

25% of the useful energy in the original steam. By 

recovering hot condensate water, there will be water 

saving as well as energy saving as the amount of 

natural gas required for boiler fuel will reduce. An 

effective condensate recovery system is essential as 

we are working our best to improve our footprint by 

using less natural gas and consuming less water in 

our production processes.

CORE AREA 3:  

WASTE	MANAGEMENT/	 

WASTE FOOTPRINT 

Waste	management	planning	is	an	enormous	task	

that	involves	logistical	planning,	scientific	knowledge	

and	understanding	in	order	to	balance	the	impact	

on	our	environment	and	the	cost	effectiveness	of	

the process. 

We	

continue	

to	

assure	

sustainable	

waste	

management	 by	 developing	 action	 plan	 in	 all	 our	

production sites.

At	Mewah,	we	assure	sustainable	waste	management	

by	developing	action	plan	in	all	our	production	sites.

1)	

Waste	are	divided	into	4	main	categories:

Category

Type of Waste

A

General	Waste

B

Scrap Waste

C

Production Waste

D

Schedule	Waste

2)	

The	 amount	 of	 waste	 generated	 by	 each	

category is monitored and attention is brought 

to the amount generated. 

3)	

Identify	 the	 4R’ components in managing 

waste:	Reduce,	Reuse,	Recover	and	Recycle.	

i. 

Reduce:	 Focus	 to	 improve	 efficiency.	 To	

establish	 practices	 that	 are	 capable	 to	

reduce the amount of waste we generate 

to	help	the	environment.

ii. 

Reuse: 

Practice	

to	

reuse	

materials	

without	change	whether	for	the	original	

or	 a	 different	 application	 instead	 of	

throwing	 them	 away,	 or	 pass	 those	

unused	materials	on	to	others	who	could	

use them.

iii. 

Recover: To set up ways to recover the 

energy	values	contained	within	the	waste	

material.

iv. 

Recycle: Many of the things we use every 

day	 can	 be	 recycled.	 Recycled	 items	

are put through a process that makes it 

possible	 to	 create	 new	 products	 out	 of	

the	materials	from	the	old	ones.

1.3.1 RECYCLING SPENT BLEACHING EARTH

Spent	 Bleaching	 Earth	 (SBE)	 is	 the	 major	

source	 of	 waste	 generated	 from	 palm	 oil	

refining	 process.	 It	 contains	 20-25%	 of	

residual	 oil.	 	 Due	 to	 the	 high	 oil	 content	 in	

the	 Spent	 Bleaching	 Earth,	 its	 disposal	 can	

be	 considered	 an	 environmental	 hazard,	 as	

it	 is	 highly	 flammable.	 At	 Mewah,	 100%	 of	

our	 SBE	 generated	 from	 our	 refineries	 are	

recycled	 either	 as	 raw	 material	 for	 another	

manufacturer or used as biomass. 

(Note:	Bleaching	earth	is	an	adsorptive	cleansing	agent	

used	 in	 bleaching	 process	 to	 remove	 impurities	 and	

colour	pigments	in	the	CPO.)	

1.3.2 REUSING SCRAP WASTE

Reusing	 scrap	 metal	 offers	 huge	 benefits	 in	

protecting the earth and saving energy. At 

Mewah,	 100	 %	 of	 scrap	 wastes	 produced,	

including	 mild	 steel,	 tin,	 zinc,	 and	 etc.,	 are	

reused	in	our	factories	before	being	sold	for	

recycling.	This	cost-effective	practice	ensures	

that	these	natural	resources	are	fully	utilized	

before being disposed.

In our business as bulk vegetable oil exporter-cum-importer, 

pigging plays a very important role.  Since day one of our operation, 

most of our oils are moved from factory to port installation through 

pipelines for shipments; likewise most of our imports are moved 

from port installation tanks back to factory through pipelines.

Pigging ensures that our oil is transferred from one location to 

another location with minimal losses via recovery of product that 

remains in the pipeline.

Through the adoption of pigging system plus dedicated pipeline 

transfer lines, we have significantly reduced the usage of cleaning 

agents and water, which in turn had lowered the amount of waste 

water going into our effluent plant. In short, besides cost efficiency, 

the adoption of pigging system also helps towards sustainability 

and brings about a positive environment impact.

oil	 received	 into	 our	 factory,	 we	 trace	 to	

the	 exact	 location	 of	 the	 palm	 oil	 mills	 and	

the	particulars	 of	FFB	suppliers	to	 the	palm	

oil	 mills	 that	 supplying	 to	 us.	 Traceability	

data	is	necessary	as	it	allows	us	to	evaluate	

our	 suppliers’	 performance	 against	 our	

Sustainable	 Palm	 Oil	 Policy.	 At	 the	 same	

time,	 we	 are	 establishing	 engagement	 with	

our	suppliers	with	the	objectives	to	improve	

the	 sustainability	 standards	 in	 our	 supply	

chain.	 This	 is	 done	 through	 traceability

2.2.2 MEWAH’S TRACEABILITY TO MILL 

(TTM) APPROACH 

In	order	to	register	and	continuously	monitor	

all	suppliers,	we	seek	to	ensure	that	we	collect	

the	following	information.

	“Traceable	to	Mill”	CPO	must	fulfil	all	five	(5)	key	

criteria.	If	any	of	this	information	is	incomplete;	

the	 volume	 received	 from	 the	 particular	

supplier	will	be	treated	as	“untraceable”.	

The	 traceability	 score	 of	 our	 refineries	 is	

computed	in	proportions	of	the	total	volume	

The key criteria in our TTM approach are:

 

I.	

Parent	Company	Name	of	Mill	Party

II.	

Mill	Name	

III.	

Mill	Address	

IV.	

GPS	Coordinates	of	Mill	Party	

V.

It	 is	 vital	 to	 take	 note	 that	 the	 definition	 of

debate because there is no common consensus 

in the industry at present.

CORE AREA 3:  

SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT 

2.3.1 SUPPLY CHAIN ASSESSMENT TO HIGH-

RISK MILLS

We	actively	engage	our	supplier	base.	We	carry	

out	 field	 assessment	 by	 auditing	 the	 mills	

that	supply	to	our	refineries.	We	started	this	

process	 by	 first	 conducting	 field	 assessment	

at	 mills	 located	 in	 high	 risk	 areas	 based	 on	

geospatial	analysis.

The	 primary	 purposes	 of	 carrying	 out	 mill	

assessment:

1)	

To	 understand	 the	 context	 in	 the	 FFB	

supply	base	in	palm	oil	mill.	

2)	

To	work	with	suppliers	to	create	shared	

value	through	supply	chain	to	make	sure	

there	 is	 no	 major	 issue	 with	 the	 supply	

chain. 

The	 supplier	 audits	 focus	 on	 two	 major	

areas:	 Mill	 operation	 and	 Field	 assessment.	

Three basic assessment techniques used 

are: 

interview, 

spot 

observation 

and 

documentation review. 

The major audit areas during our assessment 

to	palm	oil	mill	are:

 

A.	

Chemical	 stores	 –	 Storage,	 herbicide	

mixing	

areas,	

personal	

protective	

equipment	(PPE),	ventilation	and	security.

2.3.3 MEWAH’S SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT 

PROGRAM

The	Mewah’s	Sustainable	Palm	Oil	Policy	has	

resulted	 in	 a	 greater	 engagement	 with	 our	

suppliers.	

We	aim	to	raise	the	floor	of	the	palm	oil	industry	

by	 sharing	 the	 experience,	 expertise,	 and	

knowledge	by	providing	training	and	technical	

assistance	 to	 ensure	 that	 our	 suppliers	 have	

the	 right	 skills	 and	 motivation	 to	 deliver	 our	

goals.	

We	 see	 three	 crucial	 benefits	 from	 Supplier	

Engagement Program:

i.	

Multi-stakeholders	

approach	

-	

The	

opportunity	to	socialize	our	Sustainable	

Palm	Oil	Policy	with	our	direct	suppliers.	

ii.	

A	platform	to	discuss	the	implications	and	

requirement	of	adopting	similar	policies.	

iii.	

A	 platform	 to	 create	 awareness	 of	

the market demands for the need to 

delink	 our	 palm	 oil	 supply	 chain	 from	

deforestation,	 oil	 palm	 development	 of	

peatland	and	human	rights	abuses.	

Supplier	 engagement	 is	 beyond	 traceability	

exercise.	 The	 main	 objectives	 of	 supplier	

engagement are to create awareness to our 

upstream	 suppliers,	 to	 increase	 interaction	

between	 our	 suppliers	 &amp;	 buyers,	 to	 spread	

responsible	 palm	 oil	 practices	 and	 to	 build	

up	 supplier	 capacity	 to	 adapt	 sustainability	

practices. 

In	 Year	 2017,	 we	 hosted	 two	 major	 Supplier	

Engagement	 Workshops	 in	 our	 refineries,	

Mewah-Oils	

Sdn.	

Bhd.	

and	

Mewaholeo	

Industries Sdn. Bhd. The workshops were 

well-attended	 with	 over	 80	 palm	 oil	 millers	

and more than 100 participants turning up for 

the event.

MEWAH INTERNATIONAL INC. 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017




We were delighted to have the opportunity to collaborate with our esteem 

buyer in hosting Supplier Engagement Workshop at our refineries.

These workshops bring together leading local palm oil millers, 

representatives from Malaysia Palm Oil Board (MPOB) and Malaysia Palm 

Oil Refiners Association (PORAM) and the industry Sustainability Specialist 

to a roundtable platform for Sustainability discussion, with the aim to 

positively influence the millers on adopting right approach to improve 

corporate social responsibility practices. This is no ordinary discussion; it 

is a dynamic dialogue platform between all stakeholders – to show that 

the possibility of embracing sustainable milling practices is there.

It is an awesomely great experience to see the diverse stakeholder groups 

as a whole to share knowledge, skills and expertise. We believe this is 

certainly a priceless achievement for us and our stakeholders who always 

seek to building sustainability in its supply chain.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 

The	 palm	 oil	 supply	 chain	 can	 be	 long	 and	

complex.	 Although	 we	 have	 set	 up	 action	

plan	to	carry	out	supply	chain	assessment	to	

ensure	that	our	suppliers	are	fully	commit	to

that	policy	breaches	may	go	unnoticed	given	

the	large	scale	of	our	operation	especially	for	

third-party	suppliers	that	do	not	feed	directly	

into	our	supply	chain.	

In	 June	 2016,	 we	 established	 the	 Grievance	

Procedure	 for	 the	 implementation	 of	 our	

Sustainable	 Palm	 Oil	 Policy	 with	 the	 aim	 to	

provide	 a	 transparent,	 open	 and	 inclusive	

channel	of	communication	with	stakeholders	

to	

raise	

a

the	

implementation	 of	 our	 Sustainable	 Palm	 Oil	

Policy.	This	procedure	serves	as	a	platform	for	

all	stakeholders	in	our	supply	chain	to	address	

concerns	or	complaints.	

Our	 methodology	 included	 an	 extensive	

review of the grievance raised to brainstorm

opportunities	 and	 create	 high-performance	

and	collaborative	team.	

4.3.1 RECRUITMENT

Our recruitment focus not just base on job 

skills	 but	 on	 positive	 personal	 attributes.	

Personal	 attributes	 describe	 how	 we	 do	

something,	such	as	manage	our	jobs	and	the	

behaviours	 we	 use	 such	 as	 decision	 making,	

information gathering and wider thinking.

4.3.2 

RECOGNIZING

REWARDING

We	 recognize	 every	 employee	 is	 vital	 to	 the	

growth and progress of the company. Our 

recognition and reward framework aim to 

retain	and	motivate	the	talent	needed	to	grow	

and sustain our business.

We	

constantly	

seek	

to	

establish	

clear	

communication 

between 

managers 

and 

employees	 about	 what	 they	 are	 expected	 to	

accomplish.	 The	 performance-based	 system	

is a continuous process where managers 

and	 employees	 set	 goals	 through	 annual	

tasks	 &amp;	 objectives	 (T&amp;O)	 exercise.	 The	 T&amp;O	

set	is	then	translated	into	departmental	T&amp;O	

and	 individual	 employee	 T&amp;O	 so	 that	 every	

employee	knowing	that	they	are	respected	as	

individuals	at	work	and	everyone	can	feel	the	

impact of their work.

potential	 and	 provide	 them	 with	 a	 fulfilling	

career.

CORE AREA 4:  

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY 

Mewah’s	employees	are	the	company’s	most	

important	resources.	Ensuring	the	health	and	

safety	of	our	employees	is	our	responsibility.	

We	 strive	 to	 take	 care	 of	 our	 employee’s	

safety,	physical	and	mental	health,	to	remain	

an	attractive	workplace	for	our	employee	and	

to	 make	 sure	 that	 everybody	 is	 healthy	 and	

safe.

Workplace	 safety	 is	 everybody’s	 concern.	

Every	 life	 is	 valued	 and	 precious.	 Any	 work-

related	 injury	 or	 loss	 of	 life	 is	 obviously	

unacceptable.	 To	 this,	 we	 are	 committed	 to	

engage	our	employees	for	a	conducive	working	

environment	

by	

adopting	

the	

following	

practices:

A. 

Every production site must have a system 

in	place	to	measure	the	safety	record.

 

B.	

Communication	 with	 all	 employees	 –	

Every	 production	 site	 hosts	 a	 least	 one	

health,	 safety	 and	 environment	 (HSE)	

campaign every year. 

We	ensure	that	every	incident	case	is	followed	

up	 in	 collaboration	 with	 the	 Department	

of	 Safety,	 Health	 &amp;	 Environment	 through	

identification	 of	 unsafe	 act	 and	 unsafe	

condition to reduce risk of recurrence. We 

recognize	the	significant	increase	in	our	Lost	

Time	 Injury	 Rate	 from	 year	 2016	 –	 2017	 (per	

200,000	working	hours).		This	was	largely	due	to	

recruitment of a new set of contractors in one 

of our manufacturing sites. Therefore training 

was	greatly	increased	to	bring	about	greater	

safety awareness in the factory concerned.  

We	 are	 also	 continuously	 working	 with	 our	

SHE	Managers	to	improve	system	analysis	to	

prevent these incidents from happening as 

well	as	increased	field	audits	to	ensure	that	all	

contractors	follow	the	safety	rules	which	are	

in	place.

GLOSSARY

BIOLOGICAL OXYGEN DEMAND (BOD)

The amount of oxygen used when organic matter 

undergoes	 decomposition	 by	 micro-organisms	 in	 a	

given	 water	 sample	 at	 certain	 temperature	 over	 a	

specific	time	period.	

CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENTS 

Carbon	dioxide	equivalents	(CO2e)	provide	a	universal	

standard of measurement against which the impacts of 

releasing	different	greenhouse	gases	can	be	evaluated.	

EFFLUENTS 

Water discharged from one source into a separate 

body	of	water,	such	as	the	refinery	plant	process	water.

 

FRESH FRUIT BUNCH (FFB) 

Fruit	bunch	that	harvested	from	the	oil	palm	tree.	The	

weight of the fruit bunch ranges between 10kg to 40kg 

depends	on	the	size	and	age.	

GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI) 

A	

multi-stakeholder	

standard	

for	

sustainability	

reporting,	 providing	 guidance	 on	 determining	 report	

content and indicators. 

GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) 

GHG	refers	to	gases	that	have	the	ability	to	trap	heat	

in	 the	 atmosphere	 and	 keep	 the	 planet	 warm.	 The	

primary greenhouse gases in our atmosphere are 

Carbon	Dioxide,	Methane,	Water	Vapor,	etc.	

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 

GHG	Emissions	is	an	all-encompassing	measurement	

for	the	carbon	footprint	and	energy	efficiency	in	our	

production. 

HIGH CONSERVATION VALUES (HCV)

The	concept	of	High	Conservation	Value	Forests	(HCVF)	

was	first	developed	by	the	Forest	Stewardship	Council	

(FSC)	in	1999	as	their	ninth	principle.	The	FSC	defined	

HCVF	as	forests	of	outstanding	and	critical	importance	

due	 to	 their	 environmental,	 socio-economic	 and	

cultural	biodiversity	and	landscape	value.	

HIGH CARBON STOCK (HCS) 

The	high	carbon	stock	(HCS)	approach	is	a	methodology	

to	 avoid	 deforestation	 in	 land	 development.	 The	

methodology	was	initially	developed	in	a	partnership	

between	Greenpeace,	TFT	and	Golden	Agri	Resources.	

The	approach	stratifies	the	vegetation	on	area	of	land	

into	different	classes	using	analyses	of	satellite	images	

and	 field	 plot	 measurements.	 Each	 vegetation	 class	

is	 validated	 through	 calibrating	 it	 with	 carbon	 stock	

estimates	in	the	above-ground	tree	biomass.

INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY AND CARBON 

CERTIFICATION (ISCC) 

ISCC	 is	 a	 sustainability	 certification	 system	 covering	

the	 entire	 supply	 chain	 and	 all	 kinds	 of	 bio-based	

feedstocks	and	renewables.		It	is	officially	recognized	

by the European Commission under the European 

Energy	Directive	(“RED”).	

MASS BALANCE (MB) 

The	 mass	 balance	 system	 allows	 for	 mixing	 of	 RSPO	

certified	and	non-certified	palm	oil	at	any	stage	in	the	

supply	chain	provided	that	overall	company	quantities	

are	 controlled.	 The	 mass	 balance	 model	 is	 designed	

in	 such	 way	 that	 volumes	 of	 RSPO	 certified	 product	

shipped	will	never	exceed	volume	received	by	the	end-

user. 

NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION (NGO) 

The term of NGO used in this report refer to 

grassroots	and	campaigning	organizations	focused	on	

environmental	or	social	issues.	

PEAT 

Peat	is	an	accumulation	of	partially	decayed	vegetation	

matter.	Peat	forms	in	wetlands	or	peat	lands,	variously	

called	bogs,	moors,	muskegs,	pocosin	and	peat	swamp	

forests. 

ROUNDTABLE ON SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL (RSPO) 

RSPO	 is	 a	 multi-stakeholder	 organization	 that	 unites	

stakeholders	from	7	sectors	of	the	palm	oil	industry	

including	 the	 oil	 palm	 producers,	 processors	 or	

traders,	 consumer	 goods	 manufacturers,	 retailers,	

bank,	environmental	NGO	and	social	NGO	to	develop	

and	implement	global	standards	for	sustainable	palm	

oil.	

SEGREGATION (SG) 

The	 Segregation	 supply	 chain	 model	 assures	 that	

sustainable	 palm	 oil	 from	 different	 certified	 sources	

is	kept	separate	from	ordinary/	conventional	palm	oil	

throughout	supply	chain.	

STAKEHOLDERS 

Stakeholders	 in	 this	 report	 refer	 to	 any	 group	 or	

individual	 who	 are	 affected	 by	 or	 can	 affect	 the	

company’s operations. 

SUSTAINABILITY 

A	term	expressing	a	long-term	balance	between	social,	

economic	and	environmental	objectives.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017


ABOUT  

THIS REPORT 

SCOPE OF THE REPORT

This	is	the	first	Mewah	Group’s	Sustainability	

Report,	 using	 the	 Global	 Reporting	 Initiative	

(GRI)	 G4	 guidelines.	 It	 focuses	 on	 Mewah’s	

sustainability	

strategies	

and	

practices,	

highlighting	the	economic,	environmental,	and	

social	aspects	of	the	Company’s	activities	and	

developments.	

The	 report	 covers	 all	 sustainability	 issues	

deemed	material	by	Mewah.	We	have	chosen	

to focus our reporting on our downstream 

operations as this is our core business in 

Malaysia.	 It	 provides	 an	 overview	 of	 our	

approach,	priorities	and	targets,	as	well	as	a	

baseline	 performance	 review	 in	 several	 key	

areas.	This	Report	supplement	our	2018	annual	

report that can be found on http://www.

mewahgroup.com/upload/AnnualReports/ 

The	report	brings	together	our	sustainability	

initiatives,	

including	

current	

and	

future	

direction.		It	is	intended	to	be	useful	to	all	our	

stakeholders	 –	 our	 customers,	 employees,	

shareholders,	 communities	 as	 well	 as	 being	

a	 communication	 tool	 to	 various	 interested	

parties	about	our	approach	to	the	social	and	

environmental	development.	

COMPLETENESS 

We	 have	 attempted	 to	 provide	 a	 complete	

overview of our 

operations 

within the 

established	scope.	However,	since	this	is	our	

first	 report,	 data	 availability	 and	 consistency	

across	sites	may	not	be	fully	aligned	and	may	

be subjected to corrections and restatements 

in subsequent reports. 

Data in this report covers 1 Jan – 31 Dec 2017. 

Where	 possible,	 we	 have	 sought	 to	 include	

historical	data	as	a	benchmark.	We	believe	that	

the data presented are a fair representation of 

performance,	and	have	included	detailed	notes	

in	relevant	sections	to	ensure	transparency.	

ASSURANCE 

As	 this	 is	 our	 first	 report,	 we	 have	 decided	

to	 consider	 external	 assurance	 for	 a	 later	

reporting	period	and	not	for	this	report.	We	will	

conduct a review of our processes and identify 

gaps	in	the	production	of	the	first	report.	We	

will	also	use	this	report	to	engage	stakeholders	

and understand what form of assurance they 

would	like	to	see	in	our	subsequent	reports.
