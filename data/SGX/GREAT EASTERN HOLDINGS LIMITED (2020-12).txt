US TO STAY INVESTED

SUBSEQUENTLY BENEFIT 

FROM THE STRONG MARKET 

RECOVERY DURING THE 

SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

KHOR HOCK SENG

Group Chief Executive Officer

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS

The year 2020 has been unique and eventful from 

its onset. The COVID-19 pandemic escalated very 

quickly, affecting communities and businesses 

around the world. In these unprecedented times, 

economies and healthcare systems have been 

tested, and governments around the world 

implemented movement restrictions and safe 

distancing measures to contain the virus. These 

measures triggered an economic downturn 

led by a slowdown in global activities. We saw 

sharp declines in the prices of risk assets and 

interest rates, the widening of credit spreads 

and increase in market volatility in the first half 

of 2020. 

The severe economic disruption in turn led 

to unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy 

responses. Central banks significantly eased 

monetary policies by cutting policy rates to 

historical lows. Proactive policy responses 

and the gradual reopening of major economies 

globally underpinned a synchronised economic 

recovery and an impressive rebound in risk 

assets in the second half of 2020. This recovery 

gathered momentum in the last quarter of the 

year, fuelled by the roll-out of vaccines and the 

results of the US presidential election.

The low interest rate environment has posed 

challenges to the insurance industry in managing 

the in-force balance sheet and structuring 

competitive savings/investment products for 

our customers. We have proactively reduced 

our risk exposures and conserved our capital 

for long-term investment opportunities that may 

arise. At the same time, our proactive asset-

liability management capability has allowed 

us to continue to launch attractive products to 

meet our customers’ needs. 

As a leading regional life insurer, we are mindful 

of our corporate social responsibilities. Hence, a 

key focus for us was to do our part in providing 

strong support to those impacted. Across the 

markets where we operate, we pledged funds 

totalling over S$3 million to assist our customers, 

representatives and their immediate family 

members, as well as local charities. We instituted 

GREAT 

EASTERN 

HOLDINGS 

LIMITED

programmes to defer premium payments and 

to offer flexible premium payment schemes 

to our individual and corporate customers to 

ensure that they could continue to maintain their 

insurance coverage during these challenging 

times.

Across the Group, we have accelerated 

our transformation efforts in order for us to 

continuously deliver professional financial 

advice and services to our customers. This also 

enabled us to overcome the disruptions arising 

from the controls on people movement that 

prohibited face-to-face contact with our various 

stakeholders. The digital and transformation 

initiatives that were put in place since 2018 

have helped propel our business during this 

period. We were among the first insurers in 

the region to launch a fully remote advisory 

and sales process, enabling our customers to 

seamlessly fulfil their financial planning and 

insurance needs virtually, with their advisors. 

With our bank partner OCBC Bank, there has 

been closer collaboration to better understand 

customers’ needs and improve the customer 

journey. We have further strengthened our digital 

affinity partnerships to broaden our reach into 

new customer segments. 

Overall, there was minimal impact to our service 

levels and business operations as we were able 

to effectively scale up our work-from-home 

capabilities for over 6,000 employees across 

the region.

Despite the challenging business and market 

conditions, the Group has remained resilient 

and maintained our market leadership positions 

in Singapore and Malaysia. Our investment 

portfolios have weathered the economic 

downturn well, which could be attributed to a 

well-diversified high quality asset portfolio and a 

strong risk management framework. Our strong 

balance sheet and prudent portfolio management 

capabilities have enabled us to stay invested 

and ride through this market downturn, and 

subsequently benefit from the strong market 

recovery during the second half of the year.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

In 2020, the Group delivered a strong performance 

despite the challenging business environment.  

The Group’s Total Weighted New Sales rose 

by 23% to S$1,543.7 million compared to the 

same period last year.  New Business Embedded 

Value, a measure of long-term economic 

profitability, increased by 9% to S$669.5 million, 

a reflection of our strong product proposition and 

distribution network. The Group’s operating profit 

from insurance business continued its growth 

momentum and achieved an 11% increase to 

S$730.7 million. On a full-year basis, the Group’s 

Profit Attributable to Shareholders reported a 4% 

decrease to S$960.6 million for FY2020, amid 

less favourable financial market conditions for 

the year compared to FY2019.  

Our strong performance is anchored on a strong 

risk and compliance culture, and our Board 

playing a key role in setting the governance 

standards to meet our stakeholders’ expectations. 

We operate within parameters and constraints 

that are calibrated to the Board-approved risk 

appetite, and will always uphold the highest 

standards of corporate governance, transparency 

and disclosure as we strive for excellence.

The Board has recommended the payment of a 

final one-tier tax-exempt dividend of 50 cents 

per ordinary share. Upon shareholders’ approval, 

the final dividend will be paid on 5 May 2021.  

Including the interim one-tier tax-exempt dividend 

of 10 cents per ordinary share paid in August 

2020, total dividends for the financial year 2020 

would amount to 60 cents per ordinary share.

STRENGTHENING OUR FINANCIAL 

REPRESENTATIVE NETWORK

In 2020, the Group witnessed the resilience 

of our financial representative network in 

overcoming challenges. The Great Digital 

Advantage platform, launched in 2018, was a key 

foundational capability empowering our financial 

representatives to respond nimbly to changing 

consumer behaviour, needs and expectations, 

which were elevated by this pandemic.

IN 2020, WE FOCUSED ON 

FURTHER STRENGTHENING 

OUR AFFINITY PARTNERSHIPS 

TO BROADEN OUR REACH INTO 

NEW CUSTOMER SEGMENTS. 

WE WORKED IN CLOSE 

COLLABORATION WITH OUR 

PARTNERS AND LEVERAGED 

THEIR DEEP CUSTOMER 

INSIGHTS TO CURATE 

CUSTOMISED PRODUCTS 

FOR TARGETED CUSTOMER 

SEGMENTS. 

Our fully remote advisory and sales process enabled our 

financial representatives to provide seamless financial advisory 

services to their customers and address their insurance needs 

via multiple virtual touchpoints, including our digital platforms. 

Throughout the year, we launched a suite of products which 

enabled our financial representatives to continue engaging 

with existing and new customers. By sharing an online link, 

they could recommend these products to their customers to 

self-purchase, which helped uplift their productivity.

During this period, in place of physical roadshows, events 

and seminars, we initiated a series of topical webinars for 

our financial representatives to further connect with existing 

and prospective customers. 

 

In Singapore and Malaysia, we stepped up to support careers 

in the insurance sector and grew our financial representative 

footprint. Social media platforms were essential in helping 

to promote our recruitment programmes. These initiatives 

enabled us to grow our network to over 5,000 in Singapore 

and approximately 30,000 in Malaysia.

STRENGTHENING OUR BANCASSURANCE 

CHANNEL

During the first half of the year, the pandemic caused a 

significant drop in footfall to bank branches, thus impacting 

bancassurance sales. Driven by these challenges, there was 

greater collaboration with OCBC Bank to better understand 

and evolve the customer journey, aligning our insurance 

solutions to better serve their changing needs. In our markets, 

we integrated our insurance offerings into the bank’s digital 

platforms and ecosystems to optimise performance and 

create seamless customer journeys.

To address the business impact in Singapore, OCBC Bank 

launched remote sales advisory capabilities to enable their 

sales network to serve their customers’ financial needs. They 

were able to engage their customers through digital, telesales 

and direct channels. We developed new protection, savings 

and investment-linked insurance products (ILP) to provide 

the versatility of both protection and wealth accumulation 

options to customers. 

In Malaysia, our bancassurance business remained 

consistently strong with OCBC Bank, emerging as the top 

foreign bancassurance bank. In partnership with the bank, 

we launched a legacy customer campaign to promote legacy 

products to their customers.

For Bank OCBC NISP in Indonesia, while bancassurance sales 

were slow in the first half of 2020, we saw a strong recovery 

in the second half of the year. We unveiled new protection 

and savings products to better support our partner to cater 

to their customers’ needs. We further expanded partnerships 

with new banks such as Bank Muamalat Indonesia to provide 

credit life Shariah products to their housing loan customers. 

DEEPENING OUR AFFINITY PARTNERSHIPS

In 2020, we focused on further strengthening our affinity 

partnerships to broaden our reach into new customer 

segments. We worked in close collaboration with our 

partners and leveraged their deep customer insights to 

curate customised products for targeted customer segments. 

In collaboration with telecommunications provider Singtel, 

we launched home and motor general insurance solutions 

in Singapore. With ActiveSG, we offered personal accident 

insurance to its members via its mobile app.

In Malaysia and Indonesia, we worked closely with Axiata 

Digital to design customised segment-aligned insurance 

solutions for their customers via their digital and ecosystem 

platforms. We leveraged Axiata’s digital marketing capability 

to drive awareness and deepen our digital presence on their 

platforms.

In Indonesia, we also partnered with other technology-based 

fintech and insurtech companies to provide simple and 

affordable insurance with a seamless and customer-friendly 

experience. 

GROWING OUR GENERAL AND GROUP 

INSURANCE BUSINESS

Overall, our General Insurance business demonstrated 

resilience in the region, driven by our focus on the retail 

segment, portfolio realignment and expense discipline, as 

we continued to digitalise our business, strengthen our 

distribution model and upgrade our online capabilities. We 

are putting in place a new General Insurance administrative 

system which will enable us to design innovative products, 

improve operational efficiency, and respond rapidly to market 

competition. 

In Singapore and Malaysia, we have taken action on several 

fronts towards achieving positive underwriting results and 

improving operational excellence. Our continued effort to 

pivot our business models has allowed us to focus on growing 

our retail segment. 

With the successful integration of PT Great Eastern General 

Insurance Indonesia into the Great Eastern Group, we have 

put in place our bancassurance partnership with Bank OCBC 

NISP, and strengthened our relationship with the local and 

international broking community. The focus on retail business 

and digital affinity contributed to the improvement of our top 

line growth and underwriting results. 

Our Group Insurance business delivered strong sales and 

underwriting performance in 2020. We adopted a holistic 

approach to grow our employee benefits scheme, and 

expanded our network of telemedicine providers to meet 

increased market demand for General Practitioner coverage 

and virtual consultations in the region. We further introduced 

home services for executive health screenings and influenza 

vaccinations to enrich our service offering to deliver greater 

convenience and safety to our corporate users.

ENHANCING OUR CUSTOMER PROPOSITIONS 

As a leading regional insurer, our business is grounded 

upon protecting our customers and helping them to protect 

themselves, with early financial planning, protection and 

savings solutions in place. Across the region, we enhanced 

our product propositions by launching relevant benefits and 

features to provide greater assurance for our customers.

In Singapore, in line with heightened awareness in protection 

coverage, we enhanced our investment-linked plan GREAT 

Life Advantage, with more critical illness protection riders, 

as well as retrenchment waiver benefits. Amid the pandemic, 

we launched GREAT SP, a short-term endowment plan, with 

complimentary telehealth services. Driven by the increase 

in Dengue cases, we offered GREAT MozzieSafe via online 

platforms for easy access. 

As one of the three approved private insurers to provide 

complementary private insurance plans to augment the 

government’s CareShield Life scheme, we launched GREAT 

CareShield Enhanced and GREAT CareShield Advantage 

long-term disability plans.

We are pleased and honoured to be the sole insurer appointed 

by the Central Provident Fund Board for its enhanced 

Dependants’ Protection Scheme (DPS) from 1 April 2021. 

We will now play a pivotal role in making insurance accessible 

to the working population in Singapore. We hope to be able 

to leverage our appointment to offer a suite of value-added 

services and products to DPS members.

In Malaysia, health and critical illness protection solutions 

were our focus. Following its success in Singapore in 2019, 

Great Generation Care was Malaysia’s first insurance plan 

to provide comprehensive critical illness protection for three 

generations in a family under a single plan. We also launched 

the Smart Multi Critical Care, an investment-linked rider, 

which provides comprehensive critical illness coverage and 

encompasses multi-claim features. 

For our Takaful business, we continued to enhance our product 

suite to comprehensively address customers’ needs. Our 

takaful Harapan series providing affordable life and medical 

coverage, has attracted strong demand. Progressing in our 

mission to provide more people with protection solutions 

in Malaysia, we moved into our second year as the takaful 

operator for Malaysia’s mySalam government scheme to 

deliver coverage to the lower income households (B40). 

We made strides in education and awareness through our 

kiosks at public and university hospitals, and have seen a 

marked increase in the number of policyholders benefitting 

from this scheme in 2020.

In Indonesia, we enhanced our product offerings to holistically 

address our customers’ protection and wealth management 

needs. This included MaxPrestige Heritage Protector, a 

universal life product; Super Investlink Plan 101, an ILP product 

providing additional allocations to investment funds; and 

Great Optima Link + Great Term Cover package, providing 

one of the highest protection coverage in the market.

EMBRACING CUSTOMER CENTRICITY

As part of our continuing effort to put our customers first, we 

implemented several digital solutions with the aim of providing 

greater convenience and a better overall experience for them. 

In Singapore, we launched the Great Eastern App to give our 

customers 24/7 visibility of their insurance portfolios. This 

provides them with convenience and ease of access to their 

policies anytime, and allows them to make service requests 

directly on their mobile devices. To further improve customer 

experience, we implemented corporate PayNow to provide 

premium payment options to our customers, and revamped 

our Health Connect to encourage our Integrated Shield 

customers to use our medical specialist panel. Additionally, 

we implemented the Predictive Underwriting Model for life 

and critical illness products which enabled us to serve our 

customers with greater speed and efficiency.

A new WhatsApp-based servicing channel, Great Eastern 

Mobile Assistance, was launched in Indonesia to provide our 

customers with a wider range of remote customer service 

options. In addition, a new web-based platform which allows 

for digital signatures, was introduced to facilitate greater 

convenience and security for insurance sales.

In an age where data privacy is highly valued, we want to 

provide our customers with the assurance that their personal 

data is safe with us. We demonstrated this commitment to 

data protection by becoming the first insurance company 

in Singapore to obtain both the Data Protection Trustmark 

and APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules system certifications 

for Data Privacy, endorsed by Singapore’s Infocomm Media 

Development Authority.

ENHANCING OUR TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES

In line with our growth agenda and digital transformation 

strategy, we continued to invest heavily in our technological 

capabilities. 

We implemented a Group-wide private cloud infrastructure 

which enabled us to scale quickly to support business agility 

for our online business, and respond rapidly to changing 

customer expectations and market competition. We continued 

our transformation journey to refresh our Life and General 

Insurance core systems to allow us to operate with greater 

flexibility and speed. 

We enhanced our enterprise visual analytics capability to 

improve efficiency in management reporting for better data 

insights. In addition, we continued to extend Robotics Process 

Automation to enhance our operational processes across 

the Group.

As we evolve our business operating model through 

digitalisation, we are constantly enhancing our data protection 

and cybersecurity capabilities, and implementing targeted 

controls to strengthen our defence against increased cyber 

risk. 

INVESTING IN PEOPLE

Recognising that our employees and financial representatives 

are our greatest assets, we are committed to being the 

employer of choice and providing a conducive environment 

for our people to grow together. This meant that we had to 

take immediate action to protect their well-being and help 

them adjust to new ways of working during the year. 

Staff engagement sessions took the form of virtual town 

halls and webinars to help keep our employees and financial 

representatives connected on business developments. Other 

activities organised throughout the year focused on health and 

wellness amid COVID-19. For new employees and financial 

representatives, virtual orientations were the order of the day. 

To future-proof employees for the digital economy, we 

continued to invest in people development with e-learning 

modules offered throughout the year, and held a #FutureReady 

Virtual Learning Carnival on topics including Sustainability, 

Cybersecurity and Insurtech. We outlined a Generic Skills 

and Competencies module identifying soft skills development 

to align employee behaviour with traits such as Customer 

Orientation, Accountability and Leadership.

For our financial representatives, we implemented a blended 

learning approach involving e-learning, virtual classroom 

training and webinars. To further enhance our training 

programmes, we introduced a suite of topical learning 

modules on digital platforms which they could conveniently 

access on demand.

As part of the company’s wider workplace transformation 

initiative, we piloted flexi-work arrangements and 

correspondingly explored workspace redesign. A total of 

900 employees were relocated to our redesigned office at 

Changi to foster better collaboration and innovation.

GIVING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY

Particularly in these trying times, we see the importance of 

doing our part as a responsible corporate citizen and making 

a meaningful difference. From the onset of COVID-19, we 

announced in Singapore a S$1 million COVID-19 Customer 

Care Fund to support customers and immediate family 

members impacted by the pandemic with hospitalisation 

and death benefits, and set up a COVID-19 Agency Force

care for the community, we contributed over S$500,000 under 

our Great Eastern Cares initiative to help the vulnerable, and 

supported the Malaysian government’s COVID-19 Test Fund.

To help impacted policyholders maintain insurance coverage 

despite economic pressures, our Deferment of Premium 

Payment programmes across Singapore and Malaysia helped 

over 3,400 life policyholders. We additionally supported 

our General Insurance customers impacted by business 

shutdowns with flexible premium payment schemes, while 

group corporate SME customers could pay their premiums 

via quarterly instalments.

In January 2021, we further pledged a S$1 million GREAT 

Vaccine Fund in Singapore to provide hospitalisation benefits 

for customers, employees, representatives and their immediate 

families in the event of complications arising from approved 

COVID-19 vaccinations, supporting the national vaccination 

effort.

INDUSTRY RECOGNITION

During the year, we garnered many awards and accolades. We 

reached our highest-ever brand ranking of 5th position in the 

2020 edition of Singapore’s Top 100 Most Valuable Brands, an 

annual ranking by independent consultancy Brand Finance. 

We were named Top Insurer in Singapore by CampaignAsia’s 

Asia Top 1000 Brands survey conducted by Nielsen in 2020, and 

were again 1st for the sixth year running in the Life Insurance 

Sector of the Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore 

(CSISG), conducted by the Institute of Service Excellence 

(Singapore Management University). In recognition of the 

company’s substantive progress in workplace transformation 

and skills development, we were awarded the Institute of 

Banking &amp; Finance Inspire Award in January 2021.

In Malaysia, we received the Reader’s Digest Most Trusted 

Brand for the 17th consecutive year and the BrandLaureate 

Brand of the Year Award for our Life business. Great Eastern 

was recognised as one of HR Asia’s Best Companies to Work 

for in Asia 2020 (Malaysia edition) for the 5th year running. We 

received the Most Valuable Brand Award in the BrandLaureate 

e-Branding Awards 2020 for our Takaful business. 

We won several awards in Indonesia such as the Best Insurance 

Award 2020 by Investor Magazine, and were recognised 

among the country’s Top 5 Most Admired Companies (Life 

Insurance) by Warta Ekonomi Magazine. The CEO of our Life 

business in Indonesia was awarded Outstanding Leadership 

for Corporate Strategy in Indonesia’s Most Admired CEO 

Awards 2020 by Warta Ekonomi Magazine.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES

In 2020, we sought to make sustainability central to our 

business and made significant strides on this front. Driving 

change from the top, we established a Board Sustainability 

Committee to provide oversight on Group-wide sustainability 

efforts and to reinforce our commitment to incorporating 

core principles into business operations for the long term. 

We also shaped our sustainability approach in a way that 

complements our strategic focus by establishing three primary 

objectives: (1) Transitioning to a low-carbon economy (2) 

Improving people’s lives and (3) Engaging in responsible 

business practices. 

Moving towards a low-carbon economy, we transformed 

paper-centric processes to digital and electronic platforms, 

and have formally incorporated responsible investment 

considerations into our investment process. We have further 

commenced the set-up of relevant data infrastructure and 

systems to measure carbon emissions and intensity across 

various investor accounts.

As the appointed insurer for DPS in Singapore and mySalam in 

Malaysia, we help to improve lives and close protection gaps 

by providing sustainable basic insurance. As an employer, 

our #FutureReady Framework is designed to build a skilled, 

resilient and adaptable workforce which will provide greater 

job security for our employees.

With our sustainability approach and objectives defined, 

we will continue to progressively roll out initiatives in 2021 

and beyond. We will make insurance accessible to broader 

segments of our communities through our digital platforms, 

and actively help our customers live healthier, better and longer 

through our integrated health and wellness programme. We 

will also create a nurturing and engaging work environment 

that enables our people to realise their full potential. 

We will manage the risks and opportunities arising from 

climate change and promote a low-carbon economy by 

continuing our efforts to manage the environmental footprint 

of our operations, and incorporate environmental, social and 

governance considerations in our investment portfolios. At 

the same time, we will safeguard trust and protect value for 

our stakeholders through robust governance and economic 

contributions. 

More information can be found in our Sustainability Report 

on pages 60 to 80.

CHANGES TO THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE

There have been several new and revised regulations issued in 

2020 and we have taken the necessary steps to comply with 

them. Additionally, we provided our feedback on consultation 

papers and ensured timely submission to the respective 

regulators across our markets. 

In Singapore, key regulations issued by MAS in 2020 include 

the following: 

Revised regulations on valuation and capital framework for 

insurers which set out the requirements under the risk-based 

capital (RBC 2) framework, including the way in which assets 

and liabilities are to be valued;

Revised Notice on Management of Participating Life Insurance 

Business to introduce new requirements on the allocation of 

charges and expenses to Participating Fund and the inclusion 

of a non-exhaustive list of non-chargeable expenses for 

the Par Fund. Insurers are expected to meet Policyowners’

Guidelines on Individual Accountability and Conduct (IAC 

Guidelines) which promotes a strong culture of responsibility 

and ethical behaviour of financial institutions (FIs). The IAC

will take effect from 10 September 2021;

Guidelines on Environment Risk Management for Insurers

Guidelines aim to enhance the insurance sector’s resilient 

management of environmental risk. On an annual basis, 

it is mandatory for insurers to disclose the approach in 

managing the environmental risk to their stakeholders, 

while the disclosure on potential impact of the material 

environmental risk is encouraged;

identification verification.

While we are optimistic that economic growth should be 

positive this year, we recognise that developed markets are 

showing signs of exuberance. Any new adverse developments 

with regard to the pandemic could cause markets to reverse 

course rapidly. Hence, we will continue to remain vigilant and 

adopt a prudent approach in our underwriting and investment 

operations, and proactively manage our investment portfolios. 

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We would like to record our sincere gratitude to Mr Samuel 

Tsien, who will be stepping down from the Board at the 

Company’s Annual General Meeting in April 2021. The Group 

has benefitted from his invaluable contributions and insights 

over the past nine years.

We extend a warm welcome to Mr Ng Chee Peng, who will 

be joining the Board on 1 March 2021. Mr Ng brings with 

him extensive experience in strategy formulation, change and 

system transformation, and financial management expertise. 

We look forward to his active participation on the Board.

On behalf of the Group, we thank our Board of Directors and 

the Boards of our subsidiary companies for their counsel. 

Our heartfelt appreciation goes out to our management team, 

employees, bancassurance and affinity partners, financial 

representative network, business associates and the union for 

their contribution to the business in 2020. Finally, our thanks 

goes to our shareholders and customers for your continuous 

support and confidence in Great Eastern. 

We will continue to pursue a disciplined and prudent strategy 

to grow the business across our key markets. With strong 

fundamentals in place, we remain optimistic of our long-term 

prospects and continue to strive for excellence to deliver 

shareholder value.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK AHEAD

The change in business landscape has introduced new 

opportunities for us to differentiate ourselves and grow. 

We will continue to upskill internal capabilities to leverage 

data analytics to deepen our customer insights and develop 

segment-aligned product solutions to capture market 

opportunities. 

The Great Digital Advantage platform will be further enhanced 

to empower our financial representatives with complete end-

to-end digitalisation solutions to engage, acquire and transact 

with customers throughout their life stages.

We will continue to collaborate closely with our bancassurance 

partner OCBC Bank, to evolve the sales model and product 

propositions to meet their customers’ changing behaviours 

and needs. We will further leverage our affinity partners’ 

platforms and customer bases to deepen our digital presence 

and reach new customer segments. 

Our touchpoints and capabilities will be upgraded to provide 

a seamless customer experience. We will further strengthen 

our engagement programmes and platforms to forge closer 

ties with our customers. To allow our business to respond with 

speed and agility, our technology infrastructure and digital 

capabilities will correspondingly be enhanced. 

Accelerating our transformation initiatives will enable us to 

grow and strengthen our market leadership in Singapore and 

Malaysia, while elevating our growth in Indonesia through 

product innovation and a diversified distribution network.

In 2021, we foresee that the combination of accommodative 

monetary and fiscal policy, and progress in COVID-19 vaccines 

globally, is likely to enable the global economy to recover. 

Nonetheless, while there are reasons to be optimistic, we 

are mindful of potential volatility in the year ahead given 

the knowledge now about the unprecedented ability of the 

COVID-19 virus to evolve and mutate rapidly. 

The buildout of the pandemic and its effects on the economy 

and hence corporate earnings continue to be the biggest 

risks, as uncertainty remains regarding the safety, distribution, 

and uptake of the vaccines, and their eventual impact on 

economic recovery. Emergency COVID-19 spending has 

raised the national debt burden for many governments, 

especially those in emerging markets. Any rise in interest 

rates and borrowing costs will exacerbate the fragile balance 

of the payment situation of these economies. Geopolitical 

risks and global policy uncertainty will remain elevated with 

the US-China discord.

EMBEDDED

VALUE

EMBEDDED VALUE

An actuarial embedded value is a commonly used technique 

to assess the economic value of the existing business of a 

life insurance company. Looking at a company’s distributable 

profits for a year, or even a few years, is not a reliable guide 

to its long-term economic value. This is because the timing of 

distributable profits arising from a profitable insurance policy 

may involve accounting losses in the initial policy years and 

higher accounting profits in later years that will make the 

policy profitable overall. The loss in the initial years is due 

to the initial expenses of writing new business, combined 

with the need to meet capital requirements. As a result, in 

any one year, high growth of business may tend to lower 

distributable profits. Embedded values have therefore been 

developed as a way to assess the long-term economic value 

of a life insurance company for the existing blocks of business.

The embedded value of Great Eastern Holdings Limited 

(“the Group”) has been determined using the traditional 

deterministic cash flow methodology that has been adopted 

historically for embedded value reporting, and comprises the 

sum of the value of In-Force Business and the value of the 

adjusted Shareholders’ Funds.

VALUE OF IN-FORCE BUSINESS

This represents an estimate of the economic value of 

projected distributable profits to shareholders, i.e. after-tax 

cash flows less increases in statutory reserves and capital 

requirements attributable to shareholders, from the In-Force 

Business at the valuation date, i.e. 31 December 2020. The 

cash flows represent a deterministic projection, using best 

estimate assumptions of future operating experience and 

are discounted at a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of 

a risk-adjusted discount rate, together with an allowance for 

the cost of holding statutory reserves and meeting capital 

requirements, represent the allowance for risk in the value of 

In-Force Business together with an implicit allowance for the 

cost of options and guarantees provided to policyholders. It 

should be noted that this allowance for risk is approximate and 

may not correspond precisely with the allowance determined 

using capital market consistent techniques.

In projecting the value of In-Force Business, the statutory 

reserve valuation bases and capital requirements are based 

on the Risk Based Capital framework as set out in prevailing 

local regulations for Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia as 

of 31 December 2020. 

In Singapore, the Group’s asset management company 

Lion Global Investors Ltd (“LGI”) manages a proportion 

of the Singapore Life Funds’ assets for which fees are 

payable from each Fund. In line with generally accepted 

traditional embedded valuation methodologies in respect of 

services provided by asset management companies within 

our insurance group, the present value of profits arising in 

LGI from the fees paid by Singapore Life Fund is included in 

the embedded value and new business value of the Group 

for the year ended 31 December 2020. 

ADJUSTED SHAREHOLDERS’ FUND

This represents the value of assets over and above that 

required to meet statutory reserves, capital requirements 

and other liabilities.

ASSUMPTIONS USED

The assumptions adopted for the calculations have been 

determined taking into account the recent experience of, and 

expected future outlook for, the life insurance business of the 

companies involved, i.e. The Great Eastern Life Assurance 

Company Limited (“GEL”) in Singapore, Great Eastern Life 

Assurance (Malaysia) Berhad (“GELM”) and Great Eastern 

Takaful Berhad (“GETB”) in Malaysia and PT Great Eastern 

Life Indonesia (“GELI”) in Indonesia.

Investment returns assumed are based on the long term 

strategic asset mix and their expected future returns. The 

risk-adjusted discount rate used is 6.0% for Singapore, 

7.75% for Malaysia and 12.5% for Indonesia.

EMBEDDED VALUE CALCULATION

The value of In-Force Business has been calculated for the 

life insurance business of GEL in Singapore, GELM and 

GETB in Malaysia and GELI in Indonesia, along with the 

adjusted Shareholders’ Funds for the Group. The results 

of the calculations as at 31 December 2020 are as follows:

INDEPENDENT REVIEW

The embedded value, the value of one year’s new business and the analysis of change in embedded value during the year 

were determined by the Group. PricewaterhouseCoopers Southeast Asia Consulting performed a review of the methodology 

used (based on the traditional deterministic embedded value reporting approach), the assumptions and procedures adopted, 

the materiality thresholds and limitations and performed a high level review of the results of the Group’s calculations.

BUSINESS 

REVIEW

Although we faced challenges brought about by the COVID-19 

pandemic, we continued our focus to meet customer needs 

and expectations through our insurance solutions, professional 

financial advisory and quality customer service. 

The transformation initiatives put in place since 2018 played an 

important part in helping to drive our business forward during 

this period. During 2020, we accelerated our transformation 

efforts to ensure our business operations and service levels 

continued uninterrupted. 

From the onset of the pandemic, we put together a  

S$1 million COVID-19 Customer Care Fund to help customers 

and immediate families with hospitalisation and death benefits 

if impacted. We further pledged a S$1 million GREAT Vaccine 

Fund in January 2021, to provide hospitalisation benefits 

for customers, employees and financial representatives, 

and their immediate families in the event of complications 

arising from approved vaccinations, in support of the nation’s 

vaccination effort.

In 2020, we helped over 2,000 life policyholders continue 

their policies through the Deferment of Premium Payment 

Programme announced in April. We also extended support 

to customers with our travel insurance plans and waived 

administrative fees for those forced to change their travel 

plans due to movement restrictions.

In 2020, our Singapore operations comprising 

Great Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd (GELS) and 

Great Eastern General Insurance (GEG), registered 

an overall good performance despite challenges 

during the year. 

Total Weighted New Business premiums grew 

35% to S$1,053.1 million as a result of a strong 

performance by our financial representative 

network and successful well-received product 

launches. New Business Embedded Value 

increased by 20% to S$361.1 million. Our General 

Insurance business reduced by 9% to S$150.6 

million in gross written premiums year-on-year.

To help ease financial strain for policyholders affected by 

business slowdown, we rolled out measures including a flexible 

premium payment scheme for our corporate customers. 

STRENGTHENING OUR DISTRIBUTION 

CAPABILITIES

Building on our earlier digital transformation efforts, we 

empowered our financial representatives to deliver seamless 

financial advisory services to their customers, and enabled 

them to more efficiently manage their sales activities during 

the year. 

As one of the first insurers in Singapore to introduce a fully 

remote advisory and sales process in early March, we were 

able to provide customers access to continuous financial 

advisory services on digital channels. We enabled our financial 

representatives to recommend and share products with 

customers via personalised online links. Through these links, 

customers are able to seamlessly purchase these products 

on our digital platforms. We further simplified the policy 

application process and shortened response times to allow 

our financial representatives to conduct their business and 

complete transactions with greater agility and speed, thus 

uplifting overall productivity. 

Our holistic customer proposition and service offerings, 

including end-to-end professional advisory, wealth 

management solutions and priority processing, supported 

by our Prestige Client Office, allowed us to deepen our 

penetration in the affluent segment. 

On the recruitment front, we stepped up by providing 

employment opportunities in the insurance sector by 

reaching out to fresh graduates and mid-career individuals. 

We conducted virtual Masterclass seminars where our top 

in-house practitioners shared useful tips with people seeking 

to make a career change. The success of our recruitment 

initiatives led to the growth of our representative network to 

over 5,000 at the end of 2020.  

Aside from growing our people footprint, we accelerated our 

efforts on further strengthening our financial representatives’ 

capabilities. We launched a series of topical training modules 

online for convenient access throughout the year. We continued 

to enrol more leaders in a 25-week Agency Management 

Training Course to achieve the Institute of Banking &amp; Finance 

(IBF) Level 3 accreditation. 

We faced significant challenges in our bancassurance 

business during the first half of the year, but we saw a 

strong rebound in the second half of 2020. We worked with 

our bancassurance partner OCBC Bank to launch remote 

sales advisory capabilities to equip their sales network to 

better serve their customers’ financial needs. As such, OCBC 

Bank was able to enrich its sales and engagements through 

digital, telesales and direct channels.  

In 2020, we further strengthened our affinity partnerships to 

broaden our reach to new customer segments and address 

customer needs arising from their increasingly digital lifestyle 

and consumption habits. We worked in collaboration with 

telecommunications provider Singtel, harnessing their 

deep customer insights and platforms to launch contextual 

campaigns for home insurance solutions. With Singapore 

Press Holdings, we provided insurance for news tablets 

issued to its digital newspaper subscribers, while ActiveSG 

members could purchase our insurance solutions via its 

mobile app.

GROWING OUR GENERAL AND GROUP 

INSURANCE BUSINESS 

During the year, our General Insurance business demonstrated 

resilience, driven by our well established and diversified 

distribution network, focus on retail, and portfolio realignment. 

We remained steadfast in our effort to digitalise our business 

model.

With OCBC Bank, we developed relevant propositions to 

engage customers through its distribution touchpoints. 

We saw potential in extending our insurance products to 

its corporate customers, based on their increased interest 

in coverage for supply chain interruptions, physical assets 

and health protection for employees, due to the adverse 

economic environment.

Our Group Insurance business experienced good growth 

during the year, as a result of our strong relationships with 

our brokers and distribution partners, and an increased risk 

awareness among our customers. Our telemedicine solutions 

for corporate users, established since 2018, also positioned 

us well, as we saw wider adoption of contactless medical 

services and use of digital health platforms. We expanded 

the employee benefits schemes and grew our stable of 

telemedicine providers to meet the increase in demand from 

corporate users. By introducing home services for executive 

health screenings and influenza vaccinations, we were able 

to deliver greater convenience and safety to them as they 

continued working remotely.

ENHANCING OUR PRODUCT PROPOSITIONS

In 2020, we rolled out innovative insurance solutions to 

provide comprehensive health-related protection, as well 

as savings and investment-linked plans. 

In line with customers’ heightened awareness of protection 

coverage, we redesigned the Great Flexi Protect series, our 

flagship series of critical illness whole life plans with the 

versatility to scale protection coverage and payouts. This 

enhancement empowered customers to curate critical illness 

plans that best address their needs. We launched GREAT 

Cancer Guard to provide coverage for all stages of cancer. 

As one of Singapore’s three approved insurers for CareShield 

Life supplementary plans, we launched our long-term  

disability plans GREAT CareShield Enhanced and GREAT 

CareShield Advantage, aimed at enhancing protection for 

customers aged 30 and above.

Amid an increase in dengue cases in the country, we offered 

Great Value Protect with Dengue Fever coverage via online 

platforms for easy purchase. In addition, we bundled 12 

months’ complimentary Dengue Care coverage for new 

customers buying selected regular premium life, and accident 

and health insurance plans. 

To support the protection-cum-wealth accumulation needs 

of our customers, we continued to improve our investment-

linked product offerings (ILPs). We enhanced GREAT Life 

Advantage, a comprehensive plan offering both protection and 

accumulation, with simplified underwriting and more choices 

of critical illness protection riders, as well as retrenchment 

waiver benefits to provide added assurance for customers. 

To enhance the wealth accumulation component of ILPs, we 

offered our customers access to Great Eastern-Lion Dynamic 

Funds, for those who want to tap on the expertise of our in-

house investment team to manage their ILPs. 

During the year, our short-term endowment plan GREAT SP, 

supplemented with hospital cash cover and complimentary 

telehealth services as added benefits, was well-received by 

customers.  

For our bancassurance customers, we developed a 

comprehensive ILP which featured a simplified application 

process. We rolled out a suite of products, including health, 

savings and term life protection plans, for customers to 

purchase online via OCBC Bank’s digital and ecosystem 

platforms. In addition, our legacy solutions PremierLife 

Generation 3 and GreatLife Endowment, developed for the 

mass affluent, registered strong sales.

In October 2020, Great Eastern was appointed by the Central 

Provident Fund Board as the sole insurer for its enhanced 

Dependants’ Protection Scheme (DPS) that will be effective 

from 1 April 2021. We will now play a pivotal role in making 

insurance accessible to the working population in Singapore, 

and plan to offer a suite of value-added products and services 

to DPS members as they come onboard.

DEEPENING CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT 

Throughout 2020, we connected with our customers on digital 

platforms, expanding our online activities and building on 

our brand mission, particularly in the second half of the year.

Health and wellness remained a key pillar in our initiatives 

to encourage customers to partner with us in their journey 

towards good health. The FitAge feature was added to 

GETGREAT, our health and wellness app, to encourage 

people to track their fitness more holistically. We further 

boosted customer engagement through our mobile rewards 

app UPGREAT with more attractive online rewards in dining, 

lifestyle and shopping. 

In the third quarter of 2020, we launched UPGREAT Virtual 

Vacay. This virtual travel and booking platform aims to 

address consumers’ interest in travel via virtual overseas 

tours, customised staycation itineraries in Singapore, and 

provided promotional offers with travel partners. 

We launched our Live #Lifeproof brand campaign in July, to 

reinforce our brand purpose to customers. Our Live #Lifeproof 

Financial Video Series in October helmed by our financial 

representatives encouraged customers to embark on better 

financial planning for health and retirement. We also celebrated 

our first #Lifeproof Virtual Challenge to replace the physical 

15th edition of Great Eastern Women’s Run in November. 

To engage next-generation customers, we partnered with 

trending influencers in our #Lifeproof Next Gen webinar 

series which ran from August to December. This series aimed 

to impart life skills to fresh graduates and those new to the 

workforce in the areas of financial literacy and focused on 

helping them with professional competencies. We further 

conducted client webinars on investment, lifestyle, and 

health and wellness topics to keep them up-to-date on 

current topics and trends.

We additionally created a Life Hacks content microsite to 

engage potential new customers with interesting stories on 

how to best pursue financial freedom with early planning.

DELIVERING QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE 

During the year, we remained fully committed to providing 

continuous access to quality services across multiple 

touchpoints to address our customers’ needs, with health 

and safety measures put in place.

We embarked on new initiatives and continued to invest 

heavily in technology to provide our customers with seamless 

access to our products and services.  From as early as 

February, customers could purchase a suite of selected 

products seamlessly online with MyInfo, which helped facilitate 

customer identification and auto-population of personal 

information with ease. Customers who made their purchases 

via our digital platforms could also receive post-sales servicing 

and advice from their assigned financial representatives. 

To provide 24/7 accessibility to our services, we launched Great 

Eastern App to provide our customers with the convenience 

and visibility of their policies anytime, anywhere.  With this 

app, customers have the ability to make service requests 

directly on their mobile devices, and manage their policies.

Continuing with our efforts to enhance customer experience, 

we implemented corporate PayNow to allow customers to 

make premium payments conveniently on our E-Connect 

platform, and strengthened Health Connect to encourage 

our Integrated Shield customers to increase usage of our 

specialist panel for their healthcare needs. Additionally, 

we implemented the Predictive Underwriting Model for life 

and critical illness products which enabled us to serve our 

customers with greater speed and efficiency.

REVIEW

With COVID-19 impacting almost all areas of life in 2020, we 

continued to place our customers as our top priority with 

various initiatives introduced to support those impacted, 

while ensuring our customers’ protection and financial needs 

were met.

To help our customers and their family members diagnosed 

with COVID-19, we pledged RM2 million through our Financial 

Assistance Programme and supported over 1,000 people. 

We further assisted approximately 1,470 policyholders to 

continue their insurance coverage by deferring their regular 

premium payments for three months.  We supported the 

COVID-19 Test Fund initiated by Malaysia’s Ministry of Health 

by allowing each of our medical insurance policyholders and 

takaful certificate holders to apply for reimbursement up to 

a maximum of RM300 for COVID-19 testing. In addition, 

we instituted flexible premium payment schemes for our 

corporate customers whose businesses had been adversely 

impacted by COVID-19.

Despite challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, 

our financial representative network displayed resilience and 

agility, adapting quickly to the new norm of sales advisory. 

We were quick to introduce a fully remote insurance sales

uninterrupted advisory services to their customers via digital 

platforms. Our suite of guaranteed issuance offer products 

and affordable medical plans were well-timed to meet market 

demand.

To ensure we continue to uplift the professionalism of our 

representatives, our Centre for Excellence implemented 

a blended learning approach involving e-learning, virtual 

classroom training and webinars.  We conducted over 500 

virtual classroom trainings for almost 32,000 participants.  At 

the same time, the Leadership Development Faculty delivered 

programmes to upskill our newly appointed agency leaders 

with technical competencies.

Throughout the year, it was equally important for us to stay 

connected with our representatives. We launched Great 

Events via Facebook to connect and share important updates 

with a closed group of over 10,600 representatives. In July, 

we hosted the largest webinar to engage and motivate our 

representatives.  

Social media platforms were the key enablers helping to 

magnify our recruitment programmes to over 2.7 million 

people. We also organised physical and virtual employment 

workshops for graduating students to promote insurance 

as a career option.          

Our bancassurance partner OCBC Bank implemented remote 

sales advisory, enabling its sales team to continue to engage 

and effectively service the customers. In addition, it launched 

a legacy customer campaign to promote legacy planning 

to customers, and a skills uplift programme for their sales 

network to improve productivity.  

During the year, we deepened our affinity partnership with 

Axiata Digital. We offered customised segment-aligned 

insurance solutions via their digital platforms.

Our Group Insurance business also showed resilience as 

we continued to strengthen our engagement activities with 

policyholders and distribution partners, contributing to the 

growth in our business.  

Enhancing our customer propositions

In early 2020, we launched Great Generation Care, the first 

insurance plan in Malaysia to provide comprehensive critical 

illness protection for three generations in a family under a 

single plan, with complimentary critical illness/child illness 

coverage. The plan additionally offered an optional Parent 

Protect Rider with no medical underwriting required, covering 

the customer’s parents against Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, 

and Parkinson’s disease.

We further strengthened our health solutions through our 

new offerings. We launched new investment-linked riders, 

namely, SmartMedic Million that provides comprehensive 

medical and hospitalisation benefits; and Smart Multi Critical 

Care that provides comprehensive critical illness coverage 

and special benefits for diabetes and mental illness, and 

encompasses multi-claim features.  

Amid the implementation of movement restrictions and 

safe distancing measures, we offered a suite of affordable 

protection plans (Great Love4U, Great 80 Care and Great 

Life Gift) with simplified application process, with a simplified 

application process and no medical underwriting requirement. 

In collaboration with Boost e-Wallet, we launched HospiCash, 

which offers hospital cash allowance; and Protect Super6, 

providing accidental death, critical illness and bereavement 

benefits for adventure seekers. In November, we launched 

the first-ever redeemable insurance in Malaysia on the Boost 

app. Through its loyalty rewards programme, Boost users 

are able to purchase our protection plans using Boost Coins. 

One featured product under this initiative is LifeProtect, a 

life insurance plan providing additional financial assistance 

upon diagnosis of COVID-19.  

Deepening customer engagement digitally

We launched the “Discover Greatness” to engage 

with our customers and the community in August. The 

campaign aimed to encourage the community to live 

healthier and better, our customers to achieve financial 

security and prepare ahead for uncertainties, and our 

employees and financial representatives to realise their full 

potential with us.  Our campaign video generated almost  

2 million views within 1.5 months. 

To navigate the health journey of caring for ageing parents and 

to debunk myths about childhood vaccines, we organised a 

Great Wellness Webinar for our customers and the community. 

We collaborated with Pantai Hospital Ampang specialists 

to give talks on “Caring Across Generations”, where we 

promoted our insurance solution Great Generation Care.

In December, we launched UPGREAT Malaysia to drive 

greater digital engagement with customers, bringing them 

exclusive dining, lifestyle and shopping rewards seamlessly 

via the app.

GROWING OUR TAKAFUL BUSINESS

In 2020, our Takaful business continued to deliver strong 

growth supported by our product offerings and the strength 

of our financial representative network.

We empowered our representatives to provide quality service 

and meet customers’ needs more efficiently through the use 

of self-service portal, i-Great Partner.

Responding to increased concerns about job losses and pay 

cuts caused by COVID-19, we organised webinars featuring 

reputable speakers to motivate and inspire Malaysians, and 

to promote takaful as a viable career option. 

To help support our bancatakaful business, we initiated 

webinars on financial planning towards building a resilient 

wealth portfolio for customers of selected bank partners. 

Enhancing our customer propositions

Our takaful solutions were well-received during the year as 

we continued to curate relevant products to meet customers’ 

evolving needs.

In the first half of 2020, in view of heightened demand for 

protection, especially medical cover, we re-launched i-Great 

Harapan Plus and i-Great MediHarapan, a standalone medical 

plan, which saw strong take-up by customers.  Riding on 

strong market demands, we also launched i-Great Evo, a 

comprehensive plan which provides medical and critical illness 

protection, hospitalisation benefits and personal accident 

coverage; and i-Great Neo, a high coverage protection plan 

to help customers in retirement and legacy planning.                                                    

For our bancatakaful partner OCBC Al-Amin, we launched 

Family Gift-I, which offers protection benefits to immediate 

family members without additional medical underwriting 

requirements.                                                              

We also strengthened our product pipeline for affinity partners, 

offering segment-aligned insurance solutions via Axiata 

Digital’s platforms.

Progressing in our mission to provide more people with 

protection solutions in Malaysia, we moved into our second 

year as the takaful operator for Malaysia’s mySalam 

government scheme to deliver coverage to those in lower 

income households (B40).  We made strides in education 

and awareness through our kiosks at public and university 

hospitals across the country, and have seen a marked 

increase in the number of policyholders benefitting from 

this scheme in 2020.

Strengthening our customer support and engagement

We have implemented several sustainable initiatives focused 

on operational efficiencies, and providing greater convenience 

for our customers by introducing more payment options 

such as e-payments.

To better serve customers’ needs, we implemented GETCare 

app for our medical card customers. Through the app, our 

customers can conveniently access information relating to 

their medical coverage, such as the balance of their medical 

coverage limits and the list of panel hospitals near them. 

We rolled out Great ID to provide convenient customer 

access to i-Get In Touch, our self-service online portal, which 

enabled them to seamlessly check their certificate details 

and claim status, and perform online transactions such as 

nominations, fund switches and payment mode changes.

Even as the government implemented movement restrictions 

and safe distancing measures, we were able to leverage our 

digital tools such as MPOS and GETsetGo to engage with 

our customers virtually, and our representatives were able 

to continue to support their protection needs. 

GROWING OUR GENERAL INSURANCE BUSINESS

Our General Insurance business remained resilient in the 

face of COVID-19, mainly driven by the growth in commercial 

business and our diversified distribution network. Despite 

the pandemic’s severe impact on the demand for travel and 

motor sales, we maintained our focus on further strengthening 

our retail business through the launch of new products and 

deepening our affinity partnerships.

We worked in close collaboration with Axiata Digital to offer 

insurance solutions to complement their service offerings, and 

launched segment-aligned solutions via their digital platforms. 

Our partnership with Malindo Air to provide customers 

with easy access to travel insurance delivered reasonable 

performance, despite being impacted by the reduced demand 

for travel due to the pandemic.      

Enhancing our customer propositions

Curating protection solutions for young adults with active 

lifestyles, we launched EasiMed Active for those aged 40 

years and below, which provides coverage for mental illnesses 

and optional benefits for outpatient chiropractic and injury 

sustained due to hazardous activities.

We expanded our motor offerings with add-on benefits such 

as the Inconvenient Car Courtesy allowance, which provides 

an allowance in the event of car breakdowns; Special Perils 

benefit for additional protection against unexpected natural 

disaster events; and Hospital Income allowance to provide 

an allowance in the event of hospitalisation due to vehicle 

accidents. We also enabled customers to purchase Flexi 

Transit Protection, which offers personal accident coverage 

via street parking payment solution app Flexi Parking. 

We further enhanced Great Shield Home to include 

complimentary windstorm damage cover for selected outdoor 

fixtures and fittings, and offered two new chargeable options 

that provide coverage against accidental breakage of plate 

glass in buildings and increased limit of liability.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the year 2020 started out 

as a challenging one for our Indonesia operations comprising 

Great Eastern Life Indonesia (GELI) and Great Eastern General 

Insurance (GEGI). However, we saw good recovery in the 

second half of the year.  

Despite challenges, we stayed focused on providing 

customers’ insurance needs, while prioritising health and 

safety. We responded swiftly to economic and operational 

challenges, and stepped up support to help our customers 

who were impacted by COVID-19 through our IDR10 billion 

Care Fund Programme.

Like other markets, we quickly adapted and redesigned our 

sales processes to ensure business continuity, and responded 

to our partners’ and customers’ needs and expectations. We 

were quick to pivot our online platforms to enable continued 

interactions and access to financial advisory services to 

fulfill our customers’ insurance needs. The launch of digital 

signatures through Indonesia’s government recognised Privy 

ID platform further facilitated seamless insurance transactions.

In June, we expanded our bancassurance distribution channel 

by strategically partnering with Bank Muamalat Indonesia to 

provide Shariah product Asuransi Great Hasanah Pembiayaan 

to their housing loan customers.

We enhanced our digital sales capabilities during the year to 

support our distribution network. Great Advice was launched 

to help them engage more effectively with customers, while 

Great Eastern Mobile Assistance, a new WhatsApp-based 

servicing channel, gave customers a wider range of remote 

service options, and GoGREAT! augmented the customer 

engagement experience.  

To enhance our service offerings and reach new segments, 

we forged new strategic affinity partnerships. We partnered 

with Axiata Digital Services Indonesia to offer customised 

segment-aligned insurance solutions via its Boost and Aspirasi 

platforms. Together with leading technology-based insurtech 

firm Qoala and e-payment platform Linkaja, we collaborated 

to bring simple and affordable insurance solutions to the

These products helped to drive positive sales momentum 

for both our affinity partners and bancassurance partner, 

Bank OCBC NISP.  

In our General Insurance business, our focus on retail business

distribution partners contributed to the improved business 

performance in 2020.  During the year, we strengthened our 

bancassurance partnership with Bank OCBC NISP and built 

digital affinity networks.

In 2020, we focused on upgrading internal capabilities 

to provide an end-to-end digital journey for our financial 

representatives and customers, and to integrate our platforms 

with affinity partners via the API ecosystem. These upgrades 

will enable seamless online purchases and electronic 

endorsements, and provide ease of online claim submissions.

BRUNEI 

For the year 2020, we focused on ensuring that customers 

had uninterrupted access to our insurance solutions and 

professional financial advisory services in Brunei.  We 

implemented remote sales advisory to ensure our financial 

representatives could continuously engage customers, and 

strengthened our sales support.

Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, we put together a 

B$50,000 support package to help impacted customers and 

provided financial relief through the Deferment of Premium 

Payment programme for those affected during this challenging 

period.  At the same time, we included COVID-19 related 

medical and death claims in selected insurance products for 

customers.  Our new endowment plans GREAT SP, a single 

premium plan and Flexi Goal, a regular premium whole life 

plan, were well-received by customers. 

During the year, we continued to strengthen the skillsets and 

product knowledge of our financial representative network. We 

conducted regular training sessions and activities to enhance 

their professionalism and advisory skills, and helped them 

build product competencies. We were able to continually 

connect with our financial representatives via online channels 

to keep them engaged throughout.

To grow our financial representative network, we launched

HUMAN 

CAPITAL 





While the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how 

we work, we have continued to actively pivot our 

strategies to ensure business continuity while 

keeping our employees safe and engaged. During 

the year, we kept our long-term focus on building 

a future-ready workforce and our commitment 

to create a supportive workplace where our 

employees thrive and are engaged.

TRANSFORMING WORK PROCESSES 

COVID-19 accelerated the digitalisation of our human resource 

processes to enable continuity in our operations to serve our 

customers. From early 2020, we implemented split operations 

starting in Singapore and progressively across our regional 

offices to safeguard the safety of our employees and manage 

operational risks. We expanded our IT infrastructure and 

capability to also enable work-from-home arrangements, 

with employees working remotely with the required tools and 

resources without compromising productivity. 

We also digitalised other aspects including recruitment, 

where we implemented a seamless online experience 

from interviewing candidates through to contract-signing. 

In Malaysia, digitalised processes included performance 

management and talent management via a cloud-based 

technology system, to enhance operational efficiencies and 

to streamline the human capital processes.

In Indonesia, we set up the Human Resource Information 

System (HRIS) in October, which enabled employees to 

manage their human resource requests such as applying for 

leave and checking their leave balances and e-payslips. To keep 

employees safe, we implemented an Intelligent Temperature 

Checking system to communicate information directly to HRIS 

for real-time tracking of employees’ temperature readings 

and absences.

As part of our wider workplace transformation initiative, we 

started piloting flexi-work arrangements and correspondingly 

explored workspace redesign, to test a new future of work 

for employees in Singapore. We completed the pilot for 

a collaborative workspace on one office floor with video 

conference facilities, meeting rooms with wireless projection, 

open concept collaboration spaces for brainstorming, and 

flexi-workspaces. The pilot was put to the test during the year, 

and will foreseeably be rolled out to other regional offices 

progressively in 2021. 

ENGAGING EMPLOYEES 

Despite the constraints on physical interactions due to 

COVID-19, we continuously engaged our people. To onboard 

new employees, we had a combination of e-learning modules 

and face-to-face orientation sessions with designated senior 

leaders, including career planning workshops in Singapore. 

Virtual orientations were held to onboard new employees at 

our regional offices. 

In August, we celebrated our 112th anniversary in Singapore 

with a month-long campaign Life@112, a weekly workout 

challenge for employees to keep fit. We also conducted 

GREAT 

EASTERN 

HOLDINGS

other engagement activities such as virtual baking classes 

or mask-making workshops. 

Our Indonesian offices, Great Eastern Life Indonesia and 

Great Eastern General Insurance Indonesia, celebrated their 

24th and 26th anniversaries respectively, where all employees 

received a “tumpeng”, an Indonesian cone-shaped rice dish 

with side dishes of vegetables and meat delivered to their 

homes to thank them for their contributions to the company’s 

success.

With a strong focus on organisational health and wellness 

throughout the year, we encouraged employees to own 

their wellness under the LIFE Programme. Since 2013, 

participation in this voluntary programme has grown by over 

70% for employees in Singapore and Malaysia, and over 

50% for Indonesia. 

In Singapore, we distributed fruit and delivered specially-

made Great Eastern masks to all employees in July. In 

Malaysia, we distributed masks, organised a two-month 

Immunity Boosting and Hygiene Campaign in March to 

share immunity and hygiene tips, and also gave fruit and 

hand sanitisers to employees. In Indonesia, we prepared 

masks and hand sanitisers, as well as held a webinar series, 

“Inspiring Wednesday”, which covered topics such as mental 

wellness and enhancing virtual productivity for employees.

INSTILLING VALUES AND DEVELOPING A 

FUTURE-READY WORKFORCE 

Integrity, Initiative and Involvement. 

These are core values which we want to imbue in all our 

employees to live out at work every day. We launched our 

#mygreatculture programme to share actionable ways with 

employees, building on our foundational culture programme 

in 2019.

We introduced a set of Generic Skills and Competencies 

(GSCs) identifying soft skills such as Leadership, Exploring 

Possibilities and Decision-Making to embed a values-based 

ethos in our employees in 2020. Close to 95% of people 

managers participated in the managerial workshops and 

100% of employees completed the e-learning module. 

These workshops and e-learning modules were also rolled 

out in Malaysia and will be progressively introduced across 

our offices in the region. To creatively engage and keep our 

values top-of-mind with employees, we created WhatsApp 

stickers, new lanyards and incorporated our three ‘I’s into the 

design of our new Great Eastern T-shirts across our markets. 

Going forward, we will include the GSCs into our assessment 

tools to facilitate hiring and employee performance appraisals, 

so as to create a holistic programme to build the desired 

behavioural attributes in our workforce.

As a company that cares, we were fully committed to providing 

job opportunities for graduates and job seekers in 2020. 

In Singapore, we offered over 100 traineeship positions to 

graduates and internship opportunities for over 100 students, 

and recruited over 300 corporate staff who included mid-

career individuals. 

In spite of COVID-19, we continued to invest in people 

development by arranging “on-the-go” and “bite-sized” 

e-learning modules via LinkedIn Learning to drive continuous 

learning on digital platforms, workshops and webinars for 

employees to upskill so as to be future-ready. We organised 

a month-long #FutureReady Virtual Learning Carnival across 

all offices. We had an exciting line-up of 15 webinars with 

Google, KPMG, Facebook, Microsoft and others to cover 

topics such as Sustainability, Cybersecurity and InsureTech, 

for employees to have self-paced learning experiences. 

We also introduced learning frameworks for employees to 

take up work-related courses to further develop their careers 

with us. Our Indonesian teams arranged training workshops 

and professional accredited courses in Risk Management 

and General Insurance for employees to enhance their 

professional competencies. 

SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS 

We embraced sustainability in our human resource processes. 

Our October #FutureReady Virtual Learning Carnival was part 

of our wider effort to educate employees about sustainability 

and to encourage the adoption of sustainability practices. 

We introduced three webinars on this topic and are planning 

more on this front. To positively impact the environment, we 

will be digitising to eliminate paper usage to move towards 

becoming a sustainable company.

CORPORATE 

SOCIAL 

RESPONSIBILITY 

In 2020, many countries were greatly impacted by COVID-19. 

A key focus for us was to provide support to the needy 

and vulnerable who struggle with their daily needs. The 

pandemic also significantly impacted the types of activities 

that could be organised to reach out to the communities, 

within constraints of movement restrictions across Singapore, 

Malaysia and Indonesia, with most activities and fundraising 

efforts conducted through online channels. 

As the pandemic eases and as countries gradually regain 

normality, we will strive to encourage active volunteerism 

among our employees and financial representatives to support 

the disadvantaged, and support health and wellness.

SINGAPORE &amp; BRUNEI

COVID-19 escalated into a global pandemic at the start 

of 2020. In Singapore, we contributed S$200,000 to the 

Community Chest’s Courage Fund to support vulnerable 

individuals and groups such as patients and healthcare 

workers.

As a leading regional insurer and a responsible 

corporate citizen, Great Eastern is committed to 

making a difference in the communities where 

we operate. Even as we deliver our best to our 

customers, we strive to bring about positive 

and lasting changes in the communities through 

meaningful initiatives organised across the Group 

under Great Eastern Cares.

Our employees and financial representatives additionally 

raised S$265,000 through the Great Eastern Cares Community 

Fund to bring relief to beneficiaries, particularly the elderly 

and low-income families, supported by AWWA, Care Corner 

Singapore and New Hope Community Services. We provided 

them with critical essentials such as hot meals, food supplies, 

medicine, hardship subsidies and shelter for the displaced. 

While we were unable to hold our signature Great Eastern 

Women’s Run (GEWR) due to COVID-19, we continued to 

help women in their health and wellness journey with curated 

fitness and healthy living content and tips on our social 

media platforms. From 1-8 November, we organised the first 

GEWR #Lifeproof Virtual Challenge where participants could 

select the 5 km, 10 km, 21.1 km or the popular Mummy + 

Me 2 km run with their daughters, share their results on our 

social media platforms and win attractive prizes. The virtual 

challenge was well received, especially by regular GEWR 

participants, and close to 300 submitted their entries. 

To help the GEWR community and general public with their 

financial health, we launched the Live #Lifeproof Financial 

Video Series in October and November to provide tips on 

how they can better plan their finances. We covered topics 

such as how to safeguard your health, secure your child’s 

future and how to retire comfortably.

In Brunei, our financial representatives and employees 

contributed funds to purchase gifts such as clothing, stationery 

and books, and delivered them to the young patients at 

YASKA Children’s Cancer Foundation. In addition, we donated

B$10,000 to the Ministry of Health to build a therapeutic 

healing garden at a psychiatric centre in Kiarong to help 

patients during their recovery. 

MALAYSIA

To reduce the burden of rising food prices and necessities 

brought about by the pandemic, we donated AEON gift 

vouchers worth RM25,000 to 10 Jabatan Kebajikan Masyarakat 

(JKM) children’s homes during Deepavali and Christmas for 

groceries and essential items. We also provided packed meals 

to five JKM children’s homes during Christmas to spread 

the festive cheer. More than 560 underprivileged children 

benefitted from the two activities. 

Responding to COVID-19, the company donated funds to 

purchase masks and personal hygiene items for school 

children from low-income families at Sekolah Rendah Agama 

Al-Alusi in Kuala Lumpur, and made a cash donation of 

RM10,000 to the elderly home Pertubuhan Kebajikan Orang 

Tua Cacat Dan Kurang Upaya Taman Connaught to support 

the home’s utilities and rental, as well as provide the senior 

residents with masks and other daily essentials. 

Strengthening our efforts to help the impoverished community 

in Kampung Orang Asli Sungai Gabong, we contributed 

1,500 kg worth of essential household items such as cooking 

oil, rice, flour and personal hygiene items to the families in 

June. To enable the villagers to better support themselves, 

we engaged an expert from the local agriculture department 

to provide a talk on best farming practices. 

We continued to support underprivileged children through 

Program Aspirasi Gemilang ‘A’ which was started in 2014, 

rewarding children who scored an ‘A’ grade in their national 

examinations with an incentive of RM100. The programme 

awarded RM7,700 to 54 children in 2020. To-date, we have 

awarded more than RM75,000 to children from underprivileged 

homes across Malaysia and motivated them to study hard 

and to do well in their examinations.

In addition, we donated RM10,000 to support patients who 

require palliative care through our participation in the Hospis 

Malaysia virtual run, and RM3,000 to Cancerlink Foundation 

to support cancer patients. 

In recognition of our efforts to make a difference in the 

community, we received the Sustainability &amp; CSR Malaysia 

Awards 2020, which honours outstanding corporations in 

Malaysia that have excelled in the role of being change 

agents in the socio-economic transformation of Malaysia. 

We also received the Corporate Social Responsibility award 

at the Malaysian Takaful Association’s Annual Awards as well 

as the CSR Initiative of the Year Award at Insurance Asia 

Awards for our work with the Kampung Orang Asli Sungai 

Gabong community.

 

INDONESIA

To raise funds for communities affected by the pandemic, 

we collaborated with our affinity partner, BookMyShow, to 

organise an online music concert “Great Music for a Great 

Cause” in May. The concert featured the famous Indonesian 

singer, Rendy Pandugo. All donations were channelled to 

Indonesia Food Cycle Foundation to support those in need 

of food, such as street hawkers, the homeless and orphans.

We distributed over 6,000 T-shirts to 30 foundations and 

orphanages across eight cities in September and October, to 

provide the children with new clothing at a time when most 

foundations were receiving reduced support from donors 

and the wider community. 

To improve the quality of life for the needy and disadvantaged, 

the company supported renovation projects for the Griya 

Werdha elderly home in Surabaya and Yayasan Tat Twam Asi 

orphanage in Bali. Apart from helping the homes with their 

repairs, we improved their living environment and facilities, 

and increased safety measures such as building secure 

fences for the safety of the residents. 

Focusing on health and wellness, we conducted a series of 

online health and financial talks, as well as fitness sessions 

for employees of Bank OCBC NISP during the year. Close 

to 1,000 participants attended the 13 talks held throughout 

the year and topics included mental wellness, nutrition and 

financial planning, while over 300 participants joined fitness 

sessions such as body combat, yoga and zumba. 

To support financial inclusion month in October, we partnered 

Qoala and Akseleran to organise an online financial literacy 

webinar for millennials. We also conducted insurance webinars 

for 70 women and youths from the Youth Association and 

Women Association in Batam, and for 100 students from 

SMA Pelita Kasih Makassar Senior High School to build 

awareness of financial planning.

BOARD 

STATEMENT

2020 has been an unprecedented year. Despite the external 

challenges, we at Great Eastern seized the opportunity 

to build on our resilience and incorporate sustainability 

considerations in our business activities. It is during tough 

times that it is all the more important and meaningful to 

pursue our mission of making life great for our stakeholders 

by providing financial security, and promoting good health 

and meaningful relationships, as well as fulfilling our corporate 

social responsibility to the community.

2020, NEW SHARPENED FOCUS

This year we made significant strides on the sustainability front. 

We are now more focused in our sustainability approach,which 

is aimed at two sustainability objectives, namely, improving 

people’s lives and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. 

At the same time, we have strengthened our sustainability 

governance by establishing board level sustainability 

committee to oversee the Group-wide sustainability initiatives. 

SUSTAINABILITY DURING COVID-19

COVID-19 has heightened the need for us to speed up our 

digital and strategic priorities, in response to the threats and 

opportunities of the changing environment. Hence, we have 

accelerated several new initiatives to ensure operational 

viability while physical contacts among people were 

restricted, including adding digital distribution capabilities, 

and proactively engaging our customers to meet their needs.

Our efforts were targeted towards our four main stakeholders, 

which are customers, employees, financial representatives 

and the community at large. Details of these efforts can be 

found later in this report. 

DRIVING CHANGE FROM WITHIN

Fostering a culture of sustainability was an important 

undertaking for us in 2020. Several sustainability virtual 

learning sessions were organized for our employees 

throughout the year that touched on a breadth of related 

topics. These efforts helped to ensure that, regardless of job 

or rank, Great Eastern employees across the different entities 

have a common understanding of sustainability on personal 

as well as corporate level. To ingrain sustainability into our 

culture, we have adopted both a top-down and bottom-up 

approach. We have established a governance structure to 

indicate tone from the top and have also created avenues for 

employees to float their ideas on the sustainability initiatives 

to the management level. 

Since 2018, we have been a signatory to the United Nations 

Principles for Sustainable Insurance (UNPSI) and we have been 

continuing our journey of building an insurance group that is 

environmentally conscious, socially responsible and ethical. 

LOOKING AHEAD

This is the beginning of our sustainability journey at Great 

Eastern. Together with the Group Management Team, the 

Board is committed to making increasingly meaningful 

contribution towards sustainability.

ABOUT THIS REPORT

Great Eastern Group is pleased to present our 

sustainability report, which covers material 

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) aspects 

of the Group’s businesses in 2020. 

SCOPE OF THE REPORT 

This report covers all businesses and operations 

under the Group for the financial year 1 January to 

31 December 2020, unless otherwise stated. 

REPORTING FRAMEWORK

The report has been prepared in accordance with 

the core option under the Global Reporting (GRI) 

Standards. The GRI Standards are an internationally 

recognized reporting framework that covers a 

comprehensive range of sustainability disclosures. 

This report is also aligned with the requirements 

stipulated in the Sustainability Reporting guidelines 

of the Singapore Exchange.

DATA AND ASSURANCE

The data included in this report has been reviewed and 

approved in accordance with our internal processes.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY 

APPROACH

Our sustainability approach is for ESG factors to become an integral part of our corporate strategy. Our sustainability efforts 

are organized in 3 pillars and are linked to the 7 material ESG factors we have identified.

PILLAR 1

LOW-CARBON  

ECONOMY

Managing risks and opportunities 

arising from climate change and 

contributing to global efforts in 

reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions by managing the 

environmental footprint of our 

operations and incorporating 

ESG considerations in our 

investment portfolios.

PILLAR 2

IMPROVING PEOPLE’S 

LIVES

Contributing to more inclusive 

societies as insurer, employer, 

investor and corporate 

citizen by making insurance 

accessible to broader segments 

of communities through 

appropriate affordable products, 

digital advisory and distribution 

platforms and actively helping 

customers live healthier, 

better and longer through our 

integrated health and wellness 

programme.

As an employer, creating a 

learning, nurturing and engaging 

work environment that enables 

our people to realize their full 

potential.

PILLAR 3

RESPONSIBLE 

BUSINESS PRACTICES

Managing material ESG risks and 

seizing ESG opportunities while 

providing insurance products to 

customers and communities to 

gain trust of customers in the 

long term.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

The Board provides oversight on the Group’s sustainability efforts through 

the Board Sustainability Committee (SC) that was established in February 

2020. The Group CEO provides the SC with regular updates on sustainability 

efforts and initiatives, as well as updates on global and local trends that 

may have an impact on the Group’s direction and strategy in sustainability. 

The Group Management Committee (“GMC”) comprising of senior 

management from across the Group and chaired by the Group CEO, is 

responsible for the implementation of the Group’s sustainability initiatives. 

Working groups comprising of representatives from business and support 

units undertake specific tasks and pursue new initiatives or projects to 

further our sustainability goals.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Creating value for our stakeholders to gain 

their support is crucial for Great Eastern. 

Regular engagement with our different 

stakeholders gives us the opportunity to 

ensure alignment of our operations to their 

needs and interests. Our stakeholders 

are: Customers, Regulators, Investors, 

Employees, Community partners and 

Financial representatives.

OUR MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

PROCESS

Our Board considers the material ESG 

factors as part of its strategy formulation 

and decision-making. Hence, we regularly 

assess and identify material ESG factors that 

affect our business across all our operations. 

We have reviewed our sustainability approach 

this year, which has led us to reshape our 

sustainability pillars and material ESG factors. 

This reassessment has resulted in two key 

changes. Firstly, we have rationalised the 

number of material ESG factors from 10 

to 7. Secondly, our commitment towards 

the material factor “Robust Governance” 

includes Fair Dealing, Combating Financial 

Crimes and Cyber Security, and Customer 

Privacy.  

We report our progress and performance 

on each material ESG factor in the following 

sections of this report.

GREAT EASTERN’S 

RESPONSE TO COVID-19

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic along with government-

mandated movement restriction have impacted almost all 

areas of life. To ensure that we provide uninterrupted services 

to customers, we accelerated a number of strategic initiatives 

to maintain service to customers on digital platforms. The key 

projects include ramping up our IT infrastructure to support 

for employees and financial representatives working from 

home to ensure operational continuity, launching tele-advice 

platforms to enable our financial representative to service 

our customers safely and introducing assistance programs 

for customers and members of community who have been 

financially impacted. See table on the next page for a more 

comprehensive description of our initiatives.   

SUPPORTING OUR CUSTOMERS

To continue serving our customers remotely without physical 

meetings, remote advisory and servicing were introduced. We 

made available the types of servicing requests for policyholders 

to self-serve via the Great Eastern App and our E-Connect 

portal, such as change of personal particulars, premium 

apportionment and fund switches. To help customers, Great 

Eastern launched a S$1 million COVID-19 Customer Care 

Fund in Singapore and a RM 2 million Financial Assistance 

Programme in Malaysia, to provide hospitalisation and 

death benefits for our customers and their immediate family 

members. We also launched an interest-free COVID-19 

Deferment of Payment Programme, an extension arrangement 

designed to help our policyholders to maintain their insurance 

protection during the economic downturn. A total of 3,400 

policyholders have since benefited from these programmes 

across these markets. 

To ensure that our customers had access to our insurance 

offerings and protection solutions, those who wanted to 

purchase them remotely could do so via our own digital 

platforms, but still have access to professional advisory 

post-sales servicing from our financial representatives.  In 

addition, we partnered with affinity partners such as Singtel 

and Active SG and e-commerce platforms such as Shopee, 

to further enable customer purchases through other channels. 

PROTECTING OUR EMPLOYEES AND FINANCIAL 

REPRESENTATIVES

Since the onset of COVID-19, we have implemented staggered 

work hours, split-operations mode of working and a Work-

from-Home (WFH) arrangement to ensure the safety of our 

workforce and continue providing quality service to customers, 

in addition, guidelines and safety measures were introduced 

onsite at our offices. A COVID-19 Agency Force Fund was 

established to provide our representatives and their families 

with quarantine, hospitalization and death benefits. As our 

financial representatives were not allowed to bring customers 

into the office, we conducted all meetings, trainings and 

sales advisory engagements virtually. We also simplified 

digital authorisation for policy purchases to enable quicker 

processing to help our financial representatives with their 

sales activities. Notwithstanding COVID-19, our financial 

representatives continue to be productive and responsive to 

customers, and generated positive sales and income during 

the challenging period.

CONTRIBUTING TO OUR COMMUNITY

COVID-19 has taken its toll on economies resulting in job 

losses and dampened job prospects of many jobseekers. 

As a regional insurer and employer, we stepped up to offer 

111 corporate roles under the SGUnited programme in 2020. 

We provide on the job training and help these trainees build 

work experience to prepare them for future opportunities. 

In Malaysia, we supported the government’s COVID-19 Test 

Fund where medical insurance policyholders and Takaful 

certificate holders may apply for reimbursement of up to 

a maximum of RM300 for COVID-19 testing. Our Annual 

Report has more details.

MATERIAL FACTOR: 

RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT

WHY THIS IS MATERIAL TO US

As a leader in the industry with S$106.9 billion in assets under management, we are in a unique position to contribute 

to sustainability through Responsible Investment. A well-calibrated investment process that incorporates ESG 

considerations is expected to contribute towards long term sustainable economic development and better risk 

management for our investment portfolios.

OUR APPROACH

We embed ESG considerations into our investment analysis 

and decision making processes across all asset classes. 

We also advocate active ownership in our role as asset 

owners and investors to bring about positive change, through 

influencing companies and external fund managers to adopt 

ESG best practices. 

In 2020, we intensified our ESG efforts, formally incorporating 

responsible investment considerations into our investment 

process, and accelerating Group-wide efforts in establishing 

climate-related reporting metrics for our portfolios. We have 

started to measure and monitor our portfolios’ carbon footprint 

and intensity, which in time will allow us to set long-term 

reduction targets and mitigate risk arising from climate change. 

We have formalised our exclusion list to exclude investments 

in companies whose business practices are not aligned with 

our corporate values.

In Malaysia, we continue to invest in bonds that have been 

accorded Sustainability Ratings or Second Opinion Reports 

provided by accredited consultants. We also started work on 

monitoring the exposure of our loan and investment portfolios 

to climate-related risks, in line with guiding principles as set 

out in Bank Negara’s Climate Change and Principle-based 

Taxonomy discussion paper.

Lion Global Investors (LGI)

Our fund management subsidiary LGI became an UN-PRI 

signatory in January 2020. LGI has put in place a Responsible 

Investment policy and framework, which formally integrates 

ESG factors and considerations in its investment process.  

LGI has completed the setting up of relevant data infrastructure 

and systems in measuring carbon emission and intensity 

across all of Great Eastern’s Listed Equity portfolios, and 

will continue to explore the launch of suitable sustainability 

product offerings to add to its product suite. 

LGI will also actively participate in various industry schemes 

to catalyse ideas and propel policy initiatives in the area of 

responsible investments.

OUR TARGETS

• We continue to work on measuring portfolio carbon 

footprint across our Listed Equity portfolios, with a view 

to make our first disclosure in the 2021 Sustainability 

Report

• By 2023, to target to have 100% of appointed external 

managers having integrated ESG principles in their 

investment processes and ownership practices

OUR PERFORMANCE

• Committed more than S$1 billion to ESG mandates to 

date

• More than 70% of assets in Singapore are managed by 

external managers who are UN-PRI signatories, and more 

than 90% by managers who have an ESG policy in place

• In Malaysia, we increased our investment in bonds 

with Sustainability Ratings or Second Opinion report to  

S$ 109 million (RM 332 million). Meanwhile, our investment 

through UNPRI signatories stood at S$704 million  

(RM2.14 billion)

MATERIAL FACTOR: 

ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT

WHY THIS IS MATERIAL TO US

As a financial institution, our operation has limited impact on the environment but we play our part to minimize 

our environmental impact on the planet by controlling what we use, how much we use and how we use in our 

operations. We also need to build operational resilience to withstand effects of climate change on our business and 

the communities in which we operate.

OUR APPROACH

We have focused our efforts on the following areas:

Green Buildings

Initiatives undertaken in 2020, which are part of our multi-year 

continuing sustainability efforts, include: 

• Upgrading our air-conditioning systems to energy efficient 

systems

• Replacing inefficient lightings with LED lightings 

• Conducting a feasibility study to install renewable solar 

energy panels for our buildings in Singapore

• Commencing the process to obtain BCA Green Mark 

certification for two of our buildings in Singapore (Great 

Eastern @ Changi and Great Eastern House)

Sustainable Procurement

We continuously reduce our usage of paper, and use only 

paper certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. 

We aim to build reliable supply chains from suppliers that 

adopt sustainable practices through our new sustainable 

procurement practices.

OUR TARGETS

• Eliminate the purchase of plastic bottled water in all Great 

Eastern offices by 2021

• Continue to reduce paper usage by 50% in 2023

OUR PERFORMANCE

•  Established ESG principles into the Group’s supplier’s 

code of conduct in 2020

• Improved the environmental performance of our buildings 

and operations through implementing projects to meet 

BCA Green Mark Certification and adopting best practices 

in managing energy, water and waste

• Reduced purchase of single use bottled mineral water

• Reduced paper usage by 20%

MATERIAL FACTOR: 

ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT

GREAT EASTERN CENTRE CUM NANKIN ROW 

We embarked on the green property drive in 2018 starting with Great 

Eastern Centre and Nankin Row shophouses.

In this sustainability drive, Great Eastern Centre replaced its old chillers 

with a more efficient system. In addition, lightings in common areas 

such as car parks, stairwells, toilets and façade have been replaced 

with LED lighting. Motion sensors were used in toilets and stairwells. 

As a result, the electricity consumption has dropped 35% in 2020 from 

4.6 GWh to 2.9 GWh. The energy intensity dropped from 126 kWh/

sq. m to 81 kWh/sq. m. This represents a drop in carbon footprint of 

700 tonnes of CO2 emission.

While part of the reduction in electricity and water consumption in 

2020 may be attributable to the reduced usage of offices because of 

COVID-19, our past investments in energy saving projects have also 

yielded significant results.

Due to our past efforts, Great Eastern Centre and Nankin Row were 

awarded Green Mark Platinum by BCA in November 2019. Continuing 

in 2020, we replaced all inefficient lightings with LED and installed a 

new cooling system to replace the oversized Water-Cooled package 

system for our server room.

The largest contributor to our operational footprint is the electricity consumed by the buildings we own and use (Great 

Eastern corporate buildings in both Singapore and Malaysia, and commercial and residential buildings in Singapore).  

In 2020, our electricity usage reduced from 27.4 GWh in 2019 to 21.7 GWh in 2020.

The following depicts our energy, water and paper consumption in comparison with those in past years.

Starting in 2020, we expanded the tracking 

of our electricity and water consumption to 

include residential and commercial buildings 

in Malaysia and LGI office in Singapore.  The 

electricity usage, carbon emissions and water 

consumption for these properties were 12 

GWh, 8,800 tCO2 and 116,836 m3 respectively. 

The performance of these properties will be 

tracked going forward and included in our 

reports for future years.  

The initiatives undertaken in 2020 that 

resulted in reduction of paper usage include:

• Transforming paper-centric processes 

to digital and electronic platforms (refer 

to our digital initiatives under Customer 

Engagement (described in page 72) 

• Digitalising our human resource processes 

including our recruitment processes and

MEASUREMENT

Our objective is to reduce our carbon footprint over the years in support of the global efforts to transition to a low-carbon 

future. To achieve this, we are working on a methodology to measure our Scope 3 emissions with an aim to be able to track 

our carbon footprint and set realistic reduction targets in the future, particularly for our investment portfolios. As a financial 

service group, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our own operations remain low.

MATERIAL FACTOR: 

RIGHT PEOPLE (FINANCIAL REPRESENTATIVES)

WHY THIS IS MATERIAL TO US

Financial Representatives are key partners of Great Eastern as they play an important role in providing financial 

advice and recommending suitable products to people, companies and communities to help customers obtain the 

appropriate insurance coverage.

OUR APPROACH

Recruitment

Standard procedures for recruitment are in place to ensure 

that representatives meet the entry requirements, including 

the fit-and-proper requirements.

Representatives are bound by our Agency Agreement to 

adhere to professional and responsible sales conduct and 

regulatory requirements.

Training and Development

We create segmented and differentiated continual training 

modules for representatives to ensure they remain competent 

and professional. All our modules are mapped to IBF’s 

latest Skills and Competencies framework to ensure our 

representatives meet and align to industry standards.

Enabling our Financial Representatives

We continually refine our digital tools to support our 

representatives in their planning, advisory and servicing 

processes. In 2020, we focused on the integration of remote 

advisory processes that would facilitate advising and servicing 

customers in a non-face-to-face setting during the COVID-19 

pandemic.

OUR TARGETS

• Implement mandatory agency training for all aspiring 

agency directors as a promotion criteria and open same 

training to all leaders as part of their leadership learning 

roadmap in 2021 and beyond

• Continue to work with international bodies to increase 

the number of qualified financial representatives



OUR PERFORMANCE

• Launched remote advisory process for financial 

representatives. This has minimized the disruption to 

the provision of financial advisory and servicing to our 

customers during the COVID-19

MATERIAL FACTOR: 

FINANCIAL INCLUSION

WHY THIS IS MATERIAL TO US

Insurance serves an important social purpose of mitigating uncertainties. We contribute to the cause of financial 

inclusion by making insurance accessible to the community at large. 

OUR APPROACH

We deliver our goals through both public and private initiatives 

on our own or in partnership with others.

Government Schemes

We work with relevant government agencies to support 

government initiatives in providing social safety nets such 

as the long term care insurance scheme in Singapore and 

the MySalam scheme in Malaysia.

Strategic Partnerships

We expand our reach to all customer segments including the 

under-served segments via digital affinity partners. 

OUR TARGET

• Identify under-served segments and design suitable 

products that meet the needs of stakeholders

OUR PERFORMANCE

• Awarded the role of sole national provider of revised 

Dependent Protection Scheme in Singapore.  This initiative 

provides sustainable and affordable basic insurance for 

all Singaporeans and Permanent Residents

• Disbursed RM88.6 million claims to more than 73,000 

covered members under the MySalam scheme in Malaysia.  

We helped raise public awareness of the scheme through 

initiatives including setting up 125 MySalam kiosks located 

at designated hospitals across Malaysia, roadshows at 

related events and mass media marketing via radio and 

TV advertisements

• Developed more than 20 insurance products that were 

sold through our strategic partnerships

MATERIAL FACTOR: 

CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT

WHY THIS IS MATERIAL TO US

A positive customer experience encourages customers to accept appropriate advice and seek appropriate coverage 

to reduce uncertainties.  

OUR APPROACH

Customer Experience

We seek to continuously enhance our engagement with 

policyholders at all life stages by giving them hassle-free 

access to our range of services through both digital and 

personal channels. To ensure we always provide a positive

MATERIAL FACTOR: 

ROBUST GOVERNANCE

WHY THIS IS MATERIAL TO US

We are in the business of providing customers’ financial security and peace of mind. It is imperative that we manage 

our business prudently with high standard of corporate governance and integrity. Our employees and financial 

representatives deal with customers in a fair and ethical manner to ensure that our business practices gain the trust 

of customers and create long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders.

OUR APPROACH

We have implemented several culture and conduct initiatives 

to support a strong and sound culture firmly founded on our 

core values. Our Group Culture and Conduct Governance 

Committee is tasked with the implementation of these 

initiatives to promote stronger governance. There is also a 

dedicated Board Risk Management Committee (RMC) that 

provides oversight on risk governance matters within the 

Group. 

To promote a culture of robust governance across the Group, 

some of our key initiatives include:

Code of Conduct

We have in place Code of Conduct that sets out the standards 

of ethics and professional behaviour expected of employees 

and financial representatives. We expect our people to 

carry out their duties to the best of their ability and with the 

highest standards of ethical conduct. Employees and financial 

representatives are also expected to display a high level of 

courtesy to safeguard customer and company interest during 

or outside their course of work and duties.

Fair Dealing

Delivery of customers Fair Dealing outcomes is tied to the 

performance assessment of senior management.  This ensures 

that senior management takes the prioritisation of Fair Dealing 

practices seriously.

Protection of Customer data

As an insurer with over 1.8 million customers, we are committed 

to protecting the privacy of our customers.

We have in place a Group Data Governance programme 

that sets the foundation where it highlights the principles 

and requirements of the Personal Data Protection Act that 

all staff and financial representatives are required to comply 

to ensure that our customers’ data are well protected, and 

ensure that incidents are escalated and addressed promptly. 

*  DPTM is a voluntary enterprise-wide certification for organisations to demonstrate accountable data protection practices.

#  CBPR System was developed by the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) to build consumer, business and regulator trust in cross 

border flows of personal data. It assesses the organisation’s data privacy policies against APEC Privacy Framework to ensure consistency.

Access to Information

52. 

The Board members are provided with relevant 

and timely information by Management on matters 

to be discussed or considered at meetings of the 

Board and Board Committees. For matters requiring 

approval, information furnished by Management 

usually includes background explanatory information, 

relevant facts and/or analysis to support the proposal, 

implications or merits of the case, risk analysis 

and mitigating strategies, the budget (if applicable) 

and Management’s recommendation. The senior 

management executives who can provide additional 

information and insight or provide clarifications to 

queries raised are usually present at the meeting 

during discussion on such matters. Occasionally, 

external consultants engaged on specific projects 

may also be invited to brief the Board or Board 

Committees, where relevant. All Board and Board 

Committee members have unfettered access to 

information, which the Company is in possession of 

or has access to, for the purpose of carrying out their 

responsibilities.

 

53. 

Information furnished to the Board on an on-going 

basis includes business forecasts, monthly Group 

financials and quarterly reports on the financial 

results and performance of the Group and principal 

subsidiaries within the Group, with explanations 

of material deviations between actual results and 

business plans and/or budgets. Management also 

provides the Board with information on material risks 

exposed by the Company and the Group, including 

credit, market, liquidity and operational risks. 

 

54. 

Directors have separate and independent access to 

the Company Secretary and to senior management 

executives of the Company and the Group at all 

times.

55. 

The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings 

and prepares minutes of Board proceedings. She 

assists the Chairman to ensure that appropriate 

Board procedures are followed and that applicable 

regulations are complied with. Under the direction 

of the Chairman, she ensures good information 

flow within the Board and Board Committees, and 

between senior management executives and non-

executive Directors. The Company Secretary also 

facilitates the orientation of new Directors and 

professional development of Directors, as required. 

The appointment and removal of the Company 

Secretary is considered to be a matter for the Board 

as a whole. 

56. 

The Directors may take independent professional 

advice as and when necessary to enable them to 

discharge their duties effectively. Similarly, the Board 

and Board Committees may obtain professional 

advice, whenever necessary and appropriate, so as to 

effectively discharge their roles and responsibilities. 

All engagements of external advisers are at the 

Company’s expense.

Board Orientation and Development

57. 

Upon the appointment of a new Director, the newly-

appointed Director will be apprised of his/her 

statutory and fiduciary duties and obligations and 

issued a Director’s orientation kit, which will include 

key information on the Company and the Group, 

the terms of reference of the Board and Board 

Committees, duties and obligations of Directors 

as well as relevant rules and regulations. As part 

of the induction programme for new Directors, the 

Group CEO and senior management executives will 

conduct presentation sessions for new Directors on 

the Group’s principal activities, strategic plans and 

business operations and the induction programme 

will be tailored to the specific development needs of 

the new Directors. The Company constantly reviews 

and improves on the contents of such briefings to 

new Directors to take into account any new legislative 

changes which affect the roles and responsibilities 

of Directors and to enable them to have a more 

comprehensive understanding of the Group, the 

insurance business and practices and the Group’s 

financial positions.

58. 

The Nominating Committee ensures that there is a 

continuous professional development programme for 

all Directors, to ensure that they are equipped with 

the appropriate skills and knowledge to perform their 

roles on the Board and Board Committees effectively. 

The Company arranges for new Directors to be briefed 

on areas such as accounting, risk management, 

insurance and for first-time Directors to undergo 

training in roles and responsibilities of directors of 

listed companies as prescribed by the SGX-ST. 

From time to time, the Company organises talks, 

seminars or presentations by external professionals, 

consultants or Management on topics relevant to the 

insurance industry, relevant new laws, regulations 

and changing commercial risks and provides updates 

on developments in the industry locally and in other 

developed countries. Industry-related and topical 

articles are regularly circulated to Directors as part of 

the Company’s continuous development programmes 

for Directors.

in the ordinary course of business, on an arm’s 

length basis and on reasonable commercial terms. 

The Nominating Committee considers them to be 

independent of business relationships as they are 

not involved in the day-to-day conduct of these 

companies’ businesses and is of the view that these 

business relationships do not affect their ability to act 

independently.

69. 

Mr Lee Fook Sun is the non-executive Chairman of 

companies that had business transactions with GEL, 

a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in the 

financial year ended 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). 

The contracts awarded to these companies were 

in accordance with the Group’s procurement 

policy. Aggregated payments to these companies 

were insignificant compared to the Group’s overall 

expenditure in the relevant field for FY2020. As Mr 

Lee serves in a non-executive capacity in these 

companies, he would be substantially removed from 

the actual business transactions between these 

companies and GEL. The Nominating Committee 

considers him to be independent of business 

relationships as he is not involved in the day-to-day 

conduct of those companies’ businesses and is of 

the view that these business relationships do not 

affect his ability to act independently. 

70. 

Under the CG Regulations, Mr Koh Beng Seng is 

deemed non-independent as he has served for more 

than nine years on the Board and he is a Director of 

the Company’s substantial shareholder, Oversea-

Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (“OCBC Bank”). 

The Nominating Committee has determined that 

he is independent from management and business 

relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries.

71. 

Mr Norman Ip is deemed non-independent as he 

has served for more than nine years on the Board. 

However, he is independent from the substantial 

shareholder of the Company, and management and 

business relationships with the Company and its 

subsidiaries.

72. 

Mr Wee Joo Yeow is a non-independent Director as he 

is a member of the Board of OCBC Bank and hence, 

under the CG Regulations, is not independent from 

the substantial shareholder of the Company. As Mr 

Wee Joo Yeow is an independent Director of OCBC 

Bank, he has been determined by the Nominating 

Committee to be independent from management 

and business relationships with the Company and its 

subsidiaries. 

73. 

Mr Samuel N. Tsien is a non-independent Director as 

he is the Group Chief Executive Officer and Executive 

Director of OCBC Bank.

74. 

The current Board complies with the requirements 

on Board composition and Board independence 

under the CG Regulations. Six out of the ten Board 

members are independent Directors and all Board 

members are non-executive Directors.

75. 

The Board, through its Nominating Committee, 

is of the view that the current Board and Board 

Committees are of an appropriate size to facilitate 

effective decision-making, taking into account the 

scope and nature of the operations of the Company 

and the Group.

76. 

A Board Diversity Policy, setting out the approach 

to diversify the appointment of members and 

composition of the Board, is published on the 

Company’s website www.greateasternlife.com. In the 

appointment of Board members, the policy embraces 

the diversity of skills, knowledge, experience, 

including familiarity in the Company’s core markets, 

age, gender and length of service, as well as merit 

and independence. Steps are taken to improve 

effectiveness, where necessary. The Board, through 

its Nominating Committee, assesses the diversity of 

its members’ competency profiles, including gender 

representation, and determines the collective skills 

required to discharge its responsibilities effectively.

REPORT

CORPORATE 

GOVERNANCE REPORT

As at 28 February 2021

77. 

The Company’s Board members have diverse 

backgrounds, experience and qualifications, and 

bring a wide range of commercial and financial 

experience to the Board. Collectively, they provide 

the 

necessary 

business 

acumen, 

knowledge, 

capabilities and core competencies to the Company 

and the Group, including industry knowledge in 

insurance (such as key products and customers) and 

actuarial science, investment and asset management 

(such as real estate and property), knowledge in 

banking, accounting, finance, strategy formulation, 

management 

experience, 

risk 

management, 

technology, transformation management, taxation, 

trust law, cyber security and familiarity with 

regulatory requirements. Several Directors also have 

experience in jurisdictions outside Singapore, such 

as Malaysia, Indonesia and Greater China. At least 

one of the independent Directors has experience in 

the insurance industry. The diversity of experience 

and 

competencies 

of 

the 

Directors 

enhance 

the effectiveness of the Board in discharging its 

responsibilities. Female representation on the Board 

is currently 10%.

78. 

With the knowledge, objectivity and balance 

contributed by the non-executive Directors, the Board 

constructively challenges and enhances proposals 

on strategy, reviews the performance of Management 

against agreed goals and objectives, and monitors 

the reporting of performances.

79. 

The non-executive Directors met twice during the 

year without the presence of Management to discuss 

matters such as the performance and effectiveness 

of Management. 

 

Principle 3: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the 

leadership of the Board and Management, and no one 

individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.

80. 

The Chairman and the Group CEO are not related 

to each other. The roles of the Chairman, Mr 

Koh Beng Seng, and the Group CEO, Mr Khor 

Hock Seng, are distinct and separate, with a 

clear division of responsibilities between them to 

ensure an appropriate balance of power, increased 

accountability and greater independence in decision-

making. The Company has Board-approved internal 

guidelines setting out the scope of authority of the 

Chairman and the Group CEO. 

81. 

The principal responsibilities of the Chairman include 

leading the Board to ensure it effectively discharges 

its roles and responsibilities, approving agendas of 

Board meetings, monitoring the quality and timeliness 

of the flow of information from Management to the 

Board and promoting effective communication with 

shareholders. The Chairman also facilitates robust 

discussions and deliberations in Board meetings, 

encourages constructive relations between the Board 

and Management, and promotes high standards of 

corporate governance with the full support of the other 

Directors, the Company Secretary and Management.

82. 

The Group CEO manages the Company and 

oversees the Group’s operations and implementation 

of the Group’s strategies, plans and policies to 

achieve planned corporate performance and financial 

goals. His management of the Group’s businesses, 

including implementing the Board’s decisions, 

is carried out with the assistance of the senior 

management executives of the Group. Collectively, 

they are responsible for the day-to-day operations 

and administration of the Company and the Group, 

ensuring, inter alia, operational and organisational 

efficiency, profitable performance of the operating 

units, 

regulatory 

compliance, 

good 

corporate 

governance and effective risk management. The 

Board establishes the performance targets of the 

Group CEO and reviews his performance against the 

targets annually.

83. 

The Board has not appointed a Lead Independent 

Director as the Chairman and the Group CEO are 

already separate persons, are not related to each 

other and the Chairman is not involved in the day-

to-day running of the Company’s business and 

operations. The Chairman is independent from 

management and business relationships with the 

Company and its subsidiaries. He is also independent 

of the Management and performs an effective check 

and balance on the Management. The Board has a 

majority of independent Directors and the Directors 

are able to exercise independent and objective 

judgment. As part of its continuous assessment 

of corporate governance standards, the Board will 

appoint a Lead Independent Director when the Board 

situation warrants it.

Principle 4: Board Membership

The Board has a formal and transparent process for the 

appointment and re-appointment of directors, taking into 

account the need for progressive renewal of the Board.

Process for appointment of new Directors

84. 

The Nominating Committee has a key role in carrying 

out the formal and transparent process established 

for the appointment of Directors to the Board. 

Taking into account the competencies and skills 

required by the Board, the Nominating Committee 

establishes annually the profile required of the Board 

members, before making any recommendations 

on the appointment of new Directors, where 

necessary. The Nominating Committee may engage 

external search consultants to source for potential 

candidates. Proposals for the appointment of 

new Directors are reviewed by the Nominating 

Committee. The Nominating Committee meets with 

short-listed candidates to assess their suitability 

and 

commitment. 

Competent 

individuals 

are 

nominated for Board approval after the Nominating 

Committee has assessed their suitability taking into 

consideration, amongst others, their professional 

qualifications, integrity, financial and commercial 

business experience and field of expertise relevant to 

the Group, potential to contribute to the effectiveness 

of the Board and to complement the skills, knowledge 

and expertise of the Board. 

85. 

In addition, the Nominating Committee further 

determines the proposed candidate’s independence 

under the CG Regulations and ensures that the 

proposed candidate would satisfy the criteria under 

the CG Regulations in that his/her appointment 

would not result in non-compliance with any of the 

composition requirements for the Board and Board 

Committees, and that he/she is a fit and proper person 

for the office, taking into account his/her track record, 

age, experience, capabilities, skills and other relevant 

factors as may be determined by the Nominating 

Committee. Such reviews are also conducted on an 

annual basis to ensure that each Director remains 

qualified for the office based on the above criteria. 

 

Re-nomination and Re-election of Directors

86. 

All Directors of the Board are required to submit 

themselves for re-nomination and re-election at 

regular intervals, at least once every three years. At 

each AGM of the Company, one-third of the Directors, 

being those who have served longest in office since 

their re-election, are required to retire by rotation 

in accordance with the Company’s Constitution. 

Pursuant to the Company’s Constitution, newly 

appointed Directors will hold office until the next 

AGM and, if eligible, can stand for re-election. 

Retiring Directors are eligible for re-election when 

re-nominated by the Nominating Committee, taking 

into account the Directors’ attendance at meetings, 

their expertise, knowledge and commitment, and 

their contributions to Board discussions and to the 

effectiveness of the Board.

 

87. 

The Directors who are retiring by rotation under Article 

97 of the Company’s Constitution and standing for re-

election at the 2021 AGM are Mr Norman Ip, Mr Lee 

Fook Sun and Mrs Teoh Lian Ee. Mr Samuel N. Tsien, 

who is retiring under Article 97 of the Company’s 

Constitution, will not be seeking re-election as a 

Director of the Company. Mr Ng Chee Peng, who 

will be appointed as a Director of the Company on 

1 March 2021, will retire under Article 103 of the 

Company’s Constitution and stand for re-election at 

the 2021 AGM. 

88. 

Directors are expected to set aside adequate time for 

their oversight of matters relating to the Company. 

The Directors provide declarations of changes in 

their other appointments which are disseminated to 

all Board members. The Company has established 

guidelines on meeting attendance and the extent 

of other appointments outside the Company that a 

Director may assume. Generally, a Director who has 

full-time employment in any organisation may have 

appointments in no more than three other listed 

companies, while a Director who does not have any 

full-time employment may have appointments in no 

more than six other listed companies. Each of the 

Directors’ listed company directorships and principal 

commitments are provided on Pages 18 to 28 under 

the section “Board of Directors” of this Annual Report. 

The Nominating Committee annually assesses 

each Director’s attendance record and degree of 

participation at meetings to determine if a Director 

is able to and has been diligently discharging his/

her duties as a Director of the Company. All Directors 

have met the requirements under the Nominating 

Committee’s guidelines.


ANNUAL 

REPORT 

2020

CORPORATE 

GOVERNANCE REPORT

As at 28 February 2021

Principle 5: Board Performance 

The Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its 

effectiveness as a whole, and that of each of its board 

committees and individual directors.

89. 

The Board has an annual performance evaluation 

process, carried out by the Nominating Committee, 

to assess the effectiveness of the Board, Board 

Committees and each Director’s contributions. This 

annual assessment process consists principally 

of evaluation by and feedback from each Director. 

Each Director evaluates the performance of the 

Board and Board Committees. The assessment 

of the contributions of individual Directors to the 

effectiveness of the Board is also performed annually. 

Such assessments are made against established 

performance criteria consistent with those approved 

by the Board and used in the previous year. 

 

90. 

An external party is engaged every three years to 

facilitate the Board evaluation process and to provide 

the Board with an independent perspective of the 

Board’s performance, including benchmarks against 

peer boards and industry best practices. 

 

91. 

The 2020 Board evaluation questionnaire focused 

on areas such as competency and independence, 

information quality and timeliness, conduct of 

meetings, corporate social responsibility, managing 

performance, 

succession 

planning, 

Directors’ 

development, internal controls and risk management, 

and Board Committees. With regard to the individual 

Director’s assessment criteria, this would include 

attributes such as each Director’s contribution, 

integrity, knowledge and abilities. The Board 

Chairman and/or Nominating Committee Chairman 

will act upon the feedback provided to enhance the 

Board’s performance.

92. 

The purpose of the evaluation is to increase the overall 

effectiveness of the Board. The Board has found the 

evaluation process useful and constructive since 

its implementation more than ten years ago. This 

collective process has also provided an opportunity 

to obtain insightful feedback from each Director on 

suggestions to enhance the effectiveness of the 

Board.

REMUNERATION MATTERS Principle 6: Procedures for 

Developing Remuneration Policies

The Board has a formal and transparent procedure 

for developing policies on director and executive 

remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages 

of individual directors and key management personnel. 

No director is involved in deciding his or her own 

remuneration.

93. 

The objective of the Group’s remuneration policy is to 

attract, motivate, reward and retain quality personnel.

 

94. 

In considering its recommendations to the Board 

and in approving remuneration, the Remuneration 

Committee ensures that remuneration policies are 

in line with the Group’s strategic objectives and 

corporate values, and do not give rise to conflicts 

between the objectives of the Company and interests 

of individual Directors and key executives.

 

95. 

The Remuneration Committee is tasked to review and 

recommend to the Board the general remuneration 

framework as well as the specific remuneration 

for each Director and for each key executive. The 

composition and summary terms of reference of 

the Remuneration Committee are provided on Page 

84 of this Annual Report. No Director is involved 

in the deliberations regarding any remuneration, 

compensation or any form of benefits to be granted 

to himself/herself.

 

96. 

The Remuneration Committee members are well-

versed in executive compensation matters, given 

their extensive experience in senior corporate 

positions and major appointments. They also have 

access to expert advice from external independent 

remuneration consultants, where necessary. The 

Remuneration Committee will ensure that existing 

relationships, if any, between the Company and its 

appointed remuneration consultants will not affect 

the independence and objectivity of the remuneration 

consultants. 

97. 

In 2020, Willis Towers Watson provided independent 

advisory 

services 

on 

the 

Group’s 

executive 

compensation 

framework 

to 

ensure 

greater 

alignment of pay policies and practices with market 

and regulatory standards. Willis Towers Watson is 

not related to the Company and the Company is 

not aware of any business or personal relationship 

between Willis Towers Watson and the Company’s 

Directors and key management executives.

The Company does not provide any termination,

management personnel.

Principle 7: Level and Mix of Remuneration

The level and structure of remuneration of the Board 

and key management personnel are appropriate and 

proportionate to the sustained performance and value 

creation of the company, taking into account the 

strategic objectives of the company.

Remuneration of non-executive Directors

99. 

The non-executive Directors are paid Directors’ fees, 

which take into account factors such as the Directors’ 

contributions, effort and time spent, attendance 

at meetings and the frequency of meetings, the 

respective responsibilities of the Directors including 

the Board Committees on which they serve, market 

practices and the need to pay competitive fees to 

attract, retain and motivate Directors. 

 

100. 

The Remuneration Committee performs an annual 

review of the structure for Directors’ fees and of the 

computation of the aggregate Directors’ fees based 

on the earlier Board-approved fee structure, before 

recommending any proposed changes to the Board 

for endorsement. The Directors’ fees proposed by 

the Board each year are subject to shareholders’ 

approval at the Company’s AGM.

 

101. 

In its review of the non-executive Directors’ 

remuneration, the Remuneration Committee can 

seek expert advice, if necessary. No consultant 

was engaged in 2020 to provide advice on the 

remuneration of non-executive Directors.

102. 

The Remuneration Committee has considered 

the market practices for non-executive Directors’ 

compensation and, on its recommendation, the 

Board has decided to use the same fee structure for 

computing the fee for each non-executive Director for 

FY2020 as that used in the previous financial year (in 

the following table):

The remuneration of the Group CEO and the key 

senior management executives who report directly 

to the Group CEO are reviewed annually by the 

Remuneration Committee, based on the overall 

remuneration framework approved by the Board. 

 

104. 

In such annual reviews, the Remuneration Committee 

takes into consideration factors such as market 

competitiveness and market benchmark, and that 

the remuneration is commensurate with individual 

performance and contribution. The Remuneration 

Committee also takes into account the time horizon of 

risks, such as ensuring that all variable compensation 

payments shall not be fully paid over short periods 

when risks are realised over longer periods. 

 


ANNUAL 

REPORT 

2020

CORPORATE 

GOVERNANCE REPORT

As at 28 February 2021

105. 

As part of the Company’s continuous efforts to create 

sustainable value for stakeholders through broad-

based growth across its core markets, delivering 

sustained earnings, driving core competencies of 

disciplined risk management, prudent investment 

and continued upgrading of technology and people, 

and ensuring sustainable business practices, the 

performance measures set for each business 

unit embeds these objectives, which match their 

functions and are consistent with the Group’s risk 

appetite. In determining the remuneration of key 

senior management executives, risk and control 

indicators as well as audit findings and compliance 

issues are taken into account when assessing their 

overall performance, in addition to their achievement 

in business and operation performance. Executives 

are remunerated based on the achievements of their 

own performance measures, and the demonstration 

of core values and competencies, while taking 

into account market compensation data for their 

respective job roles. 

 

Principle 8: Disclosure on Remuneration

The company is transparent on its remuneration 

policies, level and mix of remuneration, the procedure 

for setting remuneration, and the relationships between 

remuneration, performance and value creation.

106. 

To ensure that its remuneration packages are 

competitive, the Company regularly reviews salary 

levels and benefits packages based on market data 

provided by recognised consultants who conduct 

surveys on comparative groups in the financial sector. 

The determination of the Company’s variable bonus 

pool is fully discretionary and the factors taken into 

consideration include financial and non-financial 

metrics such as the Company’s performance, audit 

ratings, risk indicators and compliance issues, market 

conditions and competitive market practices.

 

107. 

The total compensation packages for key senior 

management executives comprise basic salary, 

various performance bonus, allowances, deferred 

share awards and benefits. The variable components 

have been designed to link rewards to corporate 

and individual performance, based on appropriate 

and meaningful performance measures set up by 

the Company, and approved by the Remuneration 

Committee and the Board. 

108. 

The annual budget for salary increment and 

performance-related 

variable 

bonus, 

reviewed 

and approved by the Remuneration Committee, 

is submitted to the Board for endorsement and 

approval.

109. 

As a consequence of the financial crisis in recent years, 

financial institutions globally have been reviewing 

compensation practices to reduce incentives that 

encourage excessive risk taking. While the Company 

has adopted compensation practices that take into 

account the principles and implementation standards 

issued by the Financial Stability Forum for Sound 

Compensation Practices, it also continues to review 

its compensation practices on an on-going basis to 

further ensure that decisions made are conducive for 

sustained business performance. In its deliberations, 

the Remuneration Committee also takes into account 

the remuneration principles, practices and standards 

that may be specified by MAS from time to time. 

 

110. 

The Company has identified a group of senior 

executives whose authorities and actions are 

deemed to have a major influence on the long term 

performance of the Company. This group, identified 

as “Material Risk Takers” comprises the Group CEO 

and his direct reports, key personnel at business 

units and senior control staff. Employees who are not 

senior staff but are identified as “Material Risk Takers” 

are also included in this group. For the “Material 

Risk Takers” with performance bonuses exceeding 

$100,000 in Singapore, at least 40% of their entire 

bonuses are deferred in the form of shares. 

Share-based incentives

111. 

The Company does not have any share option scheme 

or share plan in place. Instead, the Company’s holding 

company, OCBC Bank, grants share awards pursuant 

to the OCBC Deferred Share Plan to selected senior 

executives of the Group, based on recommendations 

of the Remuneration Committee. The Company has 

ceased granting OCBC share options to eligible 

executives with effect from FY2019 for FY2018 

performance.

 

112. 

Details of the share options (granted previously) and 

the award of deferred shares to the Company’s eligible 

executives are disclosed in the financial statements. 

Further details of the above share option scheme and 

share plan are set out in Note 29 of the Notes to the 

Financial Statements and in OCBC Bank’s Annual 

Report. 

113. 

All grants and awards are subject to cancellation 

and clawback if it is determined that they were 

made on the basis of materially inaccurate financial 

statements and/or the employee has engaged in 

conduct that results in financial loss, reputational 

harm, restatement of financial results and/or adverse 

changes of the Company’s risk profile/rating.

Remuneration of Top Five Key Management Personnel 

in 2020

115.  The Code recommends the disclosure of the 

individual remuneration of the Company’s top five key 

management personnel as well as their aggregate 

remuneration. The Board has considered this matter 

carefully and has decided against such a disclosure 

for the time being as it is not a standard business 

practice to do so, having taken into account the highly 

competitive conditions for talent in the industry.

Remuneration of Immediate Family of Directors / Group 

CEO / Substantial Shareholder

116.  None of the Directors or the Group CEO of the 

Company had immediate family members who 

were employees of the Company in 2020. As the 

Company’s substantial shareholder, OCBC Bank, is 

not an individual, the disclosure on remuneration of 

employees who are immediate family of substantial 

shareholders is not applicable.

ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT 

Principle 9: Risk Management and Internal Controls

The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and 

ensures that Management maintains a sound system of 

risk management and internal controls, to safeguard the 

interests of the company and its shareholders.

117. 

The Board is responsible for the governance of 

risk. It sets the tone for the Company’s risk culture 

and monitors, through the Risk Management 

Committee, the effectiveness and adequacy of the 

risk management processes and systems of the 

Company and its principal subsidiaries. The Board 

approves the Company’s risk appetite and has 

oversight of the risk activities to ensure that the 

Company’s strategic intent, operating environment, 

internal control mechanisms and capital sufficiency 

are consistent with the Company’s risk appetite and 

regulatory standards. Further details of the Enterprise 

Risk Management Framework implemented by the 

Company are set out in Note 33 of the Notes to the

of institutionalising a strong risk culture within the 

Company. As a subset of the broader organisational 

culture, a strong risk culture supports appropriate risk 

awareness, bolsters effective risk management and 

promotes sound risk taking to ensure the Company’s 

risk profile remains within its risk appetite. The Board 

also approves the risk culture principles and, along 

with it, the set of desired risk culture behaviours 

to support the target risk culture throughout the 

Company. 

 

Accountability

119. 

The Company has in place a process for Management 

to represent to the Board on the integrity of the 

Company’s and the Group’s financial statement and 

internal control system in relation to the requirement 

under the listing manual of the SGX-ST for the Board 

to issue an assurance statement that accompanies 

the Company’s announcements of its interim and full 

year financial results. Following Singapore Exchange 

Regulation’s 

removal 

of 

mandatory 

quarterly 

reporting from 7 February 2020, the Company 

provided abridged financial disclosures for its first 

and third quarters for FY2020. These disclosures 

supplemented the mandatory reporting of its half year 

and full year financial statements.

120. 

The Board is kept apprised of material changes in 

legislations and regulatory requirements, including 

requirements under the listing manual of the SGX-

ST. The Board takes necessary steps to ensure that 

the Company complies with these requirements. In 

compliance with the SGX-ST Listing Rule 720(1), 

the Company has procured undertakings from its 

Directors and key executive officers in the form 

prescribed by the SGX-ST.

 

121. 

To keep Board members informed and updated, 

Management provides the Board with monthly 

financial updates on the performance and position 

of the Group. The Board is also updated on any 

significant events that have occurred or affected the 

industry during the year.

Internal Controls

122. 

The Board is responsible for ensuring that the 

Company’s system of internal controls is adequate to 

safeguard shareholders’ interests and the Company’s 

assets. The Company has in place, self-assessment 

processes for all business units to assess the adequacy 

and effectiveness of their systems and processes 

of internal controls, and their level of compliance 

with applicable rules and regulations. The results 

of evaluations are reviewed by senior management 

executives. The Board has received assurance from 

the Group CEO (which includes assurance provided 

by key management personnel to the Group CEO) on 

the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management 

and internal control systems. The Board also received 

assurance from the Group CEO and Group CFO that 

the financial records have been properly maintained 

and the financial statements give a true and fair view 

of the Company’s operations and financial position.

 

123. 

Based on the internal controls established and 

maintained by the Group, work performed by the 

internal and external auditors, and reviews performed 

by Management and various Board Committees, 

the Board, with the concurrence of the Audit and 

Risk Management Committees, is of the view that 

the system of internal controls, including financial, 

operational, compliance and information technology 

controls as well as risk management systems, were 

adequate and effective as at 31 December 2020, to 

address the risks which the Group considers relevant 

and material to its operations. 

 

124. 

The system of internal controls provides reasonable, 

but not absolute, assurance that the Group will 

not be adversely affected by any event that could 

be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its 

business objectives. However, the Board also notes 

that no system of internal controls can provide 

absolute assurance in this regard, or absolute 

assurance against the occurrence of material errors, 

poor judgment in decision-making, human error, 

losses, fraud or other irregularities.

127. 

The Audit Committee undertook a review of all 

relationships between the Group and the external 

auditor (including non-audit services provided by the 

external auditor) for FY2020, and is satisfied that the 

provision of such non-audit services would not, in 

its opinion, affect the independence of the external 

auditor. Please refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the 

Financial Statements for details of fees payable to 

the external auditor in respect of audit and non-audit 

services.

 

128. 

Taking into account the aforesaid and other factors 

such as the size and complexity of the Group and the 

adequacy of resources and experience of the external 

auditor, the Audit Committee has recommended the 

re-appointment of PwC as the external auditor at the 

2021 AGM. The Company has complied with Rules 

712 and 715 of the listing manual of the SGX-ST in 

relation to its external auditor. 

129. 

The Audit Committee, in performing its functions, 

met at least annually with the internal and external 

auditors in separate sessions without the presence 

of Management, to consider any other matters which 

may be raised privately. The auditors, both internal 

and external, have unrestricted access to the Audit 

Committee, and to information and such persons 

within the Group as necessary to conduct the audit.

Whistle-Blowing Policy

130.  The Group has a whistle-blowing policy in place 

whereby staff of the Group and external parties may 

raise concerns on possible improprieties in matters 

of financial reporting or other matters in confidence. 

The whistle-blowing policy and procedures for 

raising such concerns are disclosed and clearly 

communicated to employees. All whistle-blowing 

incidents will be reported to the Audit Committee. 

Concerns expressed anonymously will be considered 

and investigated on the basis of their merits. The Audit 

Committee ensures that arrangements are in place 

for the independent investigation of such matters 

and for appropriate follow-up action. If fraud is 

determined, appropriate remedial action will be taken 

and the Audit Committee will be updated regularly 

on its status. The whistle-blower will have protection 

against reprisals provided he/she has acted in good 

faith.

Internal Audit

131. 

The internal audit function (“Group Internal Audit”) 

serves to provide the Board and Management 

with an independent appraisal of the reliability, 

adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal 

controls established by Management, to ensure that 

transactions are promptly and accurately recorded 

and that the Group’s assets are safeguarded. Group 

Internal Audit resides in-house and is independent 

of the activities it audits. The Audit Manual and 

Audit Frequency Matrix are approved by the Audit 

Committee.

Group Internal Audit adopts a risk-based approach 

where audit work is prioritised and scoped according 

to an assessment of risk exposures, including not 

only financial risks, but operational, technology, 

compliance and strategic risks as well. The work 

undertaken by Group Internal Audit involves the 

assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of 

the Group’s risk management and internal control 

framework, including ascertaining if the internal 

controls are sufficient in ensuring prompt and 

accurate recording of transactions and the adequate 

safeguarding of assets. Reviews conducted by Group 

Internal Audit also focus on the Group’s compliance 

with relevant laws and regulations, adherence to 

established policies and processes and whether 

Management has taken appropriate measures to 

address control deficiencies. 

 

133. 

The Group Chief Internal Auditor reports to the 

Chairman of the Audit Committee and administratively 

to the Group CEO. His annual remuneration, 

evaluation, appointment, resignation and removal are 

approved by the Audit Committee. 

 

134. 

Group Internal Audit is staffed by executives with 

the relevant qualifications and experience, and the 

Audit Committee ensures that Group Internal Audit 

is adequately resourced. Group Internal Audit has 

unfettered access to the Board, the Audit Committee 

and senior management executives, where necessary, 

and has the right to seek information and explanations, 

as well as access to all the Company’s documents, 

records, properties and personnel. Group Internal 

Audit meets or exceeds the International Standards 

for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing of 

The Institute of Internal Auditors.

 

135. 

Group Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee 

its annual or periodic plan and the proposed areas 

of audit focus, factors that may adversely affect the 

Group Internal Audit’s independence, objectivity 

or effectiveness and material findings from audits 

conducted. During the year, Group Internal Audit 

carried out audits on selected significant business 

units in the Group, including an audit review of 

the IT systems. Group Internal Audit’s summary 

of major findings and recommendations and 

Management’s related responses were discussed 

at Audit Committee meetings. The Audit Committee 

ensures that procedures are in place to follow-up on 

the recommendations by Group Internal Audit in a 

timely manner and to closely monitor any outstanding 

issues. The Audit Committee also reviews annually 

the adequacy, independence and effectiveness of the 

internal audit function.

139. 

Pursuant to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) 

(Alternative 

Arrangements 

for 

Meetings 

for 

Companies, Variable Capital Companies, Business 

Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture Holders) Order 

2020, the Company adjourned and held its AGM 

(originally scheduled to be held on 15 April 2020) by 

way of electronic means on 14 May 2020. The notice 

of the adjourned AGM, new proxy form and details 

of the alternative arrangements for the adjourned 

AGM were published via SGXNET and were also 

made available on the Company’s website. Due 

to the Covid-19 restriction orders in Singapore, 

shareholders were not able to attend the adjourned 

AGM in person. Shareholders participated by 

observing and/or listening to the proceedings of the 

AGM via live audio-visual webcast or live audio-only 

stream and their questions were submitted to the 

Company in advance of the adjourned AGM.

140. 

The 

Company’s 

Constitution 

provides 

that 

shareholders may appoint not more than two 

proxies to attend and speak at the Company’s AGM 

and/or EGM and to vote in their stead. Relevant 

intermediaries (which has the meaning ascribed 

to it in Section 181 of the Companies Act (Chapter 

50)) may appoint more than two proxies to attend, 

speak and vote at the Company’s AGM and/or EGM. 

This will enable indirect investors, including Central 

Provident Fund Board’s investors to be appointed 

as proxies to participate at general meetings. 

To ensure authenticity of shareholder identity 

and other related security issues, the Company 

currently does not allow voting in absentia by mail, 

email or fax. Pursuant to the COVID-19 (Temporary 

Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings for 

Companies, Variable Capital Companies, Business 

Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture Holders) Order 

2020, voting at the adjourned AGM in 2020 was by 

proxy only. Shareholders who wished to exercise their 

voting rights at the adjourned AGM appointed the 

Chairman of the AGM as their proxy by completing 

and submitting the proxy form 72 hours before the 

time for holding the adjourned AGM.

141. 

Since 2012, the Company has conducted electronic 

poll voting for all resolutions passed at the AGM, 

for greater transparency in the voting process. 

Shareholders are informed of the rules, including 

voting procedures that govern the proceedings of 

general meetings of shareholders. Detailed results 

of the votes, showing the number of votes cast for 

and against each resolution and the respective 

percentages, are instantaneously displayed at the 

Company’s AGM and subsequently announced via 

SGXNET on the same day. An independent scrutineer 

is engaged to review the voting process and address 

shareholders’ queries on the voting procedures.

 

142. 

For the Company’s AGM, separate resolutions are 

set out on distinct issues, such as the proposed re-

election of Directors, proposed Directors’ fees and 

recommendation of final dividend. For the Company’s 

EGM, the proposed corporate action or transaction, 

as applicable, and the rationale and other pertinent 

details for such proposal are set out in a separate 

circular to shareholders, with the proposed resolution 

set out for approval by shareholders at the EGM. The 

Company does not “bundle” resolutions, unless the 

resolutions are interdependent and linked so as to 

form one significant proposal. 

 

143. 

At the Company’s previous AGMs, the Chairman and 

Directors, the chairpersons of all Board Committees, 

Group CEO, Management and the Company’s 

professional advisers would be present and available 

to address queries from shareholders. The external 

auditor would also be present to address any 

shareholders’ queries about the conduct of the audit 

and the preparation and content of the auditor’s 

report. At the Company’s 2020 AGM which was 

conducted via electronic means, the Chairman and 

Directors, the chairpersons of all Board Committees, 

Group CEO, Management and the Company’s 

professional advisers and external auditor were either 

present in person or attended via electronic means. 

Questions submitted by shareholders in advance of 

the 2020 AGM were addressed during the 2020 AGM. 

144. 

The Company Secretary prepares minutes of 

general meetings that include responses from the 

Board and Management to the relevant comments

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OUR OPINION

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Great Eastern Holdings Limited (“the Company”) 

and its subsidiaries (“the Group”), the balance sheet and the statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly 

drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 (“the Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting 

Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and 

the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2020 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated 

changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on 

that date. 

What we have audited

The financial statements of the Company and the Group comprise:

• 

the consolidated profit or loss statement of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020;

• 

the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of the Group for the year then ended;

• 

the balance sheets of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2020;

• 

the statements of changes in equity of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended;

• 

the consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the year then ended; and

BASIS FOR OPINION

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under those 

standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional 

Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements 

that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

OTHER MATTER

The financial statements for the preceding financial year were reported on by an audit firm other than PricewaterhouseCoopers 

LLP. The auditor’s report dated 18 February 2020 issued by the predecessor audit firm on the financial statements for the 

financial year ended 31 December 2019 was unqualified.

OUR AUDIT APPROACH

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the accompanying 

financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgments; for example, in respect 

of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 

uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among 

other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to 

fraud. 

Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 

statements for the year ended 31 December 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 

statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

As at 31 December 2020, the Group has life 

insurance contract liabilities of S$85,687.8 million 

representing approximately 88% of the Group’s 

total liabilities. 

We performed the following audit procedures to address this matter: 

• 

We understood the actuarial valuation process, including model 

changes and assumptions setting; 

• 

We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls 

over the accuracy and completeness of the data used;

• 

We understood the valuation methodologies used, identified 

changes in methodologies from previous valuation and 

assessed the reasonableness and impact for material changes 

identified. We carried out these procedures by applying our 

industry knowledge and experience and assessed whether 

the methodologies and changes to those methodologies are 

consistent with recognised actuarial practices and expectations 

derived from market experience;

How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter

Valuation of life insurance contract liabilities 

(continued)

Management’s valuation of life insurance contract 

liabilities uses complex actuarial methods and 

models. The valuation process involves significant 

judgment about the assumptions of uncertain 

future events, including: mortality, morbidity, 

expense, lapse, surrender and interest rates.

In addition to historical experience, management 

judgment is involved in the application of these 

assumptions. Changes in these assumptions 

used could result in a material impact to the 

valuation of the life insurance contract liabilities 

and the related movements in the consolidated 

profit or loss statement of the Group. 

• 

We performed an independent review of model points on a 

sample basis to assess that the methodologies and assumptions 

have been applied appropriately;

• 

We assessed the reasonableness of the key assumptions used 

by management including: mortality, morbidity, expense, lapse, 

surrender and interest rates, by comparing against the Group’s 

historical experiences and market observable data, where 

applicable; 

• 

We reviewed the reasonableness of the movement analysis of 

the insurance contract liabilities prepared by management. The 

movement analysis provides a reconciliation of the balance as 

at 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020, showing the key 

drivers of the changes during the year; and

• 

We assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the 

financial statements. 

Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we found 

the methodologies and assumptions used by management to be 

appropriate. Our audit procedures on the disclosures showed that they 

were in accordance with the relevant SFRS(I) disclosure requirements.

Valuation of provision for current income tax 

and deferred tax 

Refer to the following notes in the consolidated 

financial statements: Note 2.12.1 Current Income 

Tax, Note 2.12.2 Deferred Tax, Note 2.30(b) Critical 

accounting estimates and judgments on income 

taxes and Note 8 Income Tax.

We performed the following audit procedures to address this matter: 

• 

We reviewed the reasonableness of the current income tax and 

deferred tax liabilities determined by management and evaluated 

the judgments and assumptions applied by management to 

estimate the probabilities and amounts; 

• 

We examined the correspondences with the tax authority to 

identify potential tax exposures; and

How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter

Valuation of provision for current income tax 

and deferred tax (continued)

As at 31 December 2020, the Group has 

recognised a current income tax payable of 

S$225.5 million and net deferred tax liabilities of 

S$1,484.6 million.

The Group operates in various countries and is 

subject to income taxes in those jurisdictions. 

There is an inherent uncertainty involved in the 

calculation of current income tax and deferred tax. 

There are significant open tax positions. The final 

tax outcome determined by the tax authority may 

be different from the amounts initially recorded, 

resulting in changes in the tax provisions made in 

prior periods.

• 

We assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the 

financial statements. 

Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we found 

management’s assessment of the current income tax payable and 

net deferred tax liabilities is reasonable. Our audit procedures on the 

disclosures showed that they were in accordance with the relevant 

SFRS(I) disclosure requirements. 

OTHER INFORMATION 

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’ Statement, Sustainability 

Report and List of Major Properties (but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon), which we 

obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and the other sections of the annual report (“the Other Sections”), which are 

expected to be made available to us after that date.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 

conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, 

in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 

obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, 

we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 

nothing to report in this regard.

When we read the Other Sections, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 

the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.

INDEPENDENT 

AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the Members of Great Eastern Holdings Limited

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 

the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient 

to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and 

transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair 

financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going 

concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 

management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process. 

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 

is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a 

material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 

or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 

these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism 

throughout the audit. We also:

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 

and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 

to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 

for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 

override of internal control.

• 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 

in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 

control.

• 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 

disclosures made by management.

• 

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 

audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 

doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 

are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 

disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 

the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a 

going concern.

• 

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 

whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 

presentation.

• 

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities 

within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 

supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 

audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 

independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 

our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit 

of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our 

auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 

we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 

reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary 

corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the 

provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Hans Koopmans.

The Directors expect that the adoption of the new standards above will not have any material impact on the 

financial statements in the year of initial application, except as below.

SFRS(I) 17 Insurance Contracts

SFRS(I) 17 was issued in March 2018 as replacement for SFRS(I) 4 Insurance Contracts. The Accounting 

Standards Council Singapore (“ASC”) has issued Amendments to SFRS(I) 17 on 27 November 2020 to defer 

the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. 

It is a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, 

presentation and disclosure. SFRS(I) 17 requires a general model where estimates are re-measured in each 

reporting period. Contracts are measured using the building blocks of:

 

 

• 

discounted probability-weighted cash flows;

 

 

• 

an explicit risk adjustment; and

 

 

• 

a contractual service margin representing the unearned profit of the contract which is recognised as 

revenue over the coverage period.

Changes in Accounting Policies (continued)

2.2.2 SFRS(I) not yet effective (continued)

The general model is supplemented by:

 

 

• 

a simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short duration contracts; and

 

 

• 

a modification of the general measurement model (the variable fee approach) for contracts with direct 

participation features. 

SFRS(I) 17 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with comparative figures 

required. Retrospective application is required. However, if full retrospective application for a group of insurance 

contracts is impracticable, then the entity is required to choose either a modified retrospective approach or a 

fair value approach. The Group plans to adopt SFRS(I) 17 on the required effective date and a Project Steering 

Committee was formed to oversee the implementation of the standard. The Group expects that SFRS(I) 17 

will result in an important change to the accounting policies for insurance contract liabilities of the Group and 

is likely to have a significant impact on profit and total equity together with the Group’s financial statements’ 

presentation and disclosures.

Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (“IBOR”) – Phase 2

The amendments to SFRS(I) 9, SFRS(I) 1-39, SFRS(I) 7, SFRS(I) 4, SFRS(I) 16 was issued in November 2020 

by the ASC to address issues that arise during the reform of an interest rate benchmark rate, including the 

replacement of one benchmark rate with an alternative one.

The key reliefs provided by the Phase 2 amendments are as follows:

 

 

• 

Changes to contractual cash flow: When changing the basis for determining contractual cash flows for 

financial assets and liabilities (including lease liabilities), the reliefs have the effect that the changes that 

are required by an interest rate benchmark reform (that is, are necessary as a direct consequence of 

IBOR reform and are economically equivalent) will not result in an immediate gain or loss in the income 

statement. 

 

 

• 

Hedge accounting: The hedge accounting reliefs will allow most SFRS(I) 9 hedge relationships that 

are directly affected by IBOR reform to continue. However, additional ineffectiveness might need to be 

recorded.

The amendments should be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The Group is 

in the process of identifying the financial instruments that are affected, and working with the companies on 

making IBOR-related amendments to contracts.

Basis of Consolidation and Business Combinations

2.3.1 Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries 

as at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of 

the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent 

accounting policies are applied to like transactions and events in similar circumstances, except for insurance 

contract liabilities (note 2.10). A list of the Company’s significant subsidiaries is shown in Note 3.

All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group 

transactions and dividends are eliminated. 

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, 

and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.

Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity 

transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:

 

 

– 

De-recognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts 

at the date when control is lost;

 

 

– 

De-recognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;

 

 

– 

De-recognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;

 

 

– 

Recognises the fair value of the consideration received;

 

 

– 

Recognises the fair value of any investment retained;

 

 

– 

Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;

 

 

– 

Re-classifies the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income 

to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

2.3  

Basis of Consolidation and Business Combinations (continued)

2.3.2 Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Identifiable assets acquired and 

liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 

Acquisition-related costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the 

services are received. 

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and financial liabilities assumed for 

appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances 

and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. 

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition 

date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or 

liability will be recognised in profit or loss. 

On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest at fair value, or at 

the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Other components 

of non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair value, unless another measurement basis 

is required by another SFRS(I).

Any excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the 

amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), and the fair value of the Group’s previously held 

equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities 

is recorded as goodwill. The accounting policy for goodwill is set out in Note 2.22. In instances where the 

latter amount exceeds the former, the excess is recognised as gain on bargain purchase in profit or loss on the 

acquisition date.

2.4 

Subsidiaries 

A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has 

rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its 

power over the investee.

In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment 

losses, if any.

2.5 

Structured Entities

A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control and is 

generally established for a narrow and well-defined objective.

For the purpose of disclosure, the Group would be considered to sponsor a structured entity if it has a key role in 

establishing the structured entity or its name appears in the overall structure of the structured entity.

2.6 

Joint Arrangements

A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is 

the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant 

activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 

A joint arrangement is classified either as joint operation or joint venture, based on the rights and obligations of the 

parties to the arrangement. 

To the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities 

relating to the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint operation. To the extent the joint arrangement provides the 

Group with rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint venture. 

The Group recognises its interests in a joint venture as an investment and accounts for the investment using the equity 

method. The accounting policy for investment in a joint venture is set out in Note 2.7.

2.7 

Associates and Joint Ventures

Associates are entities over which the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions 

of the investee but does not have control or joint control of those policies.

The Group accounts for its investment in associates and joint ventures using the equity method from the date on which 

it becomes an associate or joint venture. If the investment in an associate is held by, or is held indirectly through, an 

entity that is a venture capital organisation, or a mutual fund, unit trust and similar entities including investment-linked 

insurance funds, the Group may elect to measure that investment at fair value through profit or loss in accordance 

with SFRS(I) 9. The Group will make this election separately for each associate, at initial recognition of the associate 

or joint venture.

On acquisition of the investment, an excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value 

of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted as goodwill and is included in the carrying amount of 

the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities 

over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the entity’s share of the associate or joint 

venture’s profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.

Under the equity method, investments in associates or joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus 

post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associates or joint ventures. The profit or loss 

reflects the share of results of operations of the associates or joint ventures. Distributions received from joint ventures 

or associates reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Where there has been a change recognised in other 

comprehensive income by the associates or joint ventures, the Group recognises its share of such changes in other 

comprehensive income. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associates 

or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associates or joint ventures.

When the Group’s share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint 

venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf 

of the associate or joint venture.

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an additional 

impairment loss on the Group’s investment in its associates or joint ventures. The Group determines at the end of each 

reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in an associate or joint venture is impaired. 

If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of 

the associate or joint venture and the respective carrying value and recognises the amount in the profit or loss.

The financial statements of the associates and joint ventures are prepared as of the same reporting date as the 

Company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

2.7 

Associates and Joint Ventures (continued)

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures the 

retained investment at fair value. Any difference between the fair value of the aggregate of the retained interest and 

proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the investment at the date the equity method was discontinued 

is recognised in profit or loss.

If the Group’s ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture is reduced, but the Group continues to apply the 

equity method, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been 

recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be 

required to be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities. 

2.8 

Transactions with Non-Controlling Interests

Non-controlling interest represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to shareholders of 

the Company, and is presented separately in the Consolidated Profit or Loss Statement, Consolidated Statement of 

Comprehensive Income and within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from Shareholders’ Equity. 

An exception to this occurs when non-controlling interests arise through minority unit holders’ interest in consolidated 

investment funds, when they are recognised as a liability, reflecting the net assets of the consolidated entity. These 

interests qualify as a financial liability as they give the holder the right to put the instrument back to the issuer for cash. 

Changes in these liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Profit or Loss Statement as expenses.

Changes in the Company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for 

as equity transactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests 

are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by 

which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised 

directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.

2.9 

Foreign Currency Conversion and Translation

2.9.1 Functional and Presentation Currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency 

of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The Group’s 

consolidated financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars, which is also the Company’s functional 

and presentation currency. 

 

2.9.2 Transactions and Balances 

Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company and its 

subsidiaries and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating 

those ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 

translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are 

measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the 

dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 

using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. 

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the end 

of the reporting period are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement except for exchange differences arising 

on monetary items that form part of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations, which are recognised 

initially in other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currency translation reserve in equity. 

The foreign currency translation reserve is reclassified from equity to profit or loss of the Group on disposal 

of the foreign operation. Exchange differences on items such as equity investments classified as fair value 

through other comprehensive income financial assets are included in the fair value reserve in equity.

2.9.3 Consolidated Financial Statements

For consolidation purposes, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Singapore Dollars 

at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period. The Profit or Loss Statement is translated 

at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising from the 

translation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as foreign currency translation reserve. 

On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences recognised in other 

comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement 

as gain or loss on disposal of the operation.

In the case of a partial disposal without loss of control of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the 

proportionate share of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling 

interest and is not recognised in Profit or Loss Statement. For partial disposals of associates or jointly controlled 

entities that are foreign operations, the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is 

reclassified to the Profit or Loss Statement.

2.10 

INSURANCE CONTRACTS 

2.10.1 Product Classification

Insurance contracts are those contracts where the Group (the insurer) has accepted significant insurance risk 

from the policyholders by agreeing to compensate the policyholders if a specified uncertain future event (the 

insured event) adversely affects the policyholders. As a general guideline, the Group determines whether it has 

significant insurance risk, by comparing benefits paid with benefits payable if the insured event did not occur. 

Insurance contracts can also transfer financial risk.

Investment contracts are contracts that may transfer financial risk but do not transfer significant insurance 

risk. Financial risk is the risk of a possible future change in one or more of a specified interest rate, financial 

instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of price or rates, credit rating or credit index 

or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to 

the contract.

Once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract, it remains an insurance contract for the remainder 

of its lifetime, even if the insurance risk reduces significantly during this period, unless all rights and obligations 

are extinguished or expired. 

Insurance and investment contracts are further classified as being either with or without discretionary 

participating features (“DPF”). DPF is a contractual right to receive, as a supplement to guaranteed benefits, 

additional benefits that are:

 

 

• 

Likely to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits;

 

 

• 

Whose amount or timing is contractually at the discretion of the issuer; and contractually based on the:

 

 

 

• 

Performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract,

 

 

 

• 

Realised and/or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer, or

 

 

 

• 

The profit or loss of the company, fund or other entity that issues the contract.

Insurance Contracts (continued)

2.10.1 Product Classification (continued)

For financial options and guarantees which are not closely related to the host insurance contract with DPF, 

bifurcation is required to measure these embedded derivatives separately at fair value through the Profit or 

Loss Statement. However, bifurcation is not required if the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract 

with DPF, or if the host insurance contract itself is measured at fair value through the Profit or Loss Statement.

For the purpose of SFRS(I) 4, the Group adopts maximum policy benefits as the proxy for insurance risk and 

cash surrender value or discounted maturity value as the proxy for realisable value of the insurance contract. 

The Group defines insurance risk to be significant when the ratio of the insurance risk over the deposit 

component is not less than 105% of the deposit component at inception of the insurance contract. Based on 

this definition, all policy contracts issued by insurance subsidiaries within the Group are considered insurance 

contracts as at the balance sheet date.

The insurance subsidiaries within the Group write insurance contracts in accordance with the local Insurance 

Regulations prevailing in the jurisdictions in which the insurance subsidiaries operate. 

2.10.2 Types of Insurance Contracts

Insurance contract liabilities are classified into principal components as follows:

 

 

(a) 

Life Insurance contract liabilities; comprising

 

 

 

– 

Participating Fund contract liabilities;

 

 

 

– 

Non-Participating Fund contract liabilities; and

 

 

 

– 

Investment Linked Fund contract liabilities.

 

 

(b) 

Non-life Insurance contract liabilities.

 

 

(c) 

Reinsurance contracts.

2.10.3 Life Insurance Contract Liabilities 

Insurance contracts are recognised and measured in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective 

contracts and are based on guidelines laid down by the respective insurance regulations. Premiums, claims 

and benefit payments, acquisition and management expenses and valuation of future policy benefit payments 

or premium reserves as the case may be, are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement. 

The valuation of insurance contract liabilities is determined according to the Insurance Regulations:

 

 

(a) 

Singapore Insurance Act (Chapter 142), Insurance (Valuation and Capital) Regulations 2004 for insurance 

funds regulated in Singapore (“MAS Regulations”); and

 

 

(b) 

Risk-Based Capital Framework for Insurers for insurance funds regulated in Malaysia.

Life insurance contract liabilities are recognised when contracts are entered into and premiums are charged. 

These liabilities are measured by using the gross premium valuation method. The liability is determined as the 

sum of the present value of future guaranteed and, where relevant, appropriate level of non-guaranteed benefits 

and expenses, less the present value of future gross considerations arising from the policy discounted at the 

appropriate discount rate. The liability is based on best estimate assumptions and with due regard to significant 

recent experience. An appropriate risk margin allowance for adverse deviation from expected experience is 

made in the valuation of non-participating life policies, the guaranteed benefit liabilities of participating life 

policies and liabilities of non-unit investment-linked policies.

2.10.3 Life Insurance Contract Liabilities (continued)

The liability in respect of participating insurance contract is based on the higher of the guaranteed benefit 

liabilities or the total benefit liabilities at the contract level derived as stated above. Refer to Table 2.10 for 

details.

In the case of life policies where part of, or all the premiums are accumulated in a fund, the accumulated 

amounts, as declared to policyholders are shown as liabilities if the accumulated amounts are higher than the 

amounts as calculated using the gross premium valuation method.

In the case of short-term life policies covering contingencies other than death or survival, the liability for such 

life insurance contracts comprises the provision for unearned premiums and unexpired risks, together with 

provision for claims outstanding, including an estimate of the incurred claims that have not yet been reported 

to the Group.

 

Risk transfer

The Group issues a variety of short and long duration insurance contracts which transfer risks from the 

policyholders to the Group to protect policyholders from the consequences of insured events such as death, 

disability, illness, accident, including survival. These contracts may transfer both insurance and investment risk 

or insurance risk alone, from the policyholders to the Group.

 

For non-participating policy contracts other than medical insurance policy contracts, the payout to policyholders 

upon the occurrence of the insured event is pre-determined and the transfer of risk is absolute. For medical 

insurance policy contracts, the payout is dependent on the actual medical costs incurred upon the occurrence 

of the insured event.

Contracts which transfer insurance risk alone from policyholders to the Group are commonly known as 

investment linked policies. As part of the pricing for these contracts, the insurance subsidiaries within the Group 

include certain charges and fees to cover for expenses and insured risk. The net investment returns derived 

from the variety of investment funds as selected by the policyholders accrue directly to the policyholders.

The Group issues investment linked contracts as an insurance contract which insure human life events such 

as death or survival over a long duration; coupled with an embedded derivative linking death benefit payments 

on the contract to the value of a pool of investments within the investment linked fund set up by the insurance 

subsidiary. As an embedded derivative meets the definition of an insurance contract it need not be separately 

accounted for from the host insurance contract. The liability valuation for such contracts is adjusted for 

changes in the fair value of the underlying assets at frequencies in accordance with the terms and conditions 

of the insurance contracts.

Subsequent measurement of life insurance contract liabilities

Adjustments to liabilities at each reporting date are recorded in the Profit or Loss Statements. Profits originating 

from the release in margins for adverse deviations are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statements over the 

lives of the contracts, whereas losses are fully recognised in the Profit or Loss Statements during the first year.

 

 

Derecognition of life insurance contract liabilities

The liability is extinguished when the contract expires, is discharged or is cancelled.

 

 

Benefits and claims

Insurance contract benefits reflect the cost of all maturities, surrenders, withdrawals and claims arising during 

the period, as well as policyholder dividends accrued in anticipation of dividend declarations. Accident and 

health claims incurred include all losses occurring during the period, whether reported or not, related handling 

costs, a reduction for recoveries, and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years.

Claims handling costs include internal and external costs incurred in connection with the negotiation and 

settlement of claims, and are included in operating expenses.

 

 

Insurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF

A significant portion of insurance contracts issued by subsidiaries within the Group contain discretionary 

participating features. These contracts are classified as participating policies. In addition to guaranteed benefits 

payable upon insured events associated with human life such as death or disability, the contracts entitle the 

policyholder to receive benefits, which could vary according to investment performance of the fund. The Group 

does not recognise the guaranteed components separately from the discretionary participating features. 

 

Profits to shareholders from the participating fund are allocated from the surplus or surplus capital, determined 

from the results of the annual actuarial valuation (such valuation also determines the liabilities relating to all 

the policyholders’ benefits of the participating fund) parameters which are set out in the Insurance Regulations 

of the respective jurisdiction in which the insurance subsidiaries operate. The provisions in the Articles of 

Association of the insurance subsidiaries within the Group are applied in conjunction with the prescriptions in 

the respective Insurance regulations, such that the distribution for any year to policyholders of the participating 

fund and shareholders approximate 90% and 10% respectively of total distribution from the participating 

fund. Any surplus that is not allocated is recognised as unallocated surplus. The unallocated surplus forms 

part of the life insurance contract liabilities. The annual declaration of the quantum of policyholder bonus and 

correspondingly the profits to shareholders to be distributed out of the participating fund is approved by the 

Board of Directors of each insurance subsidiary under the advice of the Appointed Actuary of the respective 

insurance subsidiary, in accordance with the Insurance Regulations and the Articles of Association of the 

respective insurance subsidiaries.

2.10.3 Life Insurance Contract Liabilities (continued)

Liability adequacy test

Each insurance subsidiary within the Group is required by the Insurance Regulations and accounting standards 

to carry out a liability adequacy test using current estimates of future cash flows relating to its insurance 

contracts; the process is referred to as the gross premium valuation or bonus reserve valuation, depending on 

the jurisdiction in which the insurance subsidiary operates. 

The liability adequacy test is applied to both the guaranteed benefits and the discretionary participating 

features; the assumptions are based on best estimates, the basis adopted is prescribed by the Insurance 

Regulations of the respective jurisdiction in which the insurance subsidiary operates. The Group performs 

liability adequacy tests on its actuarial reserves to ensure that the carrying amount of provisions is sufficient 

to cover estimated future cash flows. When performing the liability adequacy test, the Group discounts all 

contractual cash flows and compares this amount against the carrying value of the liability. Any deficiency is 

charged to the Profit or Loss Statement.

2.10.4 Non-life Insurance Contract Liabilities

The Group issues short term property and casualty contracts which protect the policyholder against the risk of 

loss of property premises due to fire or theft in the form of fire or burglary insurance contracts and/or business 

interruption contracts; risk of liability to pay compensation to a third party for bodily harm or property damage 

in the form of public liability insurance contracts. The Group also issues short term medical and personal 

accident non-life insurance contracts.

 

Non-life insurance contract liabilities include claim liabilities and premium liabilities.

Claim liabilities

Claim liabilities are based on the estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the balance 

sheet date, whether reported or not, together with related claims handling costs and reduction for the expected 

value of salvage and other recoveries. Delays can be experienced in the notification and settlement of certain 

types of claims, therefore, the ultimate cost of these claims cannot be known with certainty at the balance 

sheet date. The liability is calculated at the reporting date using a range of standard actuarial claim projection 

techniques based on empirical data and current assumptions that may include a margin for adverse deviation. 

No provision for equalisation or catastrophe reserves is recognised. The liabilities are derecognised when 

contracts expire, are discharged or are cancelled.

The valuation of non-life insurance claim liabilities at balance sheet date is based on best estimates of the 

ultimate settlement cost of claims plus a provision for adverse deviation. The provision of adverse deviation 

is set at 75% level of sufficiency for Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The valuation methods used include 

the Paid and Incurred Loss Development methods (also known as the Link Ratio methods), the Paid and 

Incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods and the Expected Loss Ratio method. For Singapore and Malaysia, 

the claim liabilities are not discounted for the time value of money. However, for Indonesia, the claim liabilities 

are discounted for the time value of money. 

Premium liabilities

Premium liabilities are the provision of unearned premiums representing premiums received for risks that 

have not yet expired at the reporting date.  The provision is recognised when contracts are entered into and 

premiums are charged. The provision is released over the terms of the contracts and is recognised as premium 

income. Further provisions are made if expected future cash flow of unexpired insurance contracts exceed the 

unearned premiums of these contracts.

Insurance Contracts (continued)

2.10.5 Reinsurance Contracts 

The Group cedes insurance risk in the normal course of business for all of its businesses. Reinsurance assets 

represent amounts receivable in respect of ceded insurance liabilities. These amounts are estimated in a 

manner consistent with the reinsured insurance contract liabilities, the outstanding claims provision or settled 

claims associated with the reinsurer’s policies and are in accordance with the related reinsurance contract. 

Reinsurance assets arising from ceding of in-force book and gross onerous contracts are recognised in the 

same period when the gross liabilities are accrued.

Reinsurance assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date or more frequently when an indication 

of impairment arises during the financial period. Impairment occurs when there is objective evidence as a result 

of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset that the Group may not receive part 

or all outstanding amounts under the terms of the contract. The impairment loss is recorded in the Profit or 

Loss Statement. Gains or losses on reinsurance are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement immediately at 

the date of contract and are not amortised. Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Group from its 

obligations to policyholders.

The Group also assumes reinsurance risk in the normal course of business for life insurance and non-life 

insurance contracts where applicable. Premiums and claims on assumed reinsurance are recognised as revenue 

or expenses in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business, taking 

into account the product classification of the reinsured business. Reinsurance liabilities represent balances due 

to reinsurance companies. Amounts payable are estimated in a manner consistent with the related reinsurance 

contract. Premiums and claims are presented on a gross basis for both ceded and assumed reinsurance. 

Reinsurance assets or liabilities are derecognised when the contractual rights are extinguished or expire or 

when the contract is transferred to another party.

2.11 

Recognition of Income and Expense

2.11.1 Premiums and Commissions

 

 

Life Insurance Business

First year premiums of insurance policies are recognised from inception date and subsequent renewal premiums 

are recognised when due. Single premiums are recognised on the dates on which the policies are effective. 

Premiums from the investment-linked business, universal life and certain Takaful Non-participating products 

are recognised as revenue when payment is received. Commission is recognised as an expense when incurred.

 

 

 

 

Non-Life Insurance Business

Premiums from the non-life insurance business are recognised as revenue upon commencement of insurance 

cover, in the Profit or Loss Statement. Premiums pertaining to periods outside of the financial reporting period 

are adjusted through the movement in premium liabilities. Commission is recognised as an expense when 

incurred, typically upon the risk underwritten as reflected in the premium recognised.

Premiums ceded out and the corresponding commission income from non-life insurance contracts are 

recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement upon receipt of acceptance confirmation from the ceding company 

or in accordance with provisions incorporated in the treaty contracts. Premiums ceded out pertaining to periods 

outside of the financial reporting period are adjusted through the movement in unexpired risk reserve.

2.11.2 Interest Income

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

2.11.3 Dividend Income

Dividend income is recognised as investment income when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established. 

Dividend income from the Company’s subsidiaries is recognised when the dividend is declared payable. 

2.11.4 Rental Income

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The aggregate 

cost of incentives provided to lessees is recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term on a 

straight-line basis.

2.11.5 Gain/Loss on Sale of Investments

Gains or losses on sale of investments are derived from the difference between net sales proceeds and the 

purchase or amortised cost. They are recognised on trade date.

 

2.11.6 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 

indication exists, or when an annual impairment test for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of 

the asset’s recoverable amount. 

An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of 

disposal and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 

inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount 

of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is 

written down to its recoverable amount. 

Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement. 

A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to 

determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the 

carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carrying 

amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised 

previously. Such reversal is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement. Unless the asset is measured at revalued 

amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

2.11.7 Impairment of Financial Assets 

The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (“ECL”) on the following financial instruments 

that are not measured at FVTPL: 

 

 

(i) 

Debt instruments measured at FVOCI;

 

 

(ii) 

Loans and receivables measured at amortised cost; and

 

 

(iii) 

Loan commitments.

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the ECL associated with its loans and debt instruments carried 

at amortised cost and FVOCI and its loan commitments. For trade and insurance receivables, the Group 

measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The Group recognises 

a loss allowance for ECL at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:

 

 

• 

An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible 

outcomes;

 

 

• 

The time value of money; and

 

 

• 

Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting 

date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

Recognition of Income and Expense (continued)

2.11.7 Impairment of Financial Assets (continued)

The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for financial instruments on 

which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition.

12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument 

that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Note 33(h) provides more details on how the 

expected loss allowance is measured.

 

 

Not credit-impaired financial assets

For financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date, the ECL is the present value of all cash 

shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the 

cash flows that the Group expects to receive).

 

 

Modified financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new 

one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made whether the financial asset should 

be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows.

 

 

• 

If the expected modification will not result in derecognition of the existing asset then the expected cash 

flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the 

existing asset.

 

 

• 

If the expected modification will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair 

value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its 

derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset 

that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original 

effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.

 

 

Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets measured at amortised cost and debt 

financial assets measured at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more 

events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. 

The Group considers factors such as probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor 

and default or significant delay in payments.

For financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date, the ECL is the difference between the gross 

carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.

 

 

Write-off

Loans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. 

This is generally the case when the Group determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources 

of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, 

financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the 

Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

2.11.8 Fees and Other Income

Fees and other income comprise mainly management and advisory fee income. Management and advisory 

fee income includes income earned from the provision of administration services, investment management 

services, surrenders and other contract fees. This fee income is recognised as revenue over the period in which 

the services are rendered. If the fees are for services to be provided in future periods, then they are deferred 

and recognised over those periods.

2.11.9 Employee Benefits

 

 

Defined Contribution Plans under Statutory Regulations

The Group participates in the national pension schemes as defined by the laws of the countries in which it has 

operations. In particular, the Singapore and Malaysia companies in the Group make contributions respectively 

to the Central Provident Fund and Employees’ Provident Fund, which are defined contribution pension 

schemes. These contributions are recognised as an expense in the period in which the service is rendered.

 

 

Employee Leave Entitlements

An employee’s entitlement to annual leave and long-service leave is estimated and accrued according to the 

Group’s Human Resource policy. 

 

 

Share Options

Senior executives of the Group are granted share options in the OCBC Bank’s Share Option Scheme as 

consideration for services rendered. Options granted are exercisable for up to 10 years. The options may be 

exercised after the first anniversary of the date of the grant, and generally vest in one-third increments over a 

3-year period. The cost of these options is recognised as expense in the Profit or Loss Statement based on 

the fair value of the options at the date of the grant. The share options are cash-settled share-based payment 

transactions. The expense is recognised over the vesting period of the grant, with a corresponding increase 

in liabilities. 

The cumulative expense recognised at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which 

the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of options that will ultimately vest. 

The charge or credit to profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised 

as at the beginning and end of that period.

No expense is recognised for options that do not ultimately vest, except for options where vesting is conditional 

upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vested irrespective of whether or not the market 

condition or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions 

are satisfied. In the case where the option does not vest as a result of a failure to meet a non-vesting condition 

that is within the control of the Group or the senior executives, it is accounted for as a cancellation. In such 

case, the amount of the compensation cost that otherwise would be recognised over the remainder of the 

vesting period is recognised immediately in the Profit or Loss Statement upon cancellation. 

 

 

Deferred Share Plan

In addition to the OCBC Bank’s Share Option Scheme, certain employees within the Group are granted OCBC 

shares under the OCBC Deferred Share Plan (“DSP”). The deferred share awards are granted as part of variable 

performance bonus. Half of the share awards will vest two years from the grant date and the remaining half 

will vest at the end of three years from the grant date. The cost of the DSP is recognised in the Profit or Loss 

Statement on the straight-line basis over the vesting period of the DSP. 

At each balance sheet date, the cumulative expense is adjusted for the estimated number of shares granted 

under the DSP that have vested and/or lapsed.

Recognition of Income and Expense (continued)

2.11.10 Leases 

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or 

contains, a lease if the contract involves the use of an identified asset and conveys the right to control the use 

of the asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration – i.e. the customer has the right to:

 

 

• 

obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from using the asset; and

 

 

• 

direct the use of the asset.

 

 

As Lessee

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease. 

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the amount of lease liability, any lease 

payments made or before the commencement date, any indirect costs incurred and an estimate of the costs to 

dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, 

less any lease incentives received. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease 

payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease 

or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The Group generally uses 

its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. 

Subsequently, the right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement 

date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The 

estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and 

equipment. In addition, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced by any impairment losses and 

adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. 

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effect interest method. It is remeasured 

to reflect any lease modifications or reassessments. 

The Group presents its right-of-use assets in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘other 

creditors’ in the balance sheet. 

 

 

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have 

a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments 

associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

 

 

As Lessor

The Group classifies all leases for which it is a lessor as operating leases, because each of these leases does 

not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. 

Lease payments from operating leases are recognised as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term 

and are included in ‘rental income, net’.

Taxes

2.12.1 Current Income Tax

Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected 

to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount 

are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, in the countries where 

the Group operates and generates taxable income.

Current income taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items recognised 

outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Management periodically 

evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are 

subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

2.12.2 Deferred Tax

Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date 

between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. 

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Exceptions include:

 

 

• 

Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in 

a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 

accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

 

 

• 

In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates 

and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 

controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits 

and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 

deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be 

utilised except:

 

 

• 

Where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the 

initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the 

time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

 

 

• 

In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates 

and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable 

that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available 

against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Taxes (continued)

2.12.2 Deferred Tax (continued)

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent 

that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax 

asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and 

are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax 

asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year 

when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and applicable tax laws and jurisdictions) 

that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred 

tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income 

or directly in equity and deferred tax arising from a business combination is adjusted against goodwill on 

acquisition.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax 

assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the 

same taxation authority.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition 

at that date, would be recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances changed. 

The adjustment would either be treated as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it 

is incurred during the measurement period or in profit or loss.

2.12.3 Sales Tax

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except where the sales tax 

incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case 

the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as 

applicable. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.

 

The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of 

receivables or payables in the balance sheet.

Provisions 

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 

where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 

and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. 

Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is 

no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is 

reversed. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 

reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision 

due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

2.14 

Policy Benefits

Policy benefits are recognised when the policyholder exercises the option to deposit the survival benefits with the life 

insurance subsidiary companies when the benefit falls due. Policy benefits are interest bearing at rates adjusted from 

time to time by the life insurance subsidiary companies. Interest payable on policy benefits is recognised in the Profit 

or Loss Statement as incurred.

2.15 

Claims Admitted or Intimated

Full provision is made for the estimated cost of all life insurance claims notified but not settled at balance sheet date. 

Provision is made for estimated claims incurred but not reported for all classes of non-life insurance business written.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid 

investments with maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition, or are readily convertible to a known 

amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 

2.17 

Insurance Receivables

Insurance receivables are recognised when due. They are measured at initial recognition at the fair value received 

or receivable. Subsequent to initial recognition, insurance receivables are measured at amortised cost, using the 

effective interest method. A loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, with 

the impairment loss recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement. Insurance receivables are derecognised when the 

derecognition criteria for financial assets, as described in Note 2.18 has been met. The Group’s insurance receivables 

include outstanding premium, policy loan and reinsurance receivables. Policy loans are loans and advances made to 

policyholders, and are collateralised by the underlying policies.

Financial Assets

 

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 

financial asset. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. At initial recognition, 

the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit 

or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs for 

financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are recognised as expense in the Profit or Loss Statement. 

 

Classification

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost, fair value through other 

comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) or fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”).

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as 

measured at FVTPL:

 

• 

The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; 

and

 

• 

The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 

of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A debt security is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as 

measured at FVTPL:

 

• 

The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash 

flows and selling financial assets; and

 

• 

The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 

of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

An equity security that is not held for trading may, by irrevocable election, be designated as measured at FVOCI. This 

election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. The Group has designated certain equity securities held for 

strategic purposes as measured at FVOCI. 

A financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI may, by 

irrevocable election, be designated as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting 

mismatch that would otherwise arise. The Group has designated certain debt securities which are held with the intent 

to collect contractual cash flows and sell as measured at FVTPL. 

All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.

 

Business model assessment

The Group assesses the objective of the business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best 

reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered 

includes:

 

• 

The stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice;

 

• 

How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group’s management;

 

• 

The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business 

model) and how those risks are managed;

 

• 

How managers of the business are compensated; and

 

• 

The frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about 

future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an 

overall assessment of how the Group’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how 

cash flows are realised.

Financial assets that are held for trading or whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, are measured at 

FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows 

and to sell.

Financial Assets (continued)

 

Business model assessment (continued)

The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking “worst case” or “stress 

case” scenarios into account. If the cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the 

Group’s original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in 

that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial 

assets going forward.

 

Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 

‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal 

amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as profit 

margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the 

contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term 

that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making 

the assessment, the Group considers the following key aspects:

 

• 

Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;

 

• 

Leverage features;

 

• 

Prepayment and extension terms;

 

• 

Terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets; and

 

• 

Features that modify consideration of the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and costs 

associated with the principal amount outstanding.

 

Subsequent measurement

2.18.1 Debt Instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset 

and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. The three measurement categories for classification 

of debt instruments are:

 

 

(i) 

Amortised cost

Debt instruments that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows 

represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost using the effective 

interest method. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in 

the Profit or Loss Statement. Gains or losses are also recognised in profit or loss when the assets are 

derecognised.

 

 

(ii) 

Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Debt instruments that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for sale, where the assets’ 

cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are classified as FVOCI. Any gains or 

losses from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in fair 

value reserve. Impairment, foreign exchange gains and losses and interest calculated using the effective 

interest method are recognised in profit or loss. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 

other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss when the financial asset is 

derecognised.

 

 

(iii) 

Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

Debt instruments that do not meet the criteria for classification as amortised cost or FVOCI are measured 

at FVTPL. Any gains or losses from changes in fair value and interest are recognised in profit or loss.

Subsequent measurement (continued)

2.18.2 Equity Instruments

The Group subsequently measures all equity instruments at fair value. On initial recognition of an equity 

instrument that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair 

value in OCI. The Group’s policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are 

held for purposes other than to generate investment returns. When this election is used, fair value gains and 

losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss, including on disposal. 

Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair 

value. Dividends, when representing a return from such investments are to be recognised in profit or loss when 

the Group’s right to receive payments is established.

Changes in fair value of equity instruments at FVTPL are recognised in profit or loss. 

2.18.3 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 

subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent 

changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the 

nature of the item being hedged and the type of hedge relationship designated.

The Group applies hedge accounting for hedges of net investments in foreign operations. At the inception of 

a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedging relationship to which the 

Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the 

hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, 

the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging 

instrument’s fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows 

attributable to the hedged risk. 

Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and 

are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the 

financial reporting periods for which they were designated.

For hedges of net investments in foreign operations, gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to 

the effective portion of the hedge are recognised as other comprehensive income while any gains or losses 

relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement. On disposal of the foreign 

operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded in equity is transferred to the Profit or 

Loss Statement.

The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its 

investments in foreign subsidiaries.

 

Reclassifications

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group changes 

its business model for managing financial assets.

 

Derecognition

A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired or has 

been transferred such that substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.

Financial Assets (continued)

On derecognition of a financial asset, except for equity securities measured at FVOCI, the difference between the 

carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the 

sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any 

cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI, is recognised in Profit or Loss Statement. 

On derecognition of equity securities measured at FVOCI, any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI is not recognised 

in Profit or Loss Statement, but retained in OCI.

 

Regular way purchase or sale of a financial asset

All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised or derecognised on trade date i.e., the date 

that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of 

financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in 

the marketplace concerned.

2.19 

Financial Liabilities

 

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when the Group becomes a party to the contractual obligations of 

the financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. 

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, plus, in the case of financial liabilities other than derivatives, 

directly attributable transaction costs. 

The Group’s financial liabilities include other creditors, provision for agents’ retirement benefits, debt issued and 

derivative liabilities.

 

Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows:

2.19.1 Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading. Financial 

liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term 

and include derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging 

instruments in hedge relationships.

Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair 

value. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of the financial liabilities are recognised in the Profit 

or Loss Statement.

 

2.19.2 Financial Liabilities at Amortised Cost

After initial recognition, other financial liabilities that are not carried at fair value through profit or loss are 

subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised 

in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process. 

 

Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is extinguished. When an existing financial 

liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 

are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and 

the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Profit or 

Loss Statement.

Offsetting of Financial Instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet, when and 

only when, there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 

settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. The financial assets and financial 

liabilities that are offset are immaterial.

2.21 

Determination of Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference 

to quoted or published bid prices on the balance sheet date. If quoted prices are not available over the counter, broker 

or dealer price quotations are used.

For units in unit trusts and shares in open-ended investment companies, fair value is determined by reference to 

published bid-values.

For financial instruments where there is no active market, the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques. 

Such techniques include using recent arm’s length transactions, reference to the current market value of another 

instrument which is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and/or option pricing models. For 

discounted cash flow techniques, estimated future cash flows are based on management’s best estimates based 

on market’s perspective and the discount rate is a market-related rate for a similar instrument. Certain financial 

instruments, including derivative financial instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other 

factors, contractual, and market prices, correlation, time value of money, credit risk, yield curve volatility factors and/

or prepayment rates of the underlying positions. The use of different pricing models and assumptions could produce 

materially different estimates of fair values.

The fair value of floating rate and overnight deposits with financial institutions is their carrying value. The carrying value 

is the cost of the deposit and accrued interest. The fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is estimated using 

discounted cash flow techniques. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates for similar instruments 

at the balance sheet date.

2.22 

Intangible Assets

2.22.1  Goodwill

Goodwill is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 

accumulated impairment losses.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition 

date, allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 

combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

The cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever 

there is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill 

by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) to 

which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying 

amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement. Impairment losses recognised for 

goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, 

the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation 

when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is 

measured based on the relative fair values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating 

unit retained.

Intangible Assets

2.22.1  Goodwill (continued)

Goodwill and fair value adjustments which arose on acquisitions of foreign subsidiaries before 1 January 2005 

are deemed to be assets and liabilities of the parent company and are recorded in SGD at the rates prevailing 

at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations on or after 1 January 2005 

are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operations and are recorded in the functional currency of the 

foreign operations and translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date.

2.22.2  Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 

intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment 

losses.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. 

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment 

whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the 

amortisation method are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either 

individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to 

determine whether the indefinite useful life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from 

indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. 

An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal (i.e., at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no 

future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition 

of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 

asset) is included in the Profit or Loss Statement. 

 

2.23 

Property, Plant and Equipment

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and 

equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 

Freehold land has an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated. No depreciation is provided for 999-year leasehold 

land. No depreciation is provided on capital works in progress as the assets are not yet available for use.

Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated 

useful life of an asset. The useful lives are as follows:

 

Buildings 

50 years

 

Office furniture, fittings and equipment  

5 to 10 years

 

Renovation 

3 to 5 years

 

Computer equipment and software development costs 

3 to 10 years

Property, Plant and Equipment (continued)

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 

circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. 

The residual values, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted 

prospectively, if appropriate. This is to ensure that the amount, method and period of depreciation are consistent with 

previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the items 

of property, plant and equipment. 

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are 

expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in the Profit or Loss 

Statement in the year the asset is derecognised. 

2.24 

Investment Properties

Investment properties are properties that are owned by the Group in order to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, 

or both, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, or in the 

ordinary course of business. Investment properties comprise completed investment properties and properties that are 

being constructed or developed for future use as investment properties.

Investment properties are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs. The carrying amount includes the 

cost of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria 

are met. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value which reflects market 

conditions at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties 

are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement in the year in which they arise.

Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property 

is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Gains or losses 

on the retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement in the year of 

retirement or disposal. 

Transfers are made to or from investment property only when there is a change in use. For a transfer from investment 

property to owner occupied property, the deemed cost for subsequent accounting is the fair value at the date of 

change in use. For a transfer from owner occupied property to investment property, the property is accounted for in 

accordance with the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment set out in Note 2.23 up to the date of change 

in use.

2.25 

Provision for Agents’ Retirement Benefits

Provision for agents’ retirement benefits is set aside for agents of the Malaysian operations and is calculated in 

accordance with the terms and conditions in the respective agent’s agreement (“the Agreement”). The terms and 

conditions of the Agreement stipulate that upon the agent maintaining his position for the qualifying year and achieving 

the required personal sales and minimum new business, the agent shall be allocated a deferred benefit/retirement 

benefit. The deferred benefit/retirement benefit accumulated at Balance Sheet date includes accrued interest. The 

accrued deferred benefit shall only become payable provided the Agreement has been in force for certain continuous 

contract years and the agent has attained the minimum retirement age stipulated in the Agreement. The carrying 

amount is based on amortised cost.

Contingencies

A contingent liability is:

a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence 

or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or

 

(b) 

a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:

 

 

(i) 

it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle 

the obligation; or

 

 

(ii) 

the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by 

the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.

Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Group, except for contingent liabilities 

assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and for which the fair values can be reliably determined.

2.30 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments

In the preparation of the Group’s financial statements, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments that 

affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at 

the reporting date. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are continually evaluated and based on internal studies of 

actual historical experience and other factors. Best estimates and assumptions are constantly reviewed to ensure that 

they remain relevant and valid. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes 

that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.

 

(a) 

Liabilities of insurance business

The estimation of the ultimate liability arising from claims made under life and non-life insurance contracts 

is the Group’s most critical accounting estimate. There are several sources of uncertainty that need to be 

considered in the estimation of the liabilities that the Group will ultimately be required to pay as claims.

For life insurance contracts, estimates are made for future deaths, morbidity, disabilities, lapses, voluntary 

terminations, investment returns, administration expenses and discount rates (note 2.10). The Group relies on 

standard industry and national mortality and morbidity tables which represent historical experience, and makes 

appropriate adjustments for its respective risk exposures and portfolio experience in deriving the mortality and 

morbidity estimates. These estimates provide the basis for the valuation of the future benefits to be paid to 

policyholders and to ensure adequate provisions which are monitored against current and future premiums. For 

those contracts that insure risk on longevity and disability, estimates are made based on recent past experience 

and emerging trends. Epidemics and changing patterns of lifestyle could result in significant changes to the 

expected future exposures. Each year, these estimates are assessed for adequacy and changes will be reflected 

as adjustments to insurance contract liabilities. The carrying value of life insurance contract liabilities, gross as 

at 31 December 2020 amounted to $82,906.1 million (31 December 2019: $74,159.8 million).

For non-life insurance contracts, estimates have to be made for both the expected ultimate cost of claims 

reported at the balance sheet date and for the expected ultimate cost of claims incurred but not yet reported 

at the balance sheet date (“IBNR”).

It can take a significant time before the ultimate claims costs can be established with certainty and for some 

type of policies, IBNR claims form the majority of the balance sheet liability. The ultimate cost of outstanding 

claims is estimated using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques such as Chain Ladder and 

Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments (continued)

 

(a) 

Liabilities of insurance business (continued)

The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a company’s past development experience can 

be used to project future claims development and hence, ultimate claim costs. As such, these methods 

extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based 

on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios. Historical claims development is mainly 

analysed by accident years but can also be further analysed by significant business lines and claims type. 

Large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face of loss adjustor estimates 

or separately projected in order to reflect their future development. In most cases, no explicit assumptions are 

made regarding future rates of claims inflation or loss ratios. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess 

the extent to which past trends may not apply in future, (for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in 

external or market factors, economic conditions as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy features 

and claims handling procedures) in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that present the likely 

outcome from the range of possible outcomes, taking account of all uncertainties involved. The carrying value 

of non-life insurance contract liabilities – claims liabilities, gross as at 31 December 2020 amounted to $351.0 

million (31 December 2019: $280.2 million).

 

(b) 

Income taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining 

the deductibility of certain expenses and taxability of certain income during the estimation of the provision for 

income taxes. Certain subsidiaries within the Group have significant open tax positions, which represent the 

positions that have not been finalised with the tax authorities. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated 

tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these 

matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income 

tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the determination is made. The carrying amount of the 

income tax and deferred tax provisions as at 31 December 2020 amounted to $1,710.1 million (31 December 

2019: $2,101.0 million).

 

(c) 

Impairment of goodwill

The Group conducts impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with the accounting 

policy stated in Note 2.22. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined based on the 

value-in-use method, which adopts a discounted cash flow approach on projections, budgets and forecasts 

over a 5-year period. Cash flows beyond the fifth year are extrapolated using estimated terminal growth rates 

not exceeding the long-term average growth of the industry and country in which the cash-generating unit 

operates. The discount rates applied to the cash flow projections are derived from the Group’s weighted 

average cost of capital at the date of assessment. Changes to the assumptions, particularly the discount rate 

and terminal growth rate, may significantly affect the results of the impairment test. Further details of the key 

assumptions applied in the impairment assessment of goodwill are provided in Note 26.

 

(d) 

Impairment of financial assets 

The impairment provisions for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected 

loss rates. The Group uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment 

calculation, based on the Group’s past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates 

at the end of each reporting period. For details of the key assumptions and inputs used, see Note 33(h).

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

2.30 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments (continued)

 

(e) 

Insurance contract classification 

Contracts are classified as insurance contracts where they transfer significant insurance risk from the 

policyholder to the Group. The Group exercises judgment about the level of insurance risk transferred. The 

level of insurance risk is assessed by considering whether upon the insured event the Group is required to 

pay significant additional benefits. These additional benefits include claims liability and assessment costs, but 

exclude the loss of the ability to charge the policyholder for future services. The assessment covers the whole 

of the expected term of the contract where such additional benefits could be payable. Some contracts contain 

options for the policyholder to purchase insurance risk protection at a later date; these insurance risks are 

deemed not significant. 

 

(f) 

Property classification

Investment property is a property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both.

Some properties comprise a portion that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and another portion 

that is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. 

If these portions could be sold separately (or leased separately under a finance lease), the Group would 

account for these portions separately. If the portions could not be sold separately, the property is an investment 

property only if an insignificant portion is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for 

administrative purposes. Judgment is made on an individual property basis to determine whether ancillary 

services are so significant that a property does not qualify as investment property.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by 

the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

Diluted and basic earnings per share are the same as there are no dilutive potential ordinary shares.

The following reflects the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number 

of shares outstanding during the year, used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years

RESERVES

Merger reserve represents the difference between the fair value and nominal value of shares issued for the acquisition 

of a subsidiary. The merger reserve had been utilised in part in prior years to write-off the goodwill on acquisition of 

the subsidiary.

The currency translation reserve represents exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements 

of foreign operations whose functional currencies are different from that of the Group’s presentation currency. The 

currency translation reserve is also used to record the effect of hedging of net investment in foreign operations.

The fair value reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of financial assets measured at FVOCI 

and the related loss allowance recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement until the assets are derecognised, net of tax.

The other reserve represents the gain or loss on disposal of interest in subsidiary, without loss of control, reclassifed 

to equity.

On 19 January 2011, one of the Group’s subsidiaries issued $400.0 million subordinated fixed rate notes (“Notes”) due 

2026 callable in 2021.  The Notes will initially bear interest at the rate of 4.6% per annum, payable semi-annually on 

19 January and 19 July each year up to 19 January 2021.  If the Notes are not redeemed or purchased and cancelled 

on 19 January 2021, the interest rate from that date will be reset at a fixed rate per annum equal to the aggregate of 

the then prevailing 5-year SGD Swap Offer Rate and 1.35%, payable semi-annually in arrears. The subordinated notes 

qualify as Tier 2 capital for the Group.

Subsequent to year ended 31 December 2020, the Group’s subsidiary has issued a Notice of Redemption on  

19 January 2021, to the holders of the Notes. All outstanding Notes have been fully redeemed on 19 January 2021.

The table above shows the fair value of derivative financial instruments, recorded as assets or liabilities together 

with their notional amounts.  The notional amount, recorded gross, is the amount of a derivative’s underlying asset, 

reference rate or index and the basis upon which changes in the value of derivatives are measured.

The fair value of derivatives shown above represents the current risk exposure but not the maximum risk exposure that 

would arise in the future as a result of the changes in value.

Acquisition of subsidiary

On 2 May 2019 (the “acquisition date”), the Group’s subsidiary company, Great Eastern General Insurance Limited 

(“GEG”) acquired 95% of the share capital of PT QBE General Insurance Indonesia (“PT QBE”), a general insurance 

company in Indonesia, for a cash consideration of USD 29.9 million (approximately S$40.7 million). Upon the 

acquisition, PT QBE became a subsidiary of the Group.

On 17 May 2019, PT QBE changed its name to PT Great Eastern General Insurance Indonesia (“GEGI”).

The Group has acquired GEGI to be better positioned to comprehensively provide both general and life insurance 

solutions to the business community and consumers and deepen its footprint in Indonesia.

The Group has elected to measure the non-controlling interest at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of 

GEGI’s net identifiable assets.

The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of GEGI as at the acquisition date were:

SUBSIDIARIES (CONTINUED)

24.3

Acquisition of subsidiary (continued)

Acquisition-related costs

Acquisition-related costs of $1.4 million have been recognised in the “Management and other expenses” line item in 

the Group’s Profit or Loss Statement for the year ended 31 December 2019.

Other debtors acquired

Other debtors acquired comprise of trade and other receivables with a fair value of $3.2 million.  The gross amount 

is $3.4 million.  At the acquisition date, $0.2 million of the contractual cash flows pertaining to trade and other 

receivables are not expected to be collected. 

Goodwill arising from acquisition

The goodwill of $2.3 million arises from the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the 

identifiable net asset less the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of PT QBE’s net identifiable assets. 

Goodwill is allocated entirely to the individual entity which is also the cash-generating unit.  None of the goodwill 

recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Impact of the acquisition on the Profit or Loss Statement

From the acquisition date, PT QBE has contributed has contributed $8.8 million of revenue and $5.3 million to the 

Group’s profit in year 2019, net of tax.  If the business combination had taken place at the beginning of the year 

2019,  the revenue from continuing operations would have been $14.3 million and the Group’s profit from continuing 

operations, net of tax would have been $5.4 million in 31 December 2019.

Loss of control in subsidiaries 

On 16 November 2020, a resolution was passed to commence member’s voluntary liquidation of LGlobal Funds – Asia 

High Dividend Equity and Lglobal Funds – Asia High Dividend Equity (which are subsidiaries of GEH).

On 29 November 2019, Lion Global Investors Limited (“LGI”) divested its entire equity stake in Pacific Mutual fund 

Berhad (“PMF”) for a cash consideration of RM24.9 million (approximately S$8.1 million). The stake represented 70% 

of the total issued and paid up capital of PMF.

The value of assets and liabilities of Lglobal Funds recorded in the consolidate financial statements as at 29 November 

2019, and the cash flow effect of the liquidation were:

INTERESTS IN STRUCTURED ENTITIES

A structured entity is defined as an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant 

factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when 

the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. The Group has interests in unconsolidated 

structured entities as described below.

The Group holds shares or units in investment vehicles, which consist of:

–

Debt securities which comprise: Mortgage-Backed-Securities (MBS), Asset Backed Securities (ABS) and 

Structured Deposits (SD).

–

Collective Investment Schemes which comprise: hedge funds, private equity funds, unit trusts, Real Estate 

Investment Trusts (REITs), Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) and Open Ended Investment Companies (OEIC).

The Group’s holdings in investment vehicles are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective investment 

vehicle’s offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values 

of those investment vehicles. 

The investment vehicles in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the 

respective investment vehicles for their services. Such compensation generally consists of an asset-based fee and a 

performance-based incentive fee, and is reflected in the valuation of the investment vehicles.

Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities

The Group receives management fees in respect of its asset management business. The Group does not sponsor 

any of the funds or investment vehicles from which it receives fees. Management fees received for investments that 

the Group manages but does not have a holding in also represent an interest in unconsolidated structured entities. 

As these investments are not held by the Group, the investment risk is borne by the external investors and therefore 

the Group’s maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees. The table below shows the assets under 

management of entities that the Group manages but does not have a holding in and the fees earned from those 

entities.

(1) 

The value-in-use calculation applies a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on financial budget and forecast approved 

by management covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the fifth year are extrapolated using the terminal growth rate stated above.

(2) 

The terminal growth rates used do not exceed the long term average past growth rates of the industries and countries in which Lion Global 

Investors Limited, Great Eastern General Insurance (Malaysia) Berhad and PT Great Eastern General Insurance Indonesia operate.

(3) 

The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is pre-tax and is derived from the cost of capital plus a reasonable risk premium. This is the 

benchmark used by management to assess the operating performance.

No impairment loss (2019: nil) was recognised for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 against the amounts of 

goodwill recorded above to write down the carrying value to recoverable value. A reasonably possible change in key 

assumptions will not cause the carrying values above to materially exceed the recoverable amounts.

EXECUTIVES’ SHARE OPTION SCHEME

29.1

OCBC Share Option Scheme

In April 2005, the GEH Optionholders were nominated to participate in the OCBC Bank Share Option Scheme (2001) 

(“OCBC Option Scheme”). The acquisition price of the options granted is equal to the average of the last dealt price 

of the ordinary shares of OCBC Bank over five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the date of the grant. 

The options vest in one-third increments over a period of three years, and are exercisable after the first anniversary of 

the date of grant up to the date of expiration of the options. The share options have a validity period of 10 years from 

date of grant.

The fair value of the share options is recognised by the GEH Group as staff costs in the Profit or Loss Statement.   The 

Group uses the binomial model to derive the fair value of share options granted by OCBC Bank.  The value of the share 

options is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement over the vesting period of the share options.  At each balance 

sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable, and the 

impact of the change to the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Profit or Loss Statement.

OCBC Share Option Scheme (continued)

At the Extraordinary General Meeting of OCBC Bank held on 19 April 2007, certain alterations proposed by OCBC 

Bank’s Remuneration Committee to OCBC Option Scheme were approved by its shareholders. These alterations 

enable option holders to select one of the following alternatives when exercising their options:

(i) 

All share election – an election to receive in full the number of ordinary shares upon full payment of the aggregate 

acquisition cost in respect of options exercised;

(ii) 

Partial share election – an election to receive ordinary shares representing the notional profit which would have 

been derived if the ordinary shares in respect of the options exercised had been sold; or

(iii) 

Cash election – an election to receive in cash the profit derived from the sale of OCBC Bank’s share in respect 

of the options exercised.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2020, there were no options granted under the OCBC Share Option Scheme 

(2019: nil) to GEH Optionholders to acquire ordinary shares in OCBC Bank (“OCBC shares”) pursuant to 2001 scheme, 

and no options were granted to a director of the Company (2019: nil).

EXECUTIVES’ SHARE OPTION SCHEME (CONTINUED)

29.2

OCBC Deferred Share Plan (“DSP”)

The DSP is a share-based plan implemented in 2003 and administered by the OCBC Remuneration Committee. 

The DSP is a discretionary share-based incentive and retention award program extended to executives of OCBC’s 

subsidiaries at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The awards are granted at no cost to the grantees, on a 

deferred basis as part of their performance bonus. Such awards shall lapse by reason of cessation of service but may 

be preserved at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The DSP does not involve the issue of new shares. 

Instead, existing shares will be purchased from the market for release to the grantees at the end of the respective 

vesting periods. 

During the financial year, 631,571 (2019: 313,495) OCBC ordinary shares were granted to eligible executives of GEH 

Group under the DSP, of which none (2019: nil) were granted to a director of the Company. The fair value of the shares 

at grant date was $6.0 million (2019: $3.5 million). In addition, 46,388 OCBC shares (of which none were granted to 

directors of the Company) were awarded to grantees pursuant to declarations of final dividend for financial year ended 

31 December 2020 (2019: 28,753 OCBC shares (of which none were granted to directors of the Company) awarded to 

grantees pursuant to declarations of final dividend for financial year ended 31 December 2018).

29.3

OCBC Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESP”)

All employees of OCBC Bank and their subsidiaries who have attained the age of 21 years and have been employees 

for a period of not less than six months are eligible to participate in the ESP Plan unless they are also controlling 

shareholders of the Bank or their associates. The purpose of the ESP Plan is to provide employees with an opportunity 

to increase their personal equity interest in the Bank. The Bank will either issue new shares or transfer treasury shares 

to employees upon the exercise or conversion of acquisition rights. The ESP Plan is administered by the OCBC Bank 

Remuneration Committee.

The acquisition price is equal to the average of the last traded price of the ordinary shares of OCBC Bank on the 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited over the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the 

price fixing date for the acquisition price of the ordinary shares (as determined by the OCBC Bank Remuneration 

Committee).

A participant may participate in the ESP Plan for an offering period by making contributions in cash by means of 

monthly deductions from his monthly base salary and/or his designated account; and/or by monthly debits from his 

CPF Ordinary Account to his ESP Plan account.

In June 2020, the fifteenth offering of the ESP Plan was launched for employees to acquire the shares of OCBC Bank 

at $8.98 per share. The plan commenced on 1 July 2020 and will expire on 30 June 2022. Under the offering, OCBC 

Bank granted 1,466,659 (2019: 980,689) rights to acquire ordinary shares in the Bank. The fair value of the rights, 

determined using the binomial valuation model was $1.6 million (2019: $0.8 million). Significant inputs to the valuation 

model are set out below.

SEGMENTAL INFORMATION

Business Segments

For management purposes, the Group’s operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to 

the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers 

different products for the different markets. The Group’s principal operations are organised into the Life Insurance, 

Non-life Insurance and Shareholders segments. The results of these segments are reported separately in internal 

reports that are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the 

segment and assess its performance.

a. 

Life Insurance Segment

The Life Insurance segment provides different types of products, comprising life insurance, long-term health 

and accident insurance, annuity business written and includes the unit-linked business. All revenues in the Life 

Insurance segment are from external customers.

b. 

Non-life Insurance Segment

Under the Non-life Insurance business, the Group issues short term property and casualty contracts which 

protect the policyholder against the risk of loss of property premises due to fire or theft in the form of fire or 

burglary insurance contract and/or business interruption contract; risk of liability to pay compensation to a 

third party for bodily harm or property damage in the form of public liability insurance contract. The Group also 

issues short term medical and personal accident non-life insurance contracts.

c. 

Shareholders Segment

The Shareholders segment provides fund management services for absolute return/balanced mandates with 

different risk-return characteristics and manages a range of products, including Asia Pacific equities, Asian 

and global fixed income securities portfolios. Clients include Singapore statutory boards, government-linked 

corporations, public and private companies, insurance companies and charity organisations.

The Shareholders segment also comprises activities not related to the core business segments, and includes 

general corporate income and expense items.

Geographical Segments 

The Group’s risks and rewards are affected by operating conditions in different countries and geographical areas. 

Therefore, for management purposes, the Group is also organised on a geographical basis into Singapore, Malaysia 

and Other Asia, based on the location of the Group’s assets. Sales to external customers disclosed in geographical 

segments are based on the respective location of its customers.

Segment Accounting Policies, Allocation Basis and Transfer Pricing

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting 

policies in Note 2.

Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can 

be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets, income tax and deferred 

tax assets and liabilities, interest-bearing loans and related expenses. Inter-segment transfers or transactions are 

entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to an unrelated third parties. 

Segment revenue, expenses and results include transfers between business segments. These transfers are eliminated 

on consolidation.

Framework, the Group shall:

– 

Operate within parameters and limits that are calibrated to the risk appetite approved by the Board; and

– Pursue appropriate risk-adjusted returns.

Group Risk Management department spearheads the development and implementation of the ERM Framework for 

the Group. 

The Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s risk management initiatives. The Board may delegate this 

responsibility to the Risk Management Committee (“RMC”). At the Group level, detailed risk management and 

oversight activities are undertaken by the following Group Management committees, all of which are chaired by the 

Group Chief Executive Officer and comprise key Senior Management Executives:

Governance framework (continued)

Group ALC is responsible for balance sheet management. Specifically, Group ALC reviews and formulates technical 

frameworks, policies, processes and methodologies relating to balance sheet management. Group ALC is also 

responsible for ensuring compliance and alignment with Group Governance and Oversight Framework, i.e. Group 

standards and guidelines. Group ALC is supported by the Local ALC.

Group TSC is responsible for assisting GMC in providing the overall strategic direction and approval of all IT related 

issues and initiatives, including the digitalisation and transformation programs to support the Group’s strategic growth 

into the future. Group TSC is supported by local TSC.

Group PMAC is responsible for reviewing, approving and managing new and existing products, ensuring the business 

operates within the risk appetite to deliver the annual business targets. Local PDC is responsible for reviewing and 

endorsing new products at the local operating subsidiaries.

Regulatory framework

Insurers are required to comply with the Insurance Act and Regulations, as applicable, including guidelines on 

investment limits. The responsibility for the formulation, establishment and approval of the investment policy rests with 

the respective Board of Directors (“Board”). The Board exercises oversight on investments to safeguard the interests 

of policyholders and shareholders.

Capital management

The objectives of GEH’s capital management policy are to create shareholder value, deliver sustainable returns to 

shareholders, maintain a strong capital position with sufficient buffer to meet policyholders’ obligations and regulatory 

requirements and make strategic investments for business growth.

The Group had no significant changes in the policies and processes relating to its capital structure during the year.

Regulatory Capital

The Group and its insurance subsidiaries are required to comply with the capital ratios prescribed by the Insurance 

Regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. The Capital Adequacy Ratios of the Group and its subsidiaries in 

Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia remained well above the regulatory minimum ratios under the Risk-based Capital 

Frameworks established by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Bank Negara Malaysia and Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, 

Indonesia respectively.

The Group’s approach to capital management aims to maintain an adequate level of capital to meet regulatory 

requirements, including any additional amounts required by the regulators of the Group and its insurance subsidiaries. 

This involves managing assets, liabilities and risks in a coordinated way by assessing and monitoring available and 

required capital (by each regulated entity) on a regular basis and, where appropriate, taking appropriate actions to 

adjust the capital position of the Group and/or its subsidiaries in light of changes in economic conditions and risk 

characteristics.

The primary sources of capital of the Group are shareholders’ equity and issued subordinated debt. The Group 

defines available capital as the amount of assets in excess of liabilities measured in accordance with the Insurance 

Regulations of the respective jurisdictions in which the insurance subsidiaries operate.

Dividend

GEH’s dividend policy aims to provide shareholders with a predictable and sustainable dividend return, payable on a 

half-yearly basis.

The following sections provide details of the Group’s and Company’s exposure to insurance and key financial risks, as 

well as the objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks.

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to these insurance and key financial risks or the manner in which 

it manages and measures the risks.

Insurance Risk

The principal activity of the Group is the provision of insurance products and related financial advisory services. The 

products cover risks such as mortality, morbidity (health, disability, critical illness, personal accident) and property and 

casualty, and meet customer needs in investment and retirement provision.

The Group’s underwriting strategy is designed to ensure that risks are well diversified across the types of risk and level 

of insured benefits. This is largely achieved through diversification across industry sectors and geography, the use of 

medical screening in order to ensure that pricing takes into account of current health conditions and family medical 

history, regular review of actual claims experience, as well as detailed claims handling procedures. Underwriting 

limits are also established to enforce appropriate risk selection criteria. For example, the Group has the right to reject 

renewal of insurance policy, impose deductibles and reject payment of fraudulent claims.

Risks inherent in the Group’s activities include but are not limited to the following:

Insurance Risks of Life Insurance Contracts

Insurance risks arise when the Group underwrites insurance contracts. While insurance risks may not vary significantly 

across the geographical locations in which the Group currently operates, the types of risks insured, assumptions used 

in pricing the insurance products and subsequent setting aside of the technical provisions may give rise to potential 

shortfalls in provision for future claims and expenses when actual claims experience are worse than projections. 

Assumptions that may cause insurance risks to be underestimated include assumptions on policy lapses, mortality, 

morbidity and expenses.

ENTERPRISE RISK GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Insurance risk (continued)

Insurance Risks of Life Insurance Contracts (continued)

The Group utilises reinsurance to manage the mortality and morbidity risks. The Group’s reinsurance management 

strategy and policy are reviewed annually by RMC and Group ALC. Reinsurance is structured according to the type 

of risk insured. Catastrophe reinsurance is procured to limit catastrophic losses. The Group’s exposure to group 

insurance business is not significant and there is no material concentration risk.

In general, reinsurers must have a minimum credit rating of S&amp;P A- or equivalent to be considered for reinsurance 

business. The Group limits its risk to any one reinsurer by ceding different products to different reinsurers or to a panel 

of reinsurers.

Group ALC reviews the actual experience of mortality, morbidity, lapses and surrenders, and expenses and ensures 

that the policies, guidelines and limits established for managing the risks remain adequate and appropriate.

A substantial portion of the Group’s life insurance funds is participating in nature. In the event of volatile investment 

climate and/or unusual claims experience, the insurer has the option of revising the bonus payable to policyholders.   

For non-participating funds, the risk is that the guaranteed policy benefits must be met even when investment 

portfolios perform below expectations, or claims experience is higher than expected.

For investment-linked funds, the risk exposure for the Group is limited only to the underwriting aspect as all investment 

risks are borne by the policyholders.

Stress Testing is performed at least once a year to assess the solvency of the life insurance fund under various 

stress scenarios. The stress scenarios include regulatory prescribed scenarios, as well as scenarios depicting drastic 

changes in key parameters such as new business volume, market volatilities, expense patterns, mortality/morbidity 

patterns and lapse rates.

Insurance Risk of Non-Life Insurance Contracts

Risks under non-life insurance policies usually cover a twelve-month duration. The risk inherent in non-life insurance 

contracts is reflected in the insurance contract liabilities which include the premium and claims liabilities, as set 

out under Note 15 of the financial statements. The premium liabilities comprise a reserve for unexpired risks, while 

the claims liabilities comprise the loss reserves which include both provision for outstanding claims notified and 

outstanding claims incurred but not reported.

Insurance Risk of Non-Life Insurance Contracts (continued)

Risks under non-life insurance policies usually cover a twelve-month duration. The risk inherent in non-life insurance 

contracts is reflected in the insurance contract liabilities which include the premium and claims liabilities, as set 

out under Note 15 of the financial statements. The premium liabilities comprise a reserve for unexpired risks, while 

the claims liabilities comprise the loss reserves which include both provision for outstanding claims notified and 

outstanding claims incurred but not reported.

Key Assumptions

Non-life insurance contract liabilities are determined based on claims experience, knowledge of existing events, 

the terms and conditions of the relevant policies and interpretation of circumstances. Of particular relevance is past 

experience with similar cases, trends in historical claims, legislative changes, judicial decisions, economic conditions 

and claims handling procedures. The estimates of the non-life insurance contract liabilities are therefore sensitive to 

various factors and uncertainties. The actual future premium and claims liabilities will not develop exactly as projected 

and may vary from initial estimates.

Insurance risk of non-life insurance contracts is mitigated by achieving a large and well-diversified portfolio of insurance 

contracts across various industries and geographical areas. The risks are further mitigated by careful selection and 

implementation of underwriting strategies, which are designed to ensure that risks are diversified in terms of type of 

risk and level of insured benefits. Comprehensive assessment of new and on-going claims, regular detailed review of 

claims handling procedures and frequent investigation of possible fraudulent claims are established to further reduce 

the risk exposure of the Group. In addition, the Group further enforces a policy of active management and prompt 

pursuit of claims, in order to reduce its exposure to unpredictable future developments that can negatively impact the 

Group.

The Group has also limited its exposure by imposing maximum claim amounts on certain contracts as well as the use 

of reinsurance arrangements in order to limit exposure to catastrophic events such as hurricanes, earthquakes and 

flood damages.

The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of changes in key assumptions on gross and net liabilities, profit 

before tax and equity.

ENTERPRISE RISK GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Market and Credit Risk

Market risk arises when market values of assets and liabilities are adversely affected by  changes in financial markets. 

Changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and prices of alternative investment assets can 

impact present and future earnings of the insurance operations, as well as shareholders’ equity.

The Group is exposed to market risk through its investment portfolios, as well as in the mismatches between assets 

and liabilities of the Insurance Funds. In the case of the third-party funds managed by Lion Global Investors, investment 

risks are borne by investors and the Group does not assume any liability in the event of occurrence of loss or write-

down in market valuations. 

Group ALC, Group IC and Local ALCs actively manage market risks through the setting of investment policies 

and asset allocations, approving portfolio construction, risk measurement methodologies, as well as hedging and 

alternative risk transfer strategies. Investment limits are monitored at various levels to ensure that all investment 

activities are conducted within the Group’s risk appetite and in line with the Group’s management principles and 

philosophies. Compliance with established limits forms an integral part of the risk governance and financial reporting 

framework. The approach adopted by the Group in managing the various types of risk, including interest rate risk, 

foreign exchange risk, equity price risk, credit risk, alternative investment risk and liquidity risk, is briefly described 

below:

(a)

Interest rate risk (including asset liability mismatch). The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through  

(i) investments in fixed income instruments and (ii) policy liabilities in the Insurance Funds. Since the 

Shareholders’ Fund has exposure to investments in fixed income instruments but no exposure to insurance 

policy liabilities, it will incur economic losses when interest rates rise. Given the long duration of policy liabilities 

and the uncertainties in the cash flows of Insurance Funds, it is not possible to hold assets with duration 

that perfectly matches the duration of the policy liabilities. This results in interest rate risk and asset liability 

mismatch risk, and these risks are managed and monitored by Group ALC and Local ALCs. The Insurance 

Funds will incur an economic loss when interest rates drop as the duration of policy liabilities is generally longer 

than the duration of fixed income assets.

Under Singapore regulations governed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the discounting rate 

used for discounting liability cash flows may include a positive adjustment in the form of Matching Adjustment, 

or Illiquidity Premium, subject to certain conditions being met. As a result, the Singapore non-participating 

funds could have losses when the magnitude of the adjustment decreases.

Under Malaysia regulations governed by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), liability cash flows with durations less 

than 15 years are discounted using zero-coupon spot yields of Malaysia Government Securities (MGS) with 

matching durations, while liability cash flows with durations of 15 years or more are discounted using zero-

coupon spot yield of MGS with a 15-year term to maturity. As a result, the Malaysia non-participating fund 

could have losses when the zero-coupon spot yields of MGS decrease.

Foreign exchange risk. The foreign exchange risk inherent in foreign currency fixed income portfolio is 

typically hedged using currency forwards and swaps wherever practical and cost-effective. Foreign exchange 

instruments are also used for efficient portfolio management.

The SGD and RM positions predominately arose from the entities within the Group with the same respective 

functional currencies. The Group has no significant concentration of foreign exchange risk.

Limits are set on the total amount of foreign currency (net of liabilities) to cap the Group’s foreign exchange risk.

Equity price risk. Exposure to equity price risk exists in both assets and liabilities.  Asset exposure exists 

through direct equity, equity derivatives and fund investments, where the Group, through investments, bears all

where the revenues of the insurance operations are linked to the performances of underlying equity funds since 

this has an impact on the level of fees earned. Limits are set for single security holdings as a percentage of 

total equity holdings.

(d)

Credit spread risk. Exposure to credit spread risk exists in the Group’s bond investments. Credit spread is the 

difference between the quoted yields of a credit and a government bond of the same maturity. Credit spreads 

widen when the default risk of credit bonds increases. Hence, widening credit spreads will result mark-to-

market losses in the Group’s bond portfolio.

(e)

Alternative investment risk. The Group is exposed to alternative investment risk through investments in real 

estate that it owns in Singapore and Malaysia, and through real estate funds, private equities, infrastructure 

and hedge funds with exposures in other countries. A monitoring process is established to manage foreign 

exchange, country and manager concentration risks. This process and the acquisition or divestment of 

alternative investments are reviewed and approved by RMC and Group IC.

(f)

Commodity risk. The Group does not have any direct exposure to commodity risk.

(g)

Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises when the Group is unable to meet its cash flow demands, or if the assets 

backing the liabilities cannot be sold quickly enough without incurring significant losses. For an insurance 

company, the greatest liquidity needs typically arise from its insurance liabilities. Demands for funds can usually 

be met through ongoing normal operations via premiums received, sale of assets or borrowings. Unexpected 

demands for liquidity may be triggered by negative publicity, deterioration of the economy, adverse news on 

other companies in the same or similar lines of business, unanticipated policy claims, or other unexpected 

cash demands from policyholders.

Expected liquidity demands are managed through a combination of treasury, investment and asset-liability 

management practices, which are monitored on an ongoing basis. Actual and projected cash inflows and 

outflows are regularly monitored, and a reasonable amount of liquid assets are maintained at all times. The 

projected cash flows from the in-force insurance policy contract liabilities consist of renewal premiums, 

commissions, claims, maturities and surrenders.  Renewal premiums, commissions, claims and maturities are 

generally stable and predictable. Surrenders can be more uncertain although these have been quite stable over 

the past several years.  

Unexpected liquidity demands are mitigated through a combination of product design, risk diversification, 

investment strategies and systematic monitoring. Surrender penalty in insurance contracts also protects the 

Group from losses due to unexpected surrender trends and reduces the sensitivity of surrenders to changes 

in interest rates.

ENTERPRISE RISK GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Market and Credit Risk (continued)

(h)

Credit risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor failing to discharge an obligation. The Group 

is mainly exposed to credit risk through (i) investments in cash and bonds, (ii) corporate lending activities and 

(iii) exposure to counterparty’s credit in derivative transactions and reinsurance contracts. For all three types of 

exposures, financial loss may materialise as a result of a downgrading of credit rating or credit default by the 

borrower or counterparty.

The task of evaluating and monitoring credit risk is undertaken by Local ALCs. Group-wide credit risk is 

managed by Group ALC. The Group establishes internal limits by issuer, counterparty and investment grade 

which are actively monitored to manage the credit and concentration risk and reviewed on a regular basis.  

The creditworthiness of reinsurers is assessed on an annual basis by reviewing their financial strength through 

published credit ratings and other publicly available financial information.

Reinsurance is placed with counterparties that have a good credit rating and concentration of risk is mitigated 

through counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved on an annual basis.

Credit risk arising from customer balances incurred on non-payment of premiums or contributions will only 

persist during the grace period specified in the policy document or trust deed until expiry, when the policy is 

either paid up or terminated.

The Group issues unit-linked investment policies in which the policyholder bears the investment risk on the 

assets held in the unit-linked funds as the policy benefits are directly linked to the value of the assets in the 

fund. Therefore, the Group has no material credit risk or market risk on unit-linked financial assets.

The loans in the Group’s portfolio are generally secured by collateral, with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 

70%. The amount and type of collateral required depend on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty. 

Guidelines on the collateral eligibility of collateral have been established, and all collaterals are revalued on 

a regular basis.  Management monitors the market values of collaterals, requests additional collaterals when 

needed and performs an impairment valuation when applicable.  The fair values of collaterals, held by the 

Group as lender, for which it is entitled to sell or pledge in the event of default is as tabulated below:

Amounts arising from ECL

ECL is recognised for credit-impaired and non-credit impaired exposure in accordance to SFRS (I) 9 through a 

forward-looking ECL models.

Measurement of ECL – Explanation of inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques

The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the following variables: 

• 

probability of default (‘PD’); 

• 

loss given default (‘LGD’); and 

• 

exposure at default (‘EAD’).

These parameters are derived from statistical models internally developed by the Group.

PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation, either over the next 12 months 

(‘12M PD’), or over the remaining lifetime (‘Lifetime PD’) of the obligation. PD estimates are derived from PD 

models that incorporate both quantitative and qualitative inputs, which are in turn derived from internal and 

external compiled data.

LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss incurred during a default. LGD is expressed as a percentage of loss 

per unit of exposure at the time of default and represents an estimate of the economic loss in the event of 

the default of the counterparty. Factors in determining LGDs include claim seniority, availability and quality 

of collateral, legal enforceability processes in the jurisdiction and industry of borrower and prevailing market 

conditions. They are estimates at a certain date and are derived using statistical models. These statistical 

models are developed using internally compiled data and incorporate both quantitative and qualitative factors. 

The model outputs are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information whenever appropriate.

EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group derives the EAD based on the 

current exposure to the counterparty and potential future exposure. 

The ECL is determined by projecting PD, LGD and EAD for each individual exposure. The ECLs are first 

determined from the product of these three components, which are then adjusted for forward-looking 

information. The ECLs are finally discounted to the reporting date. The discount rate used in the ECL calculation 

is the original effective interest rate or an approximation thereof.

Significant increase in credit risk

To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring 

on the asset as at reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The Group considers 

available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information, which includes the following indicators:

– Internal credit rating

– External credit rating

– Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are 

expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations.

A movement of an obligor’s credit rating along the rating scale represents a change in the credit risk as 

measured by the change in PD.

The criteria for assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly will be determined by both quantitative 

changes in 12M PDs and qualitative factors. The credit risk of an obligor is deemed to have increased 

significantly since initial recognition if, based on the Group’s quantitative model, the 12M PD is determined 

to have more than doubled since origination, except when the obligor remains within the investment grade 

ratings. 

Using its expert credit judgment and, where possible, relevant historical experience, the Group may determine 

that an obligor has undergone a significant increase in credit risk based on qualitative indicators that it considers 

are indicative of such and whose effect may not otherwise be fully reflected in its quantitative analysis on a 

timely basis. The Group uses the watch-list as an additional trigger for the identification of significant increase 

in credit risk.

The Group considers an obligor to have “low credit risk” if it is of investment grade, taking into account both 

internal and external credit ratings.

Credit risk grades

The Group assigns each obligor to a credit risk grade that reflects the PD of the obligor. Credit risk grades are 

established based on qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of default risk. These factors vary 

depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of counterparty. 

Credit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the default risk increases as credit risk deteriorates. 

Each exposure is assigned with a credit risk grade at initial recognition, based on available information on the 

borrower. Obligors are subject to ongoing monitoring and review, and may be assigned with new credit risk 

grades based on latest available information that better reflects their creditworthiness. The monitoring typically 

involves the use of information obtained during periodic review, including published financial statements, 

external rating (where available), as well as qualitative information on an obligor’s industry characteristics, 

competitive positioning, management, financial policy and financial flexibility.

Definition of default

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default by assessing the following criteria:

Quantitative criteria

For insurance receivables, the obligor is said to be in default if it fails to make contractual payments within 12 

months after it falls due. For bonds and loans, the obligor is said to be in default if it fails to meet its contractual 

obligation and there are non-payments on another debt obligation of the same issuer to the Group.

Qualitative criteria

The counterparty is in bankruptcy or has indications of potentially significant financial difficulty such as lawsuits 

or similar actions that threaten the financial viability of the counterparty; distressed exchange, merger or 

amalgamation without assumption  or breach of material loan covenants not rectified within a given timeframe, 

restructuring with expected principal haircut or a breach in material loan covenant that is not rectified within 

given timeframe.

The criteria above have been applied to all financial instruments held by the Group and are consistent with 

the definition of default used for credit risk management purposes. The default definition has been applied 

consistently to model the PD, EAD and LGD throughout the Group’s expected loss calculations.

Incorporating of forward-looking information

The Group incorporates forward-looking information into both its assessment of whether the credit risk of an 

instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and its ECL measurement. The Group has 

performed historical analysis and identified key economic variables impacting credit risk and ECLs for each 

portfolio.

These economic variables and their associated impact on the PD, EAD and LGD vary by financial instrument. 

Expert judgement has also been applied in this process. Forecasts of these economic variables (the “base 

economic scenario”) are obtained from publicly available economic databases published on a quarterly basis 

and provide the best estimate view of the economy over the next four to five years, after which, to project the 

economic variables for the full remaining lifetime of each instrument, a mean reversion approach is used. The 

impact of these economic variables on PDs, EADs and LGDs has been determined via regression analyses.

In addition to the base economic scenario, the Group uses multiple scenarios to ensure non-linear risks are 

captured. The number of scenarios and their attributes are reviewed at each reporting date. At 31 December 

2020, for all portfolios, the Group concluded that two particular scenarios are capable of capturing non-linear 

risks inherent in all portfolios. The scenario weightings are determined by expert credit judgement, taking 

into account the range of possible outcomes the chosen scenario is representative of. The assessment of 

significant increase in credit risk is performed using the 12M PD under each of the scenarios multiplied by the 

associated scenario weights. This determines whether the whole financial instrument is in Stage 1, 2 or 3, and 

hence whether 12M or lifetime ECL should be applied. Following this assessment, the Group measures ECL 

as either a probability- weighted 12M ECL (Stage 1), or a probability-weighted lifetime ECL (Stages 2 and 3). 

These probability-weighted ECLs are determined by running each scenario through the relevant ECL model 

and multiplying it by the appropriate scenario weighting (as opposed to weighting the inputs).

As with any economic forecasts, the projections and likelihoods of occurrence are subject to a high degree 

of uncertainty and the actual outcomes may be significantly different from projected outcomes. The Group 

considers these forecasts being representative of the best estimates of the possible outcomes and has 

analysed the non-linear risks and asymmetries within the various portfolios of the Group to establish that the 

chosen scenarios are appropriately representative of the range of possible scenarios.

The sensitivity of the ECL to the economic variable assumptions affecting the calculation of ECL was not 

material to the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020.

Concentration risk. An important element of managing both market and credit risks is to actively manage 

concentration to specific issuers, counterparties, industry sectors, countries and currencies.  Both internal and 

regulatory limits are put in place to manage concentration risk. These limits are reviewed on a regular basis by 

the respective management committees. The Group’s exposures are within the concentration limits set by the 

respective local regulators.  

The Group actively manages its investment mix to ensure that there is no significant concentration in market 

and credit risk.

Sensitivity analysis on financial risks. The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on the Group’s 

net profit after tax by applying possible shocks to each key variables, with all other variables constant. Co-

movement of key variables can significantly affect the fair values and/or amortised cost of financial assets. To 

demonstrate the impact due to changes in each key variable, the variables are changed individually.  

The impact on net profit after tax represents the effect caused by changes in fair value of financial assets 

whose fair values are recorded in the Profit or Loss Statement, and changes in valuation of insurance contract 

liabilities. The equity sensitivity represents the impact on net profit after tax and the effect on changes in fair 

value of financial assets measured at FVOCI.

Operational and Compliance Risk

Operational risk is an event or action that may potentially impact partly or completely the achievement of the 

organisation’s objectives resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human factors, or 

external events.

Compliance risk is any event or action that may potentially impact partly or completely the achievement of the 

organisation’s objectives, as a result of its failure to comply with the following applicable laws, regulations and 

standards:

– local laws, regulations and rules governing licensed activities undertaken by Great Eastern;

 

– foreign laws, regulations and rules that have extraterritorial jurisdiction over Great Eastern’s licensed activities;

– codes of practice promoted by industry associations of which Great Eastern are members of; and 

– any other applicable regulations which do not specifically govern the licensed activities undertaken by Great Eastern 

but can expose the organisation to legal, regulatory or reputational loss.

The day-to-day management of operational and compliance risk is through the maintenance of comprehensive 

internal control frameworks, supported by an infrastructure of systems and procedures to monitor processes and 

transactions. GMC reviews operational and compliance issues on a group basis at its monthly meetings while local 

level issues are managed and monitored by the local SMTs. The Internal Audit team reviews the systems of internal 

controls to assess their ongoing relevance and effectiveness, and reports at least quarterly to the Audit Committee.

Technology, Information and Cyber Risks

Technology risk is defined as risk related to any potential adverse outcome, damage, loss, disruption, violation, 

system/hardware failure, capacity deficiency arising from the use of technologies such as electronic hardware/ 

devices, software, online networks and telecommunications systems.

Information Risk is defined as risk related to confidentiality, integrity and availability of information (in physical or digital 

form).

Cyber Risk is defined as risk related to acts perpetrated by malicious threat actors including internal sabotage, espionage, 

malicious attacks, hacking incidents, fraudulent conduct using information and communication technologies.

Great Eastern adopts a risk based approach in managing technology, information and cyber risks relating to cyber-

attacks, data loss/leakage, deficiency in change management, emerging technology, inadequate vendor management, 

inferior system acquisition and development, network security vulnerability, privilege access misuse, system security 

vulnerability, system unavailability and technology obsolescence. Key risk indicators related to technology, information 

and cyber risks are reported to the Board on a regular basis. Independent assessment is performed by Internal Audit 

for its adequacy and effectiveness.

FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

34.1

Fair Value Hierarchy

The Group categorises fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the valuation inputs 

used as follows:

Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at 

the measurement date,

Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for an asset or liability, either 

directly or indirectly, quotes from brokers and market makers, cash flow discounting and other valuation techniques 

commonly used by market participants, and

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, 

then the fair value measurement would be categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the 

lowest input that is significant to the entire measurement (with Level 3 being the lowest).  

Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy

Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred on the date of the event or change 

in circumstances that caused the transfers.

Valuation process:

Valuation of financial instruments are performed by custodian and the valuation of investment properties are 

performed by external valuer. The valuations of investment properties are based primarily on the comparable 

method, the income method and the residual method. The valuation by custodian is verified and assessed 

reasonableness by Group Investment Management department against available market condition. The major 

inputs of investment properties are verified against independent valuation reports and assessed reasonableness 

against property value of other comparable properties. Property department also held discussions with external 

valuer on the fluctuation noted.

EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD

We view the COVID-19 pandemic as an evolving situation  with continued uncertainties that could impact the 

performance of the Group. There are still many unknowns surrounding the pandemic and the timing of its eradication 

remains uncertain. The impact to our business operations would hinge on each government’s response to manage the 

health and economic effects of the pandemic.

We expect continued volatility in the financial markets, resulting in fluctuations in the mark-to-market valuation of our 

assets and liabilities, which will impact our profit. Key factors are the direction of interest rates, credit spreads and 

equity prices. As our bonds are mostly investment grade, the default risk is likely to be low.

At the Board of Directors’ Meeting held on 22 February 2021, the Board authorised these financial statements for
