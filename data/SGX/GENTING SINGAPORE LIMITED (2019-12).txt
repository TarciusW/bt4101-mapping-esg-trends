BUSINESS IN BRIEF




MESSAGE FROM

OUR PRESIDENT

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

2019 marked another meaningful and exciting year for our 

sustainability efforts.

Over the years, Genting Singapore has established itself 

as a global brand leader in sustainable integrated resort 

development. Not resting on our laurels, we are continuously 

exploring new strategies and innovation with our stakeholders 

to be a stronger player on the sustainability front.

We are in the fourth year of our Sustainability21 Strategy 

where we proudly present our seventh comprehensive 

sustainability report in accordance with the Global Reporting 

Initiatives (“GRI”) guidelines.

Our various efforts in 2019 in the report highlight the 

importance of creating positive impact and sustainable value 

for our business stakeholders, environment, community, team 

members and customers.

We delivered on our commitment to reduce waste even 

further; from eliminating plastic straws resort-wide in 2018 

to phasing out single-use plastic bottles in 2019. This also 

propelled us to think out-of-the-box for green, practical and 

creative alternatives for our guests, including adopting the 

use of boxed water, refillable glass carafes and self-dispensing 

infused water. Our innovative ideas in using smarter and more 

eco-friendly packaging won us top prize at the Singapore 

Packaging Awards for the second consecutive year.

Genting Singapore is also closely aligned with the larger 

national commitment to fight climate change. We have 

performed well with a commendable report card on our 

longstanding conservation initiatives. We continue to exceed 

our 2020 cumulative energy and water savings targets with 

savings of 66.2% and 44.6% respectively in 2019.

We have also embarked on innovative waste management 

methods with great measurable success. From bio-digesters 

for food waste to smart bins and reducing waste at source, we 

have recorded a 9% decrease in waste sent for incineration. 

Of the waste produced this year, 24% were recycled.

In 2019, we achieved good traction in various initiatives 

surrounding environmental conservation. These include our 

Sustainable Seafood Campaign for our restaurants and central 

kitchen, beach and reef clean-ups, as well as marine 

conservation education and outreach. Through RWS Cares, 

our corporate social responsibility arm, we contributed and 

facilitated close to S$6.7 million in cash and in-kind donations 

to various charities and organisations.

Our achievements would not have been possible without 

the hard work and support of our partners, stakeholders and 

team members. We would like to thank all of them for being 

part of Genting Singapore’s sustainability journey in making a 

positive impact as a responsible corporate citizen.

Tan Hee Teck,

President and

Chief Operating Officer

MESSAGE FROM OUR PRESIDENT














BOARD OF

DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

This year’s Sustainability Report sets out what we have 

accomplished in 2019 and marks how far we have come in 

carrying out our Sustainability21 Strategy.

For the last four years, Sustainability21 has been built on 

the four pillars of Marketplace, People, Community and 

Environment. This year, we have added the fifth pillar: 

Customer. The five pillars have enabled us to sharpen our focus 

on the Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters 

of strategic importance to us. Beyond business imperatives, 

these are factors aligned with national and international 

interests.

Our Sustainability Focus underpins our management approach 

in developing policies and practices, setting performance 

targets and action plans with a goal of creating sustainable 

value for all stakeholders.

In 2019, the Board maintained oversight over the Sustainability 

Working Committee and Sustainability Steering Committee, 

ensuring that ESG material matters are of continued relevance 

to our operations, taking into consideration global dynamics, 

local trends and emerging regulatory developments.

The Board also reviewed, monitored and managed sustainability 

risks and opportunities. This oversight includes significant 

emphasis on enhancing the sustainability performance of 

business practices as well as the transparency of disclosures.

We believe that Genting Singapore has put up a good 

performance, but we will continue to strive for more 

outstanding sustainability performance. We will remain vigilant 

and steadfast in our commitments to sustainability efforts for 

the sustainable growth and development of the community 

and environment which we are a part of.

into account external stakeholders’ concerns/interests collected from engagement channels embedded in our daily operations.  

In 2019, to sharpen our focus on the ESG issues that are most pertinent, Genting Singapore identified 21 material topics under 

the five focus areas through a materiality assessment workshop.

Genting Singapore works closely with our suppliers to constantly create new and innovative products and services while

DOING GOOD BUSINESS


88% of products and services purchased locally*.

*The definition of ‘local’ includes local agents who may procure from overseas sources e.g. retail merchandise, 

rides’ spare parts and have local registered office addresses. 

FOCUS AREA #1: SUSTAINABLE SOURCES

At the start of the supply chain, we are committed to identifying sustainable sources for our key material categories, including 

food and beverages, hotel amenities, live animal feed and pulp-based materials without compromising the quality of goods 

and services procured. 

FOCUS AREA #2: SUPPLY CHAIN ASSURANCE

Since 2018, we began to holistically assess ESG risk exposure in our supply chain. For suppliers who are identified as high risk 

or fail to meet minimum ESG standards, we seek to find alternative suppliers or not assign any high-risk activities.

FOCUS AREA #3: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

Besides material and vendor selection, we also limit our environment footprint across all waste categories. In 2019, we received 

the Top Achievement award at the Singapore Packaging Agreement Awards. Our move to eliminate the use of single-use 

bottled water has saved more than 130 tonnes of packaging waste (read more on page 21). We will continue to champion 

packaging waste reduction efforts to drive material impact along our supply chain.

FOCUS AREA #4: SUPPLY CHAIN INFLUENCE

We partner with suppliers who share the same values as us. Since 80% of our spending are locally sourced, we are in a good 

position to drive and influence our supply chain towards sustainable business practices. This is achieved via:

– 

Joint supplier development projects for new innovative sustainable solutions

– 

Incorporating sustainable requirement into RWS specifications/scope of work

– 

Paving the way of how business transactions are being conducted electronically

All our suppliers have to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct as part of our Purchase Orders Standard Terms and 

Conditions. The Code of Conduct sets out our expectations for Ethical Business Practice, Labour and Human Rights, Health and 

Safety and Environmental Responsibility.

PMLTF framework

Our robust ERM framework is established to manage our operational risks and safeguard our assets to create long-term 

stakeholder value. The ERM framework (as illustrated below) is based on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

Listing Rule 1207(10) and Code of Corporate Governance 2018 Principle 9.

2. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (“ERM”)

Risk Management matters are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board every quarter, playing a pivotal role in 

providing Management action and direction on risk matters.

3. 

ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR

We comply with the Competition Act and are strictly against and do not take part in any anti-competitive behaviour. This 

includes activities that prevent, restrict, or distort competition within Singapore. Our commitment to zero tolerance:

• 

No legal actions or outcomes regarding anti-competitive, anti-trust or monopoly practices

• 

No dealings or co-operation with other companies involving anti-competitive, anti-trust or monopoly practices

3. 

ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR

We are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations related to the prevention of money laundering and 

terrorism financing, and to deter patrons and external parties from using Genting Singapore as a conduit for any illegal activity. 

To this end, a PMLTF Committee has been established to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing and to comply with 

the Casino Control Act PMLTF Regulations 2009.

Overseen by Senior Management, the PMLTF framework is also reviewed and updated annually by business units and approved 

by the Board to ensure that the framework stays relevant in this changing world. To guide the team members on the PMLTF 

framework, internal policies and standard operating procedures have been established which are communicated during 

orientation and annual refresher trainings conducted by appointed PMLTF officers.

3. ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR

4. PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORISM FINANCING (“PMLTF”)

3. 

ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR

Our robust internal control system consists of the Whistle-Blowing Policy and Entertainment and Gifts Policy which serve 

to manage our fraud risks. To promote responsible and secure whistle-blowing, we have whistle-blower hotline and email 

channels which are accessible throughout the year by all team members and external parties.

In 2019, there were no serious irregularities, such as fraud or breaches of corporate governance, from the whistle-blowing 

channel.

ANTI-BRIBERY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION:

A ZERO TOLERANCE APPROACH

We adopt a zero-tolerance stance against bribery and corruption. All our employees must comply with all applicable prevention 

of corruption laws, including the Singapore Prevention of Corruption Act.

To this end, we have a whistle-blowing channel to ensure that concerns can – whether anonymously or otherwise – be raised in 

a safe, transparent and accountable manner, without fear of reprisal in any form. This whistle-blowing policy is also applicable 

for anyone with a business relationship with Genting Singapore. The whistle-blowing platforms include a whistle-blower hotline 

and email channel. Our Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the procedure, which is administered with the 

assistance of the Head of Internal Audit.

In 2019, we achieved zero incidences of confirmed incidents related to corruption.

The Compliance Committee – which comprises a RWS Director and Senior Management personnel from the Legal, Gaming, 

Information Technology and Compliance functions – is dedicated to overseeing compliance-related matters. All incidents of 

non-compliance will be reviewed by our Compliance team and reported to the Committee. The Committee meets at least 

quarterly to assess the compliance risks, evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation controls and ensure progress on any action 

plans on agenda. In 2019 we incurred one fine by the Casino Regulatory Authority (“CRA”). Corrective actions were put 

in place to prevent the recurrences as described in the table below. We will continue to strive towards achieving zero non-

compliance cases.

We strengthened our commitment to sustainability in 2019 by taking on even more measures to reduce waste. 

Building on our move in 2018 to reduce single-use plastic by eliminating the use of plastic straws in 2018, we 

broadened this effort in 2019.

Since 2019, our themed attractions, hotels, dining establishments and MICE events have ceased using 

single-use plastic bottles. We replaced these with eco-friendly alternatives such as boxed alkaline water and 

aluminium canned drinks.

Our six hotels, which previously provided complimentary bottled water, now offer more sustainable options for 

drinking water. These include refillable glass carafes in each room as well as newly-installed and conveniently-located 

water stations on every floor. In hotel suites, a water filtration system has been installed in the sinks for safe drinking 

straight from the tap. At MICE events, guests are now served with fresh fruit-infused water dispensed from filtered 

pitchers instead of bottled water. This has saved 6.7 million plastic bottles, or more than 100 tonnes of plastic bottles 

a year.

Within the organisation, 2,000 reusable water bottles were given to our team members and encouraged to use them 

during a Free Slushie Day event. A total of 463 team members also made a commitment to protect the environment.

This reduction of plastic bottles is part of our ongoing sustainability efforts to minimise waste and drive environmental 

stewardship. It is also aligned with our moves to become a Zero Waste Nation. We will continue to map our plastic 

footprint and overall waste and explore new and innovative eco-friendly ways to make strategic reductions where 

possible.

An Organisation-wide Effort

Our environmental efforts take place across multiple 

platforms, 

from 

behind-the-scenes 

operational 

initiatives to public-facing programmes, awareness 

activities and outreach. This ensures that we take a 

holistic and strategic approach to sustainability.

It is heartening that these efforts have been 

recognised. Our hotels – including our flagship spa, 

ESPA – are BCA Green Mark-accredited for their 

sustainability features, such as extensive greenery, 

eco-pond, energy conservation, cooling and heating 

systems as well as eco-friendly linens. In 2019, RWS 

was also lauded at the Singapore Packaging Awards, 

and was named Top Achievement Winner for the 

second consecutive year.



A COMMITMENT 

TO THE ENVIRONMENT

As the owner of one of the largest integrated resorts in the world, we are dedicated to identifying and understanding the 

impact that our facilities, operations and products have on the environment.

Our environmental sustainability strategy focuses on:

• 

Preserving scarce resources through energy and water efficiency, and waste reduction

• 

Protecting the natural capital that is entrusted in our care

Guided by a Sustainability Steering Committee, our Sustainability Working Committee leads various sub-committees and task 

forces that look into and execute strategies for energy and water reduction, publicity, awareness and education, and sustainable 

procurement.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP


Waste management and minimisation form a key strategy for our organisation to ensure the sustainable and responsible use 

of resources. In keeping with 3R principles to reduce, reuse and recycle, we have taken concerted steps to eliminate waste at 

source across our operations.

Our waste management strategy involves monitoring and categorising waste produced by type and disposal methods, giving 

us a clear and comprehensive overview of where to focus our sustainability efforts.

Recycling at all levels

From the ground up, we recycle where we can. For example, horticulture waste 

is composted and the resulting fertiliser is used in landscape maintenance. We 

have also strengthened the recycling of e-waste. Electronic gadgets, computers or 

mobile accessories are collected by licensed waste collection vendors for sorting, 

segregating and salvaging so that recyclables such as plastic and metal components 

can be recycled.

Compared to 2018, in 2019 we saw a 9% decrease in waste sent for incineration. 

Of the waste produced this year, 24% were recycled.

Team members from the Wardrobe Department contributed to our efforts in 

recycling, spending 102 hours upcycling 80m of excess cloth into 100 cup holders 

and 120 tote bags for use as gifts for in-house events.

EFFLUENTS 

AND WASTE





Reducing food waste

RWS prepares and hosts thousands of meals a year. We have taken creative and innovative 

steps to minimise food wastage and improve our ecological footprint, by addressing the 

issue across the waste cycle. In a bid to strive for zero food waste right at the start, our 

chefs creatively repurpose ingredients to create edible receptacles for food presentation.

On the other end of the consumption spectrum, we have implemented three food 

grinder stations. These machines automatically grind food waste to a pulp, which is 

automatically transported to a bio-digester that converts 95% of food waste into liquid 

to reduce waste volume. This saves 72,000 plastic trash bags per year, translating to 5.3 

tonnes of plastic reduction per year across our MICE activities alone.

Taking out the trash

To improve our waste efficiency, we have deployed 17 Smart Bins, which has reduced 

the number of regular bins from 104 to 43. These energy-saving solar-powered, larger-

capacity compactor bins are able to compact trash, increasing trash capacity by 8 times. 

This reduces labour intensively as less trips are needed by cleaners to clear trash. Instead, 

cleaners are notified via SMS once the bin is full. This has reduced the frequency of trash 

clearing by 25%.

Energy Conservation

In total, our efforts in 2019 in energy conservation have 

saved some 5,069,009 kWh and as of 2019, we achieved 

a cumulative energy savings of 224,330,173 kWh and is on 

track to exceed our 2020 cumulative energy savings target.

A comprehensive Integrated Utilities Monitoring System (“IUMS”) keeps our operations running smoothly and as efficiently 

as possible. The IUMS is the control centre behind-the-scenes, overseeing electricity, water, gas and chilled water of each key 

entity within our resort. It monitors, records and trends our utility consumption. The data collected on usage patterns form the 

basis of analysis for our Facilities Management &amp; Engineering team, which looks out for abnormal usage patterns and explores 

opportunities for improvements. Guided by this intelligence, we strategise on and implement initiatives to further improve our 

energy and water use efficiencies.

Lighting the way

Since 2015, we started our 5-year phased project to convert resort-wide lightings to energy 

efficient LEDs and as of end 2019, we have achieved the target by 96%.

Cooling and heating efficiently



As an integrated resort, cooling and heating needs necessarily 

take up a large part of our operations to keep guests comfortable. 

Our award-winning district cooling plant – one of the most 

efficient in Singapore – is a crucial factor in optimising our 

electricity and water use. The plant is fitted with sophisticated 

controllers with algorithms to continuously tune and operate the 

plant at the lowest possible Coefficient of Performance (“COP”). 

This is achieved through automatically controlling and varying the 

multiple operational parameters of the chillers, pumps, cooling 

towers and heat exchangers for optimum overall efficiency.





We have also upgraded water 

heaters with heat pumps in our 

Beach Villas and various kitchens to 

lower energy consumption for hot 

water production. These systems 

also provides additional cooling 

energy to reduce cooling loads in 

these respective areas.

Keeping things flowing

Complementing these efficiencies, we use environment-monitoring sensors within our underground carpark – the largest such 

facility in Singapore. These sensors help us optimise the operation of carpark ventilation fans to achieve energy savings.

A clean energy drive

To improve our use of clean energy and support the growing adoption 

of electric vehicles (“EV”), we collaborated with Singapore Power 

Mobility (“SPM”) to introduce seven EV fast chargers across three 

locations. Since these EV charging stations were installed in September 

2019, they have been used over 500 times. As part of our partnership 

with BlueSG, we have also allocated four EV lots for their vehicles.

• Use compost to enrich soil and 

organic pesticides to biologically 

control plant pests and diseases

• Protect trees in the forest against 

damage

• Monitor the health and safety of the 

trees within our premises

• Careful collection planning in line with the Association of Zoos and 

Aquariums’ Animal Programme Standards

• Sourcing of sustainable fish feed

• Monitoring the health and safety of our marine life

• Inter-institutional exchange to share best veterinary and husbandry practices 

with other aquariums

RWS records native plants and marine species within our premises. Among plants and animals under our care, several species 

are listed under national and international conservation lists for their vulnerable status.

Outreach &amp; Education

Our environmental stewardship extends beyond how we 

operate. As an organisation, we believe that engagement is 

essential in building and nurturing a mindset of sustainability and 

environmental awareness. To this end, our advocacy spans the 

spectrum, from internal staff efforts to public campaigns.





Team member engagement

Over 2,500 RWS team members were engaged in 2019 on field trips and back-of-

house activities related to sustainability and waste reduction efforts.

These activities include an educational fieldtrip to the Sungei Buloh wetland 

reserve that highlighted the impact of marine debris on local shores. There was 

also an internal back-of-house cleanup for sustainability representatives from 

various departments.

Getting the public involved

SEAA is one of our most important platforms for conservation outreach. 

In 2019, it has taken great strides to further its engagement efforts, both 

onsite at the facility and outside in the heartlands of Singapore to enhance 

environmental awareness and inspire conservation action.

Throughout the year, our conservation arm reached out to over 7,000 

people across 14 events in the heartlands of Singapore, advocating and

Engaging The Young Ones in Marine Conservation 

In 2019, SEAA partnered “Start Small Dream Big” (“SSDB”), a nationwide movement initiated by Early Childhood 

Development Agency that encourages children to use their own resources and abilities to give back to society as a 

means to instill good values.

In line with SSDB’s theme on heritage, SEAA created resources and conducted activities centred on ‘Protecting 

Singapore’s Natural Heritage – Reduction of Single-Use Plastics’ for preschool educators and students. Children 

got to discover and acquaint themselves with the remarkable and diverse marine life of Singapore, as well as explore 

ideas and actions that can contribute to the preservation of Singapore’s natural heritage.

SEAA Education team visited 19 centres to conduct brainstorming sessions and ideate activities for marine conservation 

together with the preschoolers. This initiative reached 917 students. On top of these initiatives, 150 children got to take 

action for marine conservation through their active participation in one of the five beach clean-ups specially organised 

by SEAA for preschool centres, amounting to the collection of 60kg of trash.

raising awareness on marine life, plastic pollution and climate change. These include community and school events such as the 

Central Public Library Biodiversity Carnival and National University of Singapore Eco-Fest.

SEAA also organised the Ocean Heroes Bootcamp Network for 35 people from all walks of life – from children as young as 

eight to students and working adults – who wanted to do their part for the ocean. This three-day event, held in April 2019, 

empowered participants to conceptualise campaigns on how to reduce plastic usage in their community.

Over 2019, five beach, reef and kayak clean-ups were also held, garnering the participation of 206 members of the public 

and RWS team members. In total, over 500kg of trash from Singapore’s shorelines was collected. These clean-ups were part 

of larger national and global efforts; data collected during each beach and mangrove cleanup was handed to International 

Coastal Cleanup Singapore to educate the public on marine debris issues. Data was also provided to Project AWARE’s flagship 

citizen-science programme Dive Against Debris®, which collates information on the distribution of marine litter around the 

globe.



RWS also participated in the global Earth Hour movement as well as 

Singapore World Water Day in March 2019. Several onsite initiatives 

were also put forth to further engage around 1,300 guests and 

internal team members.

We partnered with James Cook University, Singapore and hosted 

our 2nd year of Science in the SEAA (SIS) series. This event invites 

researchers and experts to share their work with marine conservation 

enthusiasts in Singapore. Exclusive sharing sessions by the experts 

were organised for internal team members as capability building 

opportunities. Apart from these, SEAA hosted public talks and events 

on marine conservation and marine animals.

SERVICE LABELLING

We pride ourselves at creating meaningful, memorable experiences at RWS – with a service experience that ensures the health, 

safety and enjoyment of all our guests.

To guide our efforts in guest health and safety, we conduct detailed, organisation-wide risk assessments and management 

plans for each business division, such as Attractions, F&amp;B and Convention Centre. This enables us to actively identify significant 

hazards, manage risks and make sure that relevant guest safety SOPs are in place.

These SOPs are overseen, maintained and enforced by respective business divisions. For example, the Safety and Emergency 

Planning (“S&amp;EP”) department coordinates health and safety management and reporting activities at the resort level. RWS’s 

Risk Committee also reviews guest health and safety incidents on a regular basis and provides oversight on corrective actions 

to prevent recurrences.

GUEST SATISFACTION

RWS Attractions strives to create a positive experience for all 

our guests. A service excellence framework articulates our 

distinctive service DNA that defines the shared values we hold 

when engaging guests. This is in turn supported by tailored 

competency training programmes and robust monitoring 

activities for continuous improvements.

The service excellence framework covers a suite of training 

in areas such as service image, service language, service 

knowledge, and service attentiveness.

A service feedback system encourages and monitors service 

levels at key touchpoints. There is also an administrative 

function overseeing external service recognition awards.

Service excellence training

To achieve service excellence, it is important that our staff are equipped with the relevant and necessary skills for their diverse 

and unique service roles.

A competency matrix that determines the different types of skills training required has been developed for each of these 

specialised and specific roles. This training also promotes and nurtures behavioural characteristics that elevate service 

performance. In 2019, we provided 6,661 training hours related to service delivery.

Among these programmes is, Be aRWsome, a service excellence initiative designed for all team members that focuses on 

the importance of having a positive attitude. Under this programme, Team Members are taught how attitudes can influence 

thinking and behaviour. This helps them to relate to their roles in the service chain, by applying positive attitudes, behaviours, 

and ownership at work to achieve service excellence.

Guest satisfaction surveys

We conduct satisfaction surveys daily to gather feedback from guest about their experiences at the resort.

The data is analysed and shared with respective business units monthly for improvement action plans, if required. These guest 

satisfaction scores are benchmarked against the Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore, a landmark measure of customer 

satisfaction cutting across sectors and sub-sectors in the services industry of Singapore. It is jointly developed by the Institute 

of Service Excellence at Singapore Management University and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency. The data also 

provides inputs for our competency training program to address any gaps in performances.

AND EDUCATION  

A happy workplace is a productive and successful one – and one that boosts team member morale and job fulfilment. As a 

benefit of working at RWS, all staff are also entitled to discounted attraction tickets and discounts at RWS-owned F&amp;B and 

retail outlets.

And besides the provision of healthcare and insurance, Genting Singapore supports long-term health and fitness. All RWS 

staff have convenient access to the in-house clinic, and all performers enjoy free gym access in the resort. We also organised 

Company-wide events to raise awareness of important health issues. In 2019, these included ‘Fitness Flash’ (stretching exercise 

classes) and educational talks on healthy food and weight management. There were also health awareness days to highlight 

World Cancer Day, World Skin Health Day, and World Osteoporosis Day.

Complementing these efforts, we make health checkups easily available to our Team Members throughout the year at our 

partner clinics as well as onsite Health and Wellness checkups twice a year.

Our recruitment process is fair and just. We do not discriminate against race, age, gender, religion or nationality. We continue 

to search for talent through various channels, including job portals, social media platforms, Institutes of Higher Learning, career 

fairs and collaborations with partners such as the Devan Nair Employment &amp; Employability Institute, Community Development 

Councils and Workforce Singapore. In 2019, we started a pilot collaboration with the Ministry of Defence to provide newly 

minted National Servicemen with internship opportunities. A total of 17 National Servicemen were personally mentored by 

management staff, and guided on key deliverables and competencies.

Genting Singapore also provides a platform for employees to seek redress for labour practices or human rights grievances 

through the Grievance Handling Procedure. In 2019, there were no reported grievances on labour practices and human rights 

through this platform.

Besides employees, we extend the same standard to all contractors and service providers. We hold mandatory safety induction 

and meetings with contractors before work starts and safety considerations are included in our criteria when shortlisting vendors 

during the procurement process. Appointed contractors are reviewed regularly for their safety robustness and performance – 

which forms an important factor in the contract renewal process.

Promoting a culture of safety

We believe that safety and accident prevention are everyone’s responsibilities. To this end, we empower all team members with 

the knowledge and skills to take ownership of workplace safety.

For example, all employees are encouraged to refresh their knowledge on fire safety awareness via e-learning modules. Fire 

safety awareness trainings are also conducted once a week and a hands-on fire extinguisher and fire blanket trainings are 

conducted monthly on-site. Department safety representatives are also required to complete an e-learning on risk management, 

and incident reporting and investigation. Ongoing safety videos are broadcasted at the uniform collection area in the office and 

during induction training for awareness.

Building on this, each department has a safety committee that engages team members in the promotion of safety practices 

relevant to their roles and responsibilities. Once a month, safety inspections are done together with the respective Head of 

Department.

To build a culture of open communication and mutual learning, work-related incidents are communicated to employees during 

department safety committee meetings, pre-shift briefings, safety video at wardrobe areas, induction training, safety bulletins 

and safety alerts. To ensure that these messages effectively shared, we also provide them in various languages to ease of 

understanding.

Importantly, workers are also encouraged to report any unsafe act through various channels such as whistle-blowing channels, 

HR touchpoints and WSH common mailbox.

MAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT 

ON OUR COMMUNITIES

We serve the community we operate in through giving back, looking out for health and 

safety of the public, guests and staff to make a positive impact


RWS CARES:

OUR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITIES

Through empowerment and engagement, we hope to make a positive impact on the underprivileged in the community.

RWS Cares is our company’s CSR platform. We take a strategic and long-term approach to our CSR efforts so that we 

can achieve sustained and meaningful impact in the community.

In 2019, we contributed and enabled close to S$6.7 million cash and in-kind donations as well as funds raised towards 

various charity organisations in Singapore. Children, youth and elderly remain the key focus in our outreach, where 

87% of total donations account towards these causes. Genting Singapore has also joined the national movement 

towards building a more caring and inclusive society by sponsoring venues and providing resources and expertise for 

events empowering the special needs community and individuals with disabilities. Our volunteerism spirit continues 

to soar each year with our one-day Volunteer Leave, which team members can utilise, over and above their annual 

leave, to take part in CSR events organised or endorsed by RWS Cares. As such, we clocked 7,720 volunteer hours 

in 2019, which translated to S$263,000 worth in salary cost. In total, RWS Cares has engaged and reached out to 

more than 71,000 beneficiaries.

Caring for Our Silver Generation

In celebration of the Singapore Bicentennial, Genting 

Singapore organised a number of events dedicated to the 

silver community in recognition of the contributions of our 

pioneer generation.

aRWSome Volunteer Day

Our signature home refurbishment programme, aRWSome 

Volunteer Day, saw over 210 volunteers clock more than 

2,600 hours cleaning and refurbishing 26 one- and two-room 

rental flats of needy and elderly residents in Queenstown. 

This year, the programme took the company’s sustainability 

efforts a step further by including several green initiatives to 

the programme. This included an upcycling workshop for 

senior citizens and collaboration with vendors to recycle 

waste in support of a Zero Waste Nation. A group of 70 

elderly residents took part in the upcycling workshop to re-

purpose common household items such as single-use plastic 

bottles and old T-shirts into pen holders and tote bags. RWS 

collaborated with industry partners such as KL Enviro to sort 

out recyclables from the waste generated from the homes, 

and Diversey to provide environmentally-friendly floor and 

toilet cleaning solutions.



Our Children, Our Future

We believe every child should have equal opportunities to 

realise their fullest potential. We want to do our part and 

empower children to pursue their dreams and make positive 

contributions to society.

aRWSome Wishes

More than 400 children, including children-in-need and those 

from needy homes across six divisions from Tanjong Pagar 

GRC and Radin Mas SMC, celebrated an early Christmas 

at the annual aRWSome Wishes on 28 November 2019. 

Accompanied by over 100 aRWSome Volunteers for a day 

of fun at the largest-ever snowfall in the history of the 

theme park, and the biggest meet and greet with favourite 

characters during the launch of A Universal Christmas. RWS 

team members voluntarily pooled money from their own 

pockets to grant the wishes of these children by purchasing 

presents comprising attractive USS merchandise. 16 lucky 

children celebrating their birthdays in November joined Santa 

Claus on his sleigh to ride down the streets of New York.

Children for Children

Genting Singapore once again became one of the organisers 

for the 11th edition of Children for Children, the annual 

community outreach event for children from financially 

disadvantaged backgrounds. aRWSome Volunteers took 

more than 1,000 children to enjoy SEAA and The Maritime 

Experiential Museum as part of their Children’s Day 

celebrations. The charity event raised more than S$200,000 

for The Business Times Budding Artists Fund.

Empowering Youths, Transforming Lives

Some youths struggle with academic studies and life skills, and 

risk dropping out of the school system. Genting Singapore 

addresses this gap with a programme that imparts skills and 

transforms the lives of youths to be gainfully employed in the 

workforce.

aRWSome Apprenticeship

Genting Singapore took on 10 youths pursuing WSQ Higher 

Certificates in Culinary Arts and Pastry &amp; Baking at SHATEC 

under its aRWSome Apprenticeship programme. Former 

students of NorthLight School and Assumption Pathway 

School, they were assigned individual mentors, who are 

experienced RWS culinary team members, and received on-

the-job training across our celebrity chef restaurants and F&amp;B 

outlets for six months. Mentors also imparted life skills such 

as discipline, accountability and grooming, and offered socio-

emotional support to help them in character-building. Several 

youths were motivated to return to studies while others were 

considered for full-time employment at RWS.



Nurturing Diversity for an Inclusive Society

As Singapore grows into a more inclusive society for people 

with special needs, Genting Singapore wants to play a role to 

positively impact these individuals by integrating them into 

the community through sports and the arts.

Partnership with Pathlight School

Sesame Street, the internationally beloved iconic children’s 

series, commemorated its 50th anniversary with the Sesame 

Street 50 Years and Counting Celebration at USS.

Genting Singapore invited student artists from Pathlight 

School to join local and regional celebrities in painting and 

decorating the trash can of Oscar the Grouch. Team members 

adopted all 50 cans displayed across RWS and raised nearly 

S$24,000 towards Autism Resource Centre to help fund 

programmes for persons on the autism spectrum.



Major donor for St. Andrew’s Adult Home

Genting Singapore was one of the largest donors to St. 

Andrew’s Adult Home (Sengkang), Singapore’s first residential 

home for adults with moderate to severe autism. A total of 

S$1 million in cash was channelled, over three years through 

Community Chest, to the home. Receiving its first resident 

in April 2019, the residential facility adopts a cluster home 

concept instead of dormitory-style accommodations to better 

suit the sensory needs of its residents.

Inclusive Sports Festival

Genting Singapore participated in Sport Singapore’s Inclusive 

Sports Festival, from 1 to 4 August 2019 at Our Tampines 

Hub. SEAA is Singapore’s first and only accredited Disabled 

Divers International Centre offering diving programmes for 

those with disabilities. SEAA divers provided participants the 

opportunity to try out disabled diving in a safe and supervised 

environment, promoting inclusivity through sports.

RG accreditation

In November 2015, RWS became the first casino in Asia Pacific to receive RG Check accreditation from the Responsible Gambling 

Council. In December 2018, RWS once again successfully attained the RG Check accreditation and achieved the highest 

score amongst more than 150 worldwide venue accreditations and re-accreditations completed by the Responsible Gambling 

Council. To date, we have continued to maintain the highest score amongst all venue accreditations and reaccreditations.

This independent accreditation by the Responsible Gambling Council is affirmation of our commitment to effectively 

implementing player safeguards including the prevention of underage gambling and the prevention and reduction of problem 

gambling.

RG governance

We continue to engage local and foreign experts to provide specialised and experienced direction and advice on our responsible 

gambling initiatives. RWS’s Independent Advisory Panel (“IAP”) consists of experts in problem gambling and addiction 

prevention.

The panel of experts contributes insights, provides guidance and advises on new responsible gambling initiatives, such as RG 

Programme and RG training programmes.

goals include:

•

• 

A commitment to shared ownership and collective action on responsible gambling measures

was: ‘Are you playing smart?’

During the launch, RWS shared responsible gambling 

measures and practices with around 150 representatives from 

the gaming industry, including club operators, counselling 

practitioners, and related government agencies.









The RGAW also included roadshows that reached out to over 

700 people. 20 RWS RG Ambassadors engaged patrons in a 

series of interactive games.

Two experienced RG Ambassadors from RWS also took to 

the stage. They highlighted their ambassadorial roles and

First Gaming Operator to Contribute to the RGF Newsletter

In the 2018 RGF Newsletter, RWS was the first gaming operator to share their responsible gambling experience with the 

Singapore gaming industry. RWS has continued to share our knowledge and best practices on this platform including our 2019 

Newsletter contribution ‘Tips on Successful Adoption of Responsible Gambling Practices.’ The Newsletter was distributed to 

gambling operators and made available to the public on the National Council on Problem Gambling website. The fact that the 

MSF invited RWS to share our experience with the rest of the Singapore gaming industry evidenced our leading position in 

responsible gambling.

National Service (“NS”) is a critical function that ensures the safety and security of Singapore. We fully supports our 

operationally-ready NSmen in fulfilling their NS and reservist responsibilities. Our HR policies enable our NSmen to strengthen 

their commitment to serving the nation, by organising fitness events to encourage them to lead healthy lifestyles.

As representatives sitting on the Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence, we have also worked closely with 

stakeholders, businesses and members of the public to raise support and understanding on national defence matters. In 2019, 

we celebrated Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”) Day for the seventh year. Team members who are operationally-ready NSmen 

were encouraged to come to work on Monday, 1 July 2019 in their SAF uniform as a show of solidarity and pride. Other team

RWS 2.0: OUR NEXT STEPS

GOING BEYOND SUSTAINABILITY21

The RWS 2.0 Waterfront Development – part of our 

expansion and evolution – is a master plan to better 

integrate and improve our offerings as a resort. The final 

built form will resemble a mountain sitting partially on 

decking over water, a design that minimises ecological 

impact on marine life by reducing construction footprint 

into the water. The development will also include more 

sustainable modes of transport into RWS by better 

integrating 

multiple 

modes 

of 

Singapore’s 

public 

transportation, linking the interchange at Harbourfront 

MRT station with the new Driverless Transport System 

(DTS). Cyclists are also connected to the development, and 

there will be parking facilities for bicycles.

RWS 2.0 will be a green icon, featuring a rich variety 

of nature, flora and fauna. Lush and water-efficient 

landscaping will enhance biodiversity around the 

development, while providing visual relief to guests and 

visitors. Green roofs on the waterfront development 

and Forum extension as well as other extensive shading 

structures will reduce heat island effect and minimize 

thermal heat gain into the interior, enhancing indoor 

comfort. Additionally, passive cooling – recycling of 

the development’s cooling tower water usage to lower 

radiant temperatures – within the naturally ventilated 

forum further aids thermal comfort and also reduces 

electricity load.
