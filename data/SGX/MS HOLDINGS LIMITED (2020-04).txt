Dear Stakeholders,  

We are pleased to present our third sustainability report (“Report”) on behalf of the 

board of directors (“Board” or “Directors”) of MS Holdings Limited (“MS Holdings”, and 

together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”). 

This Report is for the financial year ended 30 April 2020 (“FY2020”). It is set out on a 

‘comply or explain’ basis in accordance with Rule 711B and Practice Notice 7F of the 

SGX-ST Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist. 

This Report aims to inform stakeholders of MS Holdings about our sustainability efforts 

in a transparent and accountable manner. It covers the Group’s strategies, policies, 

practices and performance in relation to economic, environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) issues.  

This Report draws on the internationally recognized framework, the Global Reporting 

Initiative’s (“GRI”) Sustainability Reporting Standards. 

The Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation, 

determined the material ESG factors and overseen the management and monitoring 

of these material ESG factors. 

We have identified 11 indicators that matter most to our business, and to both internal 

and external stakeholders. These material issues are accounted for through the 

following five sustainability strategies.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY

The Board is committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate 

governance to achieve greater transparency and to protect the interests of 

its shareholders. 

We continuously communicate the need to uphold integrity and the Group’s 

firm stance against corruption, as well as the importance of maintaining 

highest level of conduct and ethical standards. 

 



We believe in the creation of long-term economic value and consistent 

economic performance for the Group. 

The Group generates revenue primarily from the leasing of cranes and 

trading of new and used equipment.  

Total revenue for FY2020 decreased by 3.5% to S$14.0 million. This was largely 

due to decrease in the utilisation rate of our mobile cranes, which reflected 

the challenging market conditions faced by our customers. 

 

The Group supports global sustainability efforts in building a clean and 

green city for all to live, work and play in. 

We remain conscious of our energy and water footprints and look for ways 

to reduce them while balancing our needs.  

 







Our team comprises 81 employees as at 30 April 2020. 

The health &amp; safety of our employees is our priority and we 

ensure that our staff are well trained to operate equipment in 

work sites. 

Policies on health and safety are in place to protect all 

employees. In addition, with the outbreak of the coronavirus 

pandemic (“COVID-19”), we have stepped up our controls 

and implemented safe management measures at our 

workplace.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK 

The Group anticipates significant headwinds in the Group’s mobile crane rental 

business in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this challenging time, the Group’s 

focus is on supporting our customers, our employees, and the local businesses in which 

we operate in. 

The Group will continue to monitor the economy, review, and explore cost savings 

measures. We will also continue to seek business opportunities and focus on optimising 

the deployment of cranes by submitting more tenders to public sector construction 

projects or mega projects. 

We will continue to work hard to tide through the challenging market conditions. We 

appreciate having all our stakeholders join us on this journey to creating a more 

sustainable future.

Stakeholder Engagement 102-40 102-42 102-43 102-44 

Business decisions made by the Group consider the interests of our stakeholders who

Our stakeholders include employees; suppliers; customers; regulators; investors; and 

shareholders whom we have identified considering the economic, environmental, 

and social impacts of our business, across the supply chain. 

Due to COVID-19, the frequency of physical engagements with stakeholders have 

been reduced. Instead, the Group transitioned to online platforms such as Zoom and 

Microsoft Teams to engage stakeholders.  

 

Approach to Stakeholder Engagement

Reporting Principles 102-46 

We applied the GRI reporting principles – stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability 

context, materiality and completeness – in defining the report content by considering 

the Group’s activities, impact and substantive expectations and interests of our 

stakeholders. 

 

Materiality Review Process 102-46 102-47 

Performed in consultation with external consultants, the relevant topics and indicators 

that are covered in our Report were selected based on our review of the economic, 

environmental and social impacts which were most significant and based on our 

consideration of the topics that our stakeholders are most concerned with. 

The materiality assessment was subsequently endorsed by the Group’s Executive 

Sustainability Committee. 11 indicators from the GRI’s Sustainability Reporting 

Standards 2016, grouped into three main categories, were identified as relevant and 

material to the operations of MS Holdings.

Communication on Integrity and Anti-Corruption 

102-16 205-2  

The Board is committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance to 

ensure greater transparency and to protect the interests of its shareholders.  

The Group has put in place various policies and practices that will safeguard the 

interests of shareholders and enhance shareholders’ value as part of its effort to 

maintain high standards of corporate governance.  

We continuously communicate the need to uphold integrity and the Group’s firm 

stance against corruption, as well as the importance of maintaining the highest level 

of conduct and ethical standards, to all our employees. We have communicated 

such anti-corruption policies and procedures to all our employees.  

MS Group is fully committed to conduct our business with utmost integrity and with the 

highest ethical standards, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory 

requirements for the prevention of corruption, bribery and extortion.  

The Group has zero tolerance toward corruption and bribery. The Code of Conduct, 

which all employees are briefed on during their orientation, ensures that appropriate 

ethical conduct is applied.   

The Group’s whistle-blowing policy also includes corruption and bribery as one of the 

activities which constitute misconduct and is a reportable incident. The whistle-

blowing policy does not and cannot reasonably cover every situation. If employees 

are in doubt, they are strongly encouraged to seek guidance from the Head of 

Department or Human Resource Department. 

 

Whistle-blowing Policy 205-3 

The audit committee of the Company (“AC”) has put in place a whistle-blowing 

policy, whereby employees of the Group or any other persons may, in confidence, 

raise concerns about possible improprieties or other matters to the AC Chairman. 

The objective for such an arrangement is to ensure independent investigations of such 

matters and to allow for appropriate follow-up actions. Reports of suspected fraud, 

corruption, dishonest practices and other similar matters can be lodged with the AC 

Chairman, Mr Lim Kee Way Irwin.  

The policy is made available to all employees, and posted on the notice boards of 

both our offices.  

We are pleased to report that there were zero confirmed incident of corruption in 

FY2020. We aim to maintain this for the financial year ending 30 April 2021 (“FY2021”).

Intellectual capital is an asset that should not be overlooked. While new members of

employees who have been with us for many years provide valuable experience and 

knowledge.  

It is essential that our hiring practices are fair, merit-based, and non-discriminatory so 

that we can recruit people with the right knowledge and expertise to contribute to 

the growth of our business. More importantly, we need to build a conducive and 

harmonious working environment so that our employees continue to stay with us.  

Our employee demographic data is based on our employee records generated from 

our Human Resource system. 

Please refer to pages 16 to 18 of this Report for the full demographics of our

Occupational Health and Safety 403-2  

As the safety of our employees is our top priority, policies and procedures are 

established to protect our employees from accidents.  

 

Occupational Health &amp; Safety Initiatives 

The BizSAFE Star status for our subsidiary, Moh Seng Cranes Pte Ltd, was re-issued on 8 

October 2019 and we have managed to maintain this achievement since March 

2011.  Another subsidiary, MS Equipment Pte Ltd, attained a BizSAFE level 3 on 17 

August 2018. The above demonstrates the Group’s commitment to ensuring the 

highest standards of safety.  

The safety measures put in place to ensure the health and safety of our employees 

are summarised in Table 1 on page 21.  This includes formalised safety policies and 

procedures, performing risk evaluations, conducting regular safety trainings and 

enforcing stringent supervision to minimise threats to safety.  

 

Occurrences of Accidents 

MS Holdings abides by the Workplace Safety and Health (Incident Reporting) 

Regulations in the notification and reporting of work-related accidents which covers 

all employees of the organisation.  

In FY2020, there was 1 reported work-related incident where an employee 

experienced chest pain and difficulty in breathing while driving (FY2019: 1 minor 

accident). Other than the aforementioned incident, there was no other work-related 

accident.

Safety Management Measures (COVID-19) 

In view of COVID-19, our priority is the health and safety of our workforce. We have 

stepped up our controls and implemented safe management measures at our 

workplace to ensure our workforce is being well taken care of.  

We are working to avoid disruptions caused by COVID-19, while at the same time 

acting responsibly to do what we can to prevent further spread of the virus. Our 

management team meets regularly to monitor and discuss the latest updates and 

regulations from relevant government authorities.  

These are some of the measures we implemented to provide a safe working 

environment and minimise risks of further outbreaks within the workplace. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Safety Targets  

We have set a target to achieve zero work-related accident for FY2020. Except for the 

work-related incident mentioned above, we managed to meet the target set for 

FY2020 with no accidents occurring in FY2020.  

Threats to safety are inherent in the nature of the operational activities of our business 

and in the work sites which our employees are deployed to. We understand that 

accidents may happen due to unforeseen circumstances. 

The Group strives to achieve zero work-related accident in FY2021 through enforcing 

compliance of safety procedures and looking into additional measures to improve 

the safety of our employees.

In the mobile crane industry, it is necessary to continuously equip our employees with 

the knowledge and skills to perform work safely. This will minimise the risk of injuries and 

endangering the lives of themselves and their colleagues’.  

The trainings attended by our crane operators and supervisors focus on safety 

procedures due to the work environment in which they operate in has several 

potential safety hazards.  

One of the key risks relates to the unauthorised and unsupervised operation of cranes. 

Operators and supervisors are required to be properly licensed to be allowed to 

operate the vehicle. 

The Group uses the Crane Despatch Monitoring System (“CDMS”) to track all required 

training programmes for all crane operators and workers. CDMS will send an 

automated email notification a month prior to the expiry of the employees’ license or 

course requirements.  

The following trainings are compulsory for employees: 

• 

Workshop to Enhance Safety of Crane Operation (for all cranes operators); and 

• 

Construction Safety Orientation Course (for all mobile/lorry crane operators 

including workers). 

Training details during the reporting period are as follows:
