STATEMENT





The Board is pleased to present Delfi Limited’s inaugural 

Sustainability Report, which seeks to demonstrate 

Delfi’s commitment towards sustainability for all our 

stakeholders. At Delfi, we firmly believe that businesses 

play a key role in advancing global sustainable 

development. We are committed to championing 

our corporate social responsibility and sustainability 

mission, through which we seek to embrace the 

needs of the community we work with customers, 

care for the environment and act in the interests of 

our stakeholders.

The Board considers sustainability as part of its 

strategy and works closely with Management in 

determining the material environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) matters. It also plays a crucial 

role in overseeing the management and monitoring 

of the material ESG matters.

In complementing Delfi’s customary and regulatory 

financial and corporate governance disclosures in our 

Annual Report, our Sustainability Report focuses on the 

ESG aspects of Delfi’s organisational performance in 

accordance with the SGX Listing Rules 711A and 711B 

for Sustainability Reporting. Sustainability Reporting 

enables Delfi to strategically review our business in 

the context of our material sustainability impacts, 

alongside a phased disclosure of our performance with 

insights into the opportunities and challenges ahead.

INTRODUCTION

SUSTAINABILITY AT DELFI

[102-9] [102-12]

Sustainable development is “development that meets 

the needs of the present without compromising 

the ability of future generations to meet their own 

needs”.1 At Delfi, we believe in doing our part in 

contributing towards sustainable development. At 

the bedrock of our organisation, our roots anchor 

us in the sustainability domains of economic, 

environmental, social and governance. 

With the conviction of growing with our communities 

and the world, the overarching concept of sustainable 

value creation underpins all that we do. Akin to the 

cocoa tree, sustainable growth can be achieved 

when both our internal and external environment 

offers an optimal condition for us to thrive. With 

careful and tenacious management of our material 

sustainability matters, we are able to better assess 

our sustainability impact on our stakeholders 

– cultivating the positive and weeding out the 

negative. Our key stakeholders are the identified 

people and groups that can significantly affect 

or be significantly affected by our organisation. 

As we flourish, our influence and impact on our 

stakeholders widens as well. The challenge therein, 

is for us to consistently propagate the fruits of our 

labor through value creation, meeting their needs 

and expectations.

GOALS FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS

[102-40] [102-42] [102-43] [102-44]

At Delfi, passion for people has always been at the heart of what we do. Focusing our connections with all our stakeholders is vital for us to constantly 

bring delight and deliver value. Our conversations with our stakeholders allow us to understand their key concerns and respond effectively. Our 

sustainability approach draws upon these outcomes. We connect with our stakeholders through various modes of regular engagement including 

meetings, briefings, phone calls and other forms of correspondences.

Investors

We aim to promote investors’ 

understanding of Delfi’s strategy and 

performance through appropriate 

and accurate dissemination of corporate 

information. 

In the long-term, we seek to build trust-based 

relationships with our investors through our 

emphasis on governance structures and 

collaborative dialogue.

Local Communities

We respect the communities 

we operate in, and are keen to 

advance the interests of the company and the 

community in lockstep. 

As a good corporate citizen, we aim to achieve our 

goals through actively shaping and participating 

in community programs and initiatives.

Governments &amp; Regulators

We have the utmost respect for the 

rule of law, and continually extend 

our cooperation with governments 

and regulators. 

It is our priority to ensure compliance with the 

relevant laws and regulations in the jurisdictions 

that we do business.

Consumers

We are committed to going the 

extra mile to consistently provide 

our consumers – many of whom 

have been with us across generations – with a 

superior Delfi experience. 

We emphasize continuous product development 

and quality enhancement in our journey to meet 

the needs of our broad range of consumers.

Suppliers

As we view our suppliers as business 

partners, our objective is for mutual 

growth through fair and transparent 

dealings in compliance with relevant laws and 

regulations. 

We are also increasingly seeking out and working 

with suppliers that subscribe to our sustainability 

agenda.  We audit our original product manufacturers 

and key suppliers for sustainable value creation.

Trade &amp; Industry Associates

Our goal is to play an active role in 

the trade and industry associations of 

which we are members, to help further 

the interests of the group. 

We hope to lend our support and contribute to 

the various initiatives.

workplace where all our employees 

and workers are proud of – a 

true Delfi family.  

Our focus is on treating our employees and 

workers fairly, fostering close labour union 

relations and advocating excellence in occupational 

health and safety.

Customers

At Delfi, we see distributors, 

wholesalers and retailers as our 

customers as well as our partners 

in expanding our reach to our consumers, and 

ultimately driving sales for the company. 

Our goal is to create a fair and mutually 

beneficial arrangement, through clear and 

open communication lines on expectations.  

Non-profit Organisations

We seek to constructively engage 

non-profit organisations, align on 

common social causes and explore 

models for further partnership 

where feasible.

GOVERNANCE

OUR VALUES

[102-16]

Integrity, excellence and commitment are values that guide all of us at Delfi as 

we seek to enhance our organisation’s development, performance and growth. 

These core values are embedded within our concept of corporate governance 

and form an integral part of Delfi’s ethos, business, systems, processes and 

operations. Our mission is to delight customers and consumers with superior 

chocolate confectionery products and services. As an organisation, we are 

imbued with the following values:

Delfi’s Code of Conduct provides a framework for ethical decision making and 

good conduct for the Group. The Code contains important core values and 

principles of the Company’s professional conduct and governance. The Board 

of Directors, Management and all employees are dedicated to upholding the 

Code. 

Grievance Mechanisms for Ethics &amp; Integrity

[102-17]

Delfi maintains an Ethics Code, to which advice on matters of ethical concerns 

and grievances may be sought by our internal and external stakeholders. 

These matters will be handled objectively and subject to further investigation, 

disciplinary actions or legal process, where justified and necessary.

In addition, Delfi has a whistle blowing mechanism and policy that seeks 

to encourage reporting in good faith, of matters which may comprise 

misdemeanours, misconduct, fraud, corruption, illegal acts, etc. The 

mechanism and policy seeks to provide for reporting in confidence that 

stakeholders are treated fairly and shielded from any reprisal.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

[102-18] [102-23]

The Board of Delfi comprises a healthy well balanced mix of entrepreneurs, 

professionals and corporate expertise. Out of a total of 8 Directors, the Board 

comprises 3 executive Directors, 4 non-executive independent Directors and 

1 non-executive non-independent Director . There is a clear separation of 

the role of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman. 1 of our 3 executive 

Directors serves as CEO and Managing Director. The Board meets regularly 

and is provided with timely updates and information. As and when there 

are urgent commercial or other corporate matters, Board meetings are 

convened to seek guidance from the Board or to elicit a decision. All Directors 

are expected to act in good faith, and to act in the interests of Delfi. The 

Board is supported by the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the 

Remuneration Committee, the Nominating Committee, the Risk Management 

Committee and the Market Sustainability and Strategy Committee. These 

committees (with the exception of the Executive Committee) provide 

guidance and regularly review matters within their purview.

A full report on our corporate governance practices can be found in our 

Corporate Governance Report in our Annual Report 2017.

PROFILE OF OUR WORKFORCE

[102-7] [102-8]

As at 31 December 2017, we have a total of 3,822 

full-time employees in Singapore, Indonesia 

and the Philippines, of which 65% are hired on a 

permanent contract basis. People are at the heart 

of our organisation. We hire based on merit and 

are committed to upholding fair employment 

practices. Any form of discrimination has no 

place in our organisation and we believe strongly 

in providing our people with equal opportunities 

and benefits for them to reach their full potential. 

We are compliant to all relevant labour laws and 

regulations in the countries we operate. Due to 

the nature of the manufacturing industry, a large 

number of roles tend to be more physical, which 

explains the higher percentage of males within 

our workforce.

Significance Of Impact

Management Approach

Practices And Performance

Our workforce is the heart of our operations, and their health and 

safety is of key concern. We meet and strive to exceed the relevant 

occupational health and safety standards. 

In Indonesia’s factory site, our employees and workers are covered 

by an OHSAS 18001:2007 certified OHS Management System which 

is internally and externally audited on an annual basis.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

[103-1]

Human life matters greatly to us and a safety culture 

is deeply rooted in our organisation and everything 

we do. At Delfi, OHS is not only a legal and social 

obligation, but an essential part of our success. In 

building a conducive working environment, we are 

maximizing productivity and building a more active, 

motivated workforce. This minimizes business 

costs and unplanned disruptions, contributing to 

the overall profitability of our organisation. We 

recognize that good OHS management is critical 

in promoting our competitiveness as an employer 

and increasing our stakeholders’ confidence in us. 

It has a direct impact on our brand value and our 

reputation in the market.

[403-2]

As an employer, Delfi is responsible in ensuring that working conditions are conducive 

to the health, safety and well-being of our team members. Our internal and external 

audits enable us to identify violations and deficient areas for improvement. We constantly 

encourage our people to flag out any unsafe working conditions and practices across 

our operations. Comprehensive training and education programmes are conducted 

at facilities to increase awareness and set expectations of our safety culture. 

An array of specific projects and initiatives had been undertaken during the year 

to improve our management of OHS. For instance, we have further enhanced 

our Lock-out/Tag-out (“LOTO”) procedures to safeguard our people from the 

unexpected energization or start-up of machinery and equipment and hot surfaces. 

We have also implemented more rigorous workplace environment monitoring for 

conditions such as noise, lighting lux, temperature, etc. In the Philippines, we have 

acquired a new noise meter to conduct stringent evaluation of the noise level for 

new processes and equipment. Production and processing staff who are consistently 

exposed to loud noises are identified as individuals who are potentially at risk of 

hearing impairment. These individuals are medically examined through a hearing 

test to establish a baseline record.

In 2017, there were zero work-related fatalities and a total of 12 reportable work-

related injuries - 8 of which occurred in Indonesia and 4 in the Philippines. Main 

contributors include slip and fall, LOTO and work procedures. All cases were 

investigated and monitored closely with implementation of corrective and preventive 

measures, focusing on activity-based audits, enhancing the LOTO procedure and 

providing further Risk Assessment training. We continue to work closely with our 

people to reinforce our safety message and our standard operating procedures.

CASE STUDY: SAFETY MOMENTS

Since 2013, Safety Talk/ Safety Moments/ Safety Toolbox was introduced in all our operational meetings, including our daily 

production and maintenance meetings. At the start of these meetings, our managers and supervisors would spend at least 

15 minutes sharing on safety matters, with their colleagues/subordinates. This, in addition to safety trainings that we have 

embarked on, has great impact with improvements and reductions of incident rates over the past few years.

In this 15 minutes moment, we will share any safety related topic of any recent incidents that occur within the Group or any 

incident that occurred outside of the workplace. Employees are also encouraged to share their personal experiences of safety 

encounters at work or offsite. The objective of these moments is to create safety awareness in the work place amongst employees 

and their peers. Awareness, together with safety training, will further assist in reducing and minimising injuries effectively.

The food and beverage industry landscape continues 

to advance at a rapid pace. Fuelled by increasing 

stakeholder expectations, government regulations 

and innovation, the realities call for Delfi to sharpen its 

focus and awareness on consumer health and safety 

as a key sustainability matter as it directly impacts 

human lives. Consumers today are calling for greater 

transparency in disclosure of food safety programs 

and processes. A sizable group of consumers are 

now looking beyond the traditional concerns of food 

safety – the effects of food-borne contamination or 

immediate physical affliction. These individuals are 

increasingly mapping their buying decisions to potential 

long-term health and wellness impacts as well.

In 2017, the World Health Organization published that 

global obesity rates have almost tripled since four 

decades ago. More than 1.9 billion adults and 340 

million children and adolescents were overweight or 

obese.6 As an established chocolate and confectionery 

company, Delfi strongly believes in having the social 

responsibility to promote mindful consumption of our 

products – especially in our young consumers. On 

top of encouraging the act of eating in moderation, 

we continually allocate resources in food science 

research and product innovation to design a wider 

range of healthier treats for the world to enjoy.

Consumer health and safety, and mindful consumption are a priority for Delfi. 

We are proud of our Quality Management System that we have designed, 

developed, and implemented to ensure compliance with international and 

local food safety standards and recommendations.

Our policy on the quality of our products emphasizes the following:

• Consistency in quality

• Microbiologically safe

• No foreign materials and no contamination

• Hygienically packed and sealed

Our Quality Management System is certified in accordance with internationally 

recognized standards (e.g. FSSC 22000 Food Safety System Certification, 

BRC Global Standard for Food Safety) and are internally and externally 

audited on an annual basis.

6 World Health Organization, “Obesity and overweight fact sheet (2017)”



Stakeholders are able to file their feedback, concerns or grievances relating 

to health and safety through our general corporate relations channels. Our 

action plan is to investigate, address and resolve all confirmed cases as soon 

as practicable. All grievance proceedings and records are kept in confidence.

Delfi’s Quality Management System 

As part of our overall Quality Management System, we have made significant 

investments in our quality assurance systems in order to consistently achieve high 

manufacturing standards. The manufacturing standards which the Group follows 

include:

Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”)

GMP was established by the Food and Drug Administration in the USA in 1967 under 

the authority of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The GMP is based on 

international hygiene standards, and promotes a quality approach to manufacturing.  

GMP guidelines provide minimum requirements that a food product manufacturer 

must meet to assure that the products are of high quality and do not pose any risk to 

the consumer or public. The regulations are relatively general and allow the Group 

to decide individually how to best implement the necessary controls to achieve 

goals such as cleanliness, equipment verification and process validation. In doing 

this, the Group takes into account the specific needs of its consumers.

Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (“HACCP”)

HACCP was adopted by the Group as a comprehensive step-by-step food 

safety program for its production process. Assessments of hazards applicable to 

microbiological, chemical, physical, food safety and quality standard risks are made. 

Subsequent to such hazard assessment, the critical control points are determined 

within the production process to control identified hazards. Procedures for monitoring 

and taking corrective actions are established for each control point. Therefore any 

problem is traceable to the specific point in the production process and/or the 

specific raw material utilized.

The Group conducts process testing to ensure the quality and specifications of its 

products are consistent and meet the exacting standards of its consumers. Such 

in-process testing involves performing tests on samples of products to determine 

if there are any quality defects. In addition, the Group conducts microbiological 

tests on samples to ensure that its strict specifications regarding microbiological 

content are adhered to so that its products are always safe for human consumption.

Each delivery of products is given a unique lot identification code printed on the 

individual packing and accompanying documents which incorporates the date of 

manufacture. It can be used to trace the complete production history of the product 

starting from the source of raw materials. Any delivery breaching the Group’s quality 

standards can thus be identified and stopped before it is delivered to its customers 

and consumers subsequently.

FSSC 22000 Food Safety System Certification

FSSC 22000 provides a framework for effectively managing the Group’s food safety 

responsibilities. FSSC 22000 is fully recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiatives 

(GFSI) and is based on existing ISO Standards. It demonstrates that the Group has a 

robust Food Safety Management System in place. The FSSC 22000 system uses a 

management systems approach to food safety, using ISO 22000 for the management 

system requirement and ISO Technical Standards or Publicly Available Specifications 

(PAS) for prerequisite program requirements.

BRC Global Standard for Food Safety

First published in 1998, the Standard is now in its eighth issue and is well-

established globally. It has evolved with input from many leading global 

specifiers and is recognized by the GFSI. It was also the first Food Safety 

Standard to be benchmarked by the GFSI. It provides a framework to manage 

product safety, integrity, legality and quality, and the operational controls 

for these criteria in the food and food ingredient manufacturing, processing 

and packing industry.

High hygiene standards

Delfi observes high hygiene standards. Regular training and checks are conducted 

on our personnel at our facilities. These includes stringent requirements on attire, 

footwear and personal hygiene. 

Innovation and technology

We draw on innovation and technology to improve our food safety standards. For 

example, we have made significant strides in improving our packaging materials 

to strengthen protection against the external environment. We have also begun a 

phased roll-out of new X-ray machines to enhance our foreign material detection 

systems across our facilities.

Labelling and communication

The display and provision of information for our products is important to our 

consumers as well as subject to many regulations. To that end, we strive to provide 

transparent access to reliable and accurate information of our products through 

responsible labelling. Our labels advise on the expiry, recommended storage 

conditions, allergen declaration, ingredients, nutritional value, etc. We continuously 

seek to improve the contents of our product labels with greater emphasis on the 

sustainability impacts of our products.

In 2017, we have met our target of zero material incidents of non-compliance 

with applicable laws and regulations for consumer health and safety, and product 

information and labelling.



The BRC Global Standard focuses on:









• The importance of management commitment

• HACCP-based food safety programmes

• Quality management systems

• Auditing good manufacturing processes

• Auditing areas which often have the highest 

rate of product recalls and withdrawals, such 

as labelling and packing

• Developing systems to reduce exposure to 

food fraud

• Ensuring consistency of the audit process

• Promoting greater resilience, transparency and 

traceability in the supply chain

PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE

Delfi Limited’s Prescribed Standards, Requirements &amp; Practices for the 

Environment, Social &amp; Working Conditions (“Delfi Prescribed Standards”). 

Delfi recognizes that our business has an impact on people and the environment 

locally, globally and especially in the countries in which we operate and do business 

in. We believe that we are empowered to choose to act responsibly, with integrity 

and to do good while fulfilling our intent of being good business partners. Upholding 

this principle is a pre-condition to our future growth; a growth that will be achieved 

along with other like-minded responsible business partners and suppliers who share 

and identify with our vision, mission and approach to doing business.

In that vein, Delfi requires business partners and suppliers to acknowledge and 

agree to our Delfi Prescribed Standards, for the Environment, Social &amp; Working 

Conditions for the management of businesses, the purchase, and/or acquisition of 

products, materials and/or the delivery of services. Ultimately, it is the spirit of the 

Delfi Prescribed Standards that is important to us, and it is with this spirit that we 

consistently urge our business partners and suppliers to stand shoulder to shoulder 

with us in upholding the Delfi Prescribed Standards. 

The following table summarizes the elements covered in Delfi’s Prescribed Standards.

Sustainability Projects and Initiatives

Delfi believes in collaborating with businesses, communities, governments 

and non-governmental organisations (‘NGOs’) to tackle systemic sustainability 

concerns that may be prevalent in business including some sectors, like the 

chocolate industry and the cocoa ingredients industry, so that it is imperative 

that we do our part in helping to address these concerns and working against 

known ills such as child labour, forced labour, human rights violations, cruelty 

against animals, deforestation, and pollution, while we also focus on promoting 

good policies and practices in employment, health, safety and governance. 

In addition, our sustainability projects that we have implemented in the past, 

have helped some of our stakeholders increase the quality of the cocoa 

produced. Through these programs, we hope that we had contributed shared 

value through improvements to the livelihoods of farmers and their families, 

the cocoa communities and the environment. As our projects have either 

come to an end or are winding down, we are in search of and are working 

on identifying new opportunities.

CASE STUDY: PROCESSES ALLIANCE FOR COCOA 

TRACEABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY (PACTS) PROGRAM

PACTS was a tri-partite joint venture (JV) with the Cemoi Group and the 

Blommer Chocolate Company that sought to improve the livelihoods 

of the local cocoa farming community in the Ivory Coast and improve 

the supply of high quality fermented cocoa beans. At the heart of this 

JV is a balance of interests of the cocoa farming community and users 

of cocoa beans; and at a different level, the interests of the Cote D’lvoire 

and consumers of chocolate and cocoa. Formed in May 2010, the JV 

established up to 17 fermentation centres and worked with up to 50 

local co-operatives covering approximately 10,000 farmers over the 

three-years. The JV developed and implemented training and instruction 

programs to help farmers improve efficiencies and yields of their farms 

and therefore, enhance their incomes.

The Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) training conducted for the farmers 

at model farms and at the centres provided critical blended training 

specifically in the area of inputs, plantation management, nurseries, 

grafting and post-harvest process. At the 17 PACTS centres, controlled 

post-harvest processes contributed to improved quality of the cocoa 

beans supplied to PACTS shareholders.

Over the years PACTS helped farmers to rehabilitate their farms through 

grafting from clonal gardens established for this purpose and working 

together with CNRA (Ivorian National Centre for Plant Science Research). 

Grafting success overall averaged 68.8%.

This initiative ended in April 2017.



CASE STUDY: THE KOKODOLA PROJECT

In Nigeria, the Kokodola Project started in 2012 and was completed in 

2015. The Farmer Development Union (FADU) continued to work with the 

farmers on improvements to productivity and quality after the completion 

of the Project. The Project gave Delfi the opportunity and avenue to make 

sure that training of GAP, Good Environmental Practices (GEP), Good 

Social Practices (GSP), and Good Business Practices (GBP) was delivered 

to 8,917 farmers over the life of the Project. Overall performance of farmer 

knowledge after training yielded 78%. Enhanced knowledge in GAP was 

likely to assist farms in increasing productivity, yield and the quality of 

their cocoa beans. The farmers were also trained to maintain farming and 

harvest records which would help them in showing traceability of their 

cocoa beans crop, and this could potentially help them in getting a better 

price for their produce. . 

Clonal nurseries helped improve yields for the farmers in this program. 

Quality of cocoa beans from these farms were much improved compared to 

farms which produced conventional or ‘standard’ (non clonal) cocoa beans. 

The overall achievement of rehabilitated, regenerated and replanted areas 

over the program period was good. Farmers were generally more interested 

to buy seeds from trusted and assured sources, and the percentage of 

farmers obtaining planting materials from Kokodola / FADU increased to 

85% compared to 2014 when they used pods and seeds from their own 

farms. FADU continues to mentor and provide support to the Kokodola 

cocoa farmers and its communities. The program has helped improved 

productivity and knowledge for the farmers and the shareholders of the 

project has helped to create shared value through this program.

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

[103-1]

Waste and effluents management is critical for global 

sustainable development. Proper sanitation, clean 

water and air is important for human health. As part 

of the food processing sector, we understand the 

importance in managing and reducing the waste 

and effluents generated throughout our operations. 

For our communities to prosper and enjoy a high 

quality of life, we have to conscientiously monitor 

our discharges into the environment and seek to 

reduce our ecological impact. It is thus vital to 

prioritize waste disposal methods, such as reusing, 

recycling and recovery that minimize residual 

effects. Treatment of our effluents is also crucial in 

ensuring that hazardous substances do not leach 

into ecosystems and undergo bioamplification 

along the food chain. Managing waste also brings 

about potential cost-savings to our organisation. 

Looking into resource efficiency in our production 

will enable us to create more with less and deliver 

greater value to our stakeholders.

TREATMENT &amp; DISPOSAL  

OF WASTE &amp; EFFLUENTS

We believe in investing in good environmental housekeeping practices 

that will minimize our environmental footprint. Our waste and effluent 

management policies seek to fully comply with relevant laws and 

regulations.

We closely monitor our water discharges8 in both 

our manufacturing facilities in Indonesia and the 

Philippines. In 2017, a total volume of 32,107 m3 of 

water was discharged in Indonesia and the Philippines. 

In Indonesia, wastewater is removed from the 

organisation for treatment via a third-party agency. 

In the Philippines, wastewater is biologically treated 

at the facility before discharge into the Marikina 

City River. We utilize wastewater quality indicators 

to measure and ensure that these indicators are in 

generally acceptable ranges9 before any discharge 

into the natural environment.

Waste

[306-2]

At Delfi, we ensure that our wastes are safely 

disposed of in prevention of the risk of environmental 

contamination. All of our wastes are managed by 

authorized waste contractors, which is in line with 

regulatory requirements. These terms, hazardous 

and non-hazardous waste, are terms used in 

accordance with GRI Standards.

Hazardous waste typically relates to waste from our 

analytical laboratory (e.g. laboratory chemicals) and 

maintenance activities (e.g. transformer oil). Our 

hazardaous waste amounts to 0.7% of total waste 

from our Indonesia manufacturing operations, and 

in Philippines waste amounts to 0.3%.

Our hazardous waste is managed and disposed of 

in compliance with local regulations by authorised 

waste contractors.

Non-hazardous waste mainly relates to typical 

packaging and production waste comprising 

paper, plastic, metallic materials and etc. Our 

non-hazardous waste which makes up 99.3% of 

our total wastes in Indonesia were accounted for 

through recovery, landfill disposal and recycling 

methods. Whilst in Philippines, non-hazardous 

waste which makes up 99.7% of total waste,  

65% were recycled, 26% were accounted for 

through recovery and the remaining 9% were by

SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT

[103-1]

Delfi is a global organisation – Through our value 

chain, our resources, materials and products move 

across borders from country to country, on a 

daily basis. Any lapses or failures in compliance 

with import, export and trade regulations would 

directly impact our organisation and may lead to 

socioeconomic, civil or even criminal penalties. Non-

compliance could also cause significant business 

disruptions such as loss of business opportunities, 

custom clearance and shipment delays, container 

abandonment or government sequestration. Such 

disruptions would ripple across our organisation – 

affecting our production and delivery schedules, 

greatly impacting our stakeholders across the value 

chain and our brand reputation. On a financial level, 

these costs collectively would have a significant 

bearing on our financial bottom line.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

[103-2]

To ensure smooth cross-border operations, we continuously update 

and refine our compliance systems and processes to ensure compliance 

with the relevant laws in all jurisdictions in which we do business.

POLICY

We are committed towards full compliance with all applicable import, 

export and trade regulations in all the countries that we operate in.

In addition, we have the following Group-level target:

&amp; TARGETS

GRIEVANCE 

MECHANISM

Stakeholders are able to file their feedback, concerns or grievances 

relating to our import, export and trade activities through our general 

corporate relations channels. We seek to investigate, address and resolve 

all confirmed cases as soon as practicable. All grievance proceedings 

and records will be kept in confidence.
