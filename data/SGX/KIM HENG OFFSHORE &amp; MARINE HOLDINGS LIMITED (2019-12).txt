BOARD STATEMENT

The Board of Directors at Kim Heng Offshore and Marine Holdings (“Kim Heng” and together with its 

subsidiaries, “the Group”) is pleased to present our sustainability report of the Group for the financial 

period ended 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”). 

This is our third consecutive sustainability report, demonstrating our commitment to the sustainability 

reporting journey. Sustainability considerations continue to form part of our business strategy and the 

Board continues to monitor the management of material Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) 

factors across the Group.   

Sustainability reporting has encouraged us to understand the complex expectations of our stakeholders 

and has highlighted how these can impact our growth. Using these insights, we have been able to 

develop a strategic outlook focusing on a long-term perspective.

The Group has been able to benefit from cost reductions due to the identification and addressing of any 

potential areas of leakages, which is a result of the measuring and monitoring of our energy, water and 

waste levels. The Group also firmly believes that in order to achieve long-lasting success, we need to 

continue to emphasize the development and growth of our employees. 

With the current Covid-19 situation unfolding, our Group has worked tirelessly to implement our Business 

Continuity Plan, ensuring all our employees and communities stay safe, whilst undertaking our utmost 

efforts to retain all our personnel. This report is however based on information from FY2019, which was 

unaffected by the recent pandemic, and will therefore not include the Business Continuity Plan in this 

year’s sustainability report.

The Group will continue to engage with our stakeholders and work to improve our sustainability efforts, 

with the aim of building a more sustainable and resilient business. 

Through our sustainability and reporting efforts, the Group continues to advance our progress towards 

fulfilling our mission and vision, positioning ourselves as an organisation that makes a positive impact 

towards a sustainable global economy. 

ABOUT THIS REPORT

This sustainability report is structured on the data and information covering the financial period 1 January 

2019 – 31 December 2019. The Group undertakes the sustainability reporting process on an annual 

basis. 

The sustainability report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards: Core Option. The sustainability report aligns with the reporting requirements of Rules 711(A) 

and 711(B) of the Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading 

Limited (“SGX-ST”) (the “Catalist Rules”).

The information presented in this report has not undergone independent assurance. The Group may 

consider undertaking independent assurance in our future reports as our reporting processes mature.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

Materiality is a crucial step for most businesses to ensure that their strategy is targeted and relevant. Kim Heng considers our 

materiality to be a critical input into our corporate sustainability strategy, as it ensures that we engage our stakeholders with the 

information that is most relevant to them and our business. 

Our material topics were determined in the materiality assessment that was conducted in FY2017, when we undertook our 

reporting journey, which included interviews with internal stakeholders and a management workshop. The Group believes that 

these material topics are still relevant in the current year and have decided to continue reporting on these topics as there have 

been no significant changes to our business strategy and market environment. Further, through the continuation of reporting 

on these material topics, we are able to ensure consistency across our reports and narrate improvement across these topics. 

There are 6 material topics that have been strategized across the three pillars of sustainability; environmental, social and 

economic.

ENVIRONMENTAL

Environmental considerations are increasing rapidly both at the national and global level. Governments, organisations and 

stakeholders are realising the financial risks and opportunities associated with environmental management. The shipping 

industry can play a role towards a clean energy transition and Kim Heng is committed to be a part of this effort.

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

As with the majority of industry operations, the Group’s operations make use of energy primarily through electricity and marine 

gas oil. These are fossil fuel heavy sources of energy, making it an important area of consideration for our resource management. 

Another important consideration is water management. Ships and vessels make use of ballast water, which can be harmful to 

the environmental biodiversity of the waters, should it be disposed of irresponsibly. The final area of consideration in resource 

management is our waste generation, which occurs through the fabrication of offshore platforms as well as the building and 

repairing of vessels. All three areas of our resource consumption are impactful on the environment and hence require effective 

management. 

The industry in which we operate is subject to a number of environmental regulations regarding air pollution, ballast water 

discharge and waste. Our sustainability journey and our environmental footprint has enabled us to reframe these regulations 

from a ‘compliance exercise’ to an ‘opportunity to minimise waste and leakages in our business. Kim Heng believes in the 

benefits that sustainability efforts can have on the bottom line. 

Kim Heng operates with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) as well as the ISO 9001:2008 Quality 

Management System (QMS). We make use of these systems to apply a precautionary approach towards addressing and 

managing our environmental footprint.

We are proud to report that FY2019 had zero reported incidents of environmental non-compliance. The Group has maintained 

compliance with all environmental regulations and requirements.

The management approach and performance is addressed for each of our three resource management considerations 

separately.

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

The International Maritime Organisation has established regulations to provide a practical approach to management of 

operations and fleet efficiency performance, the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP).

In line with our efforts last year, we still maintain our International Energy Efficiency Certificate accreditation and our International 

Air Pollution Prevention Certificate accreditation. This demonstrates our alignment to MARPOL Annex VI regulations1, as well as 

our control of the nitrogen oxide emissions of our vessels.

The upcoming global sulphur cap that is planned for implementation industry-wide in 2020, has already been addressed by 

Kim Heng last year. We maintain our stance on using fuel that falls within the acceptable range of 0.37% to 0.5% sulphur levels. 

In FY2019, the Group expanded operations to include offshore wind energy services. These services facilitate the production of 

renewable energy, highlighting our commitment towards sustainability and innovation. 

Beyond our environmental efforts, Kim Heng is aiming to foster and develop a ‘green culture’ within all areas of our organisation 

and have continued the Group’s efforts in achieving an Eco-Office Labelling Certificate. 

PERFORMANCE

In continuation from last year’s report, the Group has included both electricity consumption of our shipyards and fuel 

consumption of our vessels. We have also included both scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions based on the consumption 

values.

The increase in electricity and fuel consumption levels, and subsequently the emissions levels, is due to the overall increase in 

business activity which is in line with the revenue increase for FY2019. 

WATER DISCHARGE AND CONSERVATION

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

The Group continues to abide by our established ballast water management plan, which requires all ships to have: 

i. a ballast water management plan

ii. a ballast water record book and 

iii. the International Ballast Water Management Certificate for all ships in operation. 

All our vessels continue to be in compliance with either the D1 standard (which specifies requirements for ships to exchange 

ballast water in open seas, away from coastal areas) or D2 standard (which requires ships to conform to the maximum amount 

of viable organisms allowed to be discharged, including specified indicator microbes harmful to human health) , depending on 

when they were built. Further, our vessels are accredited with the International Ballast Water Management Certificate. Beyond 

these regulations, our vessels are still in compliance with MARPOL Annex 1 regulation on prevention of oil pollution. They are 

accredited with the International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) certificate.

Our office and shipyard operations continue to make use of rainwater harvesting and reuse. 

This year, we have undertaken to measure and monitor water consumption and discharge with a higher degree of scrutiny, to 

identify areas of water waste reduction. We have implemented measures to record more usage data regarding our utility and 

vessel usage. 

PERFORMANCE

The Group expanded its water consumption data collection to include shipyards as well as 5 vessels. This is primarily the reason 

for the sharp increase in water consumption values, however an additional contributing factor is that the charterers of the 

vessels increased the water consumption due to their specific operational requirements. Similar to the increase in energy, the 

increase in water consumption values can be attributed to the overall increase in business activities and revenue. 

WASTE MANAGEMENT

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Kim Heng continues to comply with the MARPOL Annex V – Regulations for prevention of pollution by garbage and has strict 

waste management procedures and guidelines that have been developed with reference to local and international standards.

PERFORMANCE4 

As a result of the ongoing journey towards improved waste collection data, the Group has continued its enhancement of the 

data collection process to include data tracking of an additional vessel. Furthermore, the Group has also included the shipyards 

in the waste collection data for FY2019. This results in the reporting of 5 vessels and both shipyards in FY2019, as opposed to 4 

vessels in FY2018. This accounts for the fact that there is a significant increase in the waste disposal value this year. An additional 

contributing factor to the increase in waste disposal was the overall increase in vessel utilisation and charter. 

 As we continue to improve our waste collection process, we aim to continue to improve our reporting on waste collection.

SOCIAL

HEALTH AND SAFETY

One of our primary ambitions is to make Kim Heng shipyards and worksites, safe and healthy places to work. We recognise that 

due to the nature of some of our operations, the safety of our on-site crew and vessel workers can be at risk, but the Group is 

committed to ensuring that our staff are safe at work.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

The Group adheres to the best-in-class health &amp; safety standards to ensure that the necessary safety measures are implemented 

across the organization. Our stringent health, safety and environment (HSE) policy, outlining the key requirements for all 

employees, is in place and is implemented and monitored by key designated HSE personnel. These designated HSE personnel 

also monitor any HSE-related issues for the shipyards as well as the vessels. Their scope of operation also extends to the 

attainment of relevant certifications to ensure that the Group remains compliant. 

Similar to FY2018, our stringent risk mitigation measures are complemented with additional comprehensive risk assessments 

carried out by the HSE Risk Management Team, comprising Head of Shipyard, HSE Manager and HSE Committee members, on 

a regular basis, to ensure all areas of safety are in check. 

The Group recognises that in order to effectively prevent any failures in the safety of its workers, it is the responsibility of each 

and every person to follow the correct procedures. This ensures a safe working environmental for all. We continue to reiterate 

that it is each employee’s responsibility to halt any unsafe acts or behaviour should the working procedure be incorrect, or 

should they encounter unsafe equipment or working conditions.

We have also introduced Safety Observations, in which attention is drawn to special situations where safety is significantly 

improved as a result of safe acts or safe behaviours, improved equipment status or improved procedures, with an objective to 

inculcate safe work practices among employees. These Safety Observations have been included into our operations through 

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). This has allowed us to remain confident that we are actively reducing the risks of 

accidents, injuries or illnesses to our employees and the local community. 

As a result of our commitment to our employees’ health and safety within our organization and processes, we have been 

converted from OHSAS18001:2008 to ISO45001:2018, a new standard of Occupational Health and Safety Management 

System. Under the new standard, organisations will have to look beyond their own internal health and safety issues and consider 

what their interested stakeholders, including investors, peers and regulators, expect from them.

Additionally, we have maintained the following certifications: 

• BIZSAFE STAR  

• ISO14001:2015: Environmental Management System

• ISO 22:000 - ISPS and ISM - International Ship and Port Security (ISPS) and International Safety Management code (ISM) 

certified shipyard

• Our vessels carry medical supplies and equipment as per International Maritime Organization (IMO) and World Health 

Organization (WHO) conventions

During FY2019, the Group participated in a “Combined Fire Evacuation Drill” with the client’s vessel and also conducted a 

“Security Drill”, to enhance emergency preparedness.

• In October 2019, Kim Heng conducted a combined fire evacuation drill with the client’s vessel to ensure emergency 

procedures and systems are well functioning. All participants were familiarized with the procedures and their roles and 

responsibilities 

• In November 2019, a security drill was conducted as per ISPS requirement, to ensure participants are aware of response 

procedures and to validate the response procedures for handling such a case. The salient points learnt are to be incorporated 

into the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and Port Facility Security Plan (PFSP) as applicable.

The Group has further investigated each of these incidents, as well as non-recordable incidents to gain a holistic view of the 

overall health and safety of our operations. The accident summary and first aid analysis below demonstrate the extent to which 

these injuries occurred and assist us in identifying areas of potential risk and opportunities for improvement moving forward. 





FUTURE OUTLOOK AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

• Maintain zero workplace fatalities

• To lower incident frequency rate and severity rate for every year 

• Ensure every personnel being socially responsible towards the work environment 

HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT

The Group regards our employees as our greatest asset. It is because of them that we are able to achieve success and growth. It 

is important for us to maintain continuous employee development, provide competitive employee benefits and ensure fair and 

safe working conditions, so that we retain our staff and are positioned as an attractive organisation for new talent. 

FY2019 saw a significant increase in our total number of employees. This is primarily due to our expansion of operations into 

two new business units as well as the need for additional manpower on a large new project.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

FAIR EMPLOYMENT

Kim Heng continues our approach to providing diverse and equal opportunities to all our employees. Our policy on maintaining 

fairness and non-judgement regarding race, religion or nationality when assessing candidates continues to be paramount. The 

Group takes pride in assessing shortlisted candidates based solely on qualifications, relevant experience, skills and knowledge.

Our staff are encouraged to speak to their immediate superior should they have any grievances. Depending on the gravity of 

the grievance or issue raised, either the superior will resolve the issue, or escalated to HR or senior management as applicable 

and wherever necessary. 

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

The Group is aware of the importance of providing continuous learning and upskilling for our employees. This allows for the 

continuous advancement of skills amongst our workforce. Kim Heng provides targeted training for specific job scopes, for 

example, Construction Safety Orientation Course (CSOC) for crane operators, Shipyard Safety Instruction Course (SSIC) for 

shipyard workers, and Basic Offshore and Emergency Induction Training (BOISIET) for workers involved in offshore projects.

For FY2019, the Group decided to provide additional training to foreign workers to upskill them in specific areas of operation. 

The Group contributed a total of SGD $25,237 to training and development in FY2019.

The list below provides a comprehensive overview of all training provided and the number of attendees per training.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Kim Heng continues to comply with the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) mandatory requirements for employee benefits. In 

FY2019, we increased the salary of our foreign workers in order to maintain a competitive compensation package, which is 

within the industry market rates. 

PERFORMANCE

In FY2019, our new employee hires and our turnover rate is inclusive of onshore staff, as well as the crew from our Bridgewater 

vessels.

The total employee count includes 120 seafarers, who are employed on short-term employment contracts or rotate out every 

quarter. The high turnover rate was contributed by the increase in number of short-term employment contracts of the vessels 

crews who were employed on a short-term basis based on operational needs. 

FUTURE OUTLOOK AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Kim Heng has adopted the share option schemes including Kim Heng Employee Share Option Scheme (Kim Heng ESOS) and a 

performance share plan known as the Kim Heng Performance Share Plan (Kim Heng PSP). The aim of the Kim Heng ESOS and 

the Kim Heng PSP is to retain and reward employees in the future. Kim Heng is looking to utilize these within the next few years.

ECONOMIC 

ETHICS AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

We recognise that our industry is sensitive to the area of ethics and corruption. We understand that any breaches of ethics and 

corruption can lead to significant reputational damage, legal consequences and loss of customers. Additionally, it puts the trust 

that we have built between our business and our stakeholders at great risk.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

The Group’s approach to bribery and corruption continues to be zero tolerance. Through established policies, sound corporate 

governance and internal controls, we are able to strive for the utmost transparency and highest levels of corporate ethics. 

Our established anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) policy continues to provide guidance to management and staff on the 

measures for mitigating risks involving bribery and corruption. Further, the policy aims to address regulatory requirements and 

marketplace expectations accordingly.

The whistle-blowing policy, set out in the Corporate Governance section of the FY2019 Annual Report, provides Kim Heng staff 

with the ability to discreetly and without repercussion, raise concerns on any suspicious wrongdoings, including improprieties 

in matters of financial reporting, fraudulent acts and other matters within the Group.

This year all employees were briefed, trained and received communications on the ABC policy. We also included the ABC policy 

in a handbook as part of our induction process for new employees. The whistleblowing and ABC policy also underwent review 

by the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC). 

PERFORMANCE

There have been no cases of bribery and corruption reported or any whistle-blowing reports received in FY2019.  

FUTURE OUTLOOK AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

1. We will continue to provide training on anti-bribery and corruption to all new hires.

2. We will continue to provide all our employees with refresher courses on anti-bribery and whistle-blowing policy on an 

annual basis.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

The industry in which we operate is governed heavily by laws and regulations in the environmental, social and economic 

spheres of operation. Breaches of these laws and regulations can result in significant legal fines as well as reputational damage. 

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Kim Heng has an established management policy of compliance with social and environmental laws. All staff continue to be 

informed and briefed on this policy. Additionally, Kim Heng has a code of ethics that clearly defines our adherence to all legal 

standards regarding dealings in securities, contracts and any other provisions. Furthermore, we abide strictly to all governing 

laws and regulations, both domestic and international. 

PERFORMANCE

The Group received no monetary fines, non-monetary sanctions, or have any open cases on social and economic non-

compliance in FY2019.

FUTURE OUTLOOK AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

We aim to maintain zero cases of social and economic non-compliance in our operations.

FINANCIAL STABILITY

Through ensuring financial stability, the Group is able to continue operations to provide livelihoods for our staff and serve our 

stakeholders.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

While the approach of FY2018, of improving our cash flow and lowering our credit risk, is still valid, we have also included the 

expansion of our operational services to include sustainable avenues.  

PERFORMANCE

The Group’s financial performance improved in FY2019. The Group had successfully secured and completed various higher-

value and higher margin contracts across new verticals and geographies during the financial year.

Revenue grew by 53% year-on-year (y-o-y) to S$58.1 million in FY2019 from S$38.1 million in FY2018. Gross profit margin 

increased to 27% in FY2019 from 14% in FY2018. The improvement was contributed from the offshore rig services and supply 

chains segment for works related to fabricating of modules, afloat repairs, maintenance of vessels and rig activation, along with 

the increased vessel chartering activities with improved charter rates and higher vessel utilisation rate. 

The increase in gross profit margin in FY2019 was also due to an increase in contribution from the Group’s higher margin 

businesses from its Marine &amp; Offshore Support Services segment and vessels chartering activities. In addition, the Group had 

completed two Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) contracts during the FY2019 which was a testament to the Group’s 

growing capability and competency in the HDD space to support our venture into renewable energy services for shallow water 

subsea cable laying and wind farm projects in Asia.

In FY2019, cost of sales increased by S$9.8 million or 30% to S$42.5 million. This was due to higher sales volume, in-line with 

the higher revenue generated. Consequently, gross profit increased by 190% y-o-y to S$15.6 million in FY2019, up from S$5.4 

million in FY2018.

As of 31 December 2019, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents stood at S$3.1 million. The Group achieved a positive operating 

cash flow of S$4.9 million for FY2019 as compared to a negative operating cash flow of S$4.8 million in FY2018, due to improved 

operating performance and stringent credit control policy.

FUTURE OUTLOOK AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Moving forward, the Group intends to leverage its capabilities in the marine and offshore industry to expand into renewable 

energy sector, which is not directly impacted by the oil price. By venturing into the renewable wind energy sector, the Group 

can maximise its usage of its offshore assets and its technical knowledge.

The Group will also remain committed to the implementation of its cost cutting initiatives to effectively control costs, and to 

prudently identify strategic investment opportunities in the industry, while remaining prudent in managing its cash flow and 

cautious against overleveraging.
