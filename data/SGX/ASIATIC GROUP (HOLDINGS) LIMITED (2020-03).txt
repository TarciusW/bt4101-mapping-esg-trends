Board Statement 

 

 

 

The Board of Directors (“the Board”) is pleased to present Asiatic Group (Holdings) Limited’s (the  

“Company” and its subsidiaries, collectively known as “the Group” or “Asiatic”) third Sustainability Report. 

The Board considers Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters a priority and is committed to 

maintaining responsible business practices.  

This year the Board has reviewed material ESG matters, first identified in the financial year ended 31 March 

2018 (“FY2018”), and found that they continue to remain relevant to Asiatic’s business activities. We have 

adopted a phased disclosure of our sustainability performance which facilitates a strategic review of our 

material ESG impact and contributions each year - enabling us to track and strengthen our progress. 

The Board provides direction and works closely with management to oversee and guide all sustainability 

related matters. Since March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused severe disruption to the global 

economy. The full financial impact to the Group is unpredictable, however we are closely monitoring the 

situation for the safety of our employees and to ensure we take appropriate action. 

The following report summarises the Group’s performance in the financial year ended 31 March 2020 

(“FY2020”) demonstrating our dedication to the progress in our non-financial performance and deliver long-

term value for our stakeholders.

Our Business 

Figure 1. Asiatic’s geographical presence 

 

Since April 2003, when Asiatic Group (Holdings) Limited was formed and listed on the Catalist Board of 

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, Asiatic Group’s Energy business unit has played a pivotal role 

in the development of the energy sector in the Kingdom of Cambodia.  The Group is established as an 

independent power provider in the private sector energy market as well as to national grids, in the Kingdom of 

Cambodia. 

Apart from the energy business, Asiatic Group’s Fire Protection business was formed way back since 1965 and 

today is a reputable provider of firefighting and protection equipment and services in the industry.

Our People 

 

At Asiatic we believe the success of our operations is reliant on our people. For Asiatic to grow and prosper, we 

seek to build an inclusive and diverse working environment conducive to productivity and collaboration.  A key 

objective at Asiatic is to foster learning and development among our employees, which we believe is vital to the 

long-term growth of the Group. 

Figure 4. Asiatic’s Employee Profile 

 

In FY2020, our total workforce for both operations in Singapore and Cambodia totalled 191 as compared to 176 

at the end of FY2019. Our workforce in Singapore increased from 79 to 95 in FY2020, while our operations in 

Cambodia maintained their workforce, resulting in an overall increase in our workforce. The increase can be 

attributed primarily to an increase in the volume of our business in Singapore for FY2020. 

As of FY2020, 50% of our employees are based in Cambodia. Due to the nature of our business and as observed 

typically across industries in our sector, the Group has a higher proportion of male employees. In FY2020, 85% 

of our employees are male while 15% are female. 

 The Group is committed to ensure equal opportunities are offered to our employees based on merit, regardless 

of ethnicity, religion, age or gender. Our hiring processes strictly follow a no child labour and/or forced labour 

practice.

Our Sustainability Approach 

 

Sustainability Governance 

At Asiatic, the Board sets the tone and drives sustainability within the organisation. The Board is responsible 

for the approach and integration of sustainability principles, and the Executive Directors of both energy and fire 

protection business solutions are closely involved in the development and progress of sustainability policies 

and initiatives. Following the direction set by the Board and Executive Directors, the respective department 

heads oversee the day-to-day execution and adherence of sustainability policies and practices including 

tracking the Group’s performance against material matters.

Stakeholder Engagement 

Asiatic is committed to the long-term sustainability development of the business and recognises the value of 

engaging and remaining connected with our stakeholders. Our stakeholders are essential to the Group’s 

sustainability progress and we value all feedback and potential concerns raised. We strive to build open 

communication channels with our stakeholders and are cognisant of the increasing importance of 

sustainability to our stakeholders. Table 2 below summarises our approach towards stakeholder engagement.

Materiality Assessment 

In 2018, a materiality assessment workshop was conducted by an external consultant to identify and prioritise 

Asiatic’s material ESG matters. These matters are reviewed by the Board annually to ensure the relevance of 

the material ESG factors to the Group. The material sustainability matters were identified based on ESG 

matters that have the most significant impact on the Group’s operations and key stakeholders.  

Figure 6. Materiality assessment approach 

 

From our materiality assessment process in FY2018, we have identified three material ESG matters as reflected 

in Figure 7 below. As there are no major changes in our operations, the material matters identified were found to 

remain relevant for FY2020.  

Figure 7. Asiatic’s materiality matrix

Regulatory Compliance 

 

 

 

 

Our Approach 

Policies 

 

The Group’s corporate governance practices are informed by Asiatic’s corporate 

governance framework.  

 

The Quality Policy in our fire protection solutions business embodies our commitment 

to comply with relevant laws and regulations.  

 

Commitments 

and Target 

The Group has a perpetual target of zero confirmed cases of non-compliance with 

regulatory requirements and aims to conform with all relevant socio-economic and 

environmental regulations. 

 

 

Our corporate governance framework ensures we have in place the necessary processes for a high standard 

of corporate governance. The framework is overseen by the Board and various Board committees, and involves 

independent external auditors. A comprehensive set of internal controls and processes that are audited by a 

reputed external party are also part of the requirements of the framework. Annual audit review procedures 

include verification of compliance with all relevant legislation and regulations.  

The Group’s fire protection solution business follows the Quality Policy, developed as part of our ISO 19001:2015 

certified Quality Management System (”QMS”). Our QMS ensures we comply with all applicable statutory 

regulations and that our professional services are delivered to a high calibre. 

Our 

Perpetual 

Target 

To have  

zero 

confirmed cases of 

non-compliance 

Why is it important for us? 

We believe the core of a sustainable business is to have the right principles, 

policies and risk management practices governed by a strong corporate 

governance. As a Group, we stress the importance of complying with the laws 

and regulations of the countries we operate in, and believe that it is integral to 

our reputation and value to our stakeholders. 

Asiatic is committed to upholding the high standards of corporate governance 

and will continue to align its practices with the Code of Corporate Governance 

2018. 

1 occurrence of non-compliance 

in FY2020 

 


14 

 

Our whistle-blowing policy provides a direct channel for all internal and external stakeholders to raise in good 

faith concerns on any improprieties observed, including actions of non-compliance and misconduct in financial 

reporting. Complaints can be made in writing to asiatic@asiatic.com.sg, and all reports will be addressed in 

accordance to the whistle-blowing policy with assured confidence. Feedback is directed towards the audit 

committee who is charged with ensuring an independent, thorough and fair investigation is conducted. 

Employees are urged to follow all ethical and legal requirements to ensure the Group’s integrity and reputation 

are protected.   

Employees are promptly informed if there are any corporate policy changes, following the annual review by the 

Group’s management. In FY2020, a review by management on all operational risks pertaining to customers, 

suppliers, competitors, government agencies, and employees was conducted on 5th October 2019, for Asiatic 

Fire System Pte Ltd. The review of operational risks identified was overseen by the Director and resulted in 

action plans with segregated duties assigned.  

Our Performance 

As a testament to the strength of our corporate governance, the Group is pleased to share that there were no 

complaints received under our whistle-blowing channels in FY2020. 

Moreover, the results of both internal and external audits concluded on 27th September 2019 yielded that there 

were no non-conformities regarding operations, systems or management responsibilities for Asiatic Fire 

System Pte Ltd. All observations raised from the audit process were acted upon and closed as at end of FY2020. 

The Company acknowledged in our last Sustainability Report that we have not complied with the Companies 

Act to hold the annual general meeting for the financial year ended FY2019 by 31 August 2019. The non-

compliance occurred due to complexities of the valuation of the convertible bonds for Colben Energy Holdings 

(Maju Intan) and difficulties faced in the recruitment of a qualified personnel in our finance department. As a 

result of the non-compliance, the Group has paid a total of two fines on 18th October 2019, of S$400 under Section 

175 of the Companies Act, and S$200 under Section 201, of the Companies Act. We have successfully filled the 

vacancy in the finance department, and we are also in the process of selling our Maju Intan asset, thus 

preventing the non-compliance from re-occurring.

Workforce Health and Safety 

 

 

 

 

 

Our Approach 

Policy 

 

Our occupational health, safety and security policy aims to avert all work-related 

injuries and illnesses.  

 

The policy facilitates the identification of potential risks in our operations, thus 

enabling us to implement necessary work precautions, training and practices.  

Commitments 

and Target 

The Group has a perpetual target to achieve zero work-related incidents and illnesses 

at our workplace. 

 

 

We strive to provide a conducive working environment and operate with the belief “prevention over cure”. The 

health and safety procedures at our energy operations in Cambodia mirror this belief whereas in Singapore, 

our risk management process was developed with attention to the Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) Risk 

Management Regulation1 and WSH Code of Practice 2. The risk management process frames the roles and 

duties within the Group and provides reference on the identification of hazards, evaluation of risks, and 

implementation of mitigation measures to correct or control identified risks. As such, a risk management 

committee comprising both managerial and senior staff-level employees was formed to supervise the 

 

 

1 The Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulation is part of Singapore’s Workplace Safety and Health Act. 

2 The Code of Practice was developed and published by Workplace Safety and Health Council in collaboration with the Ministry of 

Manpower, Singapore. 

Our 

Perpetual 

Target 

To have  

zero 

work-related    

incidents and    

illnesses at our 

workplace 

Why is it important for us? 

To ensure a safe working environment, we believe it is our priority and 

responsibility as employers to create an environment where the health and safety 

of our employees is paramount. Given the current Covid-19 pandemic, Asiatic has 

in place stringent safety measures to ensure the well-being of our employees, 

sub-contractors and visitors.

application of risk management practices. The committee regularly conducts discussions and shares reports 

to senior management on any findings or development that need attention regarding workplace health and 

safety, as required during the year. Figure 8 below outlines the flow of Asiatic’s risk management process.  

Figure 8. Asiatic’s risk management process 

On a yearly basis, Asiatic undertakes an external audit to ensure that the Group meets all workplace health and 

safety outcomes satisfactorily. Any gaps identified during the audit are immediately addressed and actively 

monitored so that improvements can be made. Asiatic has also obtained several certificates demonstrating 

our commitment to facilitating a safe working environment for our people. Table 3 below lists the certificates 

obtained by Asiatic regarding health and safety.  

Table 3. Current health and safety certification

Certification 

Description 

ISO 9001:2015 

Quality Management 

System 

This certification specifies requirements for a quality management system wherein 

organisations must demonstrate the ability to consistently provide products and 

services that meet regulatory requirements and also aim to enhance customer 

satisfaction through effective application.  

BizSAFE level 3 

Risk Management 

This certification is a necessary step in adhering to requirements under the 

Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA), which outlines the risk assessments for 

every work activity and process carried out at their workplaces.  

 




17 

 

Our employees are encouraged to remain vigilant, proactive and approach health and safety at the workplace 

as a shared responsibility. We offer risk management-related trainings and certification courses to select 

employees every two years at minimum, and these employees are expected to share their knowledge and 

newly acquired skills to their colleagues with the objective of alleviating the frequency of work-related 

injuries. The Group targets to conduct fire drills and evacuation exercises on a regular basis to further prepare 

for emergency contingencies, and in FY2020 a fire drill was conducted on 21 December 2019. Our employees are 

expected to maintain caution as needed, report any incidents and diligently participate in all emergency 

preparedness activities. Employees, contractors and all relevant external parties are also expected to adhere 

to our safety management systems and quality standards which applies across all our premises.  

Covid-19 safety measures 

The Covid-19 pandemic has posed significant threats to both the health of our employees and growth of our 

business. Safety and business continuity are crucial, and Asiatic has implemented robust measures in line with 

all government mandated precautions to ensure the well-being of our employees and visitors.  

At our Singapore operations, Asiatic has implemented safe-entry registration using a government application 

for all personnel entering and exiting the office. Asiatic has enforced strict social distancing rules and requires 

that all employees wear a mask at all times at our premises. We provide two disposable masks to our 

employees on a daily basis to ensure compliance. We have further stepped up the cleaning of our premises by 

thoroughly disinfecting workstations and public areas between two to three times daily. Our common spaces 

such as pantry and photocopy areas have restrictions on the number of people allowed at one time. Asiatic also 

has a contingency plan in place for employees who are suspected of being infected with Covid-19. Our 

employees have been directed to work from home on default with staggered working hours for those who need 

to report to office. 

Figure 9. Covid-19 safety measures at Asiatic Fire System Pte Ltd  

  

Effective from March 2020, all our Cambodia plants and offices have followed similar precautionary measures 

such as donning on masks and temperature checks. Employees with high-temperatures are advised to contact 

Cambodia’s government hotline for Covid-19. Travels for work-related meetings have also been reduced, 

unless necessary. The same precautionary measures are enforced for our customers and suppliers visiting 

our offices in Cambodia.  

 






18 

 

Our Performance 

In FY2020 Asiatic Fire System Pte Ltd reported one injury from a male worker resulting from the employee 

slipping and falling down the stairs while delivering a fire extinguisher. To prevent such an incident from 

occurring again, we took measures to reinforce the emphasis on personal safety during daily meetings with 

our employees. The injury resulted in a total of 52 lost days of work by the end of FY2020 with an overall lost day 

rate (“LDR3”) of 243 and injury rate (“IR4”) of 5 for our Singapore operations.  

Our operations in Cambodia had 1 injury in FY2020, involving a male employee at the power plant as a result of 

an accident while conducting maintenance work on engines. The employee sustained an injury on his arm and 

took 1.5 days of leave of absence resulting in an overall IR of 4 and LDR of 6 for Cambodia. As a precautionary 

measure, management at Cambodia has taken initiatives to remind workers to ensure that they wear the 

necessary personal protection equipment during maintenance procedures.

The Group recorded zero work-related illnesses and fatalities in Singapore and Cambodia over the reporting 

period, an indicator we aim to maintain across our operations. Asiatic tracks the absentee rate 5  of our 

employees, to support as an indicator of the wellness and health of our employees.  The Group recorded an 

overall increase in the absentee rate in FY2020, as a result of an increase in medical leave taken by our 

employees in Singapore.

Energy Efficient Operations and Greenhouse 

Gas (“GHG”) Emissions 

 

Our Approach 

Policy 

 

We aim to ensure compliance with all necessary regulations and laws in the countries 

we operate in, to sustain good environmental practices and alleviate our carbon 

footprint where possible.  

 

Commitments 

and Target6 

The Group is committed to managing our environmental footprint whilst ensuring a 

stable supply of electricity to meet the needs of the communities we serve.  

Our target is to perform a thorough maintenance regime at least once a year to help 

maintain energy efficiency and carbon emissions intensity at our power plants. 

 

 

At Asiatic, we have a practice in place to conduct regular checks and maintenance procedures for our power 

plant equipment. Additionally, a thorough maintenance regime is performed once yearly for each engine in 

 

 

6 Our power plants in Cambodia are generally required to operate during periods of power outage or low power supply from the grid. As 

generation is on an on-demand basis and not continuous, this thus pose a limiting factor in setting a quantitative target to have 

substantial reduction in carbon intensity  

Our 

Perpetual 

Target 

To conduct a 

thorough 

maintenance 

regime at least once 

a year to help maintain 

energy efficiency and 

carbon emissions 

intensity at our power 

plants 

Why is it important for us? 

With climate-linked issues and challenges posing increasingly greater and 

severe threats, we seek to play an active role in mitigating the risks 

involved. Governments and investors alike are increasingly seeking urgent 

action on how businesses can take charge and contribute to the movement.  

We are conscious that our energy business in Cambodia uses fossil fuels, 

and therefore acknowledge our part and the challenges set out in 

alleviating climate change. Considering our energy operations have a 

relatively larger contribution compared to the emissions from our 

Singapore operations, we have focused this section on our power plants in 

Cambodia. Asiatic will review and consider expanding our scope for this 

material matter as we mature. 

 

Achieved in FY2020

ensuring they are in optimal operating conditions to function on-demand. Any irregularities are identified at 

this stage, enabling teams to correct any non-conformities up to regulatory quality standards. This process 

enables us to ensure safe operations at our power plants and effectively manage energy consumption levels.  

 

Our Performance 

In FY2020 our carbon emissions increased marginally from 0.80 tCO2/MWh to 0.84 tCO2/MWh, thus increasing 

by 4%. The increase can be attributed to increased generation in all three plants in Cambodia. 

Over the reporting period, Asiatic consumed a total of 515,117 gigajoules (“GJ”) from heavy fuel oil for power 

generation and 3,628GJ of energy from purchased electricity. Total electricity generated by our power plants 

was 51.00 Gigawatt-hour (“GWh”), of which approximately 48.04 Gigawatt-hour (“GWh”) of electricity sold to 

our customers.  

Our total scope 17  and scope 2 carbon emissions in FY2020 is 39,870 metric tons of carbon dioxide (“tCO2”) and 

236 tCO2 respectively. 

The Group is pleased to share that our target of conducting a maintenance regime for all engines in our power 

plants was achieved in FY2020. It is our endeavour to review and improve upon our practices each year to 

manage our energy consumption and GHG emissions levels in a sustainable manner.

7 Carbon emissions and carbon intensity are calculated with reference to 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. 

8 FY2019 GHG emissions intensity was restated from 0.82 to 0.80 tCO2/MWh due to updates to emissions factors used in computations. 

The difference in the restated value for FY2019 emissions is immaterial.
