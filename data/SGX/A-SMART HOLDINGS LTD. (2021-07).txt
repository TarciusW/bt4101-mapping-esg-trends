UPDATES ON PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT  

BUSINESS SEGMENT

The Group acquired controlling stakes in two newly incorporated property development companies in Timor-

Leste, namely Timor Marina Square S.A. and Timor City Square S.A. The Group holds a 69% and 60% stake 

in Timor Marina Square S.A. and in Timor City Square S.A. respectively. Both the property development 

projects have yet to commence operations. Thus, this Sustainability Report does not include this business 

segment into consideration.  

Timor Marina Square

Dili, Timor-Leste

The Group’s maiden property development project, Timor Marina Square, comprises an area of 3,204 square 

meters freehold land. It is currently in progress in Dili, the capital city of Timor-Leste. It is situated along the 

seafront coastal line of Lecidere in Dili and in close proximity to prominent institutions such as the headquarters 

of the World Bank, foreign embassies and the Timor government offices. Upon completion, it will be comprised 

of two buildings, one of which is 23-storey luxury residential apartments while the other will be a 19-storey 

tower comprising retail, office, serviced apartments and luxurious residential apartments, will be an awed 

landmark primed to target investors from China and South-East Asian countries including Singapore.

Construction commencement plans continue to be delayed due to the Covid19 travel restrictions for all 

incoming visitors into Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste has, however, already reopened its borders therefore the 

Group is expected to commence its construction activities in the near term. 

Given that the Group has obtained the building plan permit from the Timor-Leste authorities, the Group is 

thus planning to hold a ground-breaking ceremony for Timor Marina Square in early 2022, followed by a 

pre-sales event. 

Significantly, the Group’s 69% held subsidiary, Timor Marina Square has been awarded a certificate of 

Declaration of Benefits from the government of Timor-Leste. This certification represents the highest 

recognition from the Timor-Leste government to foreign investors aimed to encourage investment activities, 

create employment and introduced new experiences, skills and technology while diversifying the economy. 

With the certification, the Group is entitled to enjoy up to 100% income tax and custom duties on capital goods 

and equipment exemption for 5 years. 

Timor City Square

Dili, Timor-Leste

Timor City Square S.A. holds the rights to a 99-year leasehold land comprising a total area of 5,310 square 

meters which is strategically located adjacent to the bustling Central Business District and next to the 

automobile centre in Dili’s city centre. Timor City Square S.A. is contractually committed to develop a high-

rise mixed property within nine years from 2019. The Group plans to time its development plans to favourable 

market conditions, and has received in-principal approval from the authorities to build low rise shops for 

short-term leasing in the interim. However, the property development project has encountered a slight delay 

in construction because of lockdowns and travel restrictions into Timor-Leste arising from the outbreak of the 

pandemic. Construction work is expected to resume once the Covid19 related measures are relaxed.

A-SMART HOLDINGS LTD. | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


Dear Stakeholders, 

On behalf of the Group, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present stakeholders with the Group’s 

fourth sustainability report for the financial year ended 31 July 2021. The contents of the Report are aligned 

with SGX-ST Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability Reporting Guide, and serves to assess the Group’s sustainability 

strategies and performance. Our commitment is reflected in our sustainable business strategy and the material 

Sustainability Factors which are shown in this Report.

The Board takes sustainability issues very seriously and ensures that sustainability is practised at all levels of 

the company. The Group believes that the continued success of the Group depends on how we strike a balance 

between achieving growth and profits as well as governance, protecting the environment and the development 

of our people. 

The Group has reviewed the ESG topics considered in the previous sustainability report and concluded that 

the material topics remain imperative and relevant in FY2021. These material topics have been prioritised 

by the Group in view of their significance of economic, environmental and social impacts as well as their 

influence on our stakeholders’ assessment and decisions, which will be reflected in our ESG factors in this 

report. The material ESG factors are determined based on the GRI framework. The GRI framework is an 

industry standard, and serves as a guide for the Board in the monitoring and the report of the Company’s 

performance on ESG factors. 

We have been working closely with our stakeholders, understanding their concerns as their inputs drive our 

sustainability strategy. The Group remains committed to the well-being of our employees, the environment and 

the communities we operate in. Going forward, we will continue to monitor and review our ESG factors from 

time to time, by actively engaging our key stakeholders and taking into consideration of their comments and 

feedbacks, employee involvement, and industrial group standards.

STAKEHOLDER 

ENGAGEMENT

We recognise that suggestions and concerns of our stakeholders are effective in determining areas of 

sustainable development possibly relevant to the Group in the long term. Unlike previous years, Covid-19 

has been one of the key concerns of all stakeholders in 2021 and the Group did our best to provide support 

to all stakeholder groups in navigating through the pandemic. We have included the following goals in our 

stakeholder engagement activities:

• Understand stakeholders’ priorities and values in sustainable development;

• Align our goals and values with that of the stakeholder group; and

• Continuous improvement on ESG matters that our activities have an impact on.

We have identified the Group’s customers, employees, regulators, industry associations, shareholders, 

investors, media and suppliers as our key stakeholders. We prioritised those stakeholders who demonstrate 

extensive track record in best practices and those that have significant impact on the Group’s businesses 

(i.e. revenue contribution and availability of published information such as supplier code of conduct). Besides 

conducting research on our stakeholders’ sustainability objectives, we also maintain close relations and active 

engagement with them through the following ways:

ECONOMIC

ANTI-CORRUPTION

The Group commits itself to being an ethical and responsible business and takes zero-tolerance ap-

proach for corruptions, frauds and other behaviours violating work ethics. Unethical or illegal events 

such as corruption, bribery, and collusion are strictly prohibited. The disciplinary code and code of 

conduct is stipulated in the Employee Handbook and is communicated to all employees to ensure a 

shared understanding of its ethics. Employees are encouraged to make a report if they suspect any 

misconduct cases.

These policies are also shared with our clients, business partners and suppliers to ensure that the 

working parties that we are working with are in compliance with relevant laws and regulations. The 

composition of employees and details of business partners that the Group’s anti-corruption policies 

and procedures have been communicated to are as follows:

For FY2021, the Group has met the target set in FY2020 and there were zero corruption incidents. The 

Group has a target of zero incidents perpetually. 

WHISTLE-BLOWING POLICY

The Audit Committee (“AC”) has in place a whistle-blowing policy and arrangements where we main-

tain anonymous channels for any employee to communicate concerns or complaints to the Chairman 

of the AC, whom is well known by many employees and easily accessible without fear of negative 

consequences. Whistle-blowers are able to raise concerns on financial improprieties or other mat-

ters raised, which will be investigated and appropriate follow-up actions will be taken. 

These complaints will be brought to the attention of the AC immediately. Assessment, investigation 

and evaluation of complaints are conducted by or at the direction of the AC. Whenever necessary or 

appropriate, independent advisors will be engaged at the Group’s expense. AC will conduct an in-

vestigation and evaluation of a complaint, then will decide on recommended disciplinary or remedial 

action, if any before bringing to the Board or to an appropriate senior executive staff for authorisation 

and implementation.

Reports relating to serious offences and criminal activities in the Group received by AC will be 

highlighted to the Board during Board meetings. The AC and the Board have access to the appro-

priate external advices, where necessary. Where appropriate or required, a report will be made to 

the relevant government authorities for further investigation or action. The AC is updated annually 

or from time to time on any changes to the accounting and financial reporting standards by the 

external auditors. No former partner or director of the Group’s existing auditing firm has acted as 

a member of the AC.

A-SMART HOLDINGS LTD. | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


ENVIRONMENTAL  

Protecting the environment and ensuring the Group’s business activities do not have significant negative impact 

on the environment have been top of the Group’s mind. Thus, we have implemented control activities and 

monitoring measures in our business activities and workplace. We adopt environmentally friendly business 

practices which is in line with our objective to promote a green environment. We have been educating our 

employees to enhance their awareness on environmental protection and adhering to the relevant environmental 

laws and regulations for all our operational business units. 

As part of the Group’s vision to become a one-stop smart technology solutions provider for the F&amp;B and 

retail industry in Singapore, the Group has developed a food waste digester system utilising advanced green 

technology for food waste composting and recycling which is aligned with Singapore's initiatives of waste 

minimisation and recycling, or the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). It is part of the NEA's strategies in promoting 

waste minimization and recycling practices in Singapore.

In line with Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan, this system is designed to be deployed in locations that typically 

generate high amounts of food waste, to reduce the food waste significantly using environmentally friendly 

and sustainable methods. Following years of R&amp;D, our digester systems has met all the rigorous criteria 

set by the local authorities and is now one of the few NEA-approved vendors for comprehensive food waste 

digester systems and this gives further affirmation towards the quality of our products. During the second half 

of FY2021, the Group has not only launched its own series of food waste digester systems but also experienced 

a positive sales outlook for them.

The Group’s initial focus on market penetration has also paid early dividends as it managed to secure several 

successful tenders. Moving forward, the Group will continue to participate in all available tender exercises, 

while simultaneously expanding our existing client base. Coupled with the Zero Waste initiative of the Singapore 

government, the Group continues to maintain a healthy pipeline in sales enquiry and feedback. The Group is 

currently in discussion with several building owners and food hub operators to provide customized food waste 

management solutions to each establishment according to their specific needs. The Group has also reached 

out to other industries such as shopping malls, clubs and even places of worship to facilitate their transition to 

a greener future with our food waste management system.

During FY2021, the Group has not identified any material non-compliance with environmental laws and 

regulations, including but not limited to “Environmental Protection and Management Act” and “Environmental 

Public Health Act” in Singapore. 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION

The Group relies on electricity to run our daily operations. Thus, electricity consumption accounts for 

a substantial part of the energy usage of the Group business operations. As such, the Group regularly 

monitors our electricity consumption to ensure that the use of resources in all of its business is optimised. 

We also encourage our employees to adopt energy conservation initiatives in the office such as switching 

off unnecessary lighting, idling equipment or computers when not in use or after working hours, adopting 

power-saving features for office equipment and computers and procuring energy efficient appliances only 

upon replacement of old appliances or due to new business needs. 

The Group is committed to responsible usage of energy resources which produce lesser carbon emissions and 

strives to be the forefront of the industry in incorporating environmental protection measures into business 

operations and supports renewable energy investments. During FY2021, 20% of total power consumption is 

clean energy generated from solar systems by Sunseap Energy.

ENVIRONMENTAL

10

A-SMART HOLDINGS LTD. | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


During FY2021, the electricity consumption of the Group was approximately 441,996 kWh and its intensity was 

approximately 75,042 kWh  per S$ million revenue. The decrease in energy consumption rate could be largely 

due to the closure of the stores during the circuit breaker period. We target to maintain or reduce the electricity 

consumption intensity in FY20222. 

The detailed summary of the electricity consumption of the Group is as follows:

Note: 

1.  The total revenue of the Group during FY2021 is S$5.89 million. This number would also be used for calculating other intensity data in 

this Report.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

Proper disposal and treatment of waste generated from our business operation is of great importance to the 

Group and the communities as we operate a printing business which requires huge amounts of ink chemicals 

for our print products. Thus, we are committed to disposing waste chemicals responsibly and ensure that our 

business would not cause negative impacts the communities where we operate in. 

In order to minimise the risk of any chemical leaks, a dedicated team of experienced handlers has been tasked 

to store chemicals in designated safe areas. These safe areas are constantly under surveillance and accessible 

only by authorised personnel. The Group has obtained the Petroleum and Flammable Materials Storage Licence 

from Singapore Civil Defence Force for storing the chemicals in the designated areas. The Group views waste 

management seriously and is fully aware of the negative impacts on the environment that could arise from 

inappropriate handling and disposal of chemical waste. As such, the Group only engages NEA licensed waste 

management company to handle the disposal of chemical waste.

In addition, a set of clear guidelines on how to appropriately respond to accidents or hazardous events resulting 

from chemical spills or fire has been communicated to the employees as part of the Emergency Response Plan. 

GREENHOUSE GAS (“GHG”) EMISSIONS

Electricity consumption in the office is the Group’s largest source of indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2). The 

Group has rolled out measures and initiatives to ensure efficient use of electricity among the employees to 

cut down the carbon footprint produced by our business operations which are listed in the section “Energy 

Consumption”. During FY2021, the total GHG emissions of the Group was approximately 144.27 tCO2e and 

its intensity was approximately 24.49 tCO2e per S$ million revenue. We target to maintain or reduce the GHG 

emissions intensity in FY2022.

Fifth Assessment Report, 2014 (AR5).

  

WATER CONSUMPTION

Water resource is extremely scarce in Singapore and vital to the communities. In line with Singapore’s national 

water conservation drive, we strive to reduce water wastage in our business and also encourage our employees 

to cultivate water-saving habits in the office. Employees are encouraged to turn off the tap when it is not in 

use and report leaking faucet or pipe to the relevant authority. The Group’s only source of water is from a 

municipal water supplier. During FY2021, the water consumption of the Group was approximately 209.7 m3 and 

its intensity was approximately 35.60 m3 per S$ million revenue. The Group did not recycle or reuse any water.

RAW MATERIAL

Paper is the main raw material of the Group which is used across all business operations and accounts for a 

substantial portion of the Group’s inputs. The Group strives to ensure proper management of paper use in the 

business to conserve the environment and promote environmental sustainability. 

Reducing paper consumption and paper waste will mitigate the impacts of climate change by lowering the 

greenhouse gas emissions generated by processing pulp into paper. Thus, our sales team works very closely 

with our customers to ensure that their requirements are correctly interpreted. Thereafter, our production 

team will ensure that the design of print jobs enables optimal paper usage. Subjected to requests of our 

customers, we might also use recycled paper for printing. Efficient cutting, binding techniques and printing 

colour control are one of the important initiatives to reduce paper waste. We have trained our employees to 

carry out the above work professionally. Unusable waste paper will be treated as non-Forest Stewardship 

Council (“FSCTM”) and sold to scrap dealers for recycling. 

Besides that, our paper is purchased only from responsible certified suppliers, including those with FSCTM 

and PEFC certification, who have obtained paper supplies through sustainable forest management solutions.

A-SMART HOLDINGS LTD. | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


SOCIOECONOMIC COMPLIANCE

Socioeconomic compliance is one of the key factors for the Group to obtain its social license to operate. 

With the goal of preventing potential infringement of related laws and regulations in mind, the management 

team regularly reviews business activities, puts in place clear policies and procedures. Employees are also 

encouraged to report any suspicion of violation of laws and regulations. During FY2021, there were zero 

incidents of non-compliance with relevant material socio-economic laws and regulations. We aim to keep the 

target at zero incidents perpetually.  

RECRUITMENT AND DISMISSAL

We place great emphasis on the competency development and well-being of our employees as we believe 

that well trained employees are vital to the long-term success of our business. As such, we are committed 

to provide a safe and conducive working environment for our employees. We encourage communication, 

innovation, continuous learning and foster employee engagement. 

We believe that we have the responsibility to create personalized, elevated opportunities that engage workers 

and unleash their full potential. Thus, we have established relevant policies to fulfil our vision on people-

oriented management. The human resources management procedures are formally documented in the 

Employee Handbook, covering employment contract, promotion, performance evaluation, transfer, training, 

working hours, welfare and remuneration. During FY2021, there were no instances where a significant portion 

of the organization’s activities were performed by workers who are not employees.

A-SMART HOLDINGS LTD. | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


The termination of any recruitment contract will be based on reasonable, lawful grounds and internal policies 

that are stated in the Employee Handbook. Any unfair or illegitimate dismissals are strictly prohibited in the 

Group. Verbal warnings will be given to employees with poor working performance, letting the employee to 

know that their conduct of performance is not satisfactory and that there is a possibility of dismissal before 

issuing a warning letter. If their conduct of poor performance is repeated, the Group would then dismiss its 

employee according to relevant laws.

REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

We believe that our employees play an imperative role in the success of our business. To recognise our 

employees’ efforts in growing the business of the Group, we remunerate and reward them at a competitive 

level based on personal performance. Diverse types of leaves and insurance are included in the employees’ 

remuneration package, all of which have been listed in the Employee Handbook in details. For instance, leave 

types include but not limited to medical and hospitalization leave, marriage leave, national service (“NS”) leave, 

compassionate leave, maternity and paternity leave. The Group has in place an E-Leave System, enabling 

employees to apply for leave through the online portal and check their leave balances. 

Besides remuneration, the Group also provides healthcare benefits which includes outpatient medical and 

dental care, life insurance, the Group Travel Insurance Policy and an Insurance Scheme covering maternity 

expenses, hospitalization and surgical expenses. Other benefits and protection for our full-time employees 

include the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”), allowance for overseas business trips, reimbursement claims, and 

the Long Service Awards given to employees with at least 5 years of service.

With the intention to provide our employees and directors of the Group an opportunity to participate in the 

equity of the Group, the Group adopted the A-Smart Employee Share Option Scheme 2018 (“A-Smart ESOS”) to 

drive motivation among the employees. The ESOS is ultimately aimed to ensure greater dedication, loyalty and 

higher standards of performance from our employees, and to reward those who have contributed significantly 

to the growth and performance of the Group.

At the end of FY2021, an accumulative total of 1,658,000 share options had been granted, of which 1,542,000 

share options remained unexercised and 116,000 share options had lapsed due to staff resignations.  In FY2021, 

8 employees were granted a total of 26.5 days of child care leave.

DIVERSITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION

We practise transparency and equal treatment in the recruitment process, remuneration, promotion prospects 

and benefits. Performance targets are mutually set and agreed with employees and desired behaviour aligned 

to the Group’s values are shared with the employees. We are committed to the principles of equality and non-

discrimination and respecting labour rights. We believe that equality in the workplace will boost the confidence 

prospective employees have in us and attract talents, inculcating a sense of inclusiveness. Thus, all employees 

are given equal and fair opportunities for growth and development based on objective assessment, regardless 

of gender, race, marital status, disability, age or family status.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

Employees are valuable assets of our organisation and their safety is our utmost priority. Therefore, it is 

crucial for the company to provide a safe environment and ensure safe behavior is practised. Occupational 

Health and Safety measures are in place to ensure the well-being of our staff while providing assurance to 

our customers. Trainings are conducted regularly and safety procedures are communicated to employees to 

improve occupational health and safety awareness of the employees, in order to prevent workplace injuries 

and illnesses.

The Group has obtained the level 3 certification of bizSAFE, a capability building programme designed to help 

companies build workplace safety and health capabilities, from the Ministry of Manpower. We developed the 

Occupational Health and Safety and Security Policy, adhered to by our employees and monitored by managers 

and supervisors, to prevent occupational injuries and illness as well. The Group aims to achieve the following: 

•	

Identifying and reducing the risks of all types of work activities that have the potential to produce 

personal injuries; and

• 

Providing instructions, training and supervision to improve individual’s understanding of workplace 

hazards, including safe work practices and emergency procedures; and

• 

Involving individuals in occupational health and safety matters and consulting with them on ways to 

recognise, evaluate and control workplace hazards; and

• 

Ensuring that everyone (including visitors and sub-contractors) complies with appropriate standards 

and workplace directions to protect their own and others health and safety at work; and 

• 

Providing adequate systems and resources to effectively manage rehabilitation and return to work 

processes. 

Our Occupational Health and Safety and Security Policy were expanded in line with the Guidelines for Covid19 

to protect our employees during the pandemic:

• 

Proper health screening before entering office and temperature to be taken; and

• 

Provision of readily available masks and hand sanitisers to employees; and

• 

Staggered working hour and allow flexible workplace hours; and

• 

In-house cleaner to perform routine workplace cleaning and disinfection with scheduled cleaning roster; and

• 

Maintain 1m safe distancing.

A Risk Management team which led by our Office Support Executive and composed of employees from different 

designations and departments is set up to facilitate risk assessment at our operation locations, modify Safe 

Work Procedures and formulate Risk Management Implementation Plan. We have sent suitable employees for 

Occupational First Aid Courses at government approved centres and assigned them as safety personnel and 

were sent. In addition, we regularly review our Emergency Response Plan and are certified by the Singapore 

Civil Defence Force for fire safety works in our office that have been completed satisfactorily in accordance with 

the requirements of the “Fire Safety Act”.

During FY2021, the Group continues with the yearly assessment and checking on the laser cutting machines 

involved in our printing business to ensure improvement on health and safety impacts. The fume released by 

laser cutting machines release when it is operational might affect the health of our employees. As such, we 

have made improvement on safety procedures and have ensured that plastic doors will be shut during the laser 

cutting process.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION

The Group recognizes the importance for Training and Education as it enhances productivity of all employees 

by equipping them with the necessary skillsets, ensuring that all employees stay relevant and competitive in 

this ever-changing industry especially during the Covid19 period. 

Our Training and Development Policy encourages employees to upgrade their skillsets and enhance their 

knowledge. The Human Resource (“HR”) Department is responsible for the facilitation of any staff development 

activities. Personal and professional trainings are provided for the employees, including formal training 

sessions (individual or corporate), employee coaching and mentoring, on-the-job training, job shadowing, 

job rotation and participation in conferences. As part of our learning and development provisions, the Group 

will also arrange for job-related subscriptions or educational materials to enable employee access to news, 

articles and other relevant materials in order to carry out their work better. 

As a company with a full range of print management services, we are certified based on the FSCTM standards 

and have conducted FSCTM trainings to equip our workers with knowledge on FSCTM overview, job folder and 

cutting ticket. The Group recognised the importance of soft skills as well. Thus, the Group will occasionally 

engage external experts to organise trainings such as equal employment opportunities, diversity, leadership 

training for managers and conflict resolution training for employees. Training programs were also in place to 

train new employees or to prepare employees for promotions, transfers or new responsibilities, and teams in 

company-related issues (e.g. new systems or policy changes). These sessions will usually be conducted by our 

managers and experts. During the pandemic, some of the training sessions were conducted online.

PROCUREMENT PRACTICE

We established a close relationship with our important business partners include suppliers and consultants. 

As a company providing a full range of print management services, our major suppliers include paper suppliers 

for our printing business.

We have a strict procurement policy that requires our procurement team to work closely with suppliers to 

ensure our suppliers meet our requirements with regards to quality as well as environmental and social 

standards. An approved list of paper suppliers who are FSCTM Chain of Custody (“COC”) certified and the types 

of FSCTM paper they carried has been formulated which our employees can refer to. We have also included these 

categories on packing labels and invoice claims for easy reference. Compiling suppliers’ records and search 

for the information of FSCTM certified suppliers from the FSCTM Database is also tasked to the Purchasing 

Executive. Whenever possible, FSCTM paper samples are also collected from the certified paper merchant for 

reference purposes.

LOCAL PROCUREMENT

Local business is essential for our economy as they bring growth and innovation to our communities. Thus, 

choosing local suppliers and providing support to the local business have always been in the Group’s mind 

and the Group would also like to take this opportunity to give back to the society.  This move could create job 

opportunities for the local community and promote local economic development. The composition of our local 

suppliers are suppliers in Singapore in FY2021 is as follows:

CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Group has placed huge priority on customers’ health and safety impacts resulting from its services and 

products. Appropriate policies and measures have been established to maintain standards of our products and 

services in order to protect customers’ health and safety. We have in place relevant policies and measures to 

instruct employees to take appropriate and standardised steps while servicing our customers. In FY2021, the 

Group has not identified any incidents of non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes concerning the 

health and safety impacts of our products and services.

CUSTOMER PRIVACY

Data privacy of customers is of paramount importance to us and we are committed to protect customers' 

privacy and personal data. Thus, the Group places great emphasis on data security. We engaged an external 

professional company to handle the destruction of personal information of our customers in order to comply 

with privacy-related laws and regulations, including but not limited to the “Personal Data Protection Act”, we 

strictly abide by all off-site and on-site shredding processes set out by professionals and are accredited with 

the Certification of Destruction, in order to mitigate the risk of noncompliance and leakage of personal data. 

All staffs are being briefed on their individual responsibilities regarding the appropriate labelling and information 

classification and are required to follow the Information Labelling Procedure. The procedure provides clear 

instructions on the management of restricted documents and lists out each level of confidentiality for each 

individual department. Any employee found to have violated the procedure could be subject to disciplinary 

action, up to and including termination.

During FY2021, the Group did not receive any substantiated complaint concerning breaches of customer 

privacy, or any leaks, thefts, and loss of customer data.
