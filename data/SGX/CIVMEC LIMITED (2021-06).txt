SCOPE

Civmec’s Sustainability Report 2021 was prepared to provide key stakeholders with all 

relevant information relating to Civmec’s sustainability approach, actions, performance 

and key material issues for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 (FY2021). 

This report was approved by the Civmec Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) on  

29 November 2021. 

Civmec Limited (Company Registration Number 201011837H) is the ultimate holding 

company of the Civmec group of companies. In this report, unless otherwise stated, 

references to ‘Civmec’, the ‘Company’ and the ‘Group’ refer to Civmec Limited and 

its controlled entities. The information in this report covers all operational activities 

undertaken by Civmec. Our share of operations from joint venture projects is reported 

on a proportionately consolidated basis, unless otherwise stated.

REPORTING APPROACH

The Civmec Sustainability Report 2021 outlines our sustainability performance in 

relation to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors for the 12-month period 

to 30 June 2021, along with our future goals, targets and strategies for improvement. 

It has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016 core-level reporting. 

Civmec utilises the widely-used, international GRI Standards reporting framework for 

its ability to facilitate comparability over time, and in relation to other organisations, 

promoting greater transparency and accountability of our sustainability performance. 

The GRI Standards also enable us to identify and report on topics that are most material 

to our business and key stakeholders.

To ensure quality data and insights are collected, we have continued to refine how we 

collect this information, surveying all members of the Civmec Board, management, and 

a randomised selection of employees and clients. We undertake internal auditing of the 

report and reporting process and will continue to report on sustainability, annually.

Civmec is a leading Australian construction and engineering 

services provider, delivering a wide range of integrated 

services to the Energy, Resources, Infrastructure,  

Marine &amp; Defence sectors.

Our advanced capabilities, innovative approach and 

modern facilities enable us to work smarter and more 

efficiently, providing our clients with high-quality, 

value-driven solutions to meet their manufacturing, 

construction and maintenance requirements.

With a focus on establishing long-term partnerships and 

working collaboratively, we have played a significant 

role in the delivery of some of Australia’s most complex 

projects, both onshore and offshore, since our 

establishment in 2009.

Our state-of-the-art manufacturing and maintenance 

facilities are positioned in strategic locations in Western 

Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, providing 

our clients with logistical advantages and enabling us 

to respond agilely to their needs. These world-class 

facilities, backed by our extensive equipment base and 

strong, multi-disciplined team, enable us to effectively 

service projects of all sizes and complexities, anywhere 

in Australia.

OUR FACILITIES

Our main west coast facility, located just 30 

kilometres south of Perth, is the largest heavy 

engineering facility of its kind in Australia. 

Positioned on 200,000m² of waterfront land in 

the Australian Marine Complex (AMC) precinct, it 

has access to the AMC’s prime facilities, ports and 

equipment, in addition to 440,000m² of Common 

User Facility (CUF) land. Within the Civmec facility 

is our cutting-edge 53,000m² (usable floor area) 

Assembly Hall, 29,300m² Fabrication Hall, blast and 

paint workshops, exotic metals and site support 

workshops, and multi-storey office building.

Our Newcastle facility is our principal manufacturing 

facility on the east coast, situated on 227,000m² 

of riverfront land, 14 kilometres from the port 

of Newcastle. With more than 22,500m² of 

manufacturing workshops (with capacity to cater 

for steel and concrete production requirements), as 

part of a combined 30,000m² of undercover space 

(including storage areas), the facility efficiently services 

the east coast market, in addition to providing 

support for our west coast operations.



















About Civmec

Sustaining our maintenance and capital works 

operations are our Gladstone and Port Hedland 

facilities, each positioned purposely in major activity 

hubs for the Resources and Energy sectors. Our 

Gladstone facility, in regional Queensland, provides light 

fabrication capacity and serves as a base for essential 

equipment and the workforce required for maintenance, 

refractory and shutdown works in the area. Our new 

Port Hedland facility allows us to ably service onshore 

and offshore maintenance and capital works projects in 

the north-west of Western Australia as they arise.

Our 53,000m² (usable floor area) Assembly Hall at 

Henderson, with more than 1.2 million cubic metres 

of internal space, has facilitated the success to date 

of our works on the Royal Australian Navy’s Offshore 

Patrol Vessel (OPV) Program. The ten-year project, 

which commenced in 2018, includes the supply and 

processing of steel for 12 vessels.

With the build of the first two vessels in South 

Australia, using steel plates and pipework processed 

and manufactured at Henderson, we are undertaking 

the fabrication and consolidation of the follow-on ten 

vessels in Western Australia.

Our Henderson facility is located within the Australian 

Marine Complex (AMC), Western Australia’s premier 

integrated marine industrial precinct, featuring protected 

deep-water harbours and extensive multi-user loadout 

facilities. 

Our west coast facility – together with our shipyard on 

the east coast, which is situated on the Hunter River 

near the Port of Newcastle and incorporates 535 

metres of river frontage and two ship basins – enables 

us to provide a significant Marine &amp; Defence service 

offering. It is our goal to continue to support the Federal 

Government’s long-term Naval Shipbuilding Plan, 

focused on building a sustainable Australian naval 

shipbuilding industry.

With prime waterfront facilities and a vast range of disciplines under one 

roof, Civmec provides the Marine &amp; Defence sector with fully integrated 

services for the repair, maintenance and construction of naval and 

commercial vessels, as well as the provision of Defence Estate works.

We have addressed the material issues that reflect 

the key priorities and topics identified by a diverse 

range of stakeholders.

At the end of this financial year, a materiality assessment was undertaken that was 

consistent with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards requirements. All Board 

members and Civmec management – as well as a randomised selection of white collar 

employees, blue collar employees, and clients – were invited to participate in the survey. 

This broad variety of stakeholders enabled us to capture a range of opinions and ideas.

In determining the material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors 

selected, their relevance to the business, including our strategy, business model and key 

stakeholders, was considered. 

The results of the Civmec FY2021 Materiality Assessment Survey ranked Occupational 

Health &amp; Safety as highest in importance, consistent with results in previous years. This was 

followed by Non Discrimination, Socioeconomic Compliance, Environmental Compliance 

and Anti-Corruption. The results of the survey reinforce our decision to report on the topics 

from previous years, allowing us to demonstrate progress and comparisons over time.  

In 2015, the United Nations agreed on 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part 

of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The interrelated SDGs are a blueprint to 

achieve a better and more sustainable future for everyone across the planet. They address 

the global challenges we face, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate, 

environmental degradation, prosperity, peace and justice. As a supporter of the SDGs, we 

understand we can positively contribute towards these goals through our own sustainable 

business practices. 

The adjacent table highlights the correlation between our ESG focus areas and the SDGs.

Stakeholder 

Engagement

It is always our priority 

to maintain open lines of 

communication with our key 

stakeholders, both internal 

and external. This extends well 

beyond the formal consultation 

process undertaken to 

determine our business’ 

material issues. 

The table to the right illustrates 

the ways in which we engage 

with those stakeholders that are 

directly impacted and actively 

interested in our business. We 

understand that this ongoing 

engagement is important for 

our long-term sustainability and 

ultimate transparency.

We recognise the critical role that people play in  

the success of our business, and therefore strive  

to support and develop our people wherever possible. 

This includes people from the wide range of trades  

and disciplines we operate in, from tradespeople  

and apprentices, through to industry professionals  

and graduates. 

During FY2021, we not only delivered on key areas in 

our ‘Future Focus’ section of our 2020 Sustainability 

Report, we also implemented a range of new initiatives.

These new initiatives were identified as areas of  

further opportunity to expand our commitment to  

best-practice in the way we support and manage our 

people at Civmec. 

Our initiatives during FY2021 included:

•  introduction of a Paid Parental Leave Scheme; 

• implementation of an Undergraduate Vacation  

 

Program;

• award of the Robert Cunico Scholarship;

• establishment of a key industry partnership  

with  MATES in Construction, an alignment that 

supports suicide prevention with education, peer-to-

peer support, case management and access to a 

24/7 helpline;

• introduction of an Employee Referral Program;

• implementation of a Defence Industry Pathway 

Program for trainees;

• community engagement initiatives, such as support  

of St Patrick’s Community and Support Centre, and  

Vinnies CEO Sleepout; 

• ongoing commitment to leadership training,  

including identification of high potential individuals   

and succession planning;

• continuation of a succession planning  

strategy focused on three key areas – executive 

management, key operational roles, and  

diversity targets; 

• continuing to build on our position as an ‘employer  of 

choice’ and adopting industry practices aligned with, 

and often improved on, those of our competitors;

• further development and expansion of our formalised 

Graduate Program;

• further expansion of the reward and recognition 

strategy to target the direct workforce, implementing  

recognition mechanisms through management and 

peer-to-peer; and

•  review of business management systems, such as 

Civtrac and our payroll software platforms, to drive 

continuous improvement and efficiency capitalisation.





It is always our priority to 

provide fair, non-discriminatory 

employment, whereby all of our 

people have equal opportunities 

to develop and grow.

Employment

In another year faced with the challenges of COVID-19, we continued to maintain our position as 

a significant employer in our industry, directly employing approximately 2,800 people at peak in 

FY2021. This included 150 apprentices, trainees, undergraduates and graduates on long-term 

structured training programs across a wide age demographic. This represents a 40 per cent 

increase on the previous financial year. Pleasingly, ten per cent of our new starting apprentices 

were female, as we continue to aim to increase female participation in the more traditionally  

male-dominated professions. 

We maintained a focus in FY2021 on initiatives that are designed to drive female participation, 

including focused recruitment campaigns; reviewing occupations that can provide more flexible 

rosters; strengthening partnership programs that provide foundation skills or pathways to higher 

level qualifications; and increasing opportunities through our RTO, with personalised training 

programs that provide flexibility and accessibility for females to gain the skills and knowledge 

required to enter our industry sectors.

NEW EMPLOYEE HIRES AND EMPLOYEE TURNOVER

Given the cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate, combined with limitations on available 

resources due to the pandemic and restrictions, attraction and retention of skilled employees is 

a prime focus and potential risk for our business. The tables below illustrate new employee hires 

and employee turnover during FY2021, by age group and gender. The statistical pattern illustrated 

is typical of our industry, where cyclical/short-term project contracts are awarded, and therefore 

these numbers represent the on-hire/off-hire process. The statistics also highlight the challenge 

of attracting females into operational roles, given the nature of the work we do across traditionally 

male-dominated trades and disciplines.

Training and Education 

Collaboration, as one of our core values, ensures we 

are continually working with our people to discover their 

specific training and development needs. Throughout 

the year, we have continued to invest in our people, and 

as a progressive company, we strive to utilise innovative 

programs to upskill our teams from within. 

REGISTERED TRAINING ORGANISATION

Civmec’s Registered Training Organisation, which 

is a recognised RTO (RTO code 52645), registered 

nationally with the Australian Skills Quality Authority 

(ASQA), delivers skills and competency-based training 

in every state across Australia. Our RTO has delivered 

more than 1,777 enrolments for nationally accredited 

units of competence and verifications of competency 

throughout the year. The role of the RTO is to create 

a workforce that is both competent and diversified by 

offering a mixed approach of classroom and on-the-job 

training to focus on excelled learning and growth. We 

can provide leadership and management certifications, 

workplace health and safety certifications, and business 

management certifications, as well as a variety of units 

of competency, such as high-risk work licences, mobile 

and fixed plant operations, working at heights, working 

in confined spaces, first fire attack, and first aid.

During FY2021, there was a 30 per cent increase  

in enrolments in comparison to FY2020. To  

accommodate the increase in enrolments, the  

RTO developed new training initiatives to maximise  

operational efficiency, whilst ensuring the integrity  

and quality of the training was not compromised. 

These initiatives included moving some of the training 

modules to a Learning Management System (LMS), 

where e-learning can be delivered to our remote 

worksites via live video training sessions.

We have continued to focus on ensuring that the  

workforce is varied in terms of skills, values, backgrounds, 

and experience. We strive to offer more to our  

employees and continually demonstrate our  

commitment to their development at Civmec.  

This year, we included a number of nationally  

recognised units of competency taught in Mandarin, 

which is the first language of a portion of our workforce. 

We believe that allowing students to study in their first 

language will improve comprehension of new material 

and promote workplace inclusiveness. We are proud 

to be one of the few training organisations in Australia 

providing this service to our students and employees.

Kristelle’s Story

“I joined Civmec as a Quality Officer in 2014. Within a few years, I was 

given the opportunity to change the direction of my career and move into 

the business systems space. I was first appointed as a Business Systems 

Analyst and have since become the Project Manager of the department, 

where I am responsible for the development, implementation, training, and 

improvement of business systems that support operations. 

The relationships and learning that have come from my time at Civmec 

have kept me engaged, challenged and proud of the work we do.  

Every day at Civmec provides an opportunity to learn something new.” 

Kristelle Conti  

Project Manager Business Systems



“ The relationships and learning that have come from my 

time at Civmec have kept me engaged, challenged and 

proud of the work we do.”

Apprentices and Trainees (continued)

Recognised nationally and highly regarded in the industry, Civmec apprenticeships and 

traineeships have continued to offer meaningful career pathways in FY2021. Five of our 

apprentices were finalists this year at the 2020 Skill Hire Awards, with one of our female 

apprentices named the winner of the ‘Apprentice Safety Awareness’ award. 

Since 2018, our HSE Graduate Program has been successfully upskilling and 

developing HSE professionals, with four graduates now successfully completing  

the two-year program and progressing to HSE Advisor roles across our business.  

With the success of this program, we have continued to expand, recently employing  

an additional six HSE graduates. 

Our Graduate Engineer intake of five graduates in FY2020 increased to twenty in 

FY2021 and provides a formal, structured training plan, which includes five rotations 

through the various disciplines of our company.

In November 2020, we launched our first ever Engineering Undergraduate Vacation 

Work Program, which involved seven bright engineers on a ten-week paid program, 

each selected to be placed within an area of our business to gain a comprehensive 

understanding of Civmec and the industry. We continue to work in collaboration with 

local universities to ensure we attract quality candidates into these programs. 

Civmec has continued working with the South Metropolitan TAFE and local high 

schools for our school-based traineeship program, which was introduced in 2019. 

This program provides an opportunity for local students completing Years 10, 11 or 

12 to undertake work experience throughout the year at our Henderson facility, whilst 

continuing with their school education.  

During FY2021, we also held tours of our facility for students of local colleges to gain  

an understanding of some of our projects and how they are delivered, as well as a 

“World of Work” day; a day during which the students were given the opportunity to 

interact with some of the remote-controlled plant we utilise on our projects and link 

their studies in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) with real-world 

equipment and applications.

Performance and Career Development

We have a Performance and Career Appraisal process that we go through every 

year at the start of the year. This is in addition to encouraging regular, informal, 

performance discussions between employees and managers to ensure that 

everyone is on the same page, and expectations are met. Employees must 

review their previous year’s performance, meet with their manager to discuss this 

assessment, and set goals and targets for the coming 12 months. This process 

identifies learning, development, and career opportunities, which are then tracked 

and progressed throughout the year. The process performed during this period 

has led to the enrolment and development of employees pursuing qualifications in 

leadership and management. 

Civmec is fortunate to have a large number of long-term workers, including some 

who have been with the company almost since its inception. This demonstrates 

Civmec’s ability to provide workers with viable career paths that will allow them to 

develop and grow within the company.

Owen’s Story

“Since starting with Civmec I have had the opportunity to work on some 

iconic construction projects throughout WA. I have worked alongside 

skilled professionals from diverse backgrounds, who possess a wealth of 

knowledge within the construction and engineering industry.

Civmec has enabled me to advance my career and encouraged me to 

progress and further develop my knowledge and skills. I look forward to  

the new and exciting challenges ahead that Civmec has to offer.”

Owen Wakefield  

Rigging Supervisor 



“ Civmec has enabled me to advance my career 

and encouraged me to progress and further 

develop my knowledge and skills.”

Staff performing functions within 

administration, support services, 

operational support, project management 

and management receive regular 

performance and career development 

reviews. During FY2021, 100 per cent of 

eligible employees participated in the 

formal Performance and Career Appraisal 

process.

“ With each unique role, my 

career confidence matures. I am 

continuously reminded of how we 

all fit together and play a part in 

building the bigger picture. ”

Jorinda’s Story

“My Civmec journey started when I was an employee at GE 

Oil and Gas. At the time, I worked as a Document Controller 

on a subsea project and Civmec was subcontracted as the 

main EPC. I remember driving to Civmec as we had to pick 

up hard copy MDRs. Arriving at reception, I was greeted 

by a fellow South African accent. I remember thinking how 

incredible it would be to work here one day.

I started working at Civmec as a casual employee back 

in 2016. I’ve since worked across different functions and 

departments within the company (Purchasing, Reception 

and Proposals). I’ve always had the opportunity to work on 

exciting and ambitious projects. Most recently, I joined the 

Offshore Patrol Vessel program as Document Controller/ 

Quality Administrator. 

With each unique role, my career confidence matures. I am 

continuously reminded of how we all fit together and play a 

part in building the bigger picture. I am enthusiastic about 

what my future holds here at Civmec and who knows where 

the journey might take me next. I might even trade my high 

heels for some safety boots!”

Diversity and Equal Opportunity

DIVERSITY

At Civmec, we value diversity and equal opportunity and recognise that by focusing on 

a positive and inclusive workplace culture, we will create a healthier workplace for our 

people to develop and thrive. We aim to drive diversity in the workplace, founded on the 

belief that balance across age, gender and ethnicity contributes to a better culture and 

makes Civmec a more attractive place to work for all employees.

As we continue to strive for a supportive and inclusive workplace for all people, we are 

focused on actively capitalising on the diversity of skills, talents and perspectives of 

our people to harness an organisation where everyone works better together and feels 

valued and able to contribute. 

In FY2021, 7.1 per cent of our employees across our entire operations were female. 

Whilst this is not the balance we strive for, it is typical of our industry where the ability 

to achieve a diverse workforce in operations and project delivery is more difficult than in 

the corporate environment. As has been the case in previous years, attracting females 

into operational and project-based roles has remained a challenge, and one which we 

continue to invest in with focused recruitment drives.  

In our corporate head office, female participation is more balanced at 48 per cent. 

We continue to focus on the grass-roots level, encouraging female apprentices to grow 

their career with Civmec, and currently employ three female apprentices. Of our seven 

trainees, five are also female. Going forward, we remain committed to seeking out and 

supporting suitable female candidates to join us in trade and operational roles, both 

onsite and in our manufacturing facilities. 

There remains an opportunity to improve the composition of our Board, with the future 

appointment of a female member. Notwithstanding this, there is regular participation at 

Board meetings of other senior managers from across the business, including a number 

of women. At the Key Management Personnel/General Managers/Group Managers 

level, women hold nine per cent of positions. 

The tables on the following page demonstrate the breakdown of our employee 

categories by gender and age, reflecting the Australian Government’s Workplace 

Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) reporting categories.

The Company is committed to ensuring women and men receive equal pay for equal 

work and this is reinforced within our remuneration principles. We will continue to 

undertake an annual remuneration review. If there are any apparent gaps, they will be 

analysed to ensure that such gaps can be explained with reference to market forces 

which may include, for example, different rates of pay in different industries; location 

and the relative supply and demand for different qualifications; individual performance; 

experience; and capacity of hours able to work. The Company lodges its compliance 

reports with the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) annually. A copy of these 

reports may be obtained via the WGEA website.

ABORIGINAL ENGAGEMENT 

Civmec respects the land, culture and heritage of Aboriginal and 

Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) people and their communities. We 

continue to provide employment and training opportunities for ATSI 

people across our business, again focused at the grassroots level, 

with six per cent of participants in our apprenticeship program of 

ATSI descent.

We are also proud to work in partnership with ATSI businesses 

in the community, including the East West Pilbara Group Pty Ltd 

(EWPG) and EWP Yalagan Pty Ltd (EWP Yalagan).  

“We wholly endorse your organisation as one that ‘walks the walk’ 

when it comes to Indigenous engagement. This type of support 

not only helps our organisation prosper but creates benefits to our 

Indigenous employees, their families and the wider community.”   

- Nathan Martin, Director EWP Yalagan

 

NON-DISCRIMINATION 

We monitor the number of filed, addressed and resolved grievances 

regarding labour practices. Civmec’s confidential whistleblowing line 

is available to all employees and external stakeholders for raising 

any concerns they may have.

During the year, nil incidents of  

discrimination were reported through  

the confidential whistleblowing line.

Our Future Focus

We will continue to drive best-practice in the way we manage  

our people going forward, with future focus on: 

•  continued commitment to leadership training, including 

identification of high potential individuals and succession 

planning;

•  implementation of a succession planning strategy focused on 

three key areas – executive management, key operational roles, 

and diversity targets; 

•  strengthening our position as an ‘employer of choice’ with 

industry leading practices aligned and improved on that of  

our competitors; 

•  continued development of our apprenticeship, traineeship and 

graduate programs; and

•  further strengthening our current mental health systems  

and initiatives to ensure mental health and wellbeing is a 

continued focus. 

Initiatives specifically focused on increasing female participation 

include: 

•  focused recruitment campaigns; 

•  reviewing occupations (including non-traditional female roles) 

which can provide a more flexible roster, including part-time and 

job sharing;

•  strengthening partnership programs with key stakeholders, 

including clients, community groups and job networks, providing 

the foundation skills required for employment in the resource 

industry or pathways to higher level qualifications; and

•  increasing opportunities through our RTO, with personalised 

training programs that provide flexibility and ease of access, 

which remove the barriers that discourage women from gaining 

the skills and knowledge required to enter our industry sectors.

CONTRIBUTING TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES  

Civmec remains committed to our corporate social 

responsibilities and supporting the communities in 

which we operate, through partnerships, sponsorships, 

and fundraising. In line with our Make a Difference value, 

we empower our employees to join us in assisting the 

various communities and charities that we support.  

 

 

 

 

CEO Sleepout 

The CEO Sleepout is a worthy annual event that aims 

to break the cycle of homelessness and poverty in the 

community, and one which we have supported several 

times over the years. This year, our CEO Pat Tallon was 

joined by Group Manager HR &amp; IR Stephanie Baptist, 

together raising almost $60,000 for the cause with the 

generous support of so many.

Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea

We held a fundraiser in our offices for the Cancer 

Council Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea, which raised 

funds that will be put towards cancer research, support 

services, prevention programs, and advocacy. 



Ruah Christmas Gift Donation

The spirit of giving was felt at our Henderson facility 

last Christmas, with our employees donating a range of 

children’s toys and women’s gifts to Ruah Community 

Services. Ruah is a local charity providing resources to 

those dealing with homelessness, domestic violence 

and chronic mental illness.  



St Patrick’s Volunteering

St Patrick’s Community Support Centre assists people 

that are homeless or at risk of homelessness in the 

local community, so we were happy to spend some 

time volunteering with them last Christmas, sorting and 

packing Christmas hampers for those in need in our 

own community. We were also fortunate to be given a 

tour of their facility, learning about their range of services 

and facilities.

Containers for Change

In further support of St Patrick’s Community Support 

Centre, we implemented the ‘Containers for Change’ 

initiative across our Henderson facility over the course 

of the year. Our people are encouraged to bring in their 

eligible containers and donate, with ten cents from 

every container going directly to the centre.  

Foodbank Donation Drive-Thru

We supported Australia’s largest food relief organisation 

during the Foodbank WA “Donation Drive-Thru” in 

2021, collecting and donating food and other non-

perishable items at Easter time. The donations made 

were a continuation of our efforts to Make a Difference 

to our local community and those in need, with the 

items going on to create care hampers for Western 

Australians experiencing homelessness.



Clean Up Australia Day

In 2021, Civmec once again took part in a ‘Business 

Clean Up’ in support of Clean Up Australia Day. Many 

of our people volunteered to take time out of their day, 

picking up rubbish in and around the local vicinity to 

help protect the environment and, equally importantly, 

prevent the rubbish from ending up in our oceans.  



R U OK? Day 

With mental health and wellbeing a major focus 

this year, we continued to support R U OK? Day, a 

national day of action where Australians are reminded 

to check in on one another. Civmec employees were 

randomly paired up with a buddy from their office and 

encouraged to start up a conversation, ask how they’re 

going, or just have a coffee and a chat together. 



Indigenous Partnerships

We aim to foster positive partnerships with various 

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) businesses in 

the communities in which we operate. This has included 

recently the East West Pilbara Group Pty Ltd (EWPG) 

and EWP Yalagan Pty Ltd (EWP Yalagan). 

Other Initiatives

During the financial year, we supported a number of 

other fundraisers, charity events, educational events 

and sponsorships, including Pink Ribbon Day, Jeans for 

Genes Day, college and school educational events, and 

the Kwinana Knights Women’s Football team.

Ranking as our foremost material issue at Civmec, the 

health, safety and wellbeing of our people remains our 

key priority and chief area of focus. 

Our workplace culture is built around our Never 

Assume program, which empowers every person in the 

company to ensure their work practices are focused 

on achieving zero harm. It describes the principles and 

values adopted by our employees and underpins the 

behaviour, attitude, decisions and actions required by  

all individuals within the business.

Within the program, our set of Critical Safety Essentials 

outlines the mandatory expectations for safe behaviour 

and delivery. The way we manage safety begins 

with these critical essentials, and every employee 

is expected to abide by these underlying rules. Our 

objective, by setting clear expectations and reinforcing 

the right and responsibility of every employee to 

stop work and intervene if they see an unsafe act or 

condition, is that we will continue to drive improvements 

in our safety performance and culture. 

In support of this, we implemented a range of proactive 

measures in during FY2021:

• A three-year Mental Health Strategy 2021-2024 

was approved by our CEO in April 2021. The 

Mental Health Strategy includes psychosocial risk 

assessments, mentally healthy workplace auditing 

programs, training and awareness programs and 

support mechanisms in alignment with industry 

partners, such as MATES in Construction. 

At Civmec, we understand that achieving excellence  

in health and safety performance, and the physical  

and mental wellbeing of our people, is critical to the 

long-term success and sustainability of our company.  

• A comprehensive manual handling and ergonomics 

program was implemented on our operational 

sites, focusing on field assessments to evaluate 

body positioning, manual task assessment, 

musculoskeletal risk and both theory-based  

and practical training. Manual handling training is  

also now a mandatory part of Civmec’s online 

induction material. 

• The ‘Finish Strong 2020’ campaign was rolled out 

at the end of 2020 to ensure that our projects and 

facilities finished off the year without injury or incident. 

The ‘Kick Start 2021’ program was rolled out in late 

December for a re-start in January. 

• A ‘See It, Own It’ campaign was introduced across 

our operations in April 2021. This campaign set 

out to drive continuous safety improvement and 

reinforced the message that: “the standard you 

walk past is the standard you set”. Employees and 

leaders across the business were empowered to 

influence positive safety change, be more aware of 

their surroundings, look out for each other, and make 

a difference in their work area by putting safety at the 

highest priority.

• Several operational crisis exercises were conducted 

throughout the year. These exercises involved  

senior corporate and project-based operational  

staff and were based on potential real-life,  

site-based scenarios. 

• A ‘Sustainability Group’ was formed, comprising 

employees from various departments, with the 

purpose of exploring sustainable options for 

Civmec’s operations, including construction  

and manufacturing.

Safety Performance

We experienced another busy year at Civmec, recording 4,662,433 hours (including 

contractors), with the majority of these hours accumulated in environments of work 

considered to be of higher risk. 

During FY2021, we had a reduction in our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) to 

0.21 per one million hours worked, decreasing from 0.36 in FY2020. This improvement 

reflects our continued efforts to drive strong field leadership and proactive leading 

indicators, including hazard reporting, workplace inspections and behavioural 

observations, to facilitate a sustained reduction in recordable injuries.

Unfortunately, we noted a slight increase in our All Injury Frequency Rate (AIFR), which 

records all injuries requiring at least first aid treatment, to 31.96 per million hours 

worked. We are addressing this in a number of ways, including with the implementation 

of the aforementioned manual handling and ergonomics program and our ‘See It,  

Own It’ campaign.

Over the reporting period for all injuries, the most commonly injured body parts were 

hands/fingers, which equated to 19 per cent of all injuries, followed by back injuries at 

18 per cent, leg/hip injuries at 15 per cent and eye injuries at 14 per cent. 

Our safety performance across key metrics is outlined in the tables below:

As is typical in the construction and engineering industry, which undertakes 

predominantly manual work, the principal nature of recordable injuries was sprains 

and strains. It should also be noted that 30 per cent of recordable injuries were from 

contractor employees. 

We will continue to review our processes and systems with the aim of reducing the 

frequency and severity of all injuries. By driving top-of-mind awareness of health and 

safety on site, maintaining vigilance, and implementing proactive measures, we aim to 

further improve our safety performance in the coming years.

MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING 

The mental health and wellbeing of our people is recognised 

as an increasingly important area of focus for Civmec, 

particularly as our employees and their families are faced 

with the ongoing challenges of COVID-19. We therefore 

implemented a formalised Mental Health Strategy in FY2021 

to ensure we are providing a safe place of work, continuing 

the discussion around mental health, and arming our 

employees with the services, support and skills they need to 

assist them with their own mental health and wellbeing, as 

well as assisting in supporting their colleagues. 

This year, we established a key industry partnership with 

MATES in Construction, a not for profit organisation 

that provides leadership and support for workers in the 

construction industry, with the vision to create a mutually 

safer workplace by delivering suicide prevention education, 

peer-to-peer support, case management, and access to a 

24/7 helpline. 

We recognise that a mentally healthy workplace creates 

a positive working environment that builds individual skills 

and resilience, improves organisational adaptability, general 

health and safety, and workforce sustainability, with reduced 

staff turnover. 

Some of our additional strategies and activities to support 

our employees’ health and wellbeing include: 

• ensuring our workforce is aware of the Employee 

Assistance Program (EAP), which is available to all Civmec 

employees and their families, as well as how to access it;

• responding quickly to the evolving situations of the 

pandemic, including support provided through both our 

HR and Health and Safety departments;

• acting on discrimination or bullying, including the use of 

inappropriate language;

• encouraging people to maintain a balance between 

physical, mental and social wellbeing;

• providing additional levels of support such as a buddy or 

mentor to help as needed; 

• managing psychosocial risks with the same robust 

risk management approach as for all other identified 

workplace risks;

• early intervention programs, such as drug and alcohol 

testing, and a zero tolerance to the presence of these 

substances at work;

• prevention programs, including health assessments and 

pre-employment screening;

• access to education programs specifically developed 

to support those with supervisory or leadership 

responsibilities;

• benefits such as discounts on gym membership, health 

insurance, financial advisory services and travel.

These strategies are supported by our onsite medical facility 

and injury management services, promoting active lifestyle  

programs and assisting employees with both work-related 

and non-work-related injuries and illnesses.

We will continue to educate and train our people to facilitate 

an open dialogue around health and wellbeing, and provide 

all necessary support and assistance in order to create a 

healthy, sustainable workforce.

Our Future Focus

Heading into FY2022, health and safety will remain at the forefront of our 

priorities as we strive for zero harm, continuous improvement and ongoing 

development of our health and safety systems.

We will continue to work on new initiatives that improve outcomes 

and ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of all our employees and 

stakeholders across all areas of operation.

Our key areas of focus include:

• continuing to monitor and review our HSE Management Systems in line 

with pending Western Australian WHS legislation changes, which are  

formally expected in early 2022; 

• providing awareness training to all employees and leaders within the 

business, following pending legislation changes; 

• continuing to drive sustained improvement in lead indicator KPI reporting, 

monitoring and review, including improving efficiencies through the use 

of electronic tools to provide real time and accurate statistics and trend 

analysis and to reduce inefficient reporting mechanisms; and 

• continuing with our proactive approach towards the management of 

mental health and psychosocial hazards, and increasing education and 

awareness amongst the workforce and operational leaders.  

We remain committed to our strong safety priority, which we recognise as  

a critical element of our ongoing business improvement and success.

We challenge our employees to be 

leaders in this space, and to ensure 

they are applying best practice in 

environmental management across our 

operations, continually looking for ways to 

improve our environmental performance 

and efficiency. 

We benefit our clients, the communities in 

which we operate, and the environment 

by delivering high environmental 

performance. Alongside our commitment 

to our Environmental Policy, during 

FY2021 we continued to implement 

measures to drive environmental best 

practice at our fabrication and assembly 

facilities in Perth and Newcastle, as well 

as throughout our project sites.

These included:

• the creation of an internal sustainability 

group, consisting of employees with 

knowledge on sustainability, to develop 

initiatives to enhance our sustainability 

performance in the immediate and long 

term;

• promoting an environmentally aware 

culture through ongoing training and 

communication across all levels of the 

business;

•  assessing the feasibility of powering 

our current and future facilities with 

solar energy;

• supporting the development of 

Western Australia’s critical battery 

mineral industry with constructability 

input for major lithium producers;

• commencing the elimination of single 

use plastics across our sites;

• establishing the ‘Containers for 

Change’ initiative across our 

Henderson facilities, encouraging our 

people to donate used containers to 

raise money for St Patrick’s Community 

Support Centre; and 

• initiating the purchase of electric vehicle 

equipment across our facilities.

At Civmec, we aim to be environmentally conscientious,  

as we understand the importance of the natural environment 

in which we conduct our business. We make every effort to 

maintain strong environmental performance, as it is critical to 

the Company’s continued success, growth, and sustainability. 

Throughout the year, there has been an increased focus 

around training and communication to promote an 

environmentally conscious culture.

Environmental Compliance

In order to operate in our industry, we must follow a variety of 

local, state, and federal rules and regulations, as well as relevant 

Australian and international standards, all of which have been 

developed over time to protect and respect the environment 

and the communities in which we operate and live.

We have a solid Health, Safety and Environmental Management 

System (HSEMS) in place, which has been certified by Lloyds 

Register as meeting the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental 

Management System requirements. Our management system 

provides a solid foundation for ensuring consistency in how we 

identify, understand, and manage environmental challenges 

across the numerous jurisdictions and operational settings in 

which we operate.

All of our facilities and project sites are expected to identify, 

document, and monitor all legal and other requirements that 

are relevant to the work being done in order to maintain legal 

compliance. As part of our regular corporate auditing program, 

we assess project and facility legal compliance, as well as our 

internal standards and expectations.

During FY2021, we received no 

environmental fines/breaches and/ 

or notices in relation to state or 

federal laws and regulations.

Energy, Emissions and our Changing Climate 

Due to the nature of our business, our energy inputs are high; therefore, having a 

stable, economical, and efficient energy source is essential. We recognise the scientific 

consensus on climate change and accept that we must do our part to reduce 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement, which 

Australia is party to along with other signatories. 

Climate change poses numerous risks to the global environment, people, and 

businesses. As we engineer solutions to mitigate climate change, there are many 

opportunities for our business, such as the expected investment in hydrogen, lithium 

and critical battery minerals. Currently, we are supporting the development of  

Western Australia’s critical battery mineral industry with constructability input for  

major lithium producers.

OUR ENERGY

Currently, local electrical networks in Western Australia and New South Wales provide 

100 per cent of our electricity at our manufacturing/production sites. Due to the diverse 

project arrangements in often isolated places, it is difficult to accurately estimate energy 

usage at our projects, hence it is not included in this report.

The fabrication process, which includes handling, cutting, bending, welding, drilling, 

assembling and painting our products, accounts for the majority of the energy 

consumed at our facilities. In addition, energy is used to heat, cool, and light our 

corporate and manufacturing facilities, as well as to offer general power. Fuels and 

gases are also used to power machinery and equipment, with certain gases being 

consumed during the welding and cutting processes.

To allow us to measure and compare the energy intensity of our fabrication facilities over 

time, we measure our total energy input in Terajoules (TJ) per million dollars of turnover 

($m AUD). During FY2021, Civmec facilities consumed a total of 42.95 TJ, which is an 

increase of 54 per cent when compared to FY2020 levels. Our recorded number of 

hours worked for the facilities (including fabrication, assembly and corporate) for the 

FY2021 period also increased significantly by 501,821 to 1,576,992 in FY2021 (from 

1,075,171 in FY2020) and attributes to our energy input increases. 

To improve our energy intensity results, we are investigating the implementation of 

solar, as well as ways in which we can improve in the areas of manual and material 

handling, materials tracking and traceability, advanced automation, increased in-house 

modularisation and commissioning, and ongoing training of our local workforce.

OUR EMISSIONS

To allow us to measure and compare the emissions intensity of our facilities over  

time, we measure the CO2 emitted in tonnes (tCO2e) per million dollars of turnover  

($m AUD). In FY2021, our emissions intensity increased by 51 per cent when compared 

to FY2020 levels. This is associated with an increase in operational activities from our 

Henderson Assembly Hall, along with the significant increase in hours worked.

We are committed to improving our emissions intensity results, and over the last year 

we have been collecting our energy data to further understand and build a more 

detailed energy profile. From this data, it has guided us to make the decision to actively 

assess the feasibility of powering our current and future facilities with solar energy.  

As part of the facility design for our new Port Hedland facility, we will be incorporating 

solar panels to ensure we are continuously looking for ways to reduce our emissions. 

Our ongoing strategy with respect to reducing our overall GHG emissions and 

emissions intensity shall be delivered through our investment in, and implementation  

of, our efficiency programs. 

The table below illustrates our facilities’ energy and emissions data (Henderson and 

Newcastle), including:

• energy data, which includes diesel, petrol, electricity, LPG and welding gas;

• Scope 1 emissions, comprising diesel, petrol, LPG and acetylene;

• Scope 2 emissions, comprising our purchased electricity; and

• emissions intensity, measuring Scope 1 and Scope 2 against turnover.

“ Throughout the construction phase, 

we ensured that we continuously sought 

innovative ways to make the building 

more sustainable.”

New Garnet Recycling System 

Throughout the construction phase of our recently completed 

Assembly Hall and paint and blast shed, we ensured that we 

continuously sought innovative ways to make the building 

more sustainable. Civmec’s new paint and blast shed has 

been built with a garnet recycling system to reduce the 

amount of waste and cost of disposing garnet. 

• 

Once blasting has finished, the spent garnet is blown to 

the sides of the shed where the garnet particles (roughly 

0.6mm in size) fall through perforated metal sheets 

which line the shed.

• 

A conveyor system built under the shed floor moves the 

spent garnet to the recycling system. A bucket elevator 

system is used to transport the spent garnet from the 

conveyor system. The blasted garnet is cleaned so it can 

be used again productively.

• 

Ensuring the recycled garnet is clean involves removing 

oversized contaminates (that have not been previously 

filtered out from the perforates sheets – e.g. paint chips, 

rust, earplugs) and undersized contaminates (e.g. dust).

• 

As the garnet breaks down after each time it is blasted, 

a productive working mix is created by adding in virgin 

garnet to the cleaned garnet.

• 

The recycled garnet is then stored in blast pots prior to 

going back into the main blasting line to be reused.

Effluents and Waste

Construction waste is a significant global environmental issue that we acknowledge 

our role in. At Civmec, we aim to minimise our impact on the environment as much as 

possible, measuring and monitoring our effluents and waste, and employing a range of 

waste minimisation strategies. Our current waste reduction strategy encompasses: 

• fervent awareness and cultural acceptance across the business of the importance  

 

of waste minimisation, as well as a focus on continuous improvement of our waste  

 

management; 

•  reducing not only our own waste, but also waste that occurs within the supply 

chain, including packaging; and

•  capturing all recyclable materials across the business and reducing the amount of 

waste that goes to landfill. 

The below table details waste data relating to our two manufacturing facilities in 

Henderson and Newcastle. Obtaining accurate waste management data for projects  

is difficult, due to some projects having their waste managed by the client or owner. 

Civmec facilities do not discharge any waste materials to the environment. All waste 

materials are contained and removed from site for further processing. 

All waste data included in this report has been provided by the relevant waste  

service providers.

Note: These increases in energy occurred with a decrease in quantity of steel processed by weight in

TRADE WASTE LICENSE

Following high pressure cleaning of equipment at our Henderson maintenance and 

logistics workshop, Civmec is left with wastewater that may contain oils or grease.  

To discharge this to the sewerage network, we utilise a Trade Waste License. It involves 

first passing the water through an oily water separator, prior to discharging to the 

network for further treatment. 

The license conditions stipulate that our wastewater is tested annually for Total 

Petroleum Hydrocarbons.

SPILLS

Although continual environmental training is provided on Civmec sites and best efforts 

are made to avoid spills, due to the nature of our work and the type of equipment we 

operate, occasionally minor hydrocarbon and chemical spills do occur. 

These types of spills may affect the environment in different ways, depending on 

the type and volume of material spilt and the receiving environment. If a spill clean-

up is managed effectively, the exposure to personnel and environmental damage is 

minimised. 

We continue to implement regular spill training sessions and operational controls to 

minimise our impact on the environment. We believe the best form of spill management 

is spill prevention and it is therefore our responsibility, along with the responsibility of all 

of our personnel, to ensure all company and regulatory processes and requirements are 

adhered to. 

There were no significant or 

reportable spills during FY2021.

Modern Slavery 

We published our first Civmec Group Modern Slavery 

Statement in FY2021. With the vast proportion of 

Civmec labour sourced locally, the likelihood of modern 

slavery risks in Civmec Group’s supply chains is low, 

and mainly lies in supplier or subcontractor non-

compliance with the Group’s policies and standards, 

including excessive overtime, migrant labour exploitation 

and forced labour. 

To address these concerns, all subcontractors and 

major suppliers are required to undergo a thorough  

pre-qualification assessment that includes 

questionnaires and a declaration addressing modern 

slavery. There may be a slightly higher risk of modern 

slavery among lower-tier suppliers and subcontractors 

further down the supply chain, where the Group does 

not have clear visibility; however, the Civmec Group 

is committed to eradicating all forms of modern 

slavery across its operations and supply chains and is 

continuously improving strategies and actions to identify 

and mitigate modern slavery risks.

We understand that modern slavery risk management 

is an issue that requires continuous commitment across 

the Civmec Group and ongoing collaboration with all 

stakeholders.

Code of Conduct 

Our Code of Conduct aims to set a standard of 

behaviour and culture throughout, which guides our 

people to perform their work, make decisions, hold 

themselves accountable for their performance, and 

protect Civmec’s value and reputation.

All employees are expected, at all times, to act 

consistently with the Code, and this Code applies to 

Civmec employees whenever they are identified as a 

representative of Civmec. 

Civmec is dedicated to conducting business in a fair and honest 

manner. Everywhere we work, we are committed to doing what 

is best for our employees and the businesses we collaborate 

with. Our Modern Slavery Statement and Code of Conduct 

establishes a standard of culture throughout.

Socioeconomic Compliance

Civmec acknowledges the impacts of our business 

activities on society, the economy, and the regions and 

communities in which we operate. Socioeconomic 

compliance is a critical factor for the future success of 

our business.

We commit to compliance with all known legal 

requirements and legislations, continuously monitoring 

and measuring our socioeconomic impacts, initiatives 

and contributions in order to facilitate our business’ 

legitimacy in a sustainable society. 

Consideration is paid to socioeconomic factors from 

both within and outside the company, including 

assessment and review of our Code of Conduct, 

policies and procedures in relation to human rights 

issues, ethical supply chain relations, our contribution 

to local economies, employment and training, 

indigenous engagement, and capacity development at 

a community level. 

We try at all times to understand and respond to our 

stakeholders’ interests. Doing so helps us be a good 

neighbour, an effective partner and a sustainable 

operator. Our engagement with communities, 

employees, stakeholders and clients seeks to 

understand the social, cultural, environmental and 

economic implications of our activities, so we can 

respond to concerns, reduce negative impacts and 

optimise benefits for local communities and the  

broader economy.

Civmec remains committed to conducting our 

operations with integrity and in a manner that is 

consistent with laws and business practices that are 

aimed at fostering an open, competitive and fair market 

environment and which will best serve the long-term 

interests of our customers, our stakeholders and the 

wider community.



Our Future Focus

One of Civmec’s values is to Make a Difference and this translates to having a positive impact, both socially and 

economically, in the communities in which we operate. We acknowledge the important role our people play in 

supporting this, and are proud to have a team that continues to embrace this value with enthusiasm. 

Our future focus includes:

•  continuing to encourage and support employee participation in community engagement initiatives, by 

providing them with vehicles and opportunities to contribute; and

•  continuing to maximise relevant opportunities for community engagement.

Civmec did not receive any fines 

or major non-monetary sanctions 

for non-compliance with laws and/

or regulations in the social and 

economic arena during FY2021.

Civmec’s Board and management are committed 

to maintaining a high standard of governance  

and ethics. They recognise the importance of 

good governance in ensuring transparency  

and protecting the interests of shareholders,  

as well as strengthening investors’ confidence 

 in the management of all aspects of the 

Company’s operations.

The Board and Executives promote high standards of corporate behaviour and, as 

a dual-listed Company, endorse both the SGX Principles of the Code of Corporate 

Governance and the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations. 

Civmec’s Report on Corporate Governance for the year ending 30 June 2021 (in which 

we report against these principles) is included in our 2021 Annual Report, available on 

our website. 

To assist in the execution of its responsibilities, the Board has established several Board 

Committees, including an Audit Committee, Nominating Committee, Remuneration 

Committee and Risks and Conflicts Committee. These Committees function within 

clearly defined terms of reference and operating procedures, which are reviewed on a 

regular basis.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy



Anti-Corruption

ASSESSMENT PROCESSES

We assess all Company legal entities in regards to 

the implementation of anti-corruption practices and 

incidents of corruption. 

It is a requirement that all new major suppliers are 

required to comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct, 

committing to respect our zero-tolerance policy 

concerning bribery and corruption. Suppliers must 

have systems in place to ensure the proper instruction, 

training, and auditing of personnel and subcontractors 

to ensure compliance. We perform supplier audits and 

evaluations to monitor and assess compliance with the 

Company’s requirements and the Code of Conduct. 

Suppliers are obliged to immediately inform us of any 

known violations of the Code of Conduct.

As part of ongoing internal auditing, we investigate any 

corruption risks and, if corruption is suspected, the HR 

Business Unit, together with Executive Management 

and possibly other business units, will carry out an 

investigation with the help of specialised third parties, 

if necessary. The findings of the investigation will be 

reviewed and disciplinary action, if required, will be 

considered and implemented, which may lead to the 

termination of employment and/or the termination of 

contracts with business partners, or to such contracts 

not being extended or changed for precautionary 

reasons. The Risks and Conflicts Committee will be 

notified of any acts of corruption and advised on the 

actions taken. If a case of significant corruption has 

occurred, the Risks and Conflicts Committee may be 

more actively involved in the decision making of the 

disciplinary action required and management of the 

process, including public awareness, as required. 

To prevent corruption risks, we undertake business 

reviews of high-risk business in high-risk environments 

with high-risk customers. 

COMMUNICATION &amp; TRAINING

Civmec’s approach to anti-corruption is based on our 

Code of Conduct, which clearly prohibits bribery and 

corruption. Compliance with the Code of Conduct, as 

an integral part of the employment contract and the 

onboarding program, is the personal responsibility of 

each Civmec employee. In addition, employees receive 

training at least once a year. Corporate Legal, Internal 

Audit and Corporate Compliance teams regularly 

conduct training sessions and audits. Executive  

General Managers and Business Unit Managers are 

responsible for the compliance of their departments 

with applicable laws, internal regulations, including the 

Code of Conduct, and for the information and training 

of their staff. 

We regularly conduct formal training in proactive 

avoidance of possible violations against the Code of 

Conduct, both with e-learnings and with classroom-

based (face-to-face) courses. Training is group-specific, 

based on cases, and modern training tools are 

used (multi-media). Participation is mandatory for all 

employees in relevant roles. 

RECORDED INCIDENTS

Adoption of and compliance with the Code of Conduct 

by the General Managers and their management teams 

was reviewed in 2021. 

Our employees are the most effective channel to detect 

violation, underlining transparency as a key value at 

Civmec which must be supported and preserved.

In FY2021 there were no formal 

allegations made against Civmec 

in relation to bribery, corruption 

or kickbacks. There were also no 

legal proceedings against Civmec 

or its employees for alleged 

corruption during FY2021.

Anti-Competitive Behaviour

PURPOSE

By operating in many different geographical regions and market sectors, which 

involves dealing with a range of customers, competitors, suppliers, and various other 

stakeholders, we recognise the importance of conducting all of our operations in 

compliance with laws and business practices, including, but not limited to, those related 

to anti-competitive behaviours. 

We are committed to conducting our operations with integrity and in a manner that 

is consistent with laws and business practices that are aimed at fostering an open, 

competitive and fair market environment and which will best serve the long-term 

interests of our customers, our stakeholders and the wider community. 

We also commit to dealing fairly and honestly with all of our customers, suppliers, 

competitors and any other business partners and the community (collectively 

‘stakeholders’), and observing relevant legislation, regulation, contractual obligations 

and our corporate policies – in particular the provisions of the Competition and 

Consumer Act (‘CCA’), and the Australian Consumer Law (‘ACL’).

GUIDELINES

The key guidelines which govern our approach to anti-competitive behaviour are  

as follows:

1.  The CCA governs anti-competitive and unfair behaviours. It is regulated by the 

Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (‘ACCC’).

2.  Our corporate policies prohibit entry by any person representing Civmec into any 

arrangements which are illegal under the CCA, have the purpose or (in some cases) 

the effect of substantially lessening competition, or breach the ACL.

3.  We predominantly operate under the provisions of the CCA and ensure compliance 

with this Act (amongst others). This includes the prohibition of behaviours such as: 

a. 

 agreements between competitors to fix, maintain or control prices;

b. 

 agreements between competitors to split up a market or customer agreements 

between competitors not to deal with particular suppliers, customers or other 

competitors;

c. 

 conduct that is prohibited if it has the purpose or effect of substantially 

lessening competition as defined under the CCA, which may include, 

depending on circumstances, exclusive dealing and other restrictive 

arrangements;

d. 

 the supply of goods or services on condition that the customer purchases 

goods or services from a third party; and

e. 

 inducing resellers to not sell products below a specified price. 

4.  We also prohibit agreements, arrangements or understandings that have the 

purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a market.

Civmec had zero legal actions pending or completed in FY2021 in relation to 

anti-competitive behaviour and violations of anti-trust and monopoly legislation.

Furthermore, to date, Civmec has never received or been the subject of any 

legal action in relation to anti-competitive behaviour and violations of anti-trust 

and monopoly legislation.

POLICY COMPLIANCE

Policy compliance is essential, as the risk of failing to comply 

with the policy in relation to anti-competitive behaviour may 

result in reputational damage, expose the Company and/or its 

employees to civil or criminal liability, or result in other financial 

damage, including substantial fines and penalties being 

imposed upon Civmec. It may also put our business licences 

at risk. Any employees or employee who breach/es the policy 

may face disciplinary action, including dismissal. 

The Executive General Manager Operational Support is 

responsible for implementation of Civmec’s competition law 

compliance. This is critical to the business for a number of 

reasons, including:

• the Company may be subject to significant reputational 

damage that could have a detrimental effect on ongoing 

operations and take several years to rectify;

• investigations into the Company and findings of  

infringements attract adverse media comment;  

•  failure to comply with competition rules can have an 

extremely high financial cost with regards to fines from the 

Australian Government;

• any agreement that infringes competition law may be wholly 

or partially invalid which means that the Company cannot 

enforce it;

•  third parties who suffer loss as a result of anti-competitive 

behaviour may be able to claim damages from Civmec for 

their loss; and

•  investigations and possible legal proceedings resulting from 

infringements can take years to resolve, incurring high costs 

and taking up management time that should be devoted to 

more profitable projects. 

We encourage our staff to be vigilant and proactive in 

circumstances where they have concerns about conduct that 

may breach the CCA, and encourage employees to escalate 

any such concerns they might have to their line manager or the 

Executive General Manager, Operational Support.

Procurement Practices

LOCAL INDUSTRY PARTICIPATION

Civmec acknowledges the impact our procurement practices have on the sustainability 

and long-term wellbeing of the communities we operate in. Wherever possible, we aim 

to source and select subcontractors and suppliers that align with our environmental, 

economic and social objectives.

We provide full, fair and reasonable opportunity for local industry to take part in all 

activities, maximising local industry participation where subcontractors and suppliers 

are capable and competitive on the basis of OHS, environment, quality, delivery and 

value-for-money standards. 

We also support economic inclusion where possible through partnerships with small 

and medium-sized suppliers and Indigenous businesses in the local community. In 

FY2021, we increased our partnerships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island (ATSI) 

businesses, including the East West Pilbara Group Pty Ltd (EWPG) and EWP Yalagan 

Pty Ltd (EWP Yalagan).

Our Local Industry Participation (LIP) Policy further details our commitment to the 

sustainability of local industry, including:

•  developing project-specific LIP plans;

•  providing early and fair opportunities to all local industries;

•  developing a communications strategy for local industry so that they are informed  

at the earliest opportunity of upcoming subcontractor/supply opportunities;

•  ensuring local capabilities are considered when planning work scope to optimise 

opportunities for local businesses;

•  providing training and development opportunities for local providers in order to 

enhance their sustainability;

•  giving preference to tenderers that use the greatest local content in labour and 

materials; and

•  working with government, industry bodies and communities to improve local 

industry participation, capability and competitiveness.

Tax 

PURPOSE

Civmec recognises the importance of contributing to government revenue in the 

form of taxes, in the countries we operate in. We are committed to complying 

with all relevant tax legislations and fulfilling our fiscal obligations with integrity and 

transparency. Detailed information regarding our Company finances, including tax 

contributions, is released publicly in our annual reports. 

The vast majority of our operations in FY2021 were conducted in Australia.

By continuing to make fair and reasonable contributions to the national 

economy, we will support both local and broader communities and their 

ongoing sustainability, and continue to meet the expectations of our customers, 

stakeholders and the public. 

GUIDELINES

The key guidelines governing our approach to tax are as follows:

•  ensuring we remain familiar with all tax reporting and payment obligations 

within our jurisdiction;

•  declaring all assessable income and allowable deductions;

•  participating only in legitimate tax planning;

•  where necessary, obtaining the advice of professionals and experts; and

•  making ourselves available to the tax authorities at all times, and responding to 

any requests in a timely manner.
