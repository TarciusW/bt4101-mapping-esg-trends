BOARD

STATEMENT



The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present our Sustainability Report (the “Report”) of Vibrant Group Limited (the 

“Group”, “Vibrant Group” or “we”) for the financial year ended 30 April 2021 (“FY2021”). This Report provides an overview of the 

Group’s commitment and approach towards sustainability through its operations and business practices in the industry.

The Report presents our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives, plans and performances in a transparent manner 

and demonstrates the Group’s ongoing commitment to sustainable development. The Board believes this Report serves as a good 

platform to communicate with its stakeholders on the Group’s sustainability performance.

As one of the well-established logistics group in Singapore, the Board believes sustainability is the key for the Group to achieve 

continuous success. Being the Group’s long-term strategic approach, the Board is responsible for overseeing the performance of 

the Group by incorporating the concept of sustainability into its business operations. The Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”), 

formed by the Group’s senior management, works closely with the Board to establish the Group’s sustainability objectives, strategy 

and performance. The Board plays a significant role in identifying sustainability factors that are material to the Group’s business, and 

the feedback from stakeholders also help in the process of sustainability reporting. The sustainability factors are being managed and 

monitored through the cooperation between the Board and the management.

As an integrated service provider in logistics, real estate and financial services, the Group strives to establish the best sustainable 

practice within the industry while achieving a commercially successful business. The Group realises the importance of improving our 

sustainability performance in enhancing our competitiveness. We aim to make contributions to the environment, our employees, our 

business and the local communities by integrating sustainability approach in our operation.

The Board would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to our employees, customers and business partners for their 

continuous support over the past years. Looking forward, the Group will continue to achieve sustainable corporate development by 

implementing sustainable practices.

OUR

SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS

As a business that strives toward growth and development, we remain vigilant for emerging trends and developments that may 

present business opportunities. The changing business environment may offer opportunities for us to improve our sustainability 

performance, or sustainability opportunities may provide opportunities to improve our business performance. We are aware of the 

increasing importance of ESG factors among our stakeholders and the business landscape, and we aim to align our sustainability 

initiatives with our business strategy.

SUSTAINABILITY STEERING COMMITTEE

Sustainability at the Group is spearheaded by the SSC, which was formed by the Group’s senior management including the Chief 

Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Board works closely with SSC, whose role is to develop sustainability objectives 

and strategy, manage and monitor the overall sustainability performance, and report to the Board.

Achieving a high level of corporate governance is important to the Group. Hence, we have set in place a sustainability framework 

that will be reviewed by the SSC every year.

The SSC is supported by the Sustainability Task Force (“STF”), which is responsible for driving the sustainability programme across 

the organisation. The STF comprises members of the senior management teams from different business units across the Group.

GOVERNANCE

Vibrant Group strives to uphold good corporate governance practices to maintain trust from its stakeholders. The Group has 

developed a sound system of risk management and internal control to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, 

operational controls are adequate, and business risks are suitably protected. The audit committee of the Company (the “Audit 

Committee”) oversees and ensures that such a system has been appropriately implemented and monitored.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS

We recognise the importance of maintaining high standards of business integrity and complying with applicable laws and 

regulations, including relevant environmental laws and regulations. Thus, we have implemented measures to ensure that our 

employees comply with the Group’s policy and procedures. We have also put stringent monitoring and enforcement mechanisms 

in place to manage our economic, social and environmental performance. We provide related training to our employees to 

equip them with knowledge on compliance with laws and regulations to aspects including but not limited to anti-corruption, 

environmental emissions, employment, etc.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

As a corporation that upholds its business integrity, we have zero tolerance towards any forms of bribery and any forms of 

corruption. The Group has Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy. Other anti-corruption policies are also specified in the Code 

of Conduct and Corporate Policy on Exchange of Gifts. All employees are required to adhere to the policies strictly. The policies 

specify requirements in conducting business legally, ethically and with integrity.

In addition, a Whistle-blowing Policy has been put in place for employees to report their concerns about suspected fraud, 

corruption, dishonest practices, misconducts, or other similar matters. Employees are encouraged to report any suspicious 

practices or inappropriate activities and bring them immediately to the attention of the chairman or any member of the Audit 

Committee and/or the Board. Appropriate action will be taken if an employee is found guilty of fraud, dishonesty or criminal 

conduct in relation to his/her employment. It is also the Group’s policy to protect the identity of the whistleblower. The Group 

views any harassment or retaliation in any forms or manners against the whistleblower seriously, and has zero tolerance 

against victimisation of the whistleblower. Any acts of reprisal or victimisation of the whistleblower by members of the Group or 

management will result in disciplinary actions, including termination of employment.

During FY2021, there were neither any confirmed incidents of corruption or public legal cases regarding corruption brought against 

the Group, nor any termination of contracts with business partners due to violations related to corruption. Moreover, the Group did 

not identify any material non-compliance with relevant anti-corruption laws and regulations. We aim to maintain this trend for the 

forthcoming year.

More details of the Group’s corporate governance practices can be found in the “Corporate Governance Report” on pages 21 to 

39 of the Group’s Annual Report 2021.

ECONOMIC

Vibrant Group sees economic performance as a material factor as we believe our business economic viability is important to our 

stakeholders. We aim to attain sustainable economic growth to provide desirable returns to our shareholders annually.

To keep the Group abreast with the latest industrial information, the Group holds membership in industry associations such as the 

Singapore Logistics Association, the Singapore Business Federation, the Singapore Aircargo Agents Association, the International 

Air Transport Association, etc.

Our financial performance for FY2021 can be found in the Group’s Financial Highlights (pages 10 to 11) and Financial Statements 

section (pages 40 to 162) of the Annual Report 2021.

ENVIRONMENTAL

There is an increasing awareness of environmental issues such as climate change. As a global integrated logistics provider, 

Vibrant Group recognises the impacts of its business on the environment, especially the use of fossil fuels in vehicles and other 

resources consumed in our operation. The Group believes that environmentally friendly practices complement business efficiency 

and advocates corporate social responsibility towards the environment by incorporating these processes in its daily operations. 

As a socially responsible corporation, the Group strictly complies with related environmental regulations and all employees share 

responsibilities in monitoring the Group’s environmental performances. Employees are encouraged to report any suspected 

violation to the Group, and the management will look into the reported issues in a serious manner. In FY2021, the Group achieved 

the target of maintaining zero incidents of non-compliance with relevant environmental laws and regulations that would have a 

material impact on the Group. We aim to maintain the record of zero incidents for non-compliance for the forthcoming year.

EMISSION CONTROL

Realising the business nature of the Group incurs emissions, we strive to minimise our environmental impacts in our operations. 

We aim at reducing our emissions by introducing various practices and initiatives, while increasing our efficiency and lowering 

costs. We have implemented related environmental policies and initiatives, including but not limited to those listed below, to 

reduce the Group’s emissions:

• 

Conduct regular checks on our vehicles to ensure that they comply with environmental regulations as well as monitor our 

diesel consumption;

• 

Educate employees to turn off engines for idling vehicles; and

• 

Actively adopt other emission reduction measures which are described in the “Energy” section.

To echo with the global efforts in reducing Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions that lead to climate change, Vibrant Group 

has adopted a series of measures and initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Such measures and initiatives range from vehicle 

inspection to electricity conservation. Please refer to the section “Energy” for more details regarding energy conservation initiatives.

The Group’s major sources of GHG emissions were originated from fuel consumed by vehicles (Scope 1) and purchased electricity 

(Scope 2). In FY2021, we have achieved the target of maintaining or reducing our GHG intensities below FY2020’s level. There 

was a decrease in GHG intensity from both diesel and electricity consumption. We aim to maintain and reduce both Scope 1 and 

Scope 2 GHG intensities for the forthcoming year.

In FY2021, the Group’s total GHG emissions have decreased by about 15% when compared to FY2020. In particular, the GHG 

emissions intensity of diesel consumption (Scope 1) had decreased by about 18% from FY2020’s level to approximately 0.0014 

tCO2e per kilometres travelled in FY2021; while the GHG emissions intensity from electricity consumption (Scope 2) has decreased 

by about 13% from FY2020’s level1 to approximately 0.0131 tCO2e per square meter in FY2021. The following graphs show the 

GHG performances of Vibrant Group in FY2021 and FY2020.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

The Group is committed to handling and disposing of all wastes generated by our business activities in a proper manner, and 

strives to minimise the environmental impact during the waste management process.

The general wastes are centrally collected and disposed of, and we assign designated staff to check the waste collection area 

regularly to ensure the tidiness of the surroundings. We also encourage employees to conduct waste separation at the source and 

develop the habit of waste recycling as a daily practice by placing recycling bins in accessible areas to encourage recycling.

Regarding hazardous wastes, the Group has established the Chemical Safety Policy to govern the use, storage of chemicals, 

and disposal of such wastes. Chemical wastes must be disposed of in accordance with prevailing regulatory requirements and 

accumulation of wastes must be avoided. All hazardous wastes are required to be labelled clearly according to national and 

international codes. We engaged licensed treaters and disposers in handling hazardous wastes. Regular training is also conducted 

to ensure the competency of our staff in handling hazardous wastes and the latest legal requirements concerning regulated 

substances.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

V I B R A N T  G R O U P  L I M I T E D

12




ENVIRONMENTAL

In addition to the above measures, the Chemical Safety Policy has also stated the best practices for the use, storage, and disposal 

of chemicals in the workplace. Each warehouse is subjected to regular inspections, via an inspection or audit programme by the 

safety committee and if necessary, by the Office of Health, Safety and Environment (“HSE”). Emergency action plans concerning 

any accidental release of hazardous wastes, and responding to chemical incidents such as fires, spills, and explosions are also 

required to be established. All incidents shall be reported to the safety committee and HSE and subsequently be investigated by 

higher management to minimise the recurrence. We also conducted regular drills and training for employees to educate them on 

the appropriate mitigation measures to be taken in case of any accidental spillage.

We aim to support these initiatives by systematically recording environmental incidents such as spills as well as maintaining 

appropriate approvals for the handling of hazardous chemicals. We had achieved the target set in FY2020, for which there were 

zero spills recorded in FY2021. We aim to continue achieving this target in the forthcoming year.

ENERGY MANAGEMENT

The Group is committed to reducing energy consumption and ensuring energy efficiency in our business activities. Related 

energy management plans and measures have been developed as one of the Group’s fundamental policies to strive for energy 

conservation and efficiency. The Group has developed energy objectives and targets to continuously enhance the Group’s energy 

consumption performance and hence reduce our GHG emissions in an effective manner. The usage of electricity, fuel and other 

materials is regularly monitored. Unexpected high consumption of such resources will be investigated to find out the root cause 

and corresponding preventative measures will be taken when deemed necessary.

Given our business nature, the energy consumption is mainly the consumption of fuels for vehicles and purchased electricity for 

our operation. The Group has introduced various measures and initiatives to achieve the goal of electricity saving and efficient 

consumption. Such measures and initiatives include but are not limited to the following:

• 

Explore energy efficient technologies to implement in operations;

• 

Use of technology to track and control direct energy usage, for example, use of diesel in vehicle fleet;

• 

Achieve transparency by enhancing data quality; and

• 

Promote effective environmental management among suppliers and external contractors.

The Group is committed to strictly executing the measurement and tracking the effectiveness of the above policies and initiatives. 

When comparing FY2021 to FY2020, we reduced our electricity intensity and diesel intensity by about 10% and 19% respectively. 

As a result, we achieved FY2020’s target of maintaining or reducing both our electricity intensity and diesel intensity. Our target 

for FY2022 will be to maintain or reduce our electricity and diesel intensities below FY2021’s level. The following graphs show the 

electricity and diesel performances of Vibrant Group in FY2021 and FY2020.

WATER MANAGEMENT

The water consumed by the Group was mainly domestic water in office areas and warehouses. The Group has adopted a wide 

range of water conservation measures to reduce water consumption. Apart from encouraging all employees and customers to 

develop the habit of conserving water consciously, the Group has also been strengthening our water-saving promotion, posting 

water-saving slogans and educating employees to use water reasonably.

During FY2021, the Group had consumed approximately 13.52 megalitres of water with an intensity of approximately 79 litres per 

square meter. The water consumption in FY2020 was approximately 22.49 megalitres with an intensity of approximately 135[4] litres 

per square meter. As the Group has adopted an array of water-saving practices, the intensity in FY2021 has decreased by about 

41% below FY2020’s level. No water was withdrawn from the area with water stress. The Group will continue to strive our best in 

maintaining the water consumption intensity for the forthcoming year.

SOCIAL

Socioeconomic compliance is one of the key factors for the Group to fulfil its corporate social responsibility. The management 

of the Group regularly reviews the business activities, sets up clear policies and procedures in advance to prevent potential 

infringement of related laws and regulations. Employees are also encouraged to report suspected cases of violation in any 

laws and regulations. In FY2021, there were zero incidents of non-compliance with relevant material socio-economic laws and 

regulations, and we aim to maintain this trend for the forthcoming year.

EMPLOYMENT

We recognise that human capital is the backbone in supporting the development of the Group. Our employees are involved in 

warehouse operations and management as well as the processing and distribution of shipments and goods. Their skills and 

expertise are vital to our business success. Thus, attracting and retaining talent are part of Vibrant Group’s strategy for ensuring 

sustainable growth for our business.

The Group adopts a people-oriented management approach and realises the full potentials of our employees. The Group has 

formally established the Employee Handbook, covering the aspects of recruitment, compensation, promotion, working hours and 

rest periods, diversity and equal opportunity, etc. The Group reviews the Employee Handbook and its employment practices on a 

periodic basis to ensure continuous improvements of the employment standards and compliance with relevant employment laws 

and regulations.

Apart from the employment policies, the remuneration committee is also established to review and recommend the general 

framework of remuneration policies to the Board. The remuneration committee is also responsible for reviewing and recommending 

the Board for the specific remuneration packages for key management personnel and directors. Key terms of references can be 

found in the Group’s Annual Report.

In FY2021, Vibrant Group’s governance bodies consisted of 5 males aged over 50. There were 389 employees at the Group in 

respect to the Reporting scope. The following graphs show the age and gender diversity of employees of the Group.

RECRUITMENT AND REMUNERATION

The Group applies transparent recruitment processes based on merit, grades and relevant skills for the position and potential to 

fulfil the Group’s current and future needs. We have formulated related employment policies in governing the recruitment process 

and strictly comply with the employment legislation in Singapore.

Employees are the most important resources and play a critical role in the overall success of the Group. We believe high talent 

retention creates a positive work environment, and helps strengthen employees’ commitment to the organisation. Therefore, we 

offer competitive remuneration packages for our employees. Our full-time employees enjoy benefits including health care coverage; 

bus transport scheme; gift voucher for staff with newborn babies; insurances including but not limited to business travel insurance, 

work injury compensation insurance, group hospital and surgical insurance. Full-time employees are also entitled to different leave 

types, such as annual leave, parental leave, medical and hospitalisation leave, national service leave, etc. Retirement provision is 

also eligible for employees at the directorial level. Apart from benefits provided to full-time employees, we also provide sufficient 

benefit coverage to our part-time employees.

In addition to the above, the Group also recognises the importance of maintaining employee’s well-being, and stresses heavily on 

creating a work-life balanced lifestyle for our employees. Due to Covid-19 social distancing measures, social events were limited to 

adhere to Covid-19 safe management measures in the workplace.

During FY2021, 6 employees (1 female, 5 males) had taken parental leave and 5 of them (5 males) had returned to work after the 

leave ended. There were 2 employees who returned to work after the parental leave had ended in FY2020, and they were all still 

employed in FY2021. The retention rate of employees that took parental leave was 29%.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

Vibrant Group recognises the value of a diverse and skilled workforce and endeavours to create an inclusive and collaborative 

workplace culture in which all can thrive. The Group has formulated policies including the Remuneration Policy, Staff Welfare and 

Benefit Policy, and Employment Code of Conduct which aim at achieving diversity and equal opportunity at Vibrant Group.

We are committed to promoting a diverse workforce and maintaining a discrimination-free work environment. The Group is 

dedicated to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and embraces diversity and inclusivity regardless of race, 

religion, gender, age, nationality, family status, and marital status. This covers all aspects of employment, including selection, 

job assignment, compensation, discipline, termination, and access to benefits and training. We respect and permit clothing and 

accessories that are dictated by religious beliefs, ethnicity or disability.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

At Vibrant Group, we aim to provide opportunities for employees to not only learn and grow, but also support them in developing 

talent and ability that meet their current and further job needs. Therefore, we have developed a variety of training and development 

programmes for our employees as part of our sustainability strategy.

Our employees are encouraged to participate in a wide range of relevant learning and development programmes. During FY2021, 

our employees received an average of 3.1 hours of training per employee, and we intend to provide our employees with more 

opportunities for training in the forthcoming year. The Group also provides training sponsorship for our employees in order to 

encourage them to attend courses that are relevant to their job.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

At Vibrant Group, we regard health and safety as a top priority and see this as an essential part of our business. We strive to 

prioritise the health and safety of our employees, customers, third-party service providers and visitors. We realise the essentiality 

of maintaining a safe working environment at all of our facilities, therefore we have set in place different health and safety policies. 

Such policies include but are not limited to Personal Protective Equipment Policy, Safety Belt Policy, Drug and Alcohol Policy. We 

have also enforced the Health, Safety, Security and Environment (“HSSE”) Policy in the workplace to demonstrate our commitment 

to ensuring that health and safety at work is paramount to our business that protects the health, safety and security of our 

employees, property and the public from the risk of harm.

Apart from formulating policies, we also require employees to adopt a series of health and safety measures, which includes 

the safe use of vehicles and equipment, and the safe handling of hazardous chemicals to prevent injuries and loss of life. We 

constantly highlight the importance of a safe working environment to our employees by providing safety tips regularly. We also 

adopt a systematic approach to manage to health and safety, taking into consideration training, communication, safety at work 

sites, security operations and audits. The following table summarises the initiatives and practices that we have implemented with 

regard to the health and safety of our employees and other stakeholders.

Initiatives and Measures

Details

Safety measures

• 

Conduct safety audit(s) and inspections at all facilities to identify key areas and take 

preventive measures when necessary;

• 

Re-examine existing health and safety policies, ensure well-implementation and 

continued relevance; and

• 

Ensure responsible usage of chemicals and transparency on the substances used in 

premises.

Employee well-being

• 

Employee wellness plan including outpatient medical coverage, regular medical 

check-ups, workplace inspections, advice and treatments.

In view of the Covid-19 outbreak, the Group remains highly vigilant to the potential impact of health and safety on both its 

employees and customers. The Group has reminded employees of the importance of maintaining personal hygiene and 

implemented safe management measures such as regular cleaning of common spaces and demarcating safe physical distancing. 

For its employees and customers, the Group required that their temperature be taken before entering the Group’s premises, they 

were also required to wear a facial mask at all times. The Group has also imposed measures to avoid the spreading of Covid-19, 

such as providing alcohol-based hand sanitisers to everyone entering the Group’s premises.

The total number of hours worked in FY2021 was 5,827,258 hours. No workplace fatalities and high-consequence work-related 

injuries were recorded during FY2021, yet there were 2 lost-time injuries at Vibrant Group, which resulted in a 0.34 lost time injury 

rate. All such work-related injuries were investigated and analysed to identify and record occurrence time, place, sequence of 

events and casualties.

Based on the findings, the Group took corrective actions including more frequent equipment inspections, updating safety operating 

procedures, strengthening staff training and replacing or installing protective equipment.

The target of maintaining or reducing the lost time injury rate of 0.16 has yet to be achieved. We have achieved the target of 

achieving zero incidents of non-compliance resulting in regulatory breaches related to relevant health and safety legislation. Our 

target for FY2022 will be to maintain or reduce the lost time injury rate of 0.16 and to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance 

resulting in regulatory breaches related to relevant health and safety legislation.

CUSTOMER PRIVACY

The Group has established the following policies and standards for preventing the loss or mishandling of customer data such 

as the information technology (“IT”) security management approach to protect business and personal data against unauthorised 

access:

• 

Introducing the Internal Data Protection Policy that governs the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal data;

• 

Abiding by the employee code of conduct for the use of personal data;

• 

Complying with privacy and information security law and regulatory requirements; and

and personal data will be documented. We also plan to disseminate information on data privacy requirements to key stakeholders.

In addition to the above measures and initiatives, the Group has reminded employees to familiarise themselves with the PDPA and 

how it applies to the collection, use and disclosure of National Registration Identity Card (“NRIC”) and other national identification 

numbers.

During FY2021, the Group has achieved the target of maintaining zero breaches and substantiated complaints of customer privacy 

and losses of data, and we aim to maintain this record for the forthcoming year.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Vibrant Group has long been committed to acting for the betterment of the community and has always been sensitive to the needs 

of the underprivileged. Each year, the Group carefully selects our voluntary service or donation partners that align with the Group’s 

vision and ensures that the Group’s resources can be effectively allocated to people in dire need of assistance. Due to Covid-19 

social distancing measures, volunteering works were limited to adhere to Covid-19 safe management measures in the workplace.

Safety, sustainability, social responsibility and service are the 4 pillars of our chemical storage and logistics business. The Group 

had an outstanding performance in the Singapore Chemical Industry Council (“SCIC”) Responsible Care Awards. We received 

the Gold Award in the Distribution Code and the Employee Health and Safety Code, as well as the Achievement Award in the 

Community Awareness and Emergency Response Code. The Group shall continue to uphold its commitment to community 

awareness and will continue to seek more opportunities to give back to the society.
