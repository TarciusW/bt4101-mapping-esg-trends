CEO’S MESSAGE 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

 

As you may be aware, since May 2018, Hyflux has been undergoing a 

voluntary court-supervised reorganisation process to restructure our 

liabilities. It has been a long and difficult journey considering the large 

number of stakeholders involved as well as the complexity that our business 

and operations are in. Despite these complications which led to operational 

changes in our businesses, we assure our stakeholders that we remain 

committed to our responsibilities in corporate stewardship. 

 

Throughout this financial restructuring process and the challenges it has 

presented, the Hyflux Board of Directors and management spared no efforts 

in reviewing health and safety processes as well as refining sustainable 

practices for our business operations in Singapore and at our overseas 

plants. We continue to place emphasis on consistency in our Environmental, 

Social and Governmental (ESG) practices in our ongoing projects, such as 

the TuasOne Waste-To-Energy (WTE) Plant in Singapore, to ensure 

efficient and fair practices.  We would like to extend our sincere gratitude 

to our people, our most valuable asset, who continuously support the 

company and are instrumental in keeping the ship intact. Their unwavering 

resilience have been crucial in keeping Hyflux running in this difficult time. 

Needless to say, the safety of our colleagues is always our top priority and 

2018 again marked another year where we achieved zero fatalities at our 

construction sites and operations worldwide. To stay accident-free, we seek 

to reinforce health and safety measures at our plants and operation sites 

by ensuring that our colleagues attend refresher trainings and safety 

courses regularly. 

 

Hyflux has always taken our role as a responsible corporate citizen 

seriously by delivering environmental solutions for the past three decades. 

This is at the core of what we stand for even during our financial 

reorganisation exercise.  We thank you for your patience as we work 

through our reorganisation process and are extremely grateful for your 

support during this period.    

 

 

Ms Olivia Lum 

Executive Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer

Singspring Desalination Plant, Singapore 

 

The SingSpring Desalination Plant at Tuas is Singapore’s first seawater 

desalination plant and it meets approximately 10% of the nation’s water 

needs. Under a 20-year build-own-operate arrangement with PUB, the plant 

produces 136,380 million cubic metres per day (m3/day) of potable water, 

enough to fill about 55 Olympic size swimming pools. It adopts reverse 

osmosis technology with semi-permeable membranes. The plant was one of 

PUB’s pioneering public-private partnership initiatives and was completed 

three months ahead of schedule in September 2005. The project financing 

deal was awarded the Euromoney Asia Pacific Water Deal of the Year in 

2003. This award set a new benchmark in terms of scope as well as 

complexity of execution in the growing market of privately financed water 

projects. It also won Distinction at the Global Water Awards 2006. 

 

Tuaspring Integrated Water &amp; Power Project (IWPP), Singapore1 

 

The Tuaspring IWPP is Singapore’s second and largest seawater 

desalination plant. It is Asia’s first IWPP, with desalination capacity of 

318,500 m3/day and an on-site 411 megawatt (MW) combined cycle gas 

turbine power plant to supply power to the desalination plant and to the 

National Electricity Market of Singapore. Together with the SingSpring 

Desalination Plant, it can meet up to 25% of the country’s water needs. It 

won Distinction at the Global Water Awards 2014.  

 

Magtaa Desalination Plant, Algeria  

 

With a designed capacity of 500,000 m3/day, the project is one of the 

world’s largest ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis desalination plants. The 

Group won the bid amidst intense global competition with top international 

players shortly after winning the 200,000 m3/day Souk Tleta desalination 

project in October 2006.  

 

 

 

1 Updates on restructuring: Tuaspring IWPP has been served with a notice of termination of the Water Purchase 

Agreement by the Public Utilities Board (PUB) on 17 April 2019  

Please refer to SGX Announcement on the Termination Notice from the PUB:

This landmark win has helped the Group surge ahead in the global water 

landscape. It has won the Global Water Intelligence (GWI) Commendation 

Award for Desalination Deal of the Year in 2010 and the GWI Commendation 

Award for Desalination Plant of the Year in 2015. 

 

Souk Tleta Desalination Plant, Algeria 

 

The Souk Tleta Desalination Plant is a joint venture project with Malakoff 

AlDjazair Desal Sdn Bhd and Algerian Energy Company, the state-owned 

company handling power and water privatisation exercises in Algeria. It 

marks the Group’s entry into the water treatment market in Algeria and the 

Middle East North Africa region.  

The plant, which is situated just 50 m from the coast, produces water for 

both the state-owned water entity and national oil company of Algeria.  

 

Tianjin Dagang Desalination Plant, People’s Republic of China 

(PRC) 

 

The Tianjin Dagang Desalination Plant is the largest membrane-based 

seawater desalination plant in the PRC and one of the world’s most northern 

large-scale desalination plants. It utilises the Group’s proprietary Kristal® 

polymeric ultrafiltration membranes for the pre-treatment process, and a 

double-pass reverse osmosis process, to produce water for Tianjin’s 

petrochemical industries. 

Sited next to the existing Dagang power plant, the Tianjin Dagang 

Desalination Plant derives its feed water from the cooling water discharge 

of the power plant. With the intake water being 5°C warmer than the ambient 

temperature, lower osmotic pressure is required during the treatment 

process, resulting in lower energy consumption and higher efficiency levels. 

The modular design of the plant allows for easy capacity expansion to meet 

any increase in demand for water. 

 

PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT/ TESTING AND 

COMMISSIONING

 

Qurayyat Independent Water Project (IWP), Sultanate of Oman  

 

The Group was formally awarded the project from the Oman Power and 

Water Procurement Company (OPWP) following intense global competition. 

Qurayyat IWP employs reverse osmosis technology and has a designed 

capacity of 200,000 m3/day. Upon completing the final stages of testing and 


8 

 

commissioning, desalinated water from the plant will be supplied to OPWP 

under a 20-year water purchase agreement, during which Hyflux will also 

provide O&amp;M services to the plant.  

 

TuasOne Waste-To-Energy (WTE), Singapore 

 

TuasOne WTE Plant, scheduled for completion in 2021, is Singapore’s sixth 

and largest WTE plant. Designed to process 3,600 tonnes of waste per day 

and generate 120 MW of clean and renewable electricity, the TuasOne WTE 

Plant will have one of the best land utilisation factors in terms of incineration 

capacity per unit floor area and will also be one of the most efficient in terms 

of energy recovery per unit waste incinerated in the world. For more 

information on environment impact reduction, please refer to page 19. 

 

 

Ain Sokhna Integrated Water &amp; Power Project (IWPP), Egypt  

 

Commissioned by the General Authority for the Suez Canal Economic Zone 

(SCZone), the plant is designed to produce 150,000 m3 of desalinated water 

per day and generate 457 MW of power when completed. Contract 

negotiations for the project are ongoing.

OUR ENVIRONMENT  

 

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW 

 

As a global provider of sustainable solutions, managing the environmental 

impact of our activities and operations is an integral part of our business 

processes. We are committed to reducing our environmental impact through 

compliance with applicable environmental obligations, preventing pollution, 

reducing waste and continually improving our environmental performance. 

Hyflux exercises a precautionary approach in managing its environmental 

impact. Data in this sustainability report covers: 

 

1. O&amp;M projects (power and desalination plants): Tuaspring IWPP 

(Singapore), SingSpring Desalination Plant (Singapore) and Tianjin 

Dagang Desalination Plant (China)  

2. EPC projects: TuasOne WTE Project (Singapore) in construction 

phase and Qurayyat IWP (Oman) in testing and commissioning phase 

3. Corporate offices in Singapore: Hyflux Innovation Centre, Hyflux 

Building and Tuas Manufacturing Hub  

 

ISO 14001 guidelines on environmental management systems govern all of 

Hyflux’s operations, and all construction sites are ISO 14001 certified. 

Before the commencement of any construction project, all necessary due-

diligence in the form of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and /or 

Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessments (ESHIA) are carried 

out. Close monitoring and follow-ups are conducted throughout the 

construction phase until project completion.  

 

WATER USE AND REDUCTION [Disclosure 303 – 1] 

 

The Group’s core business is in water treatment solutions. We are 

committed to providing clean and stable supplies of water to communities 

around the world.  

Performance 

 

In FY2018, total water withdrawal at our desalination plants, EPC projects, 

and corporate offices was 543 million m3. More than 99% of total water 


15 

 

withdrawal was from surface water3 which was used for our desalination and 

power plant operations4. Approximately 40% of the seawater withdrawn for 

desalination was recovered through the reverse osmosis process.  

The overall increase in water withdrawal in 2018 as compared to 2017 was 

attributed to higher water usage at the Qurayyat IWP as the plant moves 

towards its final stages of testing and commissioning for full operational 

capabilities. Additionally, more water was utilised in line with increased  

construction activities at TuasOne WTE. 

 

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE  

[Disclosure 302 – 1, 305 – 1, 305 – 2] 

 

Hyflux’s energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions emanate 

primarily from our desalination and power plant operations, as well as our 

construction projects. 

 

Performance – Energy Consumption 

 

In FY2018, Hyflux’s total energy consumption was 1.65 million gigajoules 

(GJ) compared to 1.34 million GJ in FY2017.  

 

Electricity used for desalination and power operations amounted to 

approximately 71% of Hyflux’s total energy consumption. Diesel and fuel oil 

 

3 Surface water includes water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans 

4 Desalination and power plant operations refer to data from Hyflux’s O&amp;M Projects: Tuaspring IWPP 

(Singapore), SingSpring Desalination Plant (Singapore) and Tianjin Dagang Desalination Plant 

(China)

used to operate generators and cranes at our construction projects 

accounted for approximately 28% of total energy consumption, while 

operations at corporate facilities made up the rest. Total energy 

consumption from FY2017 to FY2018 increased about 23% due to increased 

construction activities at TuasOne WTE as well as testing and 

commissioning activities carried out at Qurayyat IWP. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Given the high energy requirement of desalination activities, Hyflux has 

constantly invested in new technologies and equipment to improve energy 

efficiency of our plants. This is evident from the lower electricity 

consumption per m3 of desalinated water produced by our newer plants as 

compared to our older plants.

Compliance with Mandatory Energy Management Practices 

 

Since 2014, Hyflux’s two desalination plants in Singapore, the Singspring 

Desalination Plant and Tuaspring IWPP, have been in full compliance with 

the National Environmental Agency’s (NEA) Energy Conservation Act. As 

per the requirements of the act, we report the energy use of the plants 

periodically and submit an annual Energy Efficiency Improvement Plan for 

each plant. We also appointed an internal representative from the company 

to monitor the operations in both plants to meet the compliance 

requirements under NEA regulations. 

 

Other energy saving measures such as steam turbine condenser 

optimisation equipment (among others) were implemented to improve 

energy consumption across our plants. Such energy management initiatives 

are part of our continuous pursuit of resource efficient solutions.  

Energy Management at Hyflux Innovation Centre  

 

Recognised for its model of innovative environmental design and 

construction, Hyflux Innovation Centre received the BCA Green Mark 

Platinum Award in FY2012. The building features environmentally 

sustainable 

designs 

such 

as 

a 

solar-powered 

gym 

and 

a grey 

water recycling system that utilises Hyflux’s proprietary Kristal® polymeric 

ultrafiltration membranes. There is also extensive usage of environmentally-

friendly and sustainable materials within the development.  

These innovative measures meet the stringent criteria set by the Building 

and Construction Authority of Singapore and has helped to lower energy 

consumption 

by 

approximately 

30% 

and 

conserve 

about 

15.6 

million litres of water a year.  

For energy saving purposes, all common areas such as lift landings are also 

fitted with motion sensor lighting. 

 

Performance – Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

 

Scope 1 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions generated per megawatt hour 

(MWh) of electricity remained at approximately 0.37 tonnes in FY2017 and 

FY2018. 

 

 

 

 

 

 


18 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A significant proportion of GHG emissions in the Group can be attributed to 

the combustion of natural gas and diesel used to generate electricity at the 

Tuaspring Power Plant. Hyflux generated about 778.6 thousand tonnes of 

Scope 1 GHG emissions in FY20185, a 4.2% increase from FY2017 in line 

with the production of more electricity. The level of emissions is in line with 

industry standards. 

Scope 

2 

GHG 

emissions 

from 

electricity 

consumption 

increased 

approximately 34.6% from approximately 143.4 thousand tonnes in FY2017 

to approximately 192.9 thousand tonnes of carbon dioxide in FY2018. The 

increase is attributed to the increase in desalination operations and 

construction activities in FY2018.

Ensuring Proper Discharge of Air Emissions 

 

The plant will have a dedicated flue gas treatment system to ensure that air 

emissions discharged comply with the more stringent Environmental 

Protection &amp; Management (Air Impurities) Regulations that were implemented 

on 1 June 2015. The tighter emission standards mandated by Singapore’s 

National Environmental Agency include a new daily site-average limit for 

sulphur dioxide (SO2), aimed at regulating SO2 emissions from combustion 

sources. 

 

The main processes encompassed by the flue gas treatment system are:  

• 

Selective non-catalytic reduction to reduce NOx concentration in the 

flue gas 

• 

Dry catalytic fabric filter system to remove dust particles, acidic and 

other gaseous pollutants 

 

Minimising the Environmental Impact of Construction  

 

Environmental Control Measures are in place to ensure silted water runoff from 

the construction site are treated before being discharged into the public 

drainage system. Monitored by real-time CCTV cameras located near the 

discharge outlets, alerts will be triggered when muddy flows are captured. This 

is to ensure compliance with the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) standard for 

discharges.

AIR EMISSIONS [Disclosure 305 – 7] 

  

Hyflux’s nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions are carefully 

managed across our operations worldwide. We aim to meet all regulatory 

standards in the jurisdictions in which our plants operate and strive to achieve 

international best practice.  

NOx emissions 6  increased to approximately 400 tonnes in FY2018 from 

approximately 310.3 tonnes in FY2017. This increase is primarily due to a higher 

output of electricity. Similarly, SO2 emissions also saw an increase to 1.3 tonnes 

in FY2018.  

 

Compliance with Mandatory Air Emissions Limits 

 

Source emissions tests are conducted annually at the Tuaspring Power 

Plant to determine the concentration levels of particulate mass (PM), 

nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulphur dioxide (SO2).  

The emissions from the plant are in strict compliance with regulatory limits 

stipulated in the Environmental Protection and Management Act, EPMA 

2008 (Air Impurities) Regulations 2001.  

 

WASTE AND EFFLUENTS [Disclosure 306-2] 

 

Desalination Operations 

 

Large volumes of seawater are used in Hyflux’s reverse osmosis 

desalination plants to produce potable water. High-concentration brine and 

backwash wastewater, by-products of desalination, are discharged back 

into the sea. Before release, online analysers installed in the outfall pipe 

measure discharge flow rate, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity, free 

chlorine, 

temperature 

and 

pH. 

These 

parameters 

are 

monitored 

continuously by a SCADA7 system to ensure they fall within allowable limits.  

 

Samples are also sent regularly to external consultants to measure 

suspended solids and chlorine levels, ensuring all parameters are within 

regulatory allowance limits. In Singapore, all parameters listed in NEA water 

quality standards of Trade Effluent Discharge to Watercourse are also 

tested in accordance with regulatory allowable limits. 

 

 

 

6 Air emissions data is based on measurements made at the Tuaspring Power Plant 

7 SCADA refers to supervisory control and data acquisition, a computer system used for gathering and analysing 

real time data 


21 

 

Construction Projects 

 

The main types of waste generated at Hyflux’s construction projects include 

scrap metal, wood and small amounts of boiler slag. In addition, some waste 

such as ash, soil and sludge wastes are collected and treated before being 

sent to landfills. Non-hazardous waste generated decreased from 

approximately 2,936 tonnes in FY2017 to approximately 2,110 tonnes in 

FY2018, mainly due to the completion of construction activities at the 

Qurayyat IWP as the plant entered the final testing and commission stages. 

 

Corporate Facilities 

 

Hyflux’s corporate facilities produce mainly domestic and municipal waste, 

which we work with local municipalities to recycle. Non-recyclable waste is 

treated and disposed of according to local regulatory requirements.

GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT  

 

COMPLIANCE [Disclosure 102-18] 

 

Hyflux champions for policies that advocate good corporate governance. 

We believe that achieving high standards of corporate governance and 

processes will help enhance the Group’s effectiveness and ensure the 

appropriate degree of accountability and transparency to increase long-term 

value. Hyflux adheres to the principles and guidelines of the Singapore 

Code of Corporate Governance issued by the Monetary Authority of 

Singapore and believes that this forms a sound platform for supporting good 

corporate governance practices.  

 

Sustainability Governance Structure 

 

 

 

 

The Board is the Company’s highest governance body that provides general 

oversight of the Group’s activities and is collectively responsible for the 

Group’s overall strategic direction. The Board provides leadership and 

guidance on corporate strategies, risk policies, corporate governance, 

business directions and performance objectives. To ensure each aspect is 

well taken care of, the Board delegates specific functions to various 

Committees, namely, Audit Committee (AC), Nominating Committee, 

Remuneration Committee, Risk Management Committee (RMC) and

Investment Committee. These Board Committees function within clearly 

defined terms of reference, which are reviewed on a regular basis. The 

Board is updated on developments around sustainability and has reviewed 

Hyflux’s material environmental, social and governance issues 

The Board of Directors were also proactive in advising the management 

team to kickstart a voluntary court-supervised financial reorganisation 

process in May 2018 by filing for a statutory moratorium under Section 

211(B) of the Companies Act for five of its entities, in order to preserve 

value for stakeholders.  

 

RISK MANAGEMENT [Disclosure 102-11] 

 

The Board recognises the importance of maintaining a sound system of risk 

management and internal control to safeguard stakeholders’ interests and 

the Group’s assets, and to manage risks. The AC and the RMC oversee and 

ensure that such a system is appropriately implemented and monitored.  

The risk management and internal control processes framework are 

intended to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material 

misstatements or loss, to safeguard assets and maintenance of proper 

accounting records, reliability of financial information, compliance with 

appropriate 

legislations, 

regulations 

and 

best 

practices, 

and 

the 

identification and containment of business risks. 

The RMC framework consists of five Directors and its primary functions are: 

 

 





To review with management and sometimes with external consultants on areas of risk 

that may affect the viability and smooth operations of the Group, as well as 

management's risk mitigation efforts.





To direct and work with management to develop and review policies and processes to 

address and manage identified areas of risk in a systematic and structured manner.





To make recommendations to the Board in relation to business risks that may affect 

the Group, as and when these may arise.


24 

 

FAIR AND ETHICAL OPERATING PRACTICES  

[Disclosure 102-16, 102-17] 

 

Code of Ethics and Conduct  

 

The Group has an internal Code of Ethics and Conduct in place that covers 

aspects such as anti-corruption and bribery, securities purchase guidelines 

and conflict of interest. The code which is readily accessible through 

Hyflux’s intranet requires all employees to conduct business legally, fairly 

and with integrity in order to ensure high standards of business integrity 

and compliance with relevant regulations. 

 

Anti-Corruption and Bribery 

 

Hyflux adopts a zero-tolerance policy towards bribery and corruption and is 

committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our 

business dealings and relationships. The Group has a worldwide policy on 

bribery and prevention of corruption in which any act of giving or accepting 

gratification to or from third parties is prohibited. Risk assessments are 

conducted across the Group as part of the annual internal audit programme 

to ensure compliance. 

 

An Ethics and Ethical Behaviour course is conducted annually by the 

Internal Audit department to ensure that employees are aware of the 

common ethical risks and the consequences associated with such actions. 

During the training, employees engage in group discussions on case studies 

and scenarios that pose ethical risks to reinforce the importance of ethical 

behaviour. In addition, reviews on internal procedures and policies are also 

done periodically to ensure adequate controls are in place. A presentation 

was also made to the Risk Management Committee in October 2018 on the 

existing policies and trainings relating to anti-corruption, and the reporting 

procedures that is in place. 

 

 

Whistle-Blowing Policy 

 

Hyflux’s confidential communication programme encourages employees to 

promptly report a breach or suspected breach of a law, regulation, company 

policy or other alleged irregularities without fear of reprisals, provided such 

concerns are not raised in bad faith. 

The policy is made available to all employees on Hyflux’s intranet and 

allows concerns to be raised to their line manager, management or various 


25 

 

Audit Committee members in confidence. Reports on any concerns will be 

submitted by the Internal Audit department to the Audit Committee Members.  

 

SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT [Disclosure 102-9] 

 

The Group acknowledges the importance and impact of sustainable 

procurement on the organisation, society and the environment. As part of 

our sustainable supply chain management, Hyflux has in place a 

comprehensive process to work with business partners in our supply value 

chain in a fair and ethical manner, to procure equipment and material which 

comply with technical specifications in all our projects.  

 

Our Supply Chain 

 

Hyflux works with a broad range of local and foreign suppliers for the 

different segments of our businesses. The Group’s main suppliers consist 

of industrial component suppliers for our plants, raw material suppliers for 

production purposes, as well as contractors for general and specialised 

professional services in our projects.  

 

Hyflux periodically qualifies and appraises the suitability of our suppliers 

based on a supplier scorecard. Suppliers are assessed technically and 

commercially on their project track record, experience and quality among 

other evaluation criteria. The due diligence process may include financial 

audits, operational risk assessments, and visits to suppliers’ premises and 

reference project sites. Some of our partners do implement their own 

sustainability practices. In general, suppliers with ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and 

OHAS 18001 certifications are preferred. We monitor our suppliers’ and 

service providers’ compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contractual 

requirements, as well as their quality, human factors, and safety standards. 

To mitigate concentration risk and to ensure sustainable supply streams, 

Hyflux procures from a broad pool of suppliers and service providers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


26 

 

Supply Chain Updates During Moratorium [Disclosure 102-10] 

 

Since the start of our reorganisation exercise, we have been working closely 

with our financial advisers to assess the position of all suppliers within the 

context of our future cash flow needs and a future reorganisation plan 

involving all stakeholders, including affected and critical suppliers. As 

Hyflux procures from a broad pool of suppliers and service providers, our 

critical supply stream is continuously assessed to maintain a stable supply. 

We continue to work closely with our critical suppliers for equipment and 

materials to ensure the completion of our on-going projects, and day to day 

business operations. Hyflux continues to apply the same stringent 

standards in the assessment of quality and suitability of new suppliers 

during the moratorium.  

 

 

 


27 

 

OUR PEOPLE  

 

Hyflux believes the key to high staff morale and productivity is a safe and 

inclusive workplace for all. 

OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH 

 

 

Safety is a core value for Hyflux and we are strongly committed to keeping 

all our offices, plants and worksites safe and accident-free for our 

employees.  

 

Group Quality, Environmental, Health and Safety (QEHS) 

Policy  

 

The Group-wide QEHS policy is applied across all of Hyflux’s operations, 

services, products, activities and projects worldwide. The policy is reviewed 

annually and from FY2016, energy management was included when 

Tuaspring Power Plant was commissioned. The implementation of the policy 

ensures compliance with applicable quality, environmental, and health and 

safety legal requirements and regulations.   

 

How We Manage Safety 

 

The Group is committed to set and comply with its own health and safety 

standards across all operations, and business unit heads are responsible 

for ensuring health and safety management systems are implemented and 

complied with on the ground.  

QEHS objectives and performance are monitored and reviewed by the 

QEHS Management Committee. The Group seeks to make continuous 

safety improvements through the sharing of insights gathered from health 

and safety-related incidents and risks. 

QEHS Committee meetings are also held monthly at all sites for the project 

manager to communicate with key stakeholders on QEHS matters and for 

performance to be reported.  

 

Regular Audits and Certification 

 

In August 2018, Hyflux passed the annual BS OHSAS 18001:2007 

surveillance audit, a testimony of our full compliance with international 

standards for occupational health and safety. The bizSAFE Star certification 

was also awarded to Hyflux from the Singapore Workplace Safety and 

Health Council, recognising our sustained efforts towards promoting good 

workplace safety conditions. 


28 

 

Safe practices at all Hyflux’s plants and operations are implemented, 

practised, documented and improved. Regular audits by independent 

parties are conducted at all sites to evaluate the effectiveness and maturity 

level of Hyflux’s occupational safety and health management system. For 

example, in September 2018, Hyflux completed the Construction Safety 

Audit Scoring System (ConSass) conducted by an independent auditor at 

the TuasOne WTE Plant. Such evaluations are essential to help the Group 

better allocate resources to improve safety and health standards on its sites.  

 

Health and Safety Training for all Employees 

 

At Hyflux, we recognise the role employees play in workplace safety and 

the importance of instilling a culture of proactive individual involvement, 

personal accountability and continuous improvement amongst employees. 

Training for health and safety is an ongoing effort which includes day-to-

day safety sharing tips, workshops, toolbox sessions and masterclasses, to 

equip employees with relevant technical knowledge, safety awareness and 

Hyflux’s values for a safe working environment. Mandatory in-house QEHS 

management system training is also provided to all supervisory personnel 

for projects.  Contract workers and all new workplace staff also attend a 

QEHS induction training to ensure they are trained in proper safety 

practices before starting work. For employees engaged in high-risk work, 

monthly training sessions and refresher courses are conducted. 

At project sites, health and safety practices are reinforced in the following 

ways.  

• Weekly mass QEHS talk – QEHS officer communication and 

consultation with all at site 

• Monthly QEHS committee meeting – project manager communicates 

with representatives of all project stakeholders in resolving QEHS 

matters and grievances  

• Monthly QEHS committee inspection – QEHS inspection by project 

manager of all stakeholders’ on-site behaviour and facilities. Areas 

for improvement are identified.  

 

All staff on Hyflux sites are also made aware of Emergency Preparedness 

and Response procedures and evacuation plans in cases of non-routine 

incidents, accidents and emergency situations.

plants. Through emergency response drills and quizzes, employees are 

equipped with the relevant technical knowledge and safety awareness to 

respond swiftly to potential emergency scenarios. 

 

 

 

Formal Worker Representation  

 

All our employees at our EPC sites and Singapore corporate offices are 

represented in formal joint management-worker health and safety 

committees that monitor occupational health and safety issues.   

 

 








30 

 

Contractors  

 

Hyflux’s contractors are expected to align with the Group’s high 

expectations of workplace safety and health. To ensure compliance, certain 

conditions are stipulated and made known to all contractors during the pre-

contract stage.  

 

SAFETY PERFORMANCE [Disclosure 403-2] 

 

In FY2018, we have once again achieved zero fatalities across our 

construction sites and operations. 

 

Non-fatal workplace injuries in Singapore involved 25 male employees and 

0 female employee, resulting in a total of 401 lost man-days. Total number 

of man-hours worked was 4,649,998. In Algeria and Oman, three employees 

were involved in non-fatal workplace injuries resulting in 10 lost man-days. 

Total number of man-hours worked was 924,888.  

 

Of the injuries sustained, about 34.5% were lacerations, about 31% were 

due to contusions, and about 24.1% were fractures while chemical burns 

and faints accounted for the remaining injuries. 

 

In FY2018, for operations in Singapore, Algeria and Oman, Hyflux’s 

accident frequency rate (AFR) was 5.4 and 3.2 respectively.  The accident 

severity rate (ASR) which takes into account the number of lost man-days 

was 86.2 in Singapore and 10.8 in Algeria and Oman.  The Group’s overall 

AFR saw an increase from 1.1 to 5.1, while the Group’s overall ASR 

increased from 35.0 to 72.1 as a result of an increase in accidents reported 

at the Singapore sites where construction activities were at its peak.

OUR EMPLOYEES 

 

As of December 2018, Hyflux has 

over 1,600 employees based in our 

offices and sites worldwide. In two 

of 

our 

largest 

workforces 

worldwide, 27.7% of our employees 

in 

Singapore 

are 

in 

full-time 

permanent positions while 100% of 

our employees in China are in full-

time permanent positions. 

 

Diversity and Equal Opportunity 

 

In accordance with Fair Employment Practices espoused by the Tripartite 

Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), Hyflux 

provides equal employment opportunities regardless of gender or age. For 

instance, we have assigned female engineers to overseas projects in 

Algeria.  The Company also offers re-employment to employees who have 

reached retirement age. Hyflux’s commitment to progressive employment 

practices is further demonstrated by our involvement in the Human Capital 

Partnership with TAFEP and the Ministry of Manpower in Singapore which 

is geared towards enhancing local workforce competitiveness. 

 

Hyflux is also a participant in the Workforce Singapore Career Support 

Programme (CSP). The CSP encourages employers to offer suitable job 

opportunities to eligible Singaporean professionals, managers, executives 

and technicians who have been unemployed for at least six months, and to 

tap on the wealth of experience they bring to the workplace. Currently, we 

have four employees under this programme and will continue to leverage it 

as a channel for recruitment.

In Singapore, two out of four key management committee members are 

female, 36% of senior management employees and 8% of non-senior 

management employees are female. While we have strived to achieve 

gender diversity throughout our employee categories, the category of non-

executive employees is male-dominated as the jobscopes are physically-

intensive. These jobscopes include the construction work at our 

manufacturing plants and production lines, which are not traditional career 

choices for females.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW [Disclosure 404-3] 

 

Our people play a vital role in the development of Hyflux’s business. 

Performance appraisals are conducted annually at Hyflux to better 

understand our employees’ development. All corporate employees are 

evaluated by their managers and given feedback on their strengths and 

areas for improvement. Employees’ career progression, key performance 

indicators and rewards are also openly discussed and determined at this 

annual appraisal. A training needs analysis is also conducted to identify 

skill gaps so that employees can thereafter be provided with the suitable 

coaching and training sessions tailored to help improve their performance.  

 

LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT [Disclosure 404-1] 

 

Hyflux’s learning and development practices are based on ISO 9001 

standards. In FY2018, training hours per employee was approximately 16.1 

hours, meeting ISO’s target of 16 hours per employee. 

 

 

 

At Hyflux, we believe in nurturing the full potential of our employees, by 

providing opportunities to develop their careers and capabilities, regardless 

of age, gender or ethnicity through training courses, on-the-job training, job 

rotations, overseas postings and mentorship. An in-house training academy 

led by dedicated personnel manages the customised training needs of our 

employees.  

Courses in the following categories are made available to all corporate 

employees.

On top of the courses designed in-house, employees are also encouraged 

to attend courses organised by external organisations to continually 

improve their skills and capabilities relevant to their job scopes.    

 

 

Talent Acquisition  

 

In Singapore, Hyflux participates in the national effort to groom talents from 

the community and contribute to the progress of the economy. We have 

engaged in government initiatives such as the Singapore-Industry 

Scholarship (SgIS), Young Talent Programme Scholarship (YTP) and the 

SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme. Upon graduation, students from 

the SgIS Scholarship and YTP programme join Hyflux and undergo a 

rigorous management trainee programme, aimed at nurturing their 

leadership ability. The SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme is a work-

learn programme to support fresh graduates’ transition into the workforce 

where participants are trained in industry-relevant skills through an 18-

month job attachment. In total, more than 10 employees were recruited 

through these programmes and initiatives. 

 

 

Talent Retention  

 

With global operations spanning the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and 

Asia, 

Hyflux 

encourages 

Singapore-based 

employees 

to 

move 

geographically to gain a deeper understanding of overseas markets, 

develop their leadership capabilities and foster global mindsets.  

With an aim to create a pipeline of talent, we encourage our people to take 

on overseas work opportunities where applicable and equip them with skills 

ranging from business and in-market knowledge to better understanding of 

cultural and language nuances. We also encourage job rotation within 

different business units to widen our employees’ work experience and offer 

growth as well as career progression. 

 

Other than introducing Flexible Work Arrangement which enables 

employees to achieve greater work-life balance and better productivity, we 

have also enhanced our employees’ benefits such as the introduction of 

birthday leave and improvement of several entitlements. 

 

 

 


35 

 

Welfare 

 

Hyflux’s employee policies, including leave entitlements, meet all 

requirements of Singapore’s Employment Act. 

 

In order to encourage staff bonding and increase information sharing, lunch 

talks covering topics such as financial management and healthy-living are 

organised to promote an open and inclusive platform for all. Lunch is also 

provided during these events to allow opportunities for networking amongst 

colleagues from different work functions. Festive bazaars are also 

organised for our employees to enjoy promotions and shop for curated 

products conveniently.  

 

In FY2018, as a way of showing our appreciation to our staff for riding with 

the company during this difficult time, we introduced more employee 

benefits such as birthday leave, reimbursement of professional membership 

fees and reimbursement of quarterly team bonding expenditure.  

 

As Hyflux progresses through the reorganisation process, it is critical to 

keep our internal stakeholders updated and informed. Our management 

team continues to work closely with employees to review and streamline 

work processes to improve workflow and boost productivity.
