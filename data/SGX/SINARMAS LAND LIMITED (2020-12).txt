CHAIRMAN AND

  CEO Statement

In 2020, the business world was caught 

off-guard by the level of upheaval and 

disruption the COVID-19 health crisis 

brought. As repercussions from the 

pandemic continue to unfold, they 

serve as a reminder to always expect 

the 

unexpected. 

Sinarmas 

Land 

Limited (“SML” or “the Company”) 

and 

its 

subsidiaries 

(collectively 

“the Group”), along with the rest 

of the business communities, found 

ourselves needing to reassess our 

plans and priorities as the impacts of 

COVID-19 were unveiled. 

Like 

many 

other 

industries, 

the 

real estate industry was negatively 

impacted in multiple different ways. 

Substantial 

changes 

were 

made 

to previously busy workplaces and 

crowded retail locations to make 

them safe and regulatory compliant, 

resulting in an extended period of low 

human traffic and decreasing recurring 

income. On the flip side, people 

realised that residential dwellings 

had become more than just a place 

Dear Valued Stakeholders,

to live. As governments worldwide 

announced different form of lock-

down and social restriction measures, 

the normalising of working from home 

arrangement had led many to expand 

and transform their residential spaces. 

COMBATING THE  

PANDEMIC TOGETHER

As one of the largest real estate 

developers in Indonesia, we adopt a 

nimble and reactive business model 

that allows us to respond rapidly 

and efficiently to any unexpected 

circumstances 

or 

changes. 

Upon 

receiving news that the COVID-19 

virus had reached Indonesia, our 

Crisis 

Management 

Committee 

(“CMC”) immediately galvanised the 

COVID-19 response task force and 

began integrating action plans with 

inputs from all business units. The 

safety of our key stakeholders such 

as employees, tenant, customers, 

governments and communities took 

priority in these plans. 

Since then, the Group has initiated 

and undertaken many preventive and 

precautionary measures to curb the 

spread of the virus. Other than issuing 

health kits that consist of surgical 

masks, face shields and gloves to 

every employee, our employees were 

also instructed to adopt a flexible 

work-from-home 

arrangement, 

replace 

physical 

meetings 

with 

web-based conferencing platforms 

and practice social distancing. The 

physical office area and workstations 

were thoroughly sanitised regularly. 

In addition, we conducted routine 

COVID-19 screening tests for our 

employees working in the front line 

and for those that commute via public 

transport.

 

Property managers were tasked with 

ensuring 

our 

premises 

remained 

accessible and open to tenants and 

customers, with minimal disruption, 

through safety measures such as 

mandatory temperature scanning via 

thermal scanner, adhering to safe

social distancing, provision of hand 

sanitisers, tracking procedures and 

distribution of information. To render 

assistance to the local government 

and surrounding communities, the 

Group donated COVID-19 rapid test 

kits, personal protective equipment, 

surgical 

masks, 

face 

shields, 

thermometer 

guns 

and 

portable 

handwash facilities. Also, the Group 

handed out food and supplement to 

people that suffered from economic 

hardship due to the pandemic, as 

well as gift hampers to COVID-19 

patients and healthcare professionals 

who worked tirelessly during this 

challenging period.     

REASSURANCE OF OUR 

SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT 

The happenings of 2020 have further 

reaffirmed our commitment to continue 

investing towards our sustainability 

vision. Developed in 2017, SML’s 

Sustainability Vision is based on four 

foundation pillars, being “Best in 

Class Real Estate”, “Climate Change 

&amp; The Environment”, “Sustainable 

Community”, 

and 

“Educational 

Patronage”. These pillars are mapped 

to 

the 

relevant 

United 

Nation’s 

Sustainable 

Development 

Goals 

(“SDGs”) with details spelt out later in 

this report.

This is SML’s fourth sustainability report 

and serves as an important tool to 

measure, manage and communicate 

our sustainability performance to 

every stakeholder. As sustainability 

disclosure continues to increase in 

prominence globally, we aim for 

consistent improvement, transparent 

disclosure and expansion of scope 

by aligning with international and 

national guidelines such as the Global 

Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards 

and the 2016 SGX Sustainability 

Reporting Guide. 

This year, we have expanded the 

scope by including landed houses 

to the existing disclosed buildings 

and projects within BSD City and 

the Jabodetabek area. Following the 

expansion, our gross floor area (“GFA”) 

and GFA Occupied covered in this 

report have changed by 6% and -12% 

to 2.75 million m2 and 1.67 million m2 

respectively. The increase in GFA is 

in line with SML’s disclosure roadmap 

that 

outlines 

our 

sustainability 

reporting scope expansion progress 

and future scope expansion targets. 

Through this roadmap, we target 

to 

cover 

the 

entire 

Indonesia 

operations and properties by 2021 

and internationally by 2022.

Other than expanding our scope, 

we conducted a materiality review in 

2020 to reassess if our existing focus 

areas and topics were still relevant to 

us. This review was completed even 

though we did not conduct a large-

scale materiality assessment similar to 

that of 2019 where we engaged our 

stakeholders through various focus 

group discussions and surveys. The 

result from 2020 materiality review 

highlighted that due to the ongoing 

COVID-19 pandemic, most of our 

stakeholders’ concerns were focused 

towards health and safety, hereby 

validating that our four foundation 

pillars continue to remain relevant.  

Upon understanding the needs of 

our stakeholders, we placed more 

emphasis on their safety and well-

being. Hence, we are glad to report 

that there were no severe health and 

safety incidents involving our staff, 

customers and tenants. Also, the 

well-being and progress of the local 

communities within and surrounding 

our developments are key to SML’s 

sustained prosperity and success. 

Because of that, we continue to 

make 

strategic 

investments 

into 

local infrastructure and participate 

in 

community 

engagements 

and 

development initiatives across our 

operating 

areas. 

As 

a 

founding 

corporate 

member 

at 

Green 

Building Council Indonesia, SML is 

committed to embed sustainable 

development into our core business 

strategy, 

specifically 

through 

incorporating 

“Green” 

building 

design and technological innovation 

in our products while continuing to be 

profitable. These initiatives and efforts 

have been recognised in Indonesia 

and internationally. 

APPRECIATION

As COVID-19 ravages the lives of 

millions around the world, many 

healthcare workers and other frontline 

essential workers risk their lives to 

ensure that we are well-taken care of 

during this difficult period. We would 

like to salute all frontline medical and 

essential workers for their dedication 

and services while extending our 

sympathies to those that have lost 

their lives or livelihoods. In addition, 

we are thankful to all stakeholders for 

their unwavering trust and support.   

Moving forward, 2021 will present 

numerous opportunities to re-evaluate 

our operations and initiatives in 

response to the COVID-19 situation 

and our stakeholders’ needs. We 

are excited to continue finding ways 

to work with you to create greater 

economic, environmental and social 

value for Indonesia and beyond.

ABOUT

  the Report

This report covers the period from 

1 January 2020 to 31 December 

2020 (“FY2020”) and shall review all 

aspects of our sustainability work 

and performance for FY2020, starting 

with materiality and stakeholder 

engagement, followed by discussion 

of our performance, practices and 

initiatives within each of Sinarmas 

Land’s four foundation pillars. We 

continue to report in line with the 

GRI standards and the SGX listing 

requirements. We are of the opinion 

that GRI remains the most relevant 

and 

internationally 

recognised 

framework, allowing us to contribute 

additional comparative information 

to the sustainability community. In 

addition, GRI standards help us to 

ensure the accuracy, reliability, clarity, 

and comparability of the information 

presented in this report.

SCOPE EXPANSION

Starting from our first sustainability 

report back in 2017, Sinarmas Land’s 

sustainability practices and scope 

have expanded significantly as we 

mature and grow in our sustainability 

journey. Initially, our coverage was 

limited to just BSD City. We have 

since included more operations into 

the report each year and rolled out 

additional 

sustainability 

initiatives 

and reporting practices throughout 

the Group. We aim to cover all of 

our operations’ developments and 

properties in Indonesia by 2021 and 

internationally by 2022. Last year, we 

expanded the scope to include JBDTK 

and this year, we further expand 

to include landed houses in those 

areas. Below is a roadmap of SML’s 

sustainability progress regarding our 

reporting scope expansion and future 

scope expansion targets.

sought 

external 

assurance for this report; however, 

we continue to focus on improving 

our data collection processes and 

controls to be ready for this step in 

the future. To quantify our FY2020 

report’s scope expansion, we used 

GFA and GFA Occupied as a yardstick 

for measurement. Our total GFA in 

FY2020 increased 6% to 2.75 million 

m2 following the inclusion of new 

projects such as GOP 1, QBig Block G. 

However, GFA Occupied decreased 

12% to 1.67 million m2 due to decline 

in occupancy of office buildings and 

ITCs (Trade Centres) which were 

closed for several months during the 

COVID-19 pandemic.

We recommend reading this report 

together with SML Annual Report 

2020, which provides key information 

on our financial performance, as well 

as additional detail on our corporate 

governance and risk management. 

Both reports are critical communication 

materials in our ongoing engagement 

with stakeholders.  

This report uses standard units of 

measurement.

BOARD STATEMENT

The Board of Sinarmas Land continues to 

take responsibility for this sustainability 

report and remain active in its preparation. 

This report has been prepared following 

the GRI Standards: Core Option. It also 

meets the requirements of the 2016 

SGX Sustainability Reporting Guide in all 

material aspects. 

The Board remains active in reviewing 

and revising, if necessary, Sinarmas Land’s 

strategy and approach to sustainability, 

which guides the sustainability efforts of 

the Group and the content of this report. 

The Board has endorsed the material 

ESG topics for our 2020 report and is 

agreeable to the additional emphasis on 

health and welfare matters. 

The Board’s endorsement takes into 

consideration the results of our 2020 

materiality review and stakeholder 

engagement activities. Details of our 

stakeholder engagements can be 

found under the sections “Materiality 

and Stakeholder Engagement” in 

page 18 and “Engagement Program 

for All Stakeholders” on page 41.

We continue to use GRI as one of the 

most commonly used internationally 

recognised 

frameworks 

and 

will 

update our disclosures based on 

new developments in the standards. 

We also keep our strategy and 

report up-to-date with directives by 

institutions such as the United Nations 

Global Compact (“UNGC”) and the 

Brundtland Commission, and continue 

to track our progress against the 

SDGs. We remain a signatory of the 

UNGC through the Indonesia Global 

Compact Network (“IGCN”).

The Board does not preside over 

sustainability efforts in isolation due 

to the need to integrate sustainability 

into all aspects of the Group’s activities. 

The 

Board 

continuously 

engages 

with the Audit and Risk Management 

Committee 

(“ARC”) 

to 

provide 

oversight on significant environmental, 

social and governance issues that 

might potentially impact SML’s long-

term business objectives. The ARC, 

in turn, reviews SML’s sustainability 

programs and keep the Board updated 

on all relevant developments.

OUR

  Approach

IN THIS SECTION

Sinarmas Land has invested significant 

amount of time and effort towards our 

sustainability practices in the belief 

that it is our responsibility to do the 

right thing for our stakeholders and 

the environment. This section details 

Sinarmas Land’s sustainability vision 

and approach and how that aligns 

with our core values. We also describe 

our 

sustainability 

governance 

structure and how we conducted our 

materiality review and stakeholder 

engagement in 2020.

BEST IN CLASS REAL ESTATE

Our Best in Class Real Estate pillar is 

the top priority for Sinarmas Land. We 

believe that by providing state-of-the-

art facilities and services of the highest 

quality, we are able to create value 

for our business, stakeholders and 

communities. Our developments and 

properties provide safe, accessible and 

convenient spaces that allow people 

who use them to live, work and play in 

comfort, thereby contributing to the 

positive socio-economic environment 

in areas that we operate. In particular, 

SINARMAS LAND’S 

SUSTAINABILITY VISION 

Sinarmas 

Land 

developed 

its 

sustainability vision in 2017, which 

represents our sustainability principles 

and core business strategies. Since 

then, we have constantly reviewed our 

sustainability vision’s relevance on a 

yearly basis. 

Our vision consists of four foundation 

pillars. The “Best in Class Real Estate” 

pillar is anchored in our business 

activities as we strive to provide top 

quality real estate and excellent value 

to support socio-economic growth in 

Indonesia. “Climate Change &amp; The 

our new developments and forward-

looking city planning support the 

area’s regeneration through increased 

access 

to 

economic 

activities, 

thereby building a stronger and more 

resilient local economy. This has been 

particularly important in 2020 due to 

national movement restrictions that 

have limited access to economically 

generating activities such as retail and 

leisure. Specifically, under this pillar, we 

are committed to:

• being the best-in-class city planning 

(as represented by BSD City in its 

entirety);

• developing

SINARMAS LAND’S SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE AND CORE VALUES


Sinarmas Land Limited  Sustainability Report 2020

15

As one of the largest real estate 

developers 

in 

a 

climate-sensitive 

country such as Indonesia, Sinarmas 

Land is acutely aware of the need to 

mitigate and adapt to climate change. 

Our industry is a significant contributor 

to Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions. 

Hence, we are committed to manage 

our GHG emissions as part of our 

responsibility to address this global 

challenge and contribute to Indonesia’s 

commitments under the Paris Climate 

Agreement. 

Specifically, 

we 

are 

committed to:

• 

steadily growing the percentage 

of developments built that follows 

internationally recognised “Green” 

standards (e.g. BCA Green Mark, 

LEED, Greenship);

• 

continue 

to 

develop 

public 

transport and logistics facilities 

within its projects to minimise 

unnecessary 

carbon 

emissions 

during transportation of humans 

and goods; and

• 

contribute by any means possible to 

the decarbonisation of Indonesia’s 

economy (e.g. through energy-

saving efforts within our projects, 

lobbying, 

collaboration 

with 

industry peers)

OUR

  Approach

SUSTAINABLE 

COMMUNITY

We believe that a community can 

and should grow with the businesses 

operating 

within 

and 

around 

it. 

The Indonesian people are a key

opportunities within BSD City and 

beyond;

• 

improving 

the 

surrounding 

community’s 

well-being

afforded by a few but a right for all, 

independent of their race, gender or 

age. We are committed to:

• 

investing 

in 

state-of-the-art 

educational 

facilities 

in 

and

GOVERNANCE &amp; RISK 

MANAGEMENT

SML has a strong corporate culture, and 

our sustainability strategy interweaved 

with our core values which are:

• 

Positive Attitude

• 

Integrity

• 

Commitment

• 

Continuous Improvement

• 

Innovation

• 

Loyalty

We believe that sustainability can 

only be truly achieved once it is fully 

integrated into our operations and 

decision-making processes. Building on 

that belief, our sustainability initiatives 

have been integrated into the Group’s 

overall governance and operations, 

with direct guidance and involvement 

from the Company’s management 

team. 

Our 

sustainability 

structure 

comprises senior management, middle 

management and employees from 

various functions. Our Executive Risk 

Management Committee (“ERMC”) 

comprises 15 senior leaders from 

different 

strategic 

business 

units 

(“SBU”) and support functions. We 

have 

identified 

three 

Person-in-

Charge (“PIC”) with their roles and 

responsibilities clearly spelt out, each 

being responsible for overseeing the 

Company’s respective environmental 

and social, employment and economic 

functions. They are supported by 

process owners of the respective 

sustainability topics and programs.

Following 

the 

integration 

of 

sustainability 

principles 

into 

our 

existing risk management structure, 

sustainability considerations form a 

part of our decision-making process. 

Management of all levels are regularly 

updated on key developments and 

changes that may potentially affect 

our operations and performances, 

along with any follow-up progress 

and mitigation actions taken. We 

reviewed and mapped the most 

significant issues to our Enterprise 

Risk Management (“ERM”), except 

for specific environmental topics, 

such as risks relating to waste 

management and the materials used 

in our construction activities. These 

omitted topics will be reviewed for 

inclusion in our 2021 risk assessment 

and sustainability program.

OUR

  Approach

MATERIALITY AND  

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

In 2019, we undertook an extensive 

review of our material sustainability 

issues 

through 

a 

comprehensive 

stakeholder 

engagement 

which 

included focus groups and surveys, 

resulting in the revision of our 

materiality matrix. 

In 2020, we revisited our material 

sustainability topics as part of our 

practice of keeping these topics 

relevant. This year, we conducted 

desktop research and analysis to 

review our sustainability work in 

the 

context 

of 

global, 

regional 

and 

industry 

developments 

and 

supplemented this research with 

various 

stakeholder 

engagement 

surveys 

(Note 

that 

our 

usual 

customer and tenant survey was not 

conducted in 2020 due to COVID-19 

restrictions. 

Please 

refer 

to 

our 

2019 report for the most recent 

customer and tenant engagement). 

Thereafter, we discussed our findings 

with the Company’s management  

team to validate and approve the 

selection of material sustainability 

topics for 2020.  

Our materiality review aligns with 

GRI’s Principles for Defining Report 

Content. Specifically, the Principles 

of 

Stakeholder 

Inclusiveness 

was 

addressed through our stakeholder 

engagement surveys. The Principle 

of Sustainability Context was the 

aim of our desktop context review, 

and the Principles of Materiality and 

Completeness were addressed in 

the management level discussion of 

the results of our context review and 

stakeholder outreach.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

1. Context review and stakeholder 

engagement 2020

The 

2020 

context 

review 

and 

stakeholder 

engagement 

aim 

to determine the relevancies of 

our four pillars and material ESG 

topics identified to the current 

sustainability 

landscape 

and 

emerging 

trends. 

This 

involved 

three steps:

1. Desktop context review

2. Internal stakeholder engagement 

survey

3. Management validation session

The desktop context review involved 

a 

landscape 

analysis 

of 

recent 

developments 

and 

sustainability 

trends, both globally and regionally. 

This analysis included developments 

in 

sustainability 

reporting 

best 

practice, such as the World Economic 

Forum’s 

report 

entitled 

“Toward 

Common Metrics and Consistent 

Reporting 

of 

Sustainable 

Value 

Creation”, 

the 

creation 

of 

the 

Value Reporting Foundation by the 

Sustainability Accounting Standards 

Board (“SASB”) and the International 

Integrated 

Reporting 

Council 

(“IIRC”) and recent consultations on 

changes to the materiality definitions 

in the GRI Standards. The analysis 

also acknowledged the increasing 

regulations in both Singapore, driven 

by MAS and SGX, and Indonesia, 

driven by IDX. In addition, the 

analysis considered changes in the 

real estate sustainability landscape 

such as increasing demand for eco-

efficient buildings, contribution to the 

development of circular economy via 

the usage of recycled materials, and 

the growing prominence issuance of 

green bonds or loans. Responses to 

COVID-19 and COVID-19 restrictions 

featured heavily in the analysis, with 

research demonstrating changes in 

behaviours such as increased working 

from home and placing a higher 

priority on safe and healthy living and 

working environments.

These findings were translated into 

an internal stakeholder engagement 

survey, requesting stakeholders to rank 

sustainability topics on a scale of least 

to most important. There were 145 

respondents to the survey, representing 

a balanced mix of employment across 

the Group. According to the survey 

results, topics of most importance to the 

stakeholders that responded includes: 

waste management, GHG emissions, 

workplace health and safety, customer 

health and safety, anti-corruption and 

indirect economic impacts.

The context review and stakeholder 

engagement exercise indicate that 

our 2019 sustainability topics remain 

relevant. To supplement our disclosure, 

we will share, in greater detail, initiatives 

implemented by the Group to safeguard 

our stakeholders against the COVID-19 

pandemic later in the report. 

2. Employee Engagement Survey 

Every year, the Group will conduct 

an employee engagement survey for 

all permanent and retired contract 

employees of staff level and above. 

Each question is based on a 4-scale 

measurement, and employees were 

encouraged to fill the questionnaires 

through an online application. SML 

Human Capital team prepared the 

questionnaire based on employee 

engagement survey best practices 

with the intention of capturing material 

issues. In 2020, the participation rate was 

87.2%, an increase of 9.86 percentage 

points from 2019. The results have 

been compiled and presented to 

the Company’s management team 

before being incorporated into SML’s 

materiality assessment and material 

topics in this year’s report. 


Sinarmas Land Limited  Sustainability Report 2020

MATERIAL SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 2020

Results from 2020 materiality review indicate that 2019 topics remain relevant to our stakeholders. Hence, there are 

no changes to the sustainability pillars, areas of focus and material GRI topics for 2020 report.

Our Employees

We recognise that our human capital 

is an essential asset to continue 

providing the best products and 

services to our customers. As of 31 

December 

2020, 

SML 

employed 

a 

total 

of 

3,742 

(2019: 

3,727) 

employees, of which 2,655 are male 

(71%) and 1,087 are female (29%). In 

general, the nature of our business, 

i.e., construction and real estate 

development, lends itself to a larger 

proportion of men in the workforce. 

Despite this challenge, we strive to 

be an equal opportunity employer by 

maintaining gender diversity to the 

best extent possible.

Our entire workforce comprises of full-

time employees. 1,024 employees, or 

27% of the workforce, are hired bases 

on a fixed contract or temporary 

term. Fixed contracts typically consist 

of a one-year term. The breakdown 

by gender according to the type of 

employment contract is visualised 

through the two charts below.

Diversity and Equal Opportunity

Our 

employee 

handbook 

and 

employment practices underscore our 

commitment to fair labour practices. 

As our Equal Opportunities Policy on 

employment stipulates, we strictly 

prohibit any form of discrimination on 

the grounds of race, national origin, 

religion, 

disability, 

gender, 

sexual 

orientation, union membership and 

political affiliation. We expect all 

employees to be treated with fairness 

and respect.

As of 2020, our governance bodies 

consisted of 19% female and 81% 

male employees. All of the governance 

bodies’ members are above the age of 

30, among which 31% are between the 

ages of 30 and 50. The remaining 69% 

are above 50 years of age.

When examining the breakdown of 

employees, female employees make 

up 7% of non-staff (supporting function 

workers), 40% of staff, 35% of managers, 

34% of senior managers, and 19% of 

top management. We are continuing 

to make efforts to ensure diversity, 

especially among middle-management 

and above.

In terms of age diversity, 14% of non-

staff, 12% of staff, 30% of managers, 

47% of senior managers, and 69% of 

top management are composed of 

employees above the age of 50.

New Hires and Employee Retention

We recognise that welfare and career 

development contribute significantly 

to the satisfaction and reputation of 

our workplace. 

The 

results 

of 

our 

proactive 

engagement with employees show 

that there are no significant levels 

of dissatisfaction. In 2020, we hired 

195 (2019: 336) new employees, 

contributing to a new-hire rate of 5% 

(2019: 9%). Our belief that diversity 

strengthens our organisation is 

demonstrated by our recruitments 

efforts to hire people of different 

backgrounds – regardless of age or 

gender. 

Our number and rate of new 

hires, across age groups, genders 

and regions, dropped in 2020 in 

comparison to 2019. In addition, 

SML’s turnover rate during the 

reporting year was 945 (2019: 424),

Respecting Freedom of Association 

and Collective Bargaining Rights

SML respects employees’ fundamental 

rights to freedom of association and 

unions. We follow regulation set out 

by the Indonesian government (as 

ratified by the ILO) which allows trade 

unions to represent our employees 

for collective bargaining, providing 

our employees with a way to seek 

remediation for disputes. A total 

number of 12 employees (0.4% of 

our total workforce) are covered by 

collective 

bargaining 

agreements. 

This is a change from 240 employees 

last year, as the properties (Le 

Grandeur Balikpapan and Le Grandeur 

Mangga Dua Hotel) corresponding to 

the most of those employees are no 

longer in operation.

Our Disciplined approach towards 

ensuring Occupational Health and 

Safety

Our main health and safety focus in 

2020 was on our COVID-19 response. 

Nonetheless, 

SML 

continues 

to 

implement emergency response and 

crisis management plans4.   

Resulting 

from 

our 

continuous 

initiatives, we are pleased to report 

that there were no fatalities across our 

Buildings and Development projects 

in 2020.

There 

were 

three 

work-related 

injuries involving our employees or 

contractors in our buildings under the 

Asset Management, Commercial, and 

Retail &amp; Hospitality Group Divisions, 

all of which were minor and resulted in 

no lost days.

Among our development projects, 

there were eight work-related injuries 

in 2020. All injuries were sustained 

by contractors working in Southgate 

Phase 1 and 2 development projects. 

Most accidents occurred due to 

misuse of equipment such as a saw 

or grinder. All cases were minor or 

moderate injuries, requiring first-aid 

level medical treatment only, with no 

lost days. 

As a result of these injuries, we 

recorded a work-related injury rate 

(formerly Accident Frequency Rate) 

of 0.58 for buildings and 1.86 for 

development 

projects; 

the 

Injury

COMPLIANCE TO ALL RELATED 

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

For the past 48 years, SML has built 

a reputation as a reliable partner 

to our stakeholders, including the 

government, 

customers 

and 

the 

communities 

we 

operate 

in. 

To 

maintain our reputation, it is essential 

for SML to comply with regulations 

at national and regional levels. These 

regulations include land acquisition, 

operational 

permits, 

design 

and 

construction, finance and accounting, 

labour laws, customer protection, 

fair 

marketing 

procedures, 

and 

environmental frameworks. Also, SML 

has adopted a zero-tolerance stance 

towards corruption.

In 2020, there were zero reported 

incidents of corruption. In addition, 

no legal cases regarding corruption 

were brought against the Group or 

its subsidiaries, and no contracts 

with business partners had to be 

terminated due to violations related to 

corruption.

Over the years, we actively educate 

our 

employees 

on 

fraud-related 

risk 

management, 

including 

how to address issues related to 

corruption, 

asset 

misappropriation 

and accounting fraud. In 2020, our 

compliance training was transitioned 

online to accommodate extended 

WFH arrangements, and is expected 

to continue into 2021. As usual, 

during orientation, new employees 

are introduced to SML’s core values, 

including the Code of Conduct, 

the Whistle-Blowing 

Policy 

which 

helps provide additional monitoring 

on misconduct, and other policies 

covering 

procurement 

and 

fair 

employment practices.

Recently, we have set out to strengthen 

our 

governance 

framework 

to 

incorporate issues of the environment, 

as well as health and safety. We also 

continue to build on our policies 

governing 

procurement 

activities 

and in 2020, we engaged with key 

suppliers and contractors to prioritise 

the use of certified green materials in 

our projects. 

As 

a 

responsible 

operator, 

we 

proactively engage with governments 

whenever we felt that there are 

gaps in current regulations. For 

example, in 2020 we lobbied to the 

local government on solid waste 

management related regulation, a 

topic that remains under discussion.

We are pleased to report that in 2020, 

there were:

 0 

reported cases 

of non-compliance concerning 

marketing communications and 

product information

0

Government 

Regulation 

No. 

27 in 2012 on Environment Control 

Permits, we are required to submit an 

extensive Environment Management 

and Monitoring Effort (UKL/UPL) report 

every six months, indicating specific 

environmental impacts, such as water 

and waste, to ensure we operate 

within allowed thresholds. Reports are 

submitted to the regional government 

and subject to their approval. 

We are also required to comply with 

several health, safety and environment 

regulations, such as those pertaining 

to liquid waste management, fire 

safety certification and equipment 

licencing. Permits are only issued 

upon satisfactory audit results showing 

compliance with these requirements.  

This year, we are pleased to share 

that there were no incidents of 

environmental non-compliance during 

the reporting period. 

Below are some highlights of our initia-

tives to provide the best services and 

facilities to our communities in 2020:

CLIMATE CHANGE

  &amp; the Environment

At Sinarmas Land, we understand 

the potential impacts climate change 

can have on Indonesia as a whole 

and our business. We strive to protect 

the environment through policies and 

programs, minimising our impacts while 

mitigating risks to our operations. 

IN THIS SECTION

This section of the report presents our 

approach to mitigate environmental 

risks and minimising our contributions 

to climate change. In doing so, we have 

identified four key areas of focus:

• 

Optimising Building Operations to 

Achieve Clean Environment 

• 

Providing and Maintaining Green 

Open Space

• 

Providing and Facilitating Various 

Type of Public Transportation

• 

Responsible Waste Management 

Program

Environmental data for our property 

management portfolio is categorised 

into the following groups:

• 

Green Buildings

• 

High-Rise Buildings

• 

Non-Green Buildings

• 

Retail and Hospitality

• 

Commercial

• 

Residential and Township

• 

Trade Centres (including all ITCs)

OPTIMISING BUILDING 

OPERATIONS TO ACHIEVE CLEAN 

ENVIRONMENT

SML strives to optimise building 

performance from the design and 

development 

stage, 

through 

to 

property 

management, 

in 

order 

to minimise the usage of natural 

resources.

We continuously seek to develop 

new ideas and innovate to realise 

green building potential. In 2019, we 

embarked on a sustainability program 

integrated across the organisation 

to better understand and manage 

our waste and recycling, energy, 

water and emissions performance. 

This year, we improved our data 

calculation and collection processes 

from projects, including amount of 

solid waste, use of building materials 

and 

water 

consumption. 

These 

initiatives are expected to provide 

a more accurate baseline for further 

efficiency targets.

Material Used in Development Projects (tonnes)

Materials

As one of Indonesia’s leading real 

estate developers, we recognised 

that all our developments, including 

buildings, supporting amenities and 

infrastructures 

have 

a 

significant 

impact on the environment. In 2020, 

5.16 million tonnes of materials were 

used, including 5.05 million tonnes 

of steel, compared with 2.76 million 

tonnes of materials used in 2019 6. In 

particular, we saw significant growth in 

the usage of steel, largely attributed 

to the construction of Ruko The 

Icon 5. Concrete and sand markedly 

decreased as the construction of most 

development projects commenced in 

Q3 2020, while Southgate Apartment 

and Foresta Business Loft 6 reaches 

the tail end of their development. We 

continue to use concrete with recycled 

content and aim to gradually build our 

internal monitoring capacity to include 

other consumable materials and their 

respective consumed quantities in 

our internal watchlist, and have them 

reported in subsequent reports. Also, 

we continue to abide by relevant 

environmental regulations to promote 

transparency and accountability in our 

supply chain.

6 Data for 2019 has been revised due to 

changes in calculation methodology.

Energy

The built-up environment consumes 

significant amounts of energy. In the 

region where BSD City is located, 

energy is predominantly generated 

from the burning of fossil fuels 

that contribute significantly to our 

greenhouse gas emissions. Adhering 

to internationally recognised green 

building 

standards, 

such 

as 

the 

Singapore BCA Green Mark standard, 

we can direct our effort towards 

achieving greater energy efficiency and 

reducing energy usage throughout 

the project life cycle. Total energy 

consumption of buildings decreased 

overall from 250 million kWh in 2019 

to 191 million kWh in 2020. Most of 

the decrease can be attributed to 

COVID-19 which caused temporary 

closures 

particularly 

in 

High-Rise 

Buildings, Retail and Hospitality, and 

Trade Centres.

Our building energy consumption 

and intensity by GFA Occupied are 

depicted in the adjacent graphs,

In line with SML’s Sustainability Vision, 

the Group is actively encouraging 

occupancy in our green office buildings 

as we seek to reduce environmental 

footprint, mitigate climate change, 

and 

improve 

the 

well-being 

of 

occupants. Our Green Buildings’ GFA 

increased from 102,157m2 in 2019 

to 140,644m2, while GFA Occupied 

changed from 83,824 m2 in 2019 to 

82,629 m2 in 20208. Green Buildings’ 

energy consumption increased from  

8,069,480 kWh in 2019 to 8,510,789 kWh  

in 2020. Energy intensity by GFA 

Occupied 

increased 

7% 

from  

96.27 kWh/m2 in 2019 to 103.00 kWh/m2, 

largely driven by the addition of GOP 1 

in 2020.9 This is still well below the 

Energy Consumption Index or ‘Indeks 

Komsumsi Energi’ (“IKE”) standard 

stipulated by the Governor of the 

Capital Region of Jakarta for green 

office buildings10.

Since 2019, we set targets for our 

High-Rise Buildings, namely Sinar Mas 

Land Plaza – Jakarta and Sinarmas 

MSIG Tower. Using 2019 as the base 

year, we began to track and monitor 

the environmental performance of 

7 Green and High-Rise Buildings are 

buildings with targets while other buildings 

(including Trade Centres) are buildings 

without targets.

8 Note that GFA Occupied figures for years 

2019 and 2018, as reported in previous 

reports, have been revised due to changes 

in calculation methodology.

9 Energy intensity calculation is based on 

consumption for partial year for one of 

the properties, GOP 1, which started 

operations in 2020 Q2. Therefore, the 

numerator uses consumption data 

from Q2 to Q4, while the denominator 

includes total GFA Occupied as of end 

of Q4.

10 Based on the IKE by the Governor of the 

Capital Region of Jakarta, the bottom 

energy consumption intensity limit for 

green office buildings is 210 kWh/m2 /

year while the upper limit is 285 kWh/m2 /

year. Please refer to Indonesian regulation 

‘PERGUB DKI NO 38_2012’ for more 

information.

decrease 

in 

energy 

consumption from 179,206,399 kWh 

in 2019 to 128,663,156 kWh in 2020, 

largely as a result of closures related

consumption 

intensity 

by 

GFA 

Occupied decreased slightly from 

136.68 kWh/m2 in 2019 to 135.12 kWh/

m2 in 2020.

In 2017, Sinar Mas Land Plaza – Jakarta 

replaced its chiller to optimise the air-

conditioning system to one with lower 

energy consumption. This initiative 

was in line with Singapore BCA Green 

Mark’s requirements and the building 

was subsequently awarded green 

building certification in 2018. In 2020, 

we made improvement to Sinarmas 

MSIG Tower’s chiller plant on Floor LG 

to optimise the chiller water pump.

Emissions

In 2020, GHG emissions from all 

buildings included in this report have 

decreased, correlated with temporary 

closures in properties in High-Rise 

Buildings, Retail &amp; Hospitality, and 

Trade Centres. Our buildings’ GHG 

emissions and emission intensities by 

GFA Occupied are depicted in the 

adjacent graph and tables 12. 

In 2020, GHG emissions for our Green 

Buildings increased from 5,804 tonnes 

of CO2 e in 2019 to 6,133 tonnes 

of CO2 e in 2020. Green buildings’ 

overall GHG emissions intensity by 

GFA Occupied increased slightly from 

0.069 tonnes of CO2 e/m2 in 2019 to 

0.074 tonnes of CO2 e/m2 in 2020.13

Since 2019, we have set new targets 

for our High-Rise Buildings, namely 

Sinar Mas Land Plaza – Jakarta and 

Sinarmas MSIG Tower. Using 2019 

as the base year, we began to track 

and 

monitor 

the 

environmental 

performances 

of 

our 

High-Rise

Water

Water is a precious resource. Thus, we 

need to monitor our usage carefully 

to mitigate the harmful effects of 

excessive water consumption. Our 

buildings’ main water consumption 

source is the municipal water supply. 

Our total municipal water consumption 

increased, primarily driven by the 

expanded scope of reporting for the 

Commercial category. Our buildings’ 

water consumption and consumption 

intensities by GFA Occupied are 

depicted in the following graph and 

tables14. Municipal water consumption 

for our Green Buildings decreased 

from 91,826 m3 in 2019 to 90,205 m3 in 

2020, contributing to a slight decrease 

in water intensity by GFA Occupied 

from 1.10 m3/m2 in 2019 to 1.09 m3/m2 

in 2020.15 

Starting from 2019, we have set new 

targets for our High-Rise Buildings, 

namely Sinar Mas Land Plaza – Jakarta 

and Sinarmas MSIG Tower. Using 

2019 as the base year, we began to 

track and monitor the environmental 

performances 

of 

our 

High-Rise 

Buildings. 

High-Rise 

Buildings’ 

municipal 

water 

consumption 

was

corresponding 

to 

municipal 

water 

intensity 

by 

GFA

Commercial buildings experienced 

the highest increase in municipal 

water consumption and intensity by 

GFA Occupied due to the significant 

increase in scope: Commercials’ GFA 

Occupied increased from 108,077 m2 

in 2019 to 176,121 m2 in 2020. As a 

result, its municipal water consumption 

increased from 103,065 m3 in 2019 to 

3,564,358 m3 in 202016.

actual volume captured. These figures are 

instead based on the GREENSHIP Rating 

issued by Green Building Council (GBC) 

Indonesia. The calculation uses average 

rainfall multiplied by wet days in one 

year (derived from data provided by the 

meteorological agency), divided by the total 

catchment area across all three buildings.

18  Includes municipal water, rain water, and 

ground water.

Two of our Green Buildings , MyRepublic 

Plaza and GOP 1, use collected 

rainwater17. Total consumption of rain 

water across buildings was 1,660 m3 in 

2020 (2019: 1,746 m3). Two other Green 

Buildings, GOP 9 and Sinar Mas Land 

Plaza – BSD City, are still implementing 

this system. The collected rainwater 

is used for gardening activities and 

flushing of toilets. Through the usage 

of collected rainwater, we aim to reduce 

our municipal water footprint, which is 

critical in water-stressed Jakarta.

PROVIDING AND MAINTAINING 

GREEN OPEN SPACE

Green Open Space (Ruang Terbuka 

Hijau, “RTH”) is incorporated into 

every new development master plan. 

RTH are important in order to:

• 

Ensure 

the 

availability 

of 

sufficient space for hydrological 

preservation;

• 

Serve as pollutant reduction in 

urban areas; and

• 

Serve 

as 

a 

recreational 

and 

sports facilities for surrounding 

communities to create a healthy 

living environment.

There are several areas included in 

SML’s Green Open Space category:

• 

City Park and Pond Area;

• 

Public Green Area;

• 

Commercial Lot Green area;

• 

Residential Green Area;

• 

Road Median; and

• 

River Side Green (RSS).

In 2019, we have set and started a 

3-year target of planting 31,803 trees 

and 17,916 biopori holes. In 2020, 

we have included tree planting and 

biopori program in our development 

and have since planted 7,012 new 

trees and created 1,143 biopori holes.

Our progress in 2020 was slowed 

down due to the ongoing COVID-19 

pandemic. We will review these targets 

again in 2021.

PROVIDING AND FACILITATING 

VARIOUS TYPES OF PUBLIC 

TRANSPORTATION 

In order for Jakarta to improve 

local air quality and reduce GHG 

emission contributions, it is important 

to promote the use of the city’s 

public transportation infrastructure. 

SML aspires to support the city to 

become a model sustainable city by 

contributing to the development of 

public transportation infrastructure.

CASE STUDY

INTERMODA BSD CITY

Intermoda BSD City is a commercial 

multipurpose 

development 

on 

a 

land area of   25 hectares integrated 

with public service facilities such as 

Commuter Line Electric Train (KRL) in 

Cisauk Station, BSD Link Bus Terminal 

and trade services through the BSD 

City Intermoda Modern Market for 

BSD City residents. The main purpose 

of Intermoda BSD City development 

is to provide better access and 

mobility for residents in and out of 

BSD City through convenient public 

transportation 

to/from 

BSD 

City. 

Intermoda BSD City also promotes 

the opening of new job opportunities, 

especially for MSMEs, which in turn 

will improve the economic condition 

of local community. 

Intermoda 

BSD 

City 

Phase 

1, 

consisting of the bus terminal and 

the 

Modern 

Market 

connected 

to Cisauk KRL Station, has been 

completed and fully operational. The 

plan for the next phase is to develop 

commercial buildings/lofts and high-

rise residential. The overall project 

will create an urban area that provides 

easy access to the business district, 

entertainment centre, modern market, 

and transportation access. This project 

was built with the “Green and Modern 

Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)” 

concept, a city planning concept 

that centres on the optimal use of 

public transport transit areas. TOD is 

a common concept adopted by many 

big cities to optimise the use of public 

transportation modes and to reduce 

the use of private vehicles hereby 

achieving lower emission level. 

The Modern Market Building is part 

of Intermoda BSD City that carries the 

concept of energy-saving with natural 

lighting and ventilation, supported 

by high roof to improve air exchange 

circulation that is comfortable for 

visitors, resulting in lesser usage of 

air-conditioning.

RESPONSIBLE WASTE 

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

Sustainable cities require effective 

waste 

management 

practices. 

As 

a property developer and estate 

management manager, we have a 

significant role to play in minimising 

our waste and encouraging our tenants 

and residents to do the same. Currently, 

there are several ongoing initiatives, 

including:

• Government 

engagement: 

Coordinate with local government 

authorities to encourage better 

waste collection; 

• Resident engagement: Partner with 

Indonesia’s Tzu Chi Foundation to 

promote the concepts of plastic 

usage reduction for all BSD City’s 

residential areas;

• Contractor 

support: 

Appoint 

certified 

hazardous 

waste 

vendors to collect and manage 

all hazardous waste generated by 

buildings managed by SML.

Effluents and Waste

We 

placed 

all 

our 

property 

management 

projects 

into 

the 

same group to better manage and 

monitor the water discharge. Most 

of BSD City’s water discharge is 

channelled into our Water Treatment 

Plant (WTP) where it is treated and 

redistributed back to our customers. 

A very small portion of our effluents 

is discharged into the surrounding 

Cisadene River, which was found not 

to be significantly affected by the 

discharge. We target to comply with 

all relevant government regulations 

on waste and water discharged. 

Please find the following statistics on 

water discharge by destination from 

our buildings in scope. Figures in the 

following table are analysed based 

on data collected from buildings with 

on-site meters as well as estimations 

for 

buildings 

where 

we 

utilised 

assumptions which is further detailed 

in the appendix.

We 

regret 

to 

report 

that 

the 

biochemical oxygen demand (“BOD”) 

of our effluents exceeded the limit 

as stipulated by the Indonesian 

government on 6 occasions in 2020, 

compared to 13 occasions in 2019. The 

average BOD of effluents was 13.2 mg/l  

in 2020, compared to 15.8 mg/l in 

201920. 

The 

Indonesian 

national 

standard for effluents is a maximum of 

30mg/l BOD. Our exceedances were 

minor and did not affect any local 

water bodies and its related habitat. 

While these minor exceedances did 

not result in any penalisation or fines 

by the government, we take such 

matters very seriously. These incidents 

occurred namely due to issues relating 

to breakdowns in the equalising panel 

and blower pump panel at QBig, and 

poor air circulation at The Breeze. This 

matter will be resolved in 2021 and 

closely monitored by management.

changes in calculation methodology.

22 Represents total waste collected by a 

certified vendor (excluding hazardous 

waste left uncollected from premises, 

which, for this year, is limited to Sinarmas 

MSIG Tower)

We practice waste segregation in 

our developments and pay special 

attention to ensure that no hazardous 

waste is sent to landfill. Since 2019, we 

have had a policy to ensure that every 

building under Asset Management 

and 

Retail 

&amp; 

Hospitality 

Group 

Division shall appoint a certified 

waste management vendor to collect 

and manage our hazardous waste. In 

2020, we improved our data collection 

measures to improve our hazardous 

waste management. Our properties 

across Office21, Retail &amp; Hospitality, 

and Trade Centres generated 6,832 

tonnes of hazardous waste22 in 2020, 

compared with 16,457 tonnes reported 

in 2019. 

Sinarmas MSIG Tower stored 1,754 kg of 

hazardous waste in safe on-site facilities. 

The building is in the process of 

appointing certified vendors to collect 

and manage its hazardous waste.

As for non-hazardous waste, apart 

from increasing the types and amounts 

of material that can be reused and 

recycled across our operations, we are 

using our ongoing communications 

with local government authorities to 

suggest improvements to the available 

infrastructure 

for 

the 

processing 

of non-hazardous waste, which is 

currently collected, managed, and sent 

to landfill. We collect and report data 

on waste sent to landfill. We show the 

breakdown of non-hazardous waste 

sent to landfill by building type in the 

following chart and table.23 Waste for 

the reporting year remained steady at 

55,680 tonnes. Trade Centres make up 

the largest composition contributing

LOCAL COMMUNITY PROGRAMS

1 Green Habit 2.0 Less Plastic

In 2019, SML launched Green Habit 

2.0 “Less Plastic” program. The 

program focused on substituting 

plastic bottles with paper cups/

tumblers in BSD Office Buildings 

and residential areas. SML has 

collaborated with Tzu Chi Foundation 

to collect plastic waste from several 

residential clusters in BSD City and 

office buildings such as the Wisma 

BCA and all the buildings within the 

Green Office Park.  In the first half of 

2020, the Green Habit program was 

successfully implemented in several 

residential clusters in BSD City, 

such as Victoria River Park Cluster 

and Green Cove Cluster. However, 

the 

program 

was 

subsequently 

postponed due to the COVID-19 

pandemic.

SUSTAINABLE

  Community

IN THIS SECTION

Our 

buildings, 

developments 

and projects all form their own 

communities. 

We 

feel 

that 

our 

role is not just to provide physical 

infrastructure for living and working, 

but to contribute to the well-being 

of the people in these communities. 

Other 

than 

being 

green 

and 

innovative, our buildings should also 

contribute towards a healthy, happy 

and above all, sustainable community. 

The following pages provide an insight 

into our various initiatives contribute 

to a sustainable community. 

Our developments contribute to the 

well-being of communities through 

the provision of modern work facilities, 

safe 

residential 

units, 

valuable 

commercial 

buildings 

and 

retail 

centres, local marketplaces for local 

businesses, accessible public transport 

and essential services like healthcare 

and utilities. These facilities support 

a stable socio-economic environment 

in 

these 

communities. 

We 

also 

acknowledge that construction can be 

disruptive. Sinarmas Land respects our 

communities and strive to mitigate any 

potential negative impacts caused by 

our activities.

In order to get feedback from our 

community on how we can continue 

to serve their well-being as well 

as mitigate disruptions, we have 

community 

engagement 

initiatives 

that supplement our customer, tenant 

and employee surveys, which was 

mentioned earlier in this report.

We 

also 

conduct 

needs-based 

community programs such as donation 

drives, 

sponsoring 

local 

events, 

contributing to natural disasters relief 

programs 

supporting 

social 

and 

environmental campaigns and the 

development of local worship facilities 

to contribute to a sustainable and 

happy community.

In this section of the report, we discuss 

two areas of work we have embarked 

on in 2020 to help our communities to 

prosper and thrive:

• 

Engagement 

Program 

for 

All 

Stakeholders

• 

Improving Community Welfare in 

Surrounding Development Areas

ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM  

FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS

Sinarmas Land continuously engages 

our communities on various fronts to 

better understand their needs and 

opinions on new developments or 

initiatives. We gather feedback to 

develop products and deliver services 

of the highest quality to benefit our 

communities as well as to understand 

how we can better manage our 

potentially 

negative 

impacts. 

We 

also engage with the media for wider 

engagement with society and other 

public entities.

Managing Our Impact  

on Communities

While our continuous development 

activities contribute to the vibrancy 

of the local area, certain activities 

might 

unfortunately 

pose 

some 

inconvenience to the surrounding 

communities. As a baseline, we 

ensure that both our contractors 

and 

employees 

adhere 

to 

the 

legal 

requirements 

stipulated 

by 

the 

Indonesian 

government 

with 

regards to traffic, noise and pollution 

management. As most construction 

activities are handled by external 

contractors, we mandate that every 

contractor appointed or engaged must 

be rated by the regional regulator and 

possess a Construction Service Permit 

Letter issued by the government. 

In addition, we have included the 

following initiatives to avoid negative 

impacts during construction activities:

• 

Regular communication with the 

communities 

surrounding 

the 

development project about our 

construction plans;

• 

Mitigate the potentially negative 

impacts for example reduce noise 

pollution, reasonable construction 

hours, keeping the environment 

clean during construction and many 

more.

Sinarmas 

Land 

comply 

with 

Government Regulation No. 27 (2012) 

on Environment Control Permits that 

requires every developer to perform 

an environmental impact assessment 

(AMDAL) and provide plans to avoid/

mitigate the possibility of negative 

impacts before the commencement of 

any property development project in 

Indonesia. This assessment covers the 

following areas: 

• 

Physical, 

chemical 

(land, 

soil, 

space, etc.) and biological aspects 

(habitats and biodiversity);

• 

Social factors (economics, safety, 

culture, etc.); 

• 

Community health. 

As a result of precautions taken, 

based on reports from government 

regulators and issuance of permits, 

we are pleased to note that during 

the reporting period, none of our 

operations were found to have any 

significant or potentially negative 

impacts on local communities.  

Engagement with Media

The media is a key platform for SML 

to communicate with the society and 

other public entities. Our Corporate 

Communication 

Division 

actively 

engage with the media to provide 

the 

latest 

information 

on 

SML 

products, services and businesses. 

These engagements are carried out 

through exclusive interviews, press 

releases, press conferences (online 

and in-person where possible), press 

tours and media gatherings. During 

the COVID-19 pandemic, Corporate 

Communication switched to virtual 

meetings and interviews as much as 

possible.

IMPROVING COMMUNITY 

WELFARE IN SURROUNDING 

DEVELOPMENT AREA

To support our local community’s 

welfare, we make targeted and 

strategic 

investments 

into 

local 

infrastructure 

and 

community 

development. Due to restrictions 

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, 

the school renovation program was 

dropped. As a replacement, SML 

will launch a new program called 

“Bedah Rumah” (House Renovation).

EDUCATIONAL

  Patronage

IN THIS SECTION

Educational Patronage is an area in 

which we place strong emphasis and 

take a long-term approach. We invest 

heavily in education for our employees 

and our surrounding communities. 

This section of the report provides an 

overview of the investments SML made 

to enhance and drive educational 

development. 

An 

educated 

and 

self-sufficient 

population can drive success both 

for our nation and for our business. 

Elevating the level of national education 

will alleviate poverty and improve 

livelihoods for the nation as a whole. 

In addition, a strong education system 

will provide a stable pipeline of diverse 

talent for the long-term success of our 

business. Hence, we are determined to 

support the education system within 

our organisation and the surrounding 

communities.

Internally, we provide various learning 

opportunities 

to 

improve 

our 

employees’ knowledge and skillsets. 

We have a set of policies and targets 

to maintain the quality of our human 

resources and talents.

Externally, we support learning and 

knowledge 

development 

for 

our 

communities in a number of ways. 

The key objective of these programs 

is to provide equal opportunity to 

members 

of 

local 

communities, 

particularly those who have limited 

access to develop knowledge and 

skills to support themselves.

SML provides both educational and 

financial support, as well as providing 

infrastructure and learning spaces such as 

schools and community learning centres.

In 2020, we continued our focus on the 

following initiatives:

• 

Initiating 

Program 

to 

Support 

Knowledge Enhancement

• 

Improving Educational Method and 

Facility

INITIATING PROGRAMS TO 

SUPPORT KNOWLEDGE 

ENHANCEMENT

Training and Development 

At 

Sinarmas 

Land, 

we 

operate 

an annual employee training and 

professional certification program. This 

program is fully funded by our annual 

training budget and consists of specific 

programs that address our employees’ 

training needs. By equipping our team 

with the knowledge and skills they 

need, it will contribute to the growth of 

their career and our Group. We want to 

nurture our employees and local talent 

by providing them with the knowledge 

and abilities to excel, hereby helping 

to create a more resilient national 

workforce. In addition, we provide 

on-the-job training opportunities and 

support sufficiently qualified staff by 

paying for their relevant professional 

bodies’ membership fees, such as 

chartered engineers.

All SML employees are required to 

undergo mandatory training specific 

to their job function as part of their 

skills enhancement every year. As of

employees and 4.50 training hours for 

female employees. 

Employee Performance

To keep track of employee training 

needs, 

we 

conduct 

semi-annual 

performance and career development 

reviews. 

This 

KPI-based 

formal 

review is an important milestone 

in our employees’ career as their 

performances, strengths and areas 

of 

improvement 

are 

evaluated 

transparently and objectively, which 

will then form the basis for additional 

training or promotion. Group Division 

Heads identify and introduce suitable 

training and development programs 

to tailor to their division employees’ 

needs based on employees’ previous 

year performances, results and career 

plans. In 2020, all employees of all 

genders and employee categories 

(senior 

management, 

executives, 

and 

non-executives) 

received 

regular performance and career 

development review.

IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL 

METHOD AND FACILITY

We developed several programs to 

support our community educational 

patronage targets. These include:

• 

Scholarship collaboration with IULI 

University for the community in 

BSD City;

• 

Scholarship program for employee’s 

children and family; and

• 

Scholarship 

program 

for 

LOCAL COMMUNITY PROGRAMS

communities in Tangerang district 

and South Tangerang City. 

Other than the programs mentioned 

above, SML is committed to provide 

essential educational resources and 

facilities, as well as improving teaching 

methods. Our 2020 initiatives to 

improve education in communities are 

as follows: 

• 

Continuous support for Gerakan 

Sekolah Menyenangkan (“GSM”), 

an initiative aimed to change the 





EDUCATIONAL

  Patronage

1 Gerakan Sekolah 

Menyenangkan (“GSM”)

GSM’s mission is to bridge the gaps and 

differences between schools to share 

teaching knowledge and resources 

by 

changing 

the 

preconceived 

mindset of teachers, students, and 

ultimately the society. Cooperating 

with various stakeholders in South 

Tangerang 

City 

and 

Tangerang 

District, this program will benefit 

Primary and Junior School students. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, 

GSM conducted the program virtually 

and was attended by 450 teachers 

from 225 different schools. Also, SML 

and GSM founders were involved in 

developing an emergency curriculum 

during the national lockdown. In 2021, 

the program will be revamped into a 

new concept, namely Bina Sekolah 

(School Coaching), and will continue 

to provide training programs for 

selected schools.

450 

teachers attended

225 

schools signed up

mindsets of teachers, students and 

society by equalising and bridging 

the teaching and knowledge gaps 

between different schools; 

• 

Organised 

the 

second 

Banten 

Dyslexia Event to raise the awareness 

of dyslexic children’ needs;  

• 

Conducted renovations for schools 

and libraries in BSD City and our 

other area of operations.  

Details of our 2020 initiatives can be 

found below:

2 Banten Dyslexia Event 2

Conducted in January 2020, the 

educational seminar, “Banten Dyslexia 

Event 2”, was attended by 325 

participants that consist of teachers, 

GSM teachers and parents. This 

seminar provides broad knowledge 

and insights for teachers and parents 

to better understand dyslexic children 

and offer them the same opportunities 

as other children.

3 All Centres (excluding Craft 

Centre) at BSD Knowledge 

House (“Rumah Pintar”)

At our BSD Knowledge house, we 

provide various facilities to the public 

that contribute to knowledge and 

learning in those communities. These 

include:

• 

Computer

APPENDIX A: NOTES FOR 

 Sustainability 

  Performance Data

ENVIRONMENT

1. Buildings’ energy consumption, 

GHG emissions, and respective 

intensities data include our use of 

electricity from the grid and diesel 

fuel for emergency purposes in our 

back-up generators. Our processes 

do not use any heating, cooling, or 

steam consumption.

2. We do not sell any electricity, 

heating, cooling, or steam energy 

to other organisations.

3. Gross Floor Area (“GFA”) for 

intensity figures: GFA is identified 

based on the Built Drawing Data 

and Tenant Relation Data (based on 

Tenant Agreement).

4. All covered floor areas of a building 

(except 

otherwise 

exempted), 

indoor and basement parking areas, 

and uncovered areas for commercial 

uses, are deemed to be the gross 

floor area of the building.

5. We also report our intensity 

figures on a GFA Occupied basis. 

GFA Occupied is calculated by 

multiplying occupancy rate (simple 

average of monthly occupancy 

rates) with the GFA.

6. Building and development site 

details including property type, 

approximate net leasable area, 

project site area, and expected 

completion date are available in 

SML’s Annual Report 2020 (Property 

Portfolio).

7. Green Buildings’ intensity figures 

for energy consumption, water 

consumption 

and 

greenhouse 

gas emissions in 2018 and 2019 

were revised due to a correction 

in GFA and/or GFA Occupied for 

Sinar Mas Land Plaza - BSD City, 

MyRepublic Plaza, and GOP 9. 

8. High-Rise 

Buildings’ 

energy 

consumption figure in 2019 was 

revised due to a correction in 

consumption data for common area.

9. Non-Green 

Buildings’ 

intensity 

figures for energy consumption, 

water 

consumption, 

and 

greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, 

were revised due to corrections in 

GFA and GFA Occupied for BSD 

Permit and Township Office.

10. Retail 

&amp; 

Hospitality’s 

intensity 

figures for energy consumption, 

water 

consumption, 

and 

greenhouse 

gas 

emissions 

in 

2018 and 2019 were revised due 

to corrections in GFA and GFA 

Occupied for QBig BSD City.

11. Residential &amp; Township’s intensity 

figures for energy consumption, 

water 

consumption, 

and 

greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 

were revised due to corrections in 

GFA and GFA Occupied for BSD 

Modern Market.

12. Commercial’s 

intensity 

figures 

for energy consumption, water 

consumption, 

and 

greenhouse 

gas emissions in 2018 and 2019 

were revised due to corrections in 

GFA and GFA Occupied for The 

Elements Jakarta and changes 

in calculation methodology for 

aggregate across Trade Centres.

13. Water consumption and discharge 

data for Green Buildings in 2018  

and 2019, and Commercial in 2019 

were revised due to changes in 

calculation methodology for GOP 9 

and Akasa Apartment.

14. BOD of effluent data for Green 

Buildings 

in 

2018, 

High-Rise 

Buildings in 2019, and Trade 

Centres for 2019 were revised 

due to changes in calculation 

methodology for Sinar Mas Land 

Plaza - BSD City, Cashbac, and 

aggregate across Trade Centres.

15. Non-hazardous waste data for 

Green Buildings in 2019 was revised 

due to changes in calculation 

methodology 

for 

MyRepublic 

Plaza.

16. Standards 

and 

methodologies 

used for unit conversion of diesel 

fuel are based on the Carbon 

Disclosure Project.

17. Greenhouse gas conversion is based 

on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 

18. Emission factors for electricity 

consumption are sourced from the  

Standard Pedoman Teknis Perhitungan 

Baseline 

Gas 

Rumah 

Kaca 

Sektor Berbasis Energi Republik 

Indonesia, Area Jamali (Jawa-

Madura Bali): 0.725 kg/CO2/kWh.

19. Greenhouse Gas Protocol Emission 

Factors from Cross Sector Tools, 

March 2017 were used for diesel 

conversions. The gases included in 

the conversion of diesel are CO2, 

CH4 and N2O. 

20. Our 

water 

consumption 

data 

is based on the standards and 

methodologies defined by the 

Indonesian 

National 

Standard 

and Indonesian regulation for 

water supply. Calculation of water 

discharge was performed in the 

following manner. While 2020’s 

scope expanded, we are aware 

that not all building has installed 

on-site meter to measure water 

discharge due to their designs. 

The following buildings have on-

site meters as of 2020 to measure 

water discharge:  

 

• 

Green Buildings: MyRepublic 

Plaza, GOP 1

 

• 

High-Rise Buildings: Sinar Mas 

Land Plaza - Jakarta Tower II  

&amp; III

 

• 

Non-Green Buildings: Wisma 

BCA BSD City

 

• 

Retail &amp; Hospitality: QBig BSD 

City

 

• 

Commercial: Hotel Le Premier 

Kota Deltamas, Kawasan Kota 

Deltamas

 

• 

Trade Centres: ITC BSD, BSD 

Junction, Mall Mangga Dua, 

ITC Cempaka Mas, ITC Depok, 

ITC Fatmawati, Graha Cempaka 

Mas, ITC Roxy Mas, ITC Permata 

Hijau, ITC Mangga Dua

 

For 

buildings 

without 

on-site 

meters, we made estimations on 

the volume of water discharged. 

Among the buildings in scope, 

for Sinar Mas Land Plaza - Jakarta 

Tower I and Cashbac, we set 

the volume of water discharged 

equal to the amount of water 

consumption.

 

For the rest of buildings in scope, the 

volume of water discharged is based 

on the assumption that volume of 

water discharge from a building 

is approximately 80% of water 

consumption for each building. 

This methodology is aligned with 

international standards and the 

Indonesian government’s Ministry 

of Public Work and Housing. We 

have applied this methodology 

to determine the water discharge 

volume for the following buildings in 

scope:

 

• 

Green Buildings: Sinar Mas 

Land Plaza - BSD City, GOP 9

 

• 

High-Rise Buildings: Sinarmas 

MSIG Tower

• 

Trade Centres: Mall Ambasador

11 of our buildings in scope use 

septic tanks  — septic tanks are 

ground tanks collecting waste 

water from the building without 

going 

through 

the 

Sewage 

Treatment 

Plant 

(“STP”). 

The 

system cannot segregate between 

solid waste and effluent and it is 

not common to install meters on 

these systems. Septic tanks are 

emptied periodically by authorised 

vendors and not channelled to 

the city sewage system or surface 

water. Hence there are no records 

of water discharge from the 

following buildings:

 

• 

Non-Green Buildings:

Permit and Township Office
