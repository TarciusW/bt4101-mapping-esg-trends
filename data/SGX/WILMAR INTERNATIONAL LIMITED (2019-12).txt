EXTERNAL ASSURANCE

FOCUS ON ESG MATERIALITY 

Ernst &amp; Young LLP (EY) was engaged to 

provide independent, limited assurance on 

selected disclosures in this report. Further 

details may be found in the Assurance 

Statement on pages 147-151.

Materiality is an essential filter to determine 

the most important ESG topics in creating 

long-term value for our business and 

stakeholders. These topics influence how 

the Board and senior management steer 

our sustainability strategy, initiatives, and 

reporting. To ensure continued stakeholder 

confidence in our sustainability approach, 

we review materiality annually. 

Our materiality process adheres to GRI 

Standards Reporting Principles and AA1000 

AccountAbility Principles. This involves a 

four-step approach, outlined in the diagram 

below. The material ESG topics of our palm 

oil and sugar business are shown in the 

materiality matrixes on the next page.

Topic 

Identification

Stakeholder Engagement 

Topic Prioritisation

Validation 

and Sign-off

Integration

We identified ESG topics that 

may be material to our business 

and stakeholders by reviewing 

key industry and sustainability 

trends and reviewing ESG topics 

identified by sustainability 

reporting and rating frameworks. 

This includes the GRI Standards, 

the Sustainability Accounting 

Standards Board (SASB), the 

Dow Jones Sustainability Indices 

(DJSI), and the Zoological Society 

of London (ZSL)’s Sustainability 

Policy Transparency Toolkit 

(SPOTT). 

Having identified the relevant ESG topics, we 

prioritised those that would most significantly 

impact our ability to deliver long-term value 

to our business and stakeholders. This process 

involved multiple forums and engagement 

with internal and external stakeholders, which 

included:

• 

Conducting internal materiality workshops 

with key palm business departments from 

Indonesia and Malaysia.

• 

Seeking online input from our sugar business 

in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and 

India.

• 

Distributing an online materiality survey to 

Wilmar employees. 

• 

Engaging an external sustainability consultant 

to conduct independent interviews with 

external stakeholders such as our customers 

and suppliers. 

Following a review 

by Wilmar's senior 

management, the Board 

of Directors reviewed 

and approved our list of 

material ESG topics.

We integrated the final list 

of material ESG topics into 

our sustainability strategy 

and management initiatives, 

targets, and performance 

indicators. These topics 

also form the basis of our 

sustainability reporting.









Unless otherwise noted, the sites included 

in this report are those where we have a 

shareholding above 50% with operational 

control. There has been no significant 

change to the size, structure, or ownership 

of our palm operations since the previous 

report. In June 2018 we increased our stake 

in the Mumbai-based Shree Renuka Sugars 

Limited  (SRSL) to 58%. Consequently, we 

have included SRSL in the scope of this 

report.

The report also covers sustainability 

initiatives and performance data on our 

supply chain, where available. These 

include our traceability initiatives; our No 

Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation 

(NDPE) policy implementation; and supplier 

monitoring and engagement, which can 

be found in the supply chain section. We 

do not disclose key supplier information 

restricted by confidentiality agreements.

Wilmar International Limited   |  Sustainability Report 2019

Sustainability Report 2019  |  Wilmar International Limited 













Over the last decade, sustainability has become a 

mainstream topic and a critical part of any successful 

business. To us, sustainability is core to our business 

and commercial strategies, and we have never 

shied away from taking the lead in pushing the 

boundaries of our own sustainability performance, 

and that of the wider palm oil industry. 

In 2008, we achieved our first Roundtable on 

Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification and with 

that, the internal adoption and implementation of 

sustainability best practices. In 2013, we were the 

first in the industry to adopt a No Deforestation, 

No Peat, and No Exploitation (NDPE) policy for 

our entire supply chain, in addition to our own 

operations. In 2015, we became the first palm oil 

company to have a publicly accessible grievance 

procedure that enables any external stakeholder 

to raise issues relating to our operations or those 

of our suppliers. We published our supplier palm 

oil mill list in the same year amid initial reservations 

from the palm oil industry. And in 2018, after a 

year-long review of our action taken on suppliers 

that continue to deforest, we adopted a clear cut-

off date of 31 December 2015 for deforestation 

(including requirements for recovery plans to account 

for deforestation from the cut-off date), and a 

suspension approach whereby suppliers verified 

to be deforesting will be immediately suspended 

at group level. 

In 2019, we updated our NDPE policy to incorporate 

the commitments, policies and procedures that 

Wilmar adopted after 2013, and to include updated 

terminology and approaches to identifying forest 

areas, notably the use of the High Conservation 

Value-High Carbon Stock Approach (HCV-HCSA) 

integrated assessment toolkit and the linked quality 

assurance processes. The updated policy strengthens 

many sustainability commitments that were 

introduced post 2013, notably the deforestation 

cut-off date, recovery plan requirements, suspension 

approach, our Human Rights Framework and 

Women’s Charter published in 2019, enhanced 

health and safety responsibilities, and more robust 

whistleblowing and grievance mechanisms.

As the Board, we are kept abreast of all the 

efforts that the Group has put in to achieve our 

sustainability commitments, and in some areas, we 

have challenged ourselves to do more than other 

industry players. We agree that our size, influence, 

and global reach bestow on us a critical obligation 

to be sustainability frontrunners. However, the 

industry will never be able to transform without 

the commitment from all players including smaller 

companies, and without giving recognition where 

sustainability progress has been made. We convey 

our concern that the ever increasing support 

for blanket palm oil boycotts may prove to be 

detrimental to the wider adoption of sustainable 

practices in the sector especially amongst smaller 

and locally-focussed companies.  

We understand the expectations from external 

stakeholders, in particular our NGO stakeholders, on 

meeting our commitments to removing deforestation 

from our palm oil supply chain. We have risen to 

this challenge since we pledged to do so in 2014 

as a signatory to the New York Declaration on 

Forests. Through active monitoring of our estates 

and suppliers, and then following through where

Welcome to Wilmar International’s 

2019 Sustainability Report.

Statement from the Board

To us, 

sustainability 

is core to our 

business and 

commercial 

strategies

It has been ten years since the publication of our first Sustainability Report in 2009. 

We started sustainability reporting years before it became a regulatory requirement in 

Singapore, as we saw that as critical to strengthening transparency and accountability 

for our stakeholders.

the rural communities we operate in, and we give 

back and support these communities through our 

Community Support Programme that provides 

funding for community health and safety, youth 

education and skills training, environmental efforts, 

and other youth and community initiatives. 

We continue to adapt our operations to help 

mitigate climate change. All our palm oil and sugar 

mills generate renewable energy from agriculture 

by-products such as palm kernel shells, palm fibre, 

and bagasse. In both Australia and India, our sugar 

mills generate enough power annually to not only 

meet our own energy needs, but also export enough 

surplus electricity to the national grid to power the 

equivalent of more than 110,000 homes a year. 

In India, we are encouraging our cane farmers to 

switch from chemical fertilisers to organic composts 

to minimise the impact of salt pan formation on the 

soil while reducing our carbon impact. Meanwhile 

we are continuing to research on and develop 

higher-yielding oil palm seedlings and we are 

working with oil palm smallholders to replant with 

higher yield varietals to help reduce the pressure 

of expansion of oil palm into potential forest areas.

Given the timing of this report, it would be remiss of 

us not to address one of the biggest challenges in 

modern times. As the COVID-19 pandemic tightens 

its grip, many of our employees, communities, and 

supply chains are struggling with disruption and 

hardship. Faced with an unprecedented crisis, we 

have committed to providing aid in the form of 

medical equipment, food supplies as well as financial 

contributions in China, Ghana, India, Indonesia, 

Malaysia, and Nigeria and will continue to support 

the ongoing fight against COVID-19. More than 

ever, as members of the agriculture sector, we play 

our role in supporting rural communities seriously 

by continuing to provide jobs and stable incomes to 

farming communities, critical access to healthcare, 

and being a core partner to local governments 

through infrastructure development and assistance. 

We would like to take this opportunity to extend 

our profound sympathies to all those who have 

been directly or indirectly affected during this 

deeply troubling time and to express our thanks 

and appreciation to frontline staff all over the world 

for their efforts in dealing with this pandemic.

In conclusion, we would like to express our heartfelt 

gratitude to all our partners and stakeholders who 

have supported our journey towards a sustainable 

palm oil and sugar industry and our objective 

to provide sustainable products whilst sharing 

the benefits of our success with the communities 

around us.

















deforestation non-compliance is found, we have 

removed 1.5 million hectares of non-compliant oil 

palm plantation areas from our supply chain. We 

therefore have confidence that we are on the right 

track to removing deforestation from our palm oil 

supply chain by 2020. 

Some of our most impactful achievements have 

centred on our supply chain. To date, over 90% 

of our group-level palm oil suppliers have either 

provided a written confirmation of their commitment 

to our NDPE policy, published their equivalent 

policy, reported on NDPE compliance via our 

supplier reporting tool platform, or become a 

member of the RSPO. This is a positive sign that 

the palm oil industry is reaffirming the need to 

adopt sustainable practices. For those that do not 

meet our sustainability requirements, we are not 

afraid of taking action and suspending companies 

at group level. However our approach is also a 

supportive one, and we continue to engage and 

provide guidance to assist suppliers to meet NDPE 

compliance. In our sugar business, we have started 

to develop our supplier programme which will 

initially focus on traceability. In Australia, we continue 

to maintain 100% traceability to originating sugar 

mill, while consolidating data and working towards 

reporting our traceability to mill for the entire sugar 

business in 2020.

We continue our partnerships with multi-stakeholders 

to expand our sustainability efforts at the grassroot, 

national and international levels. Since becoming a 

member of the RSPO in 2005, we have supported 

ongoing multi-stakeholder dialogue at all levels. 

Besides the RSPO, Wilmar’s active involvement 

in broader initiatives has achieved commendable 

progress. For example, we have actively engaged 

with the Tropical Forest Alliance, and more local 

issue-based partnerships like the Palm Oil and 

NGO Alliance (PONGO), the Fire Free Alliance, 

and ongoing business-to-business cooperation with 

suppliers and customers to support smallholder and 

community development. In our sugar business, 

we have been members of Bonsucro since 2014 

and have been actively pursuing certification and 

participating in the standard’s review. In Queensland, 

Australia, we also contribute to various regional 

cane grower agronomic support organisations, 

such as the Herbert Cane Productivity Services 

Ltd. where we serve on the Board. We also work 

with Solidaridad Asia in India to roll out a series of 

training programmes on best management practices 

for cane growers supplying our sugar mills in order 

to support the sustainability of smallholders.  

On the social front, we remain committed to 

protecting and enhancing human rights, as well 

as supporting the local communities in which we 

operate. Wilmar works in partnership with external 

organisations to support improvements to the lives 

of our local communities and smallholders. Our 

ethos is guided by the United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals, particularly in support of 

women, and children’s education and protection. 

Our newly adopted Women’s Charter sets out 

guidance in safeguarding women’s rights and 

creating an equitable and inclusive workplace for 

our female employees. We also continue to work 

with suppliers, smallholders, and local communities 

to ensure that children have access to good quality 

education and are never engaged in plantation 

or other work. Our sugar mills in Queensland, 

Australia, have operated for over 100 years in

INTEGRATED AGRIBUSINESS 

Wilmar’s entire agricultural commodity value 

chain is driven by a resilient business model 

ranging from processing to branding, to 

merchandising and distribution. We are 

able to achieve operational synergies and 

cost efficiencies through scale, integration, 

and logistical advantages. Our pioneering 

approach has allowed us to transform 

the industry towards sustainable growth 

throughout our entire operations—and 

beyond.

FINANCIAL AND EMPLOYEE HIGHLIGHTS 

The Group recorded a 15% increase in 

net profit to US$ 1.29 billion in FY2019, 

led by strong performances from Tropical 

Oils and Consumer Products. Overall sales 

volume for FY2019 climbed by 3.8% but 

lower commodity prices resulted in a 4.2% 

decline in revenue to US$ 42.64 billion.

REVENUE 2015-2019 (US$ MILLION)

NET PROFIT 2015 - 2019 (US$ MILLION)

FY2017 figures were restated upon 

adoption of SFRS (I) 9 Financial 

Instruments, SFRS (I) 15 Revenue 

from Contracts with Customers 

and IFRS Convergence. FY2018 

figures were restated subsequent 

to the finalisation of purchase 

price allocation exercise for 

the acquisition of SRSL and its 

subsidiaries.

NOTE:

Our operations

PALM OIL OPERATIONS

Wilmar is one of the world’s largest oil 

palm plantation owners, managing 232,490 

hectares of planted area and 45 mills in 

Indonesia, East Malaysia7, Ghana and 

Nigeria. In Indonesia, nine of these mills 

are independent of estates8, and purchase 

100% fresh fruit bunches (FFB) from third-

party suppliers. 

In 2019 our total planted area has increased 

by 2,532 hectares due to increased planting 

at our estates in Nigeria and the acquisition 

of Laba Utama in Malaysia. Scheme 

smallholder planted areas have decreased 

by about 400 hectares as the commitments 

set out with these clusters were completed in 

2019. They are now part of our independent 

smallholder supply base.

Our subsidiaries and associates account for 

over 250 refineries, oleochemical plants, 

specialty fat plants and biodiesel plants that 

process crude palm oil (CPO) and lauric oil 

from our own operations and third-party 

suppliers. The total processing capacities 

of these facilities ranges from one to 30 

million metric tonnes per year, including 

both palm oil and soft oils.

SUGAR OPERATIONS

As one of the world’s top ten raw sugar 

producers, Wilmar manages 7,440 hectares 

of planted sugarcane area. 92% is located 

in Queensland, Australia, with the rest in 

Myanmar. Wilmar also operates 17 mills 

throughout Australia, India and Myanmar. 

Since June 2018 we also have interests in 

India, having acquired 58% of Mumbai-

based Shree Renuka Sugars Limited (SRSL). 

In 2019 our sugarcane yield was 87.6 metric 

tonnes per hectare (MT/ha) in Australia and 

51.2 MT/ha in Myanmar. Compared to 2018, 

there was a 26% fall in yield at our Myanmar 

operations due to less rainfall thereby 

contributing to dry weather conditions 

affecting cane growth. 

Wilmar operates seven sugar refineries 

across Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia 

and India with a total processing capacity 

of four million MT per year. Our refineries 

in Australia are part of a joint venture. 

We operate seven mills and one refinery in 

Morocco through associate companies14.

Guided by our Board Diversity Policy, 

Wilmar values the benefits a diverse board 

brings to the organisation. Our directors are 

drawn from a wide range of backgrounds 

with diverse skills, qualifications, and 

industry-relevant experience. In February 

2019 we appointed the first female 

director to the Board. In December a new 

independent non-executive director joined 

the Board, totalling 13 members with a 

majority of seven independent directors.

In August 2019, all Board members attended 

an environmental, social and governance 

(ESG) group sustainability training session, 

delivered by Wilmar’s General Manager – 

Group Sustainability.

Wilmar is committed to upholding the highest standards of 

corporate governance. Anchored by strong leadership, effective 

internal controls, and accountability to stakeholders, our Board of 

Directors is responsible for the strategic direction of the Group. 

The Board is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 

Mr Kuok Khoon Hong and is supported by key management 

teams responsible for executing the strategy and operations of 

the Group.

Governance and management 

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE 

AND MANAGEMENT

At the heart of Wilmar’s strategic 

management and decision-making is our 

commitment to sustainability. Our No 

Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation 

(NDPE) policy provides a blueprint for our 

palm oil operations. Other sustainability-

related policies and frameworks guide 

our global operations. These cover the 

environment, health and safety, equal 

opportunities, human rights, labour rights, 

child protection, and food safety. 

Wilmar’s sustainability department is 

spearheaded by the Chief Sustainability 

Officer, led by the Group Sustainability 

General Manager and staffed by over sixty 

employees worldwide. The department 

is responsible for implementation of 

the Group’s sustainability strategies. A 

combination of local and technical expertise 

throughout South East Asia, Africa and 

Europe enables the department to oversee 

implementation of the NDPE policy, the 

principles of the United Nations Global 

Compact (UNGC), sustainability certification, 

supply chain monitoring, stakeholder 

engagement, and reporting.

Sustainability policies are overseen by the 

chairman and CEO and supported by the 

Board’s Risk Management Committee on a 

quarterly basis through review of detailed 

reporting and emerging issues. A Technical 

Advisory Group and Suspension Committee 

work with our operations and communication 

teams to execute implementation of the 

NDPE policy and evaluate progress. Local 

teams in Indonesia and Malaysia also exist 

to provide on-the-ground support to third-

party suppliers. We also engage externally 

with partners and specialists to support 

implementation of the NDPE policy and 

supply chain compliance. 

Wilmar continuously reviews and enhances 

key sustainability performance indicators to 

further strengthen our governance practices.

ESG PRACTICES AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE SDGS

Decisions and actions are guided by 

exemplary ESG practices. These stem from 

four key value pillars: conserving forests and 

species, reducing climate change impacts, 

giving back to the people, and maintaining 

a sustainable business.

However, we are faced with challenges 

such as scarce natural resources, wavering 

financial markets, limitations to local 

buying power and the need for qualified 

talent. Consequently, Wilmar’s business 

case necessitates harnessing the United 

Nations Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs) and creating opportunities to address 

these challenges. In 2017 we identified 

and aligned our ESG framework with the 

SDGs. These global objectives form the 

backbone of the Agenda for Sustainable 

Development, a shared plan—adopted 

in 2015 by 193 countries—with a goal of 

eradicating worldwide poverty and achieving 

sustainable development by 2030.

By reviewing the SDGs' underlying targets, 

and identifying our key strengths and areas 

of impact, we have designated five SDG 

objectives to strive for:

Our Code of Conduct addresses concerns 

around conflict of interest, and bribery 

and corruption while our Code of Ethics 

promotes moral and ethical standards 

expected of our employees. We also have 

a specific Anti-Fraud Policy identifying 

fraudulent acts and repercussions of 

dishonest and deceptive behaviour, and 

a Privacy Policy on how personal data is 

safeguarded. Our 2018 Whistleblowing 

Policy encourages employees to report 

suspected wrongdoing, knowing that their 

concerns will be taken seriously and their 

confidentiality respected.

In 2019 there were no reported incidents 

of anti-competitive behaviour, monopolistic 

practice, corruption or ongoing corruption 

legal cases. Wilmar does not condone 

lobbying practices, nor do we make any 

political contributions. There were also no 

significant incidents of non-compliance 

with any relevant environmental and socio-

economic laws or regulations in our locations 

of operations covered in this report.

All employees at our Singapore headquarters 

received internal training on the above 

policies and other key topics such as 

guidance on money laundering, trade 

compliance, and sanctions. These training 

materials were also shared with Wilmar’s 

global offices with the aim of a global rollout.

Wilmar endeavours to uphold the highest levels of integrity and 

ethical standards through instilling a culture of group personal 

responsibility.

Our approach to sustainability

Sustainability continues to 

be a fundamental aspect in 

our operations and business 

strategies. 

We understand that ending deforestation 

is essential in mitigating the risks of climate 

change, which is among the reasons 

Wilmar became a signatory of the New 

York Declaration on Forests (NYDF)15. 

In 2019, at the NYDF 5th Anniversary and 

Leadership Event, Wilmar was among the 

few private sector players invited to share 

our experiences and challenges in leading 

the sustainability-driven transformational 

change for the palm oil industry, together 

with the complexities and on-ground 

realities.

We persist to meet our 2020 aspirations and 

our sustainability commitments, despite the 

challenges we face, through our endeavours, 

which include further intensifying our efforts, 

channelling additional resources, capacity 

building as well as investing in innovation 

and improvements.

Part of these endeavours include fortifying 

and improving our own operations, further 

strengthening our supply chains to be even 

more compliant to our NDPE policy and 

collaborating with stakeholders to identify 

potential gaps and to develop solutions.

Besides oil palm plantation management, 

Wilmar monitors palm oil deriving from 

over 20* million hectares of land. While 

eliminating deforestation in our vast and 

complex supply chain has been our primary 

focus, we recognise it is a monumental task 

for any organisation to achieve in isolation. 

Nevertheless, we are making significant 

progress in transitioning our supply chain 

palm producers away from deforestation. 

Guided by our No Deforestation, No 

Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) policy, we 

are resolute in continuing to work closely

Wilmar International Limited   |  Sustainability Report 2019

In our previous sustainability reports, we 

shared our intentions for our NDPE policy 

updates to include provisions to cover our 

sugar business. However, following several 

consultations and further consideration, it 

was agreed that it would be more effective 

to separate the policy frameworks given the 

distinct complexities and material issues 

specific to each sector. Thus, in 2020 we 

aim to develop a dedicated programme and 

framework to address critical sustainability 

issues in the sugar industry.

STRENGTHENING POLICIES AND GUIDANCE

We focused on strengthening our policies and guidance to our sustainability commitments 

in 2019, particularly in relation to our palm businesses and supply chain.

In November 2019 we updated our NDPE 

policy to capture and reflect the many 

developments that have taken place since 

the first policy launched in 2013. The 

Consortium of Resource Experts (CORE), 

non-governmental organisations and 

other partners helped examined the policy 

followed by key stakeholders being informed 

via two public town hall sessions. Our 

suppliers have also been specially informed 

of the changes. Our commitments reflected 

in the various sections of this report align 

with language in the current policy.

Any refinery, mill or 

plantation that we own, 

manage or invest in 

(including those of our 

subsidiaries) regardless

Revised grievance mechanism

In June 2019, we updated our Grievance Procedure to better support the implementation of 

our NDPE policy. The updates incorporated elements contained within the Joint Statement 

published in December 2018, specifically on the cut-off date for deforestation and peat 

development as of 31 December 2015. Any new verified deforestation occurring after 

1 January 2019 would therefore be subject to immediate suspension of the supplier at 

group-level. We are also developing a protocol to identify NDPE policy non-compliance 

based on our No Exploitation of People and Local Communities commitments that 

warrant action and oversight additional to what is set out in the Grievance Procedure.

New guidance on human rights and women

In May 2019, we published our Human Rights Framework  as well as our Women’s Charter. 

While both documents provide our approach for Wilmar-owned operations, the Human 

Rights Framework Policy Statement is applicable to both our operations and suppliers.

CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION

RSPO

To provide traceable and certified sustainable palm oil and sugar, Wilmar supports 

relevant sustainability certification schemes and works diligently to achieve and maintain 

compliance for our upstream and downstream operations. 

One mill in West Kalimantan, PT. Agro Nusa 

Investama (ANI) Sambas (Kumpai), achieved 

the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 

(RSPO) re-certification in 2019. Although PT. 

Kencana Sawit Indonesia in West Sumatra 

was scheduled to achieve re-certification in 

2019, audits were carried out in September 

and certification was achieved in March 

2020. We will continue working to achieve 

certification for the remaining mills as we 

face delays in finalising Hak Guna Usaha 

(HGU) (operation permits). These delays are 

a result of the revised legality requirements 

set out by the RSPO in June 2018. 

With the recertification of PT. ANI Sambas 

achieved in 2019, 26 of our 36 operations 

have achieved certification, totalling a 

certified RSPO area of 234,396 hectares. 

This amounts to 77% of our total area 

certifiable. This includes our certified plasma 

smallholders linked to four of our operations 

in Indonesia and Ghana. In 2019, our mills 

produced approximately 720,800* metric 

tonnes (MT) of certified sustainable palm 

oil (CSPO) and around 161,400* MT of 

certified sustainable palm kernel (CSPK)—an 

additional 5.9% of CSPO and 8.4% of CSPK 

compared to 2018. We target to complete 

RSPO certification for all our own palm oil 

mills by 2023. 

As of December 2019, all our refineries have 

achieved certification across all regions, 

except for 14 remaining operations in China. 

We are on track to achieve certification in 

2020 in line with our target to complete 

RSPO certification for all our own palm oil 

refineries in 2020.18

Around 4.5% of all the palm oil products 

we handle, trade and process are RSPO 

certified.

Wilmar has implemented an automatic certification provision for our downstream 

operations. This means that any newly acquired refinery is automatically scheduled 

for RSPO certification. Being RSPO certified upon acquisition contributes to achieving 

Wilmar’s target of 100% certification by 2020 for all our downstream operations where 

we have majority management control.

18 This covers 107 refineries in all 

countries we have downstream 

operations. Apart from Indonesia 

and Malaysia, where we have 

64 certified refineries, these fall 

outside the scope of this report.

Working together 

is important for 

transformation of 

the palm oil sector.

Sustainability

PepsiCo and Wilmar, along with other 

industry players, have been finding ways to 

work collaboratively on impact programmes 

and initiatives such as the Child Protection 

and Safeguarding Implementation Manual, 

the NDPE Implementation Reporting 

Framework (IRF), and Radar Monitoring 

Technology to Detect Deforestation (RADD) 

platform in order to stimulate change 

throughout the palm oil value chain. 

PepsiCo recognises the role that Wilmar 

plays in addressing systemic issues in 

the industry, including through good 

grievance management. In particular, 

Wilmar has a strong record of creating 

and following through on action plans to 

address grievances and employs a proactive 

monitoring and engagement mindset. 

Overall, Wilmar is very responsive and are 

always forthcoming in providing responses 

to any questions or concerns.

Wilmar’s continued commitment to work with 

like-minded partners will lead to beneficial 

results for the whole palm oil industry. We 

will continue to co-operate with Wilmar to 

apply these initiatives even more widely 

in the palm oil supply chain and for other 

crops and commodities being sourced by 

PepsiCo. 

About

PepsiCo is a global food and beverage 

company that sources palm oil from around 

the world and Wilmar is one of PepsiCo’s 

top three suppliers. Natasha is the global

SMARTCANE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP)

In 2019 three additional Wilmar-owned mills 

received Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil 

(ISPO) certification, bringing the total to 

11 mills—32% of our Indonesia upstream 

operations. This would translate to around 

163,550* MT and 41,970* MT of ISPO-

certified CPO and PK respectively. We target 

to achieve ISPO certification for all our own 

palm oil mills in Indonesia by 2023.

For independent mills, ISPO certification 

is only possible if 20% of the crop 

supplied by farmers is also certified 

20. Since 2017 we have assisted farmer 

co-operatives in achieving certification. 

This is conducted through integrated 

farmer guidance programmes, farmer 

organisation empowerment, and by 

separate implementation of a traceability 

programme. In 2019 four co-operatives 

successfully became certified across Riau 

and Jambi, signifying their capacity to 

comply with international sustainability 

criteria. As such, one independent mill was 

successfully certified in 2019 with three 

more receiving confirmation in March 2020 

of their ISPO certification but due to the 

COVID-19 situation, the official handover 

ceremony has been postponed for the 

time being. We target to complete ISPO 

certification audits for our ten independent 

mills in Indonesia by 2023.

In Malaysia, our ninth mill achieved 

Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) 

certification in May 2019, prior to the 

mandated government cut-off date of 31 

December 2019. This allows us to have a 

total certified production capacity of around 

202,300* MT of MSPO-certified CPO and 

39,700* MT of MSPO-certified PK. In 2019, 

Wilmar acquired a new estate, Laba Utama, 

in Sabah, making it the last remaining site 

to achieve MSPO certification, which we 

aim to carry out in 2020. Consequently, 

we have updated our 2019 target for all of 

our Malaysia mills21 and estates to achieve 

100% MSPO certification by 2020.

Of our downstream operations in Malaysia, 

all of our palm oil processing facilities 

(refineries, kernel crushing plants, biodiesel 

and oleochemical plants) are MSPO Supply 

Chain Certification Standard (SCCS) certified 

– refineries that are under the cooking oil 

price stabilisation scheme (COSS) achieved 

certification by April 2019 while the 

remaining facilities achieved certification 

by year-end. 

Three additional downstream operations 

achieved International Sustainability and 

Carbon Certification (ISCC) certification 

in 2019. Our total number of ISCC-

certified operations cover 20 mills and 17 

downstream operations including refineries, 

biodiesel plants, bulking terminals and 

warehouses certified across Malaysia and 

Indonesia, and one trader in Singapore. 22

Out of our total sugarcane planted areas in 

Australia, 55.6% is certified in compliance 

with Bonsucro Production Standards, 

including three raw sugar mills. We also 

have certified downstream operations in 

Australia, New Zealand and Singapore in 

line with the Bonsucro Chain of Custody 

certification.

In 2019, one additional farm was accredited 

by Smartcane BMP, now totalling three farm 

areas in Burdekin, Herbert and Proserpine. 

In 2019 we began the process to accredit 

the remaining farms at Plane Creek, with 

an objective of completing this by 2020.

INNOVATION AND YIELD IMPROVEMENT

Wilmar invests significantly in research and 

development (R&amp;D) to find new ways of 

boosting our performance while ensuring 

that we continue to produce our palm oil 

responsibly and sustainably. Improving 

our productivity, increasing our yields, and 

optimising our use of resources are all vital 

as we work towards fulfilling global palm oil 

demands. It is also imperative that our R&amp;D 

initiatives are focused on ensuring our crops 

are more resilient and better able to adapt 

to actual and expected climate change. This 

includes harnessing innovative solutions with 

a focus on reducing our use of resources 

and improving process efficiency to lessen 

greenhouse gas emissions. We however 

do not believe in growing or producing 

genetically modified organism (GMO) crops 

and do not use GMOs in our palm and sugar 

production processes.

For our sugar plantations, we invested in R&amp;D efforts aimed at increasing farm productivity 

in our milling regions, and the broader Australian sugar industry. We are focusing our 

current research on the development of guidelines for the use of sugar milling by-products: 

mill mud and ash. This involves testing the best ways to apply mill mud and ash to reduce 

the potential loss of nutrients from the farms while potentially increasing the profits of 

sugarcane growers who are our suppliers. The research is being conducted at 13 trial 

sites across Australia, making it one of our biggest trials. 

SEE SECTION ON OPTIMISING CHEMICAL USE FOR A CASE STUDY ON 

CONTROLLING RAT POPULATIONS USING BARN OWLS

Increasing farm productivity using mill by-products  

We have been conducting joint research with Orillion, a New Zealand-based pest control 

expert, on a new rodenticide initiative to support our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 

programme. We have tested the rat bait preferences in a small enclosure and will expand 

the programme to a wider area.

Through a joint project with University Putra Malaysia (UPM) in Labuk, Sabah, we introduced 

non-native barn owls for biological control of the rat population and as a way of minimising 

the use of rat bait. Throughout 2019, we initiated a staged release of ten owls into our 

estates where  they  roam freely  in hope that they will eventually propagate and make 

homes in strategically-placed nesting boxes. In the near future, we will acquire more barn 

owls from UPM to fast track this biological control programme.

R&amp;D to support our IPM programme

Since 2009 we have collaborated with Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory to conduct 

research on using genetic screening to shorten the palm breeding cycle. We have made 

significant progress to date and are in the process of field-testing selected genetic markers 

against FFB yields in sampled palms. If it proves successful, this research may enable us 

to halve the breeding process time compared to conventional methods.

In 2019 we began commercial trials on mechanical wheelbarrows to assist in-field 

evacuation of crops during harvesting. This could also be helpful during a shortage of 

workers. We will test these wheelbarrows, known as ‘power barrows’ at selected estates 

with suitable terrain.

Third-party suppliers

We remain committed to implementing 

best practice within our own estates, but 

also recognise that a large part of our 

footprint lies beyond our operations. Our 

suppliers have a critical role to play in 

more sustainable and responsible palm 

oil production. As the world’s largest palm 

oil trader and one of the largest sugar 

operators, Wilmar is in a unique position to 

have a lasting impact on our supply chains. 

This potential for wider positive sustainability 

impact is the reason we allocate significant 

effort and resources in encouraging the 

industry towards responsible production.

OVERVIEW OF OUR SUPPLY CHAINS

56% of our total fresh fruit bunches (FFB) 

supply for Wilmar-owned mills come from 

third-party supplier plantations in Indonesia, 

Malaysia, Ghana and Nigeria (inclusive 

of independent smallholders). Of our 

total third-party FFB supply, 0.59% of it 

is RSPO-certified. More than 90% of the 

crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil 

(PKO) equivalent we procure comes from 

third-party direct supplier mills.

Palm oil suppliers

97% of our sugarcane comes from third-

party farmers and smallholders in Australia, 

Myanmar and India. Of our total third-party 

raw sugar sourced, 85% comes from major 

traders from Brazil, Thailand and Australia 

and the remaining 15% from India, South 

Africa and Latin American countries.

Sugar suppliers



TRACEABILITY

TRACEABILITY TO MILL DATA 

AS OF 31 DECEMBER 2019 24

Wilmar has both a responsibility and an 

opportunity to lead our supply chain towards 

more sustainable palm oil production. By 

tracing supply flows, we can map our supply 

base, evaluate supplier performance against 

our NDPE policy, and engage with suppliers 

to drive continuous improvement. We make 

our supply chain as transparent as possible 

to all stakeholders on our sustainability 

dashboard. While we previously updated 

this quarterly, we will now do so bi-annually 

because fluctuation between reporting 

periods is minimal.

As of December 2019, 96.2% of CPO 

and PKO equivalent is traceable to mill 

level.23 This translates to about 23.8 million 

tonnes of palm products traceable to mills 

across our global operations. Over 90% of 

volumes originate from third-party suppliers 

in Indonesia and Malaysia. 

In 2015, Wilmar committed to achieving 

full palm oil mill traceability for all volumes 

handled by our refineries. However, securing 

100% traceability continues to be extremely 

difficult due to the challenges of commodity 

transportation and trading structures within 

countries like China and India. We continue 

to work diligently with our suppliers to close 

this gap and have revised our target to 

100% traceability to palm oil mills by 2022.

As of year-end 2019, approximately 15% of our third-

party supplying mills within our global supply chain 

are traceable to plantation level. We have achieved 

100% traceability to plantation for all Wilmar-owned 

palm oil mills across our global operations based 

on the set criteria. However, pursuing traceability 

to plantation for third-party direct supplier mills is 

significantly more complex. It is an extremely resource-

intensive exercise, and many smaller companies do 

not have the means to carry it out. In December 2019, 

there was a breakthrough whereby RSPO member 

concession maps in Malaysia were made public 

via the GeoRSPO platform. However, challenges 

remain for non-RSPO members and some Indonesia 

suppliers because of recent changes in regulations 

prohibiting public availability of maps. We continue 

to engage with relevant stakeholders to address 

these restrictions. Despite this, Wilmar continually 

looks for more meaningful approaches to monitor 

its suppliers to address issues of deforestation and 

fire use via platforms such as our Supplier Group 

Compliance Programme.

For our sugar division, our primary focus has been on 

tracing raw sugar sourced from third-party suppliers 

for our own refineries. We have achieved 100% 

traceability to mill for both origin refineries in Australia 

since 2018.

Due diligence for potential new suppliers

A thorough due diligence process is 

undertaken for 100% of our potential 

supplying mills before it is eligible to enter 

Wilmar’s supply chain. The process covers 

various environmental and social criteria, 

and allows for collating of information on 

various aspects, including but not limited to: 

• 

Public information of potential non-

compliances or grievances.

• 

Location and proximity to forest and 

peat landscape risks through concession 

maps or supply chain sourcing 

information.

• 

Legal compliance.

• 

Traceability data.

• 

High Conservation Value (HCV) and 

High Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA) 

assessments, where applicable.

This process is important to mitigate the risk 

of potential breaches to our NDPE policy. If 

the company has been involved in an activity 

that is in breach of our commitments, we will 

seek clarification from them in order to be 

able to close the issue or agree on an action 

plan that meets our requirements before 

we begin sourcing from them. Unless the 

company has already published and adopted 

our NDPE policy in their operations, they 

are required to provide written confirmation 

of our NDPE policy. 

Assessing existing suppliers with the 

Supplier Reporting Tool

Wilmar assesses all mills that are already 

part of our supply chain annually. We use 

our Supplier Reporting Tool (SRT) to screen 

them for environmental and social risks. This 

includes both direct suppliers and Wilmar-

owned mills, which we identify based on the 

previous year’s procurement data. Once our 

suppliers have completed the SRT online, 

via the OnConnect system, they will receive 

a report with an individualised action plan. 

This ensures greater consistency in providing 

recommendations and secures clarity on the 

required follow-up procedures. This allows 

for improved sustainability performance of 

our direct third-party suppliers.

Since its launch in 2017, the SRT has been 

rolled out to our suppliers in Indonesia, 

Malaysia, Honduras, Guatemala, and 

Colombia. Out of our 899 suppliers from 

2018, 470* completed SRTs were submitted 

as of December 2019. This accounts for 

52.3% of the supply base. 

Our SRT allows us to collate reports on 

specific NDPE related criteria as reported by 

each supplier mill. Based on these reports, 

we can then identify potential risks of our 

direct mill suppliers. The criteria that is 

reported on includes:



SUPPLIER ASSESSMENTS

Adopting a group-level 25 

approach towards supply chain 

transformation

ENGAGING SUPPLIERS ON OUR 

NDPE COMMITMENTS 

Our NDPE policy applies to all third-party 

suppliers at group level, with no exceptions. 

During the year, Wilmar focused on 

communicating our NDPE commitments, 

which was updated in 2019, to our suppliers 

as we continue to address deforestation 

in our global supply chains. We have had 

formal engagements with all our Group-

level palm oil suppliers. As of December 

2019, over 90% of our suppliers have either: 

• 

provided written confirmation to 

Wilmar’s NDPE policy

• 

published their own NDPE policies

• 

reported NDPE compliance via our 

SRT platform, or 

• 

are a member of the RSPO.

Since the December 2013 launch of our 

NDPE policy, action and engagement 

extends beyond our direct mill suppliers 

to also include the supplier at group level. 

This refers to any parent company group 

(or their subsidiaries) that Wilmar has a 

palm oil sourcing business relationship. It 

is part of our commitment to encouraging 

industry-wide sustainability and forms the 

bedrock of our belief that accountability 

means we must be answerable not only for 

our own actions but for those of others too.

While our efforts on traceability and supplier 

assessments are undertaken at mill level, 

our Supplier Group Compliance Programme 

and Grievance Procedure complements 

this approach.

25 We use the RSPO definition for ‘group’ until clear 

internal guidelines for interpretation of rules and 

legislation is complete.

—an Android based mobile application 

developed to automate sugarcane 

procurement and management systems 

by providing real time input. 

The application allows supplier data to 

be captured and stored and is particularly 

useful as our suppliers are predominantly 

smallholder farmers in India. This includes 

grower names, addresses, bank account 

information, type of plantation, soil type, 

irrigation methods used, machine harvesting 

(if any), and crop test results. With all field 

data captured, we can generate online 

business reports and controls for review. 

The benefits of this systems include:

• 

GPS-based area calculation providing 

more precise locations for cane 

availability.

• 

An ability for growers to report and 

for buyers to assess cane quality for 

procurement decisions.

• 

Ongoing access to master data and 

real time reports on any web browser-

supported device.

• 

Battery-operated Bluetooth printers 

used to issue real-time harvesting 

orders. The printers help to overcome 

electrical load shedding at villages and 

minimise maintenance.

• 

Elimination of data entry errors.

Tracing our sugarcane

suppliers in India via the

Drishticane app

To support providing suppliers with guidance in implementing our NDPE policy, we assess 

potential non-compliance, evaluate progress and help identify areas for improvement.

READ MORE ON OUR SRT

To ensure suppliers can demonstrate their 

commitments in accordance with our NDPE 

policy, we regularly provide capacity building 

training programmes and access to relevant 

facilities. A notable palm oil engagement in 

2019 included our support of third-party FFB 

suppliers in Malaysia to help achieve MSPO 

certification by the government-mandated 

deadline of 31 December 2019. With our 

help, 18 FFB suppliers covering 25,223 

hectares of plantation successfully achieved 

certification and can now provide around 

500,000 metric tonnes of certified FFB.

For our sugar operations, we continually 

engage with suppliers on Bonsucro 

certification standards and work with 

buyers to provide them with sustainability 

information such as traceability data required 

from their customers.

In 2019, we continued our work to develop 

relationships between sugarcane growers 

and Wilmar millers in Australia. We have 

improved communications through 

dialogue and regular updates. This included 

distributing bi-annual newsletters to growers, 

publishing weekly mill production reports, 

and reaching out to communicate any 

operational or cane supply issues. We also 

conduct frequent face-to-face sessions with 

growers. This includes tours of our mills and 

sugar terminals, pre-season information 

forums, sessions on innovative pricing and 

pooling options, and workshops carried out 

with subject matter experts to discuss current 

and anticipated trends in the sugar market. 

In India, SRSL also engages with cane sugar 

suppliers to adopt best management 

practice in sugarcane farming to address 

issues such as grub menace, striga weed 

and vermi-compositing. 

In 2019 we invested over US$ 57,000 

on grower engagement programmes in 

Australia and India.

SUPPLIER CAPACITY BUILDING

within our operations and across our wider 

supply chain, covering mills and plantations 

owned by our subsidiaries or suppliers.

Since 2017 we have worked with Verité and 

Mars—a global consumer goods company—

to pilot a human rights programme in our 

extended supply chain, based on existing 

supplier information and findings from 

supplier assessments. The available supplier 

information, which was then added to via 

SRT reporting in 2018, created a detailed 

roadmap in the Pasir Gudang landscape 

in Peninsular Malaysia. The input received 

from Verité helped to identify practical 

interventions for suppliers, and also helped 

define how Wilmar’s third-party compliance 

team were taking forward human rights 

related issues more effectively with suppliers. 

The intent therefore is to help scale more 

rapidly and identify solutions for common 

labour challenges in the palm oil industry.

In 2019, we conducted six site visits to 

our supplier operations. These partners 

have supported labour development and 

the indicators for our SRT and the Nimbly 

audit tool. We have also developed criteria 

for when labour and social findings are 

triggered as critical aspects requiring more 

urgent intervention. This programme is set 

to continue in 2020.

Assessing risks related to

supply chain human rights

The SRT enables us to identify and 

screen for potential human right risks

Wilmar International Limited   |  Sustainability Report 2019

Sustainability Report 2019  |  Wilmar International Limited 

In June 2019, we published an updated 

version of Wilmar’s Grievance Procedure, 

which was first introduced in January 2015, 

after a process of consultation with NGOs 

and subject experts. Apart from streamlining 

the document, the grievance mechanism 

now more succinctly addresses NDPE non-

compliances. We have communicated this 

updated procedure to all our suppliers. 

The updated Grievance Procedure is 

also available in Bahasa Indonesia for our 

Indonesian stakeholders. 

Concurrently in 2019 we also started the 

development of a No Exploitation specific 

grievance protocol. The development has so 

far involved two rounds of multi-stakeholder 

consultations. The No Exploitation 

Protocol is being drafted to support 

Wilmar’s Grievance Procedure to address 

objections regarding the implementation 

of our No Exploitation of People and Local 

Communities commitments set out within 

the NDPE policy. This protocol identifies 

non-compliances that warrant action and 

oversight additional to those described 

in the Grievance Procedure. We target to 

establish the No Exploitation Protocol to 

support the Grievance Procedure by Q3 

2020. 

A separate multi-stakeholder process 

coordinated under Mighty Earth’s Sundaland 

process in 2019 intended to produce 

‘industry accepted re-entry criteria’ that 

would allow previously suspended suppliers 

to rejoin NDPE supply chains. However, 

the stakeholders in the Sundaland process 

working group could not agree on the 

adoption of all the criteria. The undisputed 

portion of the re-entry criteria from the 

Sundaland process has since been adopted 

by Wilmar. 

We have increased our reporting capabilities 

for our new Grievance Procedure. Wilmar 

continuously target to achieve a 100% 

response rate for all grievances raised, 

and are working to resolve all open cases 

effectively and amicably.

Engaging suppliers post suspension

Since 2015, we have suspended 26 parent 

companies (managing 2.2 million hectares 

of oil palm plantations and 69 mills) from 

our supply chain due to non-compliance 

with our NDPE policy, 22 of which were 

related to deforestation. As of December 

2019, 10 out of the 26 parent companies 

(managing 0.7 million hectares of oil palm 

plantations) met Wilmar’s re-entry criteria 

while 16 parent companies (managing 1.5 

million26 hectares of oil palm plantations) 

remain on our suspension list. 

It is estimated that 6.4 million hectares have 

been spared from oil palm development 

in Indonesia. This is largely attributed 

to the individual NDPE commitments of 

key companies, alongside government 

policies 27. To avoid any suspension from 

inadvertently contributing to a growing 

unsustainable market or negatively 

impacting oil palm smallholders, Wilmar 

sees post-suspension engagement as crucial, 

enabling us to assist suppliers in bringing 

their operations to compliance.

Through corrective measures and action, 

suspended suppliers can re-enter our supply 

chain. For clarity, we have published criteria 

with tangible measures for re-engagement, 

otherwise known as ‘Minimum requirements 

for supply chain re-entry after suspension 

due to no deforestation and/or no peatland 

(NDP) non-compliance’. It is the suspended 

supplier’s ability to meet these requirements 

that determines the resolution of their non-

compliance status and any potential return 

to our supply chain. The document was 

finalised and published on our website in 

Q3 2019.

We guide our suppliers to close the gaps 

identified by sharing documentation, 

assisting suppliers to develop standard 

operating procedures (SOP) and 

sustainability policies, and helping to 

conduct field assessments that inform 

supplier compliance.

Sustainability Report 2019  |  Wilmar International Limited 



In June 2018, Greenpeace released a 

report linking GAMA Plantation Group to 

deforestation and peat clearance practices. 

Wilmar responded by suspending trade 

immediately with all companies identified 

within this group, thus triggering a 

spate of remedial actions. These former 

independent companies (consolidated into 

GAMA Plantation Group and now known 

as KPN Plantation) operate around 20 mills 

over a planted area of 200,000 hectares 

in the Indonesian regions of Sumatra, 

Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Papua. In 2019, 

KPN Plantation—in collaboration with 

Aidenvironment Asia—embarked on a 

multi-year process to implement their new 

NDPE policy. So far, they have undertaken 

remediation actions to restore riparian areas 

and develop Recovery Plans in Kubu Raya, 

Sambas, Jambi and Merauke, with a focus 

on social forestry programmes.

In early 2019, Wilmar and Nestlé carried 

out a site visit in Papua to witness the 

implementation of their NDPE policy, 

Recovery Plans and understand issues 

and challenges in the implementation. As a 

sign of faith in the progress made by KPN 

Plantations, Nestlé publicly reinstated the 

group into their supply chain in early 2019.

A 2015 Greenomics report uncovered 

deforestation in the biodiversity-rich 

region of Leuser of North Sumatra that 

was linked to the Mopoli Raya Group, which 

at the time was a Wilmar supplier. Wilmar 

subsequently suspended the group that 

year. Following their suspension, Mopoli 

agreed to a moratorium on land clearance 

in compliance with Wilmar’s NDPE policy. 

A registered assessor was subsequently 

engaged to conduct an HCS assessment 

and HCV pre-identification.

Wilmar’s ongoing involvement—with 

support of the Earthworm Foundation—

has helped Mopoli Raya to navigate 

tenurial conflicts and illegal community 

logging. Mopoli Raya has since announced 

their own NDPE policy and established 

a sustainability team to lead on their 

commitments.

RAYA’S JOURNEY

We require supplier groups with non-compliant forest 

clearing and peat development after the cut-off date 

of 31 December 2015 to submit Recovery Plans to 

address issues on these past non-compliance(s). 

Recovery Plans may include protecting and restoring 

ecosystems or assisting local communities to secure 

social forestry rights. Wilmar’s sustainability teams 

engage and support our suppliers throughout 

this process. Currently, there are no industry-wide 

accepted criteria for what constitutes an adequate 

Recovery Plan. In 2019, through a group process 

convened by the Mighty Earth, Wilmar worked with 

other palm oil companies and NGOs to define such 

criteria. Working group discussions are ongoing.

Addressing non-compliance 

through recovery plans

Wilmar acknowledges that establishing 

a deforestation-free supply chain from 

2020 onwards requires the provision of 

remediation measures.

Successfully re-engaging

As part of our full supplier compliance verification framework—and in addition to our 

SRT and grievance mechanism—Wilmar also launched the Supplier Group Compliance 

Programme (SGCP) in December 2013 to proactively monitor risk of association at supplier 

group level. This proactive monitoring programme is delivered by Aidenvironment Asia 

(now known as Earth Equalizer). The platform provides deforestation and fire alerts 

that are directly actionable, as the occurrences are directly linked to the concessions 

and companies that own them. The platform, therefore, enables us to better identify 

deforestation or peat development non-compliance occurring within our supply chain.

The programme currently monitors over 20* million hectares and covers over 500 parent 

groups of company-owned or managed lands both within and beyond Wilmar’s existing 

supply chain. Any verified deforestation will trigger the grievance procedure.

METHODOLOGY

The biggest challenge we face on 

the ground is having to balance our 

sustainability commitments with the 

needs of the communities in areas we 

operate in.

As most of KPN’s plantations are in rural 

areas where economic development is 

limited, communities rely on KPN to help 

develop the local economy. Except for the 

company’s established operations, KPN 

plantation development is now limited. 

When we began our NDPE journey in 2018, 

KPN faced difficulties in enforcing a work-

stop order until we conducted full HCV 

and HCS assessments. At the operation 

sites, members of local communities who 

were employed by KPN were conducting 

land clearing activities—which were halted. 

Consequently, KPN had a responsibility to 

find alternative roles within its operations for 

the local community. The abrupt transition 

posed significant challenges for KPN, 

especially during the initial three months.

Fortunately, with support from the rest 

of our stakeholders as well as through 

open dialogue and engagement efforts, 

community members understood the 

necessity of halting clearing activities during 

the transition period in order to manage the 

company’s sustainability commitments. With 

support from KPN, the transition period 

also enabled workers to develop new skills.

During this challenging period, Wilmar 

provided us with the necessary support. 

This included observing progress on-site, 

discussing programmes, and providing 

feedback for improvement as required. 

Today, KPN and affected communities 

have made significant progress towards 

overcoming this hurdle. Noting the reduction 

in total planted area due to our NDPE policy 

requirements, an additional challenge was 

the time community members needed—

many of whom live day-to-day and therefore 

face unrelenting pressures—to understand 

and adapt to long-term programmes. An 

example of these programmes includes 

fish-farming projects which were introduced 

by KPN to offer long-term benefits for 

community members. Besides being a food 

source, the intended outcome was to enable 

the community to rely on aquaculture as an 

alternative source of income. Although it was 

a time-consuming effort, the community now 

understands the benefits of the programme 

and appreciates its value in improving their 

livelihood.

About

In June 2018, Greenpeace (GP) released 

a report in which a group of companies, 

together as GAMA Plantation Group, had 

identified breaches to Wilmar’s NDPE 

policy commitments. The report implicated 

three plantation companies in particular for 

deforestation and peat clearance activities. 

Wilmar has never sourced from these said 

plantations. However, because of GP 

report’s findings, on 22 June 2018 Wilmar 

suspended all companies that were listed 

as GAMA Plantation Group. Full support 

and commitment from top management 

have played a pivotal role in getting 

GAMA Plantation Group (known as KPN 

Plantation since October 2019) to commit 

and implement the NDPE policy across their 

oil palm operations. Wilmar reinstated KPN 

Plantation as a supplier in 2019.

In October 2019, Wilmar joined nine 

other palm oil producers and buyers at a 

landscape level to support and fund the 

development of a new, publicly available, 

radar-based forest monitoring system known 

as Radar Alerts for Detecting Deforestation 

(RADD). This partnership will make it easier 

for companies and other stakeholders to 

identify signs of deforestation in near real 

time and with greater accuracy, beginning 

with Indonesia and Malaysia. With this 

information, we can mobilise rapid follow-

up actions on the ground.

Managing climate change risks

One of our focus areas is managing the 

impacts of climate change due to excess 

GHG emissions. There is a need for an 

urgent reduction of GHG emissions by 

7.6% per year from 2020 to 2030 in order to 

meet the cap of a 1.5°C increase in global 

temperatures.28 Climate change, and the 

resulting rise in global temperatures, has 

a direct correlation to increasing pressure 

on fertile soils. This will lead to drastic 

challenges such as severe weather and 

concerns over food security. Wilmar 

understands the risks posed to agriculture, 

land use, food production and people and 

has significantly invested in resources and 

focused our initiatives to manage these risks 

in our operations and supply chain through:

• 

Climate change mitigation by 

employing policy and practices to 

reduce carbon emissions and land 

use change, and 

• 

Climate change adaptation by 

equipping operations and personnel 

with measures and programmes to 

manage the effects of climate change.

 Wilmar’s approach includes the elimination 

of peatland deforestation and development. 

We are also committed to best management 

practice for soils and peat. We reduce 

resource use and GHG emissions at Wilmar-

owned plantations by converting waste to 

renewable energy for fuel and composting 

as organic fertiliser. We also use sugar mill 

by-products to increase farm productivity; re-

use wastewater throughout the production 

process; have installed solar panels at plants 

and methane captures at palm oil mills; 

and employ other best practices. We also 

monitor land use change and hotspots; 

educate community members on fire risk; 

equip them with agronomy techniques; and 

invest in R&amp;D for high-resistant and high-

yield seeds to adapt to extreme weather. 

We expect our suppliers to adopt climate 

change mitigation and adaptation practices 

in accordance with our efforts to ensure 

NDPE compliance at group level.

In the face of unprecedented, 

interconnected environmental global 

challenges, we must take action to 

avoid negative consequences for the 

people and ecosystems that sustain 

us. Our practices are aligned with the 

components in SDG 15 (Life on land).

Wilmar supports 

landscape and 

jurisdictional approaches 

as alternative strategies 

to achieving sustainable 

practices at scale.

These approaches assist in aligning 

interests and coordinate actions 

among governments, businesses, local 

communities, and NGOs to address 

pertinent challenges such as land-use 

planning and tenure clarification, 

smallholder inclusion and production 

practices.

Wilmar is part of the Malaysian state of 

Sabah’s Jurisdictional Certification Steering 

Committee (JCSC), which functions to help 

the Sabah government to achieve its vision 

of producing 100% certified sustainable 

palm oil under RSPO certification by 2025. 

Wilmar has been part of the working group 

to map out HCV and HCS areas in the 

entire state of Sabah and has also provided 

input into the approach for smallholders 

in the state. As of late 2019, the JCSC 

has approved the setting up of a full-time 

secretariat to ensure the efforts of the 

state of Sabah stay on target. 

Wilmar is also a contributor to a 

jurisdictional approach initiative convened 

by the Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA), which 

aims to develop guidelines for sustainable 

production at a landscape level before 

being localised and adapted to applicable 

regions in South East Asia. Under this 

umbrella initiative we will work with our 

peers to support the programme and look 

into implementation in Sabah and the parts 

of Indonesia where we operate.

(HCVRN) and High Carbon Stock Approach 

(HCSA) toolkit guide identification of these 

areas. As of November 2018, the revised 

RSPO Principles and Criteria (P&amp;C) now 

include HCSA for upcoming assessments. 

In most circumstances, we will integrate 

HCV and HCSA assessments using HCVRN 

licensed assessors.

As of December 2019, a total 31,375 

hectares at our palm oil estates is conserved, 

almost 10% of our total landbank. Compared 

to 2018, 1,175 hectares in Nigeria have been 

added due to the inclusion of greenfields in 

Calaro, while 675 hectares in Sabah is not 

suitable for planting and has been added 

to the HCV area.

In Australia, we have reserved 675 hectares 

of vegetation categorised as ‘endangered’ 

or ‘of concern’ at our sugar estates in line 

with local laws. In India we follow regulatory 

requirements in allocating 33% of our facility 

compound areas to be planted with native 

tree species. These green belts are to cover 

the entire periphery of our mills and plants. 

During the course of 2018 and 2019, we 

have planted over 9,000 trees, totalling 151 

hectares, at our seven mills.

Through assessments conducted to date for 

our palm oil operations, all identified HCS 

forests and HCV areas are being monitored 

and managed as conservation areas under 

dedicated management plans. To ensure that 

we consistently improve on the monitoring 

and management of these reserved areas 

and conserve our biodiversity, we have 

developed a range of programmes involving 

our workers and local communities.

In Solok, Sumatra, Wilmar has overseen 

the conservation of 1,760 hectares at 

one of our operations, PT. Kencana Sawit 

Indonesia (KSI), which is home to 97 

fauna species and 44 flora species. Of 

the wildlife and animals currently found 

in the forest landscape, 18 are classified 

as either endangered, vulnerable, near 

threatened or not evaluated according to 

the International Union for Conservation 

of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) 

Red List of Threatened Species. By national 

law, 26 species are protected, of which six 

have been identified as rare, threatened 

and endangered (RTE). 

The identified HCV area was originally 

home to gibbons prior to becoming locally 

extinct. In 2014, Wilmar partnered with the 

Kalaweit Foundation (Yayasan Kalaweit) 

to rehabilitate siamang gibbons into the 

HCV area. The local tree species provides 

an ideal habitat and food source, critical 

to the siamangs’ survival. Following IUCN 

soft release guidelines, we introduced nine 

male and nine female siamangs in two 

batches, totalling 18: seven in 2015 and 

11 in 2018. The siamangs have adapted 

well, with three infants being born from 

2016 to 2019. Unfortunately, one infant 

has since died as a result of a bee sting.

A monitoring team, including local 

community members, works closely with 

the Kalaweit Foundation to monitor the 

population’s health and behaviour daily 

to ensure that the sustainably managed 

production landscape continues to support 

the survival of the endangered species. 

A research station was also built by our 

operational team in PT. KSI. This is used 

by the monitoring and animal patrol teams 

to carry out their work and guard the HCV 

area.

APPLYING LOCAL KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT

REINTRODUCING LOCALLY EXTINCT SPECIES INTO CONSERVATION AREAS

HCV and riparian areas are critically 

important for their high biological and 

ecological value, but also fundamental to 

meeting the needs of local surrounding 

communities and are often essential 

to their traditional cultural identity. 

Wilmar appreciates these socio-cultural 

bonds, engaging and learning from local 

communities who depend on the forest 

and rivers that surround them.

For instance, water catchment areas in and 

around our PT. KSI operations in Indonesia 

are sources of clean water and protein for 

the surrounding village units (Minangkabau 

nagaris), Talau and Sei Kunyit. Traditional 

local knowledge demands that during 

certain periods the community safeguard 

fish in a protected pool (lubuk larangan). 

This requires approval from a community 

head who will make a devotion to the river 

before permitting fishing as a source of 

food.

Wilmar’s HCV management team works 

with representatives from the Talau and Sei 

Kunyit communities to protect and manage 

these HCV and riparian areas. These 

partnerships were established through 

formal agreements with the communities 

in order to uphold their traditions and 

employ local knowledge on management 

of the areas, including settling any HCV 

management disputes.

Since 2014 Wilmar has partnered with the 

University of Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) 

to gather baseline data on the diversity of 

flora and fauna species found in HCV areas 

within Wilmar’s Saremas and Segarmas 

oil palm plantations in Sarawak. Surveys 

from 2018 to 2020 have recorded an 

additional six species found in the HCV 

areas. A cumulative total of 24 species of 

medium and large mammals have been 

observed and recorded at the Sarawak 

estate from 2013. 

SEE MORE ON OUR CONSERVATION EFFORTS

Riparian areas bordering rivers and water 

bodies are critical habitats with significant 

environmental benefits for plants and 

communities. Natural vegetation also 

serves as a buffer to pollutants entering 

a stream from run-off and erosion. However, 

some of these areas have been disturbed 

in the past through community activities 

or agricultural development. 

As part of our management and monitoring 

plans, trained teams have worked to 

restore degraded areas to their original 

condition to enrich the HCV areas and 

improve the local wildlife habitat. This has 

been applied through frequent monitoring 

and management by identifying priority 

restoration areas, establishing nurseries and 

planting trees in designated areas. Wilmar 

commissions various experts to join field 

staff and HCV officers to conduct surveys 

and seedling collection, establishing the 

nurseries, planting and maintaining trees 

as well as monitoring and management of 

the area. Job opportunities are also given 

to local community members who are hired 

to work at the nurseries. 

To date, our total riparian area at our palm 

oil operations make up 5,842 hectares of 

the land we conserve. Of this total, 812.73 

ha were established via our restoration 

efforts.

Wilmar has established the annual Wildlife 

Outreach and Awareness Project. The 

objective was to raise stakeholders’ 

awareness on RTE species and wildlife 

conservation in Sabah and Sarawak as 

many species risk displacement due to 

human activity, especially poaching and 

illegal wildlife trading.

We collaborate with government 

agencies such as the Sabah Wildlife 

Department (SWD) and the Forestry 

Sarawak Corporation (FSC) and NGOs 

such as HUTAN-Kinabatangan Orangutan 

Conservation Project and the Bornean 

Sun Bear Conservation Centre (BSBCC) 

who collectively share their considerable 

knowledge on wildlife conservation.

We also create awareness by engaging 

with plantation and mill employees, local 

communities, and children from local 

schools. In 2019, the annual programme 

was enhanced at our Sabah operations 

as we conducted extensive engagement 

with more than 1,800 people at Sugut, 

Labuk and Segama in July, November 

and December of that year. Similarly, in 

Indonesia Wilmar’s HCV team conducted 

stakeholder engagement involving workers 

and local communities. In 2019, the 

outreach totalled over 6,200 participants.

Wilmar is among the few oil palm companies 

with personnel that have been appointed 

as honorary wildlife rangers30 and wildlife 

wardens.31 Honorary wildlife rangers have 

the authority to halt any illegal activity 

threatening wildlife, including to stop and 

search airplanes. As of December 2019, 

we had 32 honorary wildlife wardens in 

Sabah and 38 honorary wildlife rangers in 

Sarawak, of which a total of ten are women.

Wilmar International Limited   |  Sustainability Report 2019

We have a commitment to progressively reduce our 

greenhouse gas emissions at Wilmar-owned operations. 

This will be achieved by our efforts to halt deforestation, 

best management practices on cultivated peatland, and 

treating palm oil mill effluent to reduce methane emissions. 

The GHG Protocol benchmark is used to quantify our 

palm oil and sugar mill emissions. We have set a target to 

reduce GHG emissions intensity by 15% for all our palm 

oil mills by 2023 (set against our 2016 baseline of 0.82 

metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per metric 

tonne of crude palm oil processed (MT CO2e/MT CPO)). 

This applies to all our mills in Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana 

and Nigeria, regardless of certification status. In 2019, 

our GHG emission intensity was 0.77 MT CO2e/MT CPO, 

5% higher compared to 2018 intensity. This is due to our 

adoption of a more conservative calculation approach for 

palm oil mill effluent which takes into account the emissions 

of treated effluent through later stages of anaerobic ponds. 

We have set a 

target to reduce 

GHG emissions 

intensity by 15% 

for all our palm 

oil mills by 2023

We use these for flaring, generating 

electricity or feeding into boilers to 

replace burning of palm kernel shells. An 

operational methane capture facility can 

potentially reduce a palm oil mill’s GHG 

emissions by 90%. In 2019 we completed 

construction of our 24th methane capture 

facility at our CPO mill, PT. AMP Plantations, 

in Sumatra. Subsequently, we have 

achieved our 2020 target to complete 

the construction of 25 methane capture 

plants at CPO mills by commissioning the 

flare at PT. Sarina Titian Permata 1 in end 

February 2020. With 25 methane captures in 

full operation, we estimated in 2015 being 

able to avoid 500,000 MT CO2e of emissions 

annually. As of December 2019, we see 

a 571,596 MT CO2e of total emissions 

avoided at all our mills, far exceeding our 

initial estimations.

It can take up to six months for a methane capture facility to operate at 

full capacity as well as optimum operational efficiency/maintenance to 

maximise the achievable reductions at each plant. Therefore the emission 

figures are not directly correlated to the number of facilities year-on-year 

but are reflective of those in operation at respective efficiencies from 

previous years. Data for 2015 is based on our estimated emission reduction 

of 20,000 MT CO2e per plant.

Wilmar International Limited   |  Sustainability Report 2019

Sustainability Report 2019  |  Wilmar International Limited 

For our RSPO-certified palm oil operations 

we also use the RSPO PalmGHG calculator 

to report annual progress in monitoring and 

reducing significant pollutants and emissions 

from plantation and mill operations. We 

mapped our 2019 emissions using version 

four (v4) of the said calculator.

In 2019, our overall net GHG emissions 

(excluding estimated outgrower emissions) 

for the Group’s RSPO mills and estates was 

849,226 MT CO2e—a 51.5% decrease from 

2018. The biggest sources of GHG emissions 

from our RSPO operations are from historical 

land use change (55%), oxidation of existing 

planted peat (17%), and palm oil mill effluent 

(POME) (13%). Compared to 2018, emissions 

from our land use change increased from 

42% to 55%. We attribute this rise to our 

improved geographic information system 

(GIS) which now provides more accurate 

imagery on previous types of land use 

within our estates. In 2019, we used more 

compound fertiliser which has also led to 

an increase in total emissions from 4% in 

2017 and 2018 to 7% in 2019. 

Despite these increases, our overall net 

GHG emissions have decreased due to a 

few factors. We largely attribute this to our 

peat oxidation figures, which show a drop 

in emissions from 30% in 2018 to 17% in 

2019, partly  due to Wilmar aligning with 

the guidance and classification of peat 

areas by the Ministry of Environment and 

Forestry of Indonesia 32. Conservation area 

figures increased by 4% thereby contributing 

to the decrease in overall net emissions. 

This is because an additional mill received 

RSPO certification in 2019, resulting in an 

increase in planted area figures. Mill credits 

have also more than doubled from 2018 as 

additional biogas plants have come into 

operation. This replaces the need for palm 

kernel shells as boiler fuel and has led to 

an increased amount becoming available 

for sale. In 2019, our data recording also 

improved which can also be attributed to 

the more positive figures.

Including estimated outgrower emissions, 

our GHG emissions totalled 2,036,815 MT 

CO2e in 2019—a reduction of 47.5% from 

2018. We attribute the reduction to a 50% 

drop in total emissions at our Indonesia 

operations, which account for 88% of 

the Group’s emissions. This was due to 

corresponding emissions after peatland 

reclassification. 

Outgrower emissions are estimated 

based on the highest emission 

intensity of our own estates 

supplying to each mill multiplied 

by the total volume of outgrower 

FFB supply. Outgrowers include all 

suppliers that are not from Wilmar 

or scheme smallholder estates.

Wilmar International Limited   |  Sustainability Report 2019

Sustainability Report 2019  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Out of this total, 35,763,892 MWh is 

generated from renewable biomass sources 

which comes from our palm and sugar 

operations, representing 75% of total energy 

mix. This is a 16% increase from 2018 when 

our renewable energy mix was at 58.8%. 

The main energy sources for our palm oil 

mills come from renewable biomass such as 

empty fruit bunches (EFBs), mesocarp fibre 

and kernel shells. For our sugar operations 

in Australia and India, cane bagasse is the 

main source of fuel required to power mills. 

There is minimal usage of other fuel sources, 

which are used for start-up processes or 

during maintenance periods. 

In Australia, Wilmar is the largest producer 

of renewable biomass energy. Our 

cogeneration process generates a total 

capacity of about 199 megawatts. Three 

of our mills use cogeneration facilities to 

increase their export capacity and further 

drive efficient biomass use. Surplus bagasse 

is stockpiled on specially designed pads to 

ensure a ready source of renewable energy 

outside the crushing season.

According to Global Forest Watch Fires 

data, in 2019, 42% of fire alerts detected 

in Indonesia occurred on carbon-rich 

peatlands 33. Draining one hectare of tropical 

peatland will produce an average of 55 

metric tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. 

With a cut-off date of 31 December 2015, 

Wilmar has prohibited any development on 

peatland regardless of depth and supports 

the conservation and restoration of these 

areas to avoid release of carbon emissions. 

Of our total planted area, approximately 

6,860 hectares (2.55%) are classified as 

peat, about two-thirds of which are in West 

Kalimantan. Our conservation area currently 

comprises 135 hectares of peat, of which 127 

hectares come from our Sumatra operations 

alone. 

For planted peat areas, we use best 

management practices as defined by 

peat experts and the RSPO. This includes 

maintaining water tables at appropriate 

levels and exchanging best practice on 

platforms such as the Tropical Forest Alliance 

2020. We also work with the Indonesian 

Peatland Restoration Agency (Badan 

Restorasi Gambut (BRG)) towards national 

peatland conservation targets.

33  ‘Fire Report covering data from 1 January 2019–30 September 2019’. Global Forest Watch, Accessed 18 February 2020.

We export a significant portion of the 

electricity produced to national grids. 

This contributes to a reduction of regional 

GHG emissions. In 2019, a total of 533,777 

megawatt hours (MWh) were exported to 

national grids: 350,000 MWh from eight 

mills in Australia, and 183,777 MWh from 

five mills in India.

Karnataka State in India supplies power from 

national grids to farmers on a cost-free basis, 

but these farmers end up with limited access 

to power, especially during peak summer 

months. This causes a detrimental effect 

to crops because of insufficient energy for 

maintenance and harvesting.

To address the issue, SRSL  has implemented 

solar-powered irrigation pumping systems 

as an alternative power source for the 

farmers and their estates. This scheme was 

implemented with financial help from local 

banks, which allows the farmers to claim 

subsidies. Since 2014, we have progressively 

installed 591 pumping systems across the 

irrigation sources of our farmer’s operations. 

This includes open wells, bore wells, and 

rivers. Because of this initiative farmers can 

now enjoy electricity throughout the hot 

summer months and have also recouped 

their investments. Crops can continue being 

irrigated as scheduled. This has led to higher 

productivity yields of 25–30% compared to 

when power access was limited.

Fire monitoring and management

From August to September 2019,  forest 

fires resulted in a haze blanketing over 

Sumatra and Kalimantan, as well as parts 

of Malaysia and Singapore. Indonesian 

forest fires pose a huge risk for both our 

employees and the communities living in 

and around our estates. It also jeopardises 

the livelihoods of the local community and 

impacts our operations requiring resources 

to be diverted to suppress any fires.

In December 2019, Australia began 

experiencing a series of massive bushfires, 

fuelled by record-breaking temperatures 

and months of severe drought. As a result, 

people and wildlife were killed, millions of 

hectares of land burnt, residential towns 

were severely affected, and air quality 

diminished drastically. While such blazes 

and haze are cyclical occurrences in both 

regions during the hotter months, 2019 

witnessed particularly severe conditions. 

Although major affected areas were in New 

South Wales, there was no direct impact to 

Wilmar’s operations and supplier operations 

in the north of the state. However, as sugar 

is a dry crop subject to erratic weather, we 

are not immune to such crises. We permit 

burning in our sugarcane farms in the 

Burdekin region of Queensland, only during 

cane harvesting and under strict, prescribed 

circumstances. The Burdekin is one of the 

regions where burning prior to harvesting 

provides the most environmentally friendly 

outcome, due to the cane and soil conditions 

34. Wilmar adheres to all applicable local 

regulations and have implemented our own 

robust fire standard operating procedures 

(SOP). In 2019, 3,044 hectares were burnt 

at our sugar operations using prescribed 

and controlled methods.

Our Myanmar operations use an overhead 

irrigation system and do not use burning 

methods for harvesting. While we do not 

own farming operations in India, our mills 

do encourage no burning methods for all 

smallholder suppliers. We also implement 

awareness programmes to assist them in 

their understanding.

In recent years we have witnessed longer droughts and a higher 

number of recorded fires, as global temperatures continue to rise 

and the world faces more extreme weather conditions. 2019 saw 

catastrophic fires throughout Australia and Indonesia—two of 

the regions where a significant portion of our oil palm and sugar 

businesses operate.

Internal fire monitoring

34  Burdekin’s flat landscape coupled with dry climate requires flood irrigation for production. Cutting the cane green would leave a thick cane 

trash blanket which would obstruct water flow and result in water percolation into soil. This would increase the water table leading to a number of 

production and environmental issues.

35  The FFA is a multi-stakeholder alliance launched in February 2016, to share information, knowledge and techniques that will lead a lasting solution 

for a fire and haze-free Indonesia.

Wilmar has always taken a strong stand 

against the illegal use of fire and our no-burn 

stance is an integral part of our NDPE policy. 

Within our palm oil operations, we monitor 

fires in Indonesia via our Fire Free Alliance 

(FFA)35 programme to quickly detect, 

suppress and report on fire incidences. 

Our hotspot alerts are identified via 

satellite imageries, which are monitored 

daily. However, because satellites capture 

changes of temperature, all alerts need to 

be verified on the ground because not all 

necessarily translate to fires in the field. Any 

hotspot notification located within Wilmar’s

plantations and five kilometres outside of 

our concession boundaries will be relayed 

by our GIS team to the team on-site. A team 

comprising members from Wilmar’s GIS, 

Conservation and Management departments 

are then mobilised to verify data received 

from the satellite imagery. In cases where 

fires are confirmed, our fire response teams 

are immediately dispatched to extinguish 

the fires.

In 2019 there were a total of 143 hotspots 

detected at our Indonesia operations and 

16636* fires recorded, affecting about 954* 

hectares. This represents a reduction in 

number of fire occurrences by 60%, and 

reduction in fires by hectares by 53% when 

compared to 2015, a year that saw similar 

rain and weather patterns to 2019. In 

Sumatra, the number of fires recorded is 

higher than the hotspots because some of 

these fires were small-scale and therefore 

not registered by the hotspot monitoring 

system. In comparison, Sumatra’s 64* fires 

contributed to 50* hectares burnt while 

in West Kalimantan the 27* fires resulted 

in 191* hectares burnt thereby signifying 

the size of the small-scale fires in Sumatra. 

Within a five-kilometre radius of our 

concession boundaries, a total of 1,607 

hotspots were recorded in 2019 of which 

214 turned out to be actual fires.

Our monitoring also extends to our suppliers 

under our Supplier Group Compliance 

Programme (SGCP). This currently covers 

over 20* million hectares associated with 

our supply chain and includes monitoring 

of fire alerts. In cases where a fire alert is 

highlighted via reports from the monitoring 

platform or in the media, we will seek 

immediate clarification from relevant 

suppliers. In all cases, we found that the 

fire alerts were either false or that the fires 

detected were not deliberately set by the 

companies themselves. Most importantly 

the fires were not used by the companies 

for land clearing. Unfortunately, during 

the dry seasons, strong winds and dry 

vegetation provide an easy way for these 

fires to spread.

While occurrence of fire is usually due to 

extreme dry weather conditions, some 

instances in Sumatra and Borneo are linked 

to illegal slash-and-burn methods by local 

farmers. This technique is still employed 

despite it being against the law and 

increasing pressure from industry players like 

Wilmar to stamp these practices out within 

the supply chain. This trend is documented 

by the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) 

Forest Fire analysis which shows that most 

occurrences of fires based on fire alerts 

occur outside of the palm oil concession 

boundaries.

A key component of our FFA fire 

management efforts and strategies centres 

upon community engagement and raising 

awareness on the risks surrounding the use 

of fires for land clearance and preparation. 

Another factor are enforcement efforts to 

deter or apprehend intentional fire starters. 

However, in order to influence areas outside 

Wilmar and our suppliers’ control, there is 

a further need for collaboration between 

government agencies, the private sector 

and local communities to facilitate a lasting 

solution.

*  EY has performed limited assurance procedures on this figure 

This protocol consolidated procedures 

and protocols developed since 2007. As 

part of prevention and monitoring, we 

begin by mapping the risk of fires in our 

estates and within a five-kilometre radius 

outside of our plantation. To enforce this, 

we take great pains to identify hotspots via 

satellite imagery and verify fires within our 

own operations and a five-kilometre radius 

outside our concession boundaries, as well 

as the lands owned by our suppliers. The 

fire risk map is generated using information 

such as past fire incidences, proximity to 

roads, river and population, accessibility, 

and soil type. In places of high risk such as 

peat areas, we have prepared a series of 

boreholes which will provide the necessary 

water resource for the purpose of fire 

suppression.

Managing waste

In 2019, approximately 74% of solid 

waste generated from our palm oil milling 

processing was re-used as fuel or organic 

fertiliser. In addition, the remaining one 

million metric tonnes of waste within the 

compound was stockpiled for later re-use. 

With the inclusion of waste stockpiles, 

our target to re-use 100% of solid waste 

generated from our palm oil milling 

processes has been met in 2019.

Wilmar follows waste management best practice for our upstream 

palm oil facilities and seeks to recover and re-use all waste. The 

solid waste produced from our production processes includes 

empty fruit bunches (EFB), mesocarp fibre, and palm kernel shells. 

These are used as energy for fuel and composed or mulched as 

organic fertiliser. We also produce palm oil mill effluent (POME) 

which is used as a fertiliser or treated prior to local river discharge.

Our sugar operations produce solid waste 

such as bagasse, press mud, ash, sludge 

and yeast sludge. We use bagasse as boiler 

fuel and other waste as raw material for 

composting purposes. At our mills we 

collect excess water from washing and gland 

leakages at pits before being recycled back 

for use in the process after treatment. 

For farmer suppliers in India, both Wilmar and the government encourage 

the implementation of drip-irrigation systems for efficient water use.

DISCHARGE

Water is an essential global resource and 

home to a vast array of aquatic life that 

is increasingly facing supply pressures 

aggravated by climate change and pollution.

Wilmar has adopted a life cycle approach 

in the management of our water footprint 

– from the design to the construction and 

running of our mills, refineries, processing 

plants. Our production facilities focus 

strongly on water use efficiency, an approach 

that delivers long-term cost savings. We 

conduct water assessments prior to the 

development or new plant construction. 

This highlights potential water risks to the 

natural ecosystem and local communities 

that rely on the water source for sanitation, 

nutrition, and livelihoods. 

Wilmar diligently tracks and monitors our 

site water use. This includes the availability 

of water at given sources to measure and 

mitigate disruptions to our operations. We 

also collaborate with local authorities to 

understand their future water availability 

strategies.

We have been monitoring rainfall patterns at 

our palm oil plantations since the inception 

of each estate, resulting in records for at 

least 25 years in most of the regions where 

we operate. Based on these records and 

recent trends, water stress is still not a 

material issue for our oil palm estates. While 

we face reduction in rain during weather 

phenomena, such as El Niño, this is not 

significant. Land irrigation of POME, mainly 

done to help boost fertiliser, continues to be 

carried out during these periods. This land 

irrigation helps alleviate the impacts of the 

lack of rain during times of water scarcity.

Wilmar has implemented measures to 

increase water efficiency – especially for 

our most water intensive mills – followed 

by nursery irrigation and household use.

Wilmar has production sites in water-stressed 

areas in India and Australia. Based on the 

World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct tool, 37 

our refinery in Gujarat, India operates in an 

extremely high-stress water area. All other 

India-based mills across Maharasthra and 

Karnataka and one of our mills in Victoria, 

Australia operate in high-stress water areas. 

All of the water sourced by our Australia 

refineries is from municipal sources, while 

our India operations heavily rely on the water 

contained within the cane they process. 

In Gujarat, we use surface water supplied 

by third party government agencies. This 

plant is a zero-discharge facility, where all 

water withdrawn is treated and re-used 

back in the operations. We have recently 

installed a secondary reverse osmosis plant 

to treat the rejected water from the primary 

plant to convert into raw water. We have 

also become member of Federation of 

Kutch Industries Association (FOKIA), a 

government aided organisation to support 

industries in the region to mitigate water 

scarcity issues by installing common 

desalination plants. In Maharasthra and 

Karnataka, mills that have distilleries and co-

generation plants in their vicinity implement 

a zero-discharge approach, where the excess 

process condensate can be used for cooling 

towers after secondary treatment. The 

remainder discharge is mostly used for green 

belt irrigation within the mills’ premises and 

supplied to neighbouring farmers.

NOTE:

Efficient use of water only applies to fully irrigated sugarcane. Therefore, data is only representative for all farms in Burdekin where irrigation is used. 

Our remaining farms are rain-fed or supplemented with irrigation.

NOTE:

37  Aqueduct’s tools map water risks 

such as floods, droughts, and stress, 

using open-source, peer reviewed 

data.

As one of the largest producers and 

buyers of sugarcane in Australia, Wilmar 

is a pioneer in implementing sustainable 

sugarcane growing practices. Wilmar is 

seeking consultation from customers during 

the initial stages of a programme designed 

to raise funds to support best practice 

implementation for sugarcane farms in 

the reef regions of Australia. Our aim is 

to comply with reef regulation to facilitate 

the protection of the Great Barrier Reef. 

The project is still in the early stages of 

development, much of which will depend 

on customer interest and potential demand.

As a founding member of the Baratta Creek 

Action Group (BCAG), Wilmar is active 

in its initiatives around improving water 

quality flowing to the Great Barrier Reef. 

We are also a member of the Cane Supply 

Improvement Programme (CSIP) in helping 

develop recommendations on the use of 

mill by-products for industry application.

Our 2019 mill water usage levels were in line 

with industry levels across all regions. Based 

on 2016 baselines, we target to reduce water 

consumption intensity to 1.2m³ per tonne of 

FFB processed (m³/MT FFB processed) for 

Indonesia and 1.3m³ / MT FFB processed for 

both Malaysia and Ghana by 2023. In 2019, 

these targets were achieved for Central 

Kalimantan and Sumatra in Indonesia. Our 

water consumption intensity in Sumatra 

has been steadily declining and is at two-

thirds of its 2016 rate. Once our new mill in 

Nigeria is operating at full capacity, we will 

set a target supplemented with more robust 

data. Sarawak data has been updated to 

reflect the current reporting scope (excluding 

Suburmas mill from calculations) and the 

increase in 2019 intensity is due to lower 

efficiencies of the old boilers in Saremas 

1 mill. 

For our sugar operations, some of our 

estates are rain-fed while others are irrigated 

farms. In accordance with the Bonsucro 

Production Standard, we monitor net water 

consumed per unit mass of product for 

our sugarcane plantations and mills and 

in 2019 our consumption was well within 

the water usage limits. We also attempt to 

ensure that all irrigated water is efficiently 

used and applied to our fields. In 2019, we 

exceeded the Bonsucro threshold for our 

Burdekin operations due to low rainfall that 

resulted in increased water consumption.

The water leaves the refinery in its liquid 

products as trade waste or storm water to 

sewer and as condensed vapour in cooling 

water which is then returned to the adjacent 

river. Other smaller flows include amenity 

activities to sewer and direct vapour loss to 

the atmosphere. We continuously employ 

practices to minimise water use, thereby 

reducing our environmental footprint.

Water usage intensity at the Yaraville 

refinery has decreased by 46% over the 

last ten years. In 2014 we installed a 

triple-effect evaporator and in 2016 we 

implemented a new recovery pan. Both 

measures contributed to larger reductions 

in subsequent years. We intended these 

upgrades to recover condensed vapour 

for re-use in the refinery, also adding to a 

reduction in emissions and easing impacts 

on the surrounding environment. In 2021 we 

plan to install a pan calandria which will allow 

for an increase in condensate return to our 

boiler station, thereby reducing water usage 

by eliminating wastage of surplus hot water. 

When installed, we aim to further reduce 

water usage intensity to below 0.95 kL/MT.

Wilmar International Limited   |  Sustainability Report 2019

Sustainability Report 2019  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is wastewater 

from fresh fruit bunches (FFB) processing 

and palm oil refinery effluent (PORE) is 

wastewater from refining crude palm oil 

(CPO). While POME is mainly organic in 

nature, it is not discharged directly, as we 

repurpose it through land application or 

treat it via anaerobic digestion prior to local 

waterway discharge. The chemical oxygen 

demand (COD) content for PORE is much 

lower than POME but as the refining of 

CPO involves higher usage of chemical 

processes than the mill extraction process, 

PORE requires a chemical treatment step 

to remove the oil and grease and inorganic 

substances before further aerobic treatment 

prior to discharge. One refinery in Indonesia 

sends its effluent to a municipal treatment 

centre for external treatment. We have 

an ongoing target to maintain effluent 

discharge levels to be within local regulation 

thresholds for palm oil mills and refineries 

waterway discharge. 

For our upstream and downstream sites, 

biological oxygen demand (BOD) and 

COD levels are monitored for both land 

application and river discharge. In 2019, 

Wilmar was within the legal limit for BOD 

levels for our upstream operations in 

Indonesia and Malaysia and because of 

low mill utilisation in Nigeria, there was no 

effluent discharge in 2019. For Ghana, a new 

effluent discharge standard was promulgated 

to Wilmar in August 2019 which stipulates 

a limit of 50 milligrams per litre (mg/L) for 

BOD discharge, regardless of river discharge 

or land application. These guidelines were 

developed based on Ghana’s existing 

guidelines for the Oil and Fat Processing 

Sector and we are currently in discussion 

with the local authority to set a standard that 

will apply to the palm oil sector. We were 

also within legal limits for COD levels in our 

upstream and downstream operations.38

Wilmar has implemented comprehensive procedures to safeguard 

water quality. We regularly report our progress in monitoring and 

reducing significant pollutants. 

MANAGING EFFLUENT 

38 This covers our downstream operations within the scope of this report, which may include biodiesel and oleochemical plants.

With water forming a big part of the sugarcane crop, sugar 

mills generate effluent water through its milling process. As 

the effluent does not contain high COD similar to POME, 

the water is suitable for re-use in irrigation systems after 

a simple treatment. During seasons of drought, effluent 

water discharged from sugar mills is diverted to rain-fed 

farms to supplement any further water needs. For our 

sugar operations in Australia, most effluent is discharged 

via land application for irrigation purposes on farms 

surrounding its mills and is not governed by a specific 

discharge limit. In Myanmar, we do not discharge via 

land application and were within BOD legal thresholds 

for river discharge in 2019. In India, due to the fact that 

our facilities are located in water-stressed areas, there is a 

heightened awareness on re-using water from the milling 

and distillery processes. Wastewater is treated and used 

at distillery and cogeneration plant cooling towers, for 

molasses dilution (following further ultraviolet treatment) 

and to irrigate the green belts within the mill compounds. 

Spent wash from distilleries is bio-digested and, along 

with other solid waste, re-used in incineration boilers 

and as compost or liquid fertiliser. We are implementing 

further measures with an aim of achieving zero liquid 

discharge for our distillery plants in India.

COD regulatory limits range from 80 mg/L to 250 mg/L across our various 

operations depending on permits.

Optimising chemical use

We aim to minimise the use of chemicals, 

including pesticides and chemical 

fertilisers. Any fertiliser use is guided by 

a management plan and is included in 

our SOP. Safeguards are implemented 

to eliminate exposure to hazardous 

chemicals for workers, communities, and the 

environment. In India we have a programme 

for farmers to switch to manure or organic 

fertiliser to minimise the impact of salt pan 

formation due to high nitrogen use, and 

in Australia we provide farmers with mill 

mud to help with fertilising. For palm oil 

operations we work with our smallholder 

suppliers on appropriate use of pesticides 

to prevent overuse. This includes training 

on the types of pesticides for specific 

weeds and also to switch to path and circle 

spraying only—which largely reduces the 

overall use of pesticides. 

World Health Organization (WHO) Class 

1A or 1B and Stockholm or Rotterdam 

Conventions pesticides are strictly 

prohibited except for specific instances 

that follow WHO recommendations and 

guidelines. We only allow the use of 

paraquat in our sugar business due to an 

absence of viable alternatives. Its use is the 

most practical and may even curb overall 

environmental impacts in Australia as it 

is considered reef friendly. Workers are 

provided with adequate personal protective 

equipment and require specific licences to 

handle these chemicals. 

For any substance that poses a potential 

hazard to workers to the environment, 

toxicity is closely monitored on a regular 

basis and risk assessments are carried out. 

As only a few oil palm plantation companies 

disclose toxicity levels, comparison can 

be difficult. However, we believe that our 

current range of below 1,000 units per 

hectare is largely in line with industry best 

practice.

CHEMICAL RAT BAIT USAGE VS. BARN OWL POPULATION 

AT WILMAR’S CENTRAL KALIMANTAN ESTATE 2008-SEPTEMBER 2019

In accordance to the Bonsucro Production Standard we monitor the level of active 

ingredients per hectare for our sugar operations. This covers all applied agro-chemicals, 

including pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and ripeners. In 2019, chemical 

usage at our Australia and Myanmar operations were within the Bonsucro limit. 

Due to heavy rainfall in 2018 and 2019, 

there has been a rise in white grub (or root 

grub) in Belagavi, Karnataka. This pest 

feeds on sugarcane roots and subsequently 

damages the undersoil portion of the cane. 

SRSL operates four mills in Belagavi, which 

account for 20% of total cane crushing 

in the district. In 2019, we taught IPM to 

control the pest menace and prevent its 

spread to other areas. This was achieved 

by mapping the species across operational 

areas, followed by a series of workshops 

and demonstrations with technical experts. 

Farmers were taught to adopt integrated 

and community approaches through 

cultural, mechanical, physical, and biological 

methods for effective and efficient control of 

root grub menace in sugarcane cultivation. 

Such approaches have proven effective in 

controlling the target pest in an economical, 

environmentally friendly way and has set a 

benchmark for sustainable cultivation.

While we have 2017 data for Myanmar, it is not comparable as reporting 

initially followed harvesting cycles and not calendar years.

In oil palm plantations they contribute to the 

damaging of fronds, oil palm flowers, and 

fruits, thereby significantly affecting yield. 

While rodenticides (with active ingredients 

such as Brodifacoum and Bromadiolone) 

in ready-mix bait form has been effective 

in controlling the rat population, they can 

cause chemical pollution to the environment 

contributing to disturbances in the plantation 

area and the disruption of predators. Bait 

application and acceptance levels also 

require close supervision and monitoring.

As an IPM solution, we have been controlling 

the rat population by breeding and releasing 

barn owls. With high reproduction rates 

and a high dependency on rats as their 

main source of food, barn owls are natural 

predators and serve as an optimal solution. 

By applying this measure, we have been 

able to minimise chemical rat bait use in 

the plantation since 2011 at our Central 

Kalimantan estates. Apart from a slight 

increase in rodenticide usage in 2016, due 

to an outbreak in several blocks that could 

not be handled by the existing barn owl 

population in these areas, the amount of 

rat bait usage has drastically decreased.

Owls are released to field nest boxes in 

planted oil palm blocks. Owl chicks from 

the boxes are nursed at our hatcheries 

before being sent back to the owl pairs in 

the field nest boxes. This helps to increase 

barn owl population in the fields. 

Since 2013, the barn owl population has 

significantly increased in the fields, based 

on our monthly census on occupational nest 

box rates. In September it was recorded 

that 52.5% of the total existing 3,822 field 

nest boxes were occupied across the whole 

estate, signifying an effective and productive 

IPM method. We are currently looking into 

increasing the barn owl population and 

increasing the field nest box ratio from 

one box per 40 hectares to one box per 

20 hectares ratio.

Using barn owls to control the rat population

Rats can consume food ± 10% of their 

body weight in a single day and bring 

food to their nests 40 times per day.

Wilmar International Limited   |  Sustainability Report 2019

Sustainability Report 2019  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Wilmar’s global palm oil and sugar businesses employ over 

71,000 workers, provide economic opportunity to more than 

15,000 smallholders, and support hundreds of rural communities 

surrounding our operations. Given that we have an impact on a 

vast number of lives, it is imperative that we champion and lead 

with measures that uphold our enduring respect for human rights. 

Our dedication to human rights

On 1 May 2019, Wilmar launched a 

dedicated Human Rights Framework 

to better address emerging human rights 

challenges. In addition to advocating for 

human rights, the document embeds three 

pillars of Protect, Respect and Remedy as 

outlined in the United Nations Guiding 

Principles (UNGP)  on Business and 

Human Rights. The Policy Statement in the 

framework applies to our operations and 

supply chain and is additional to the existing 

commitments in our No Deforestation, No 

Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) policy and 

other sustainability policies on  aspects such 

as equal opportunities, sexual harassment, 

violence and abuse, reproductive rights, 

child protection, whistleblowing, and 

modern slavery. Our framework outlines 

Wilmar’s approach to implementing these 

commitments throughout our operations. 

In 2019, our updated NDPE policy was 

better aligned with globally recognised 

frameworks and guidance for human 

rights, such as the Food and Agriculture 

Organization’s Voluntary Guidelines on 

Responsible Governance of Tenure (VGGT), 

and the UN Global Compact and the 

International Labour Organization (ILO) 

conventions. Our updated Grievance 

Procedure is also in line with the UNGP 

to underpin an effective non-judicial 

mechanism and reflects our commitment 

to the protection of human rights defenders, 

whistleblowers, complainants, and 

community spokespersons—consistent 

with the guiding RSPO Human Rights 

Defenders Policy. We are also finalising 

a stand-alone protocol to address supplier 

non-compliance to the no exploitation 

aspect of our NDPE policy that warrants 

action and oversight, additional to that 

described in the Grievance Procedure. 

Once finalised it will be added to the 

procedure.

Since we began the partnership in 2017, 

we have undergone a 12-month programme 

and developed a three-year strategy to 

change mindsets and entrench sustainability 

as a priority approach for our company. 

We have since improved worker pay and 

conditions at PT. Daya Labuhan Indah and 

PT. Perkebunan Milano in North Sumatra. 

We continue to raise awareness throughout 

our operations while we work to mitigate 

labour rights risks issues in priority areas, 

namely exploring possible root causes of 

child labour, understanding the link between 

work and pay practices, and screening for 

emergent labour issues. 

We aim to launch the programme 

throughout Indonesia to both strengthen 

Wilmar’s sustainability structure and 

design value-based labour and community 

engagement initiatives. This is expected to 

be rolled out in 2020 after completion of 

Verité’s final assessment in North Sumatra. 

The Indonesia-wide roll out will be based 

on the model applied in North Sumatra.

We are active participants in joint 

partnerships and various multi-stakeholder 

platforms to promote, respect and provide 

support for human rights. This includes 

consulting with human rights experts and 

civil society organisations to ensure feedback 

is received. Over the last three years we 

have collaborated with our technical partner 

and expert, Verité. During this time, we 

developed and are implementing robust 

solutions to address systemic labour issues 

in our operations, while simultaneously 

equipping our employees with the tools and 

knowledge to raise awareness on human 

rights and labour concerns.

In accordance with SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), 

we view it as our responsibility to provide a good livelihood and 

development opportunities for all our workers and their families.

Responsible employment 

We commit to ensuring international 

best practice for fair working conditions, 

particularly where legal frameworks are 

not yet in place, and will use the principles 

defined in the Free and Fair Labor in 

Palm Oil Production: Principles and 

Implementation Guidance as reference. 

All employees and workers are paid at least 

the applicable local minimum wage in line 

with legal regulations, and comprise basic 

pay as well as fixed and variable allowances. 

In Australia, wages are paid consistent with 

the sugar industry award agreement which 

are higher than the minimum requirements. 

In Ghana, our lowest monthly wage is 794 

cedi, 60% more than minimum wage of 

319 cedi. 

At oil palm estates operating in remote areas 

with limited accessibility to urban areas we 

provide free housing, facilities, and benefits 

for those who choose to stay on site. As our 

operations are still developing in Nigeria, 

only 31% of permanent workers are currently 

provided access to accommodation within 

our estates, but 20% more than in 2018. We 

target to provide all workers in Nigeria with 

accommodation choices by 2025.

We also provide childcare facilities and 

access to schools, which are either Wilmar-

run or government schools operated by 

Wilmar. Transportation to nearby schools 

is also provided to all children of school-

going age. Workers are also provided a 

meal allowance and healthcare. 

Before we implement any significant 

operational change, employees are 

given three to six months’ notice. Notice 

periods leading up to termination and 

resignation is made clear to all employees 

and workers in employee handbooks and 

collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). 

These documents also include provisions 

for consultation and negotiation with 

employers. In employee contracts and 

CBAs, payment terms for overtime and 

official rest days for workers are explicitly 

outlined. In a language they understand, 

all workers are given information in writing 

details of their working conditions, including 

but not limited to the nature of the work 

that will be undertaken, rate of pay and 

pay arrangements, working hours, vacation 

and other leave, and all other employment 

benefits. 

Through our work with Verité, we are looking 

to calculate wages for work completed 

after regular hours for piece-rate workers 

with the aim of better compensating work 

rendered upon exceeding the minimum 

productivity output. We are also considering 

alternative measures to financial penalties 

for breaches in company regulations on 

discipline and performance. Such measures 

may include alternating our approach to 

positive reinforcement for any non-breaches. 

Wilmar has been an active member of the 

RSPO Labour Task Force. Recently, we have 

contributed to the development of a first-

of-its-kind guidance document for the oil 

palm industry regarding the payment of a 

decent living wage (DLW). The methodology 

adopted that from the global living wage

old respectively, have worked in 

Wilmar’s Sabahmas estate since 

1994. Isham is a driver, and Mare 

is a child minder at the crèche. 

Together they had all four of 

their children in Sabahmas. Two 

of their elder adult children are 

already working, and the third is 

studying for an undergraduate 

degree in a university in Jakarta. 

Their youngest attends a Wilmar-

Both Isham and Mare have 

applauded the company for their 

focus on prioritising education 

for migrant worker’s children. 

Mare appreciates her role as 

she helps provide other working 

mothers – her neighbours in 

Sabahmas – support to allow 

them to go to work without 

worrying about the safety and 

security of their pre-school aged 

children.

“We have been here for more 

than 25 years. The company 

provides us with everything – 

housing, schooling for the kids, 

and pays us the same as locals. 

We are happy here.”

Temporary workers play an important 

role, filling seasonal harvesting needs and 

specialist, timebound jobs in the palm oil 

and sugar industries. Of the total palm 

oil and sugar workers employed by the 

company, about 9.5% of these are temporary 

workers.

 

In Indonesia, not all temporary workers 

receive similar benefits to permanent 

workers. We have endeavoured to convert 

all temporary contracts to permanent ones. 

Since 2018, the following workers enjoy 

permanent status: Central Kalimantan 

(100%), Sumatra (93.2%), West Kalimantan 

(69.8%). The disparity in West Kalimantan 

is because many workers who are also 

smallholders prefer a more flexible work 

arrangement. We are working to address 

this concern in West Kalimantan, including 

exploring a pilot under  the Decent Rural 

Living Initiative (DRLI).

In recent years, the treatment of 

migrant workers in Malaysia has 

been subject to much scrutiny due to 

a general imbalance of benefits and 

safeguards with regard to human 

and labour rights. Migrant workers 

from Indonesia and the Philippines 

account for 76% of Wilmar’s 

plantation operations in Sabah 

and Sarawak.  All migrant workers 

employed by Wilmar are entitled 

to the same pay and benefits 

enjoyed by local workers, except 

for contributions to the Employees’ 

Provident Fund—a mandatory, 

statutory requirement for local 

employees only. Migrant workers 

are also eligible to receive at least 

the minimum wage, in addition 

to free housing, healthcare, and 

education for their accompanying 

children. Wilmar also provides 

long-term employment contracts. 

Wilmar recruits and documents 

all our workers through the 

proper channels with no effect 

on their wages. We also ensure 

there are no language barriers 

when communicating to workers, 

whether verbally or through 

documentation.

coalition and was assisted with Wilmar’s 

methodology to calculate whether prevailing 

wages were meeting the DLW benchmark 

in RSPO-certified units for all workers. As an 

important element of the recently adopted 

2018 Principles and Criteria (P&amp;C), this 

guide will assist members in assessing 

whether the remuneration provided to their 

workers is sufficient for the worker and 

his/her family to afford a basic but decent 

lifestyle. This approach takes into account 

family needs such as adequate housing, 

sanitation facilities, a clean water supply, 

medical care, and children’s educational 

requirements. 

A full list of our commitments on fair working 

conditions that apply to our operations and 

those of our suppliers can be found in the 

annex of our updated NDPE policy.



As sugarcane is a seasonal crop, all our sugar 

operations rely on seasonal and temporary 

workers during the main crop season. It 

is therefore not possible to have a 100% 

permanent workforce where we have sugar 

plantations and mills. In Myanmar, we rely on 

contractors to carry out our main sugarcane 

growing operations.

Of the total palm oil and sugar workers 

employed by the company, about 9.5% 

of these are temporary workers.

Wilmar International Limited   |  Sustainability Report 2019

Sustainability Report 2019  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Gender distribution within the Group 

significantly varies between the different 

countries and regions in which we operate. 

In many regions it is more prevalent for 

men to work in the agricultural industry and 

women may not have access to the formal 

labour market.

Nevertheless, all employees have the 

right to equal opportunity and treatment, 

regardless of race, colour, gender, age, social 

class, religion, sexual orientation, politics 

or disability. This is outlined in our Equal 

Opportunity Policy and in recruitment, 

training, and development. Regardless 

of gender, all employees and workers are 

paid equally based on the nature of their 

work—a ratio of one-to-one. 

In 2019, Wilmar has focused on increasing 

women’s representation and leadership in all 

levels of the workforce and we believe we 

have made good progress addressing key 

issues faced by women, particularly in the 

Indonesian and Malaysian palm oil industry. 

In our efforts to convert temporary contracts 

to permanent ones for our Indonesia oil 

palm estates, we have also ensured that 

all female workers are awarded similar 

opportunities to permanent ones, such 

as maternity leave and menstrual leave 

procedures. We have initiated women’s 

sexual health awareness programmes for 

workers and the wives of workers who are 

not working in the plantation but living in 

the vicinity of Wilmar operations.

Since 2007, we have implemented stand-

alone gender committees, or Women’s 

Working Groups (WoW), in all of our oil palm 

estates. This is not limited to our RSPO-

certified operations in Indonesia, Malaysia 

and Ghana but also includes Nigeria as of 

October 2019. 70% of our estates in Nigeria 

have established WoWs and we target 

to establish Women’s Working Groups in 

100% of Wilmar’s oil palm estates by 2020. 

Core members of each WoW are made up 

of and led by women to empower female 

members in the workforce and promote 

their access to decision-making positions.

In April 2019, a Women’s Committee 

Steering Group (WCSG), headed by Wilmar’s 

General Manager – Group Sustainability, was 

established to ensure WoW consistency with 

the five key issue objectives. Membership 

of the WCSG is comprised of women leads 

representing specific geographical groups 

of operational units. Quarterly regional 

meetings will be held to report relevant 

issues.

Wilmar is also proud to be a part of Diversity 

Council Australia Limited, an independent 

organisation spearheading equitable 

diversity and inclusion in the workplace with 

a goal of developing or supporting initiatives 

to establish a diverse and accommodating 

workplace for all employees. 

Recognising that sugar mills are important 

employers in the region, Wilmar has opened 

its doors to apprenticeships for young 

women in Queensland which will begin 

in 2020. 

IMPROVING WELFARE 

AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN

In May 2019, Wilmar launched its Women’s Charter setting out core 

areas with an objective of ensuring a fairer and more inclusive workplace 

for women. The charter is Indonesia- and Malaysia-focused, outlining our 

approach to respecting and ensuring women’s rights and the welfare of 

their families within Wilmar-owned operations. The charter incorporates 

five key objectives:

Protection from sexual 

harassment and violence

Measures for non-

discrimination, fair and 

equal opportunities 

at work and in worker 

representation

Protection and care 

of female health

Continuing 

education for 

improvement 

of personal and 

family life

Creating safer environments for children:  

 

Road related incidents were the biggest threats to children on our estates. Wilmar 

has implemented safety measures to mitigate vehicles transporting heavy equipment, 

including gates, speed bumps and pedestrian paths around residential areas, creches, 

and schools. Trucks and heavy equipment must be placed in designated parking areas 

away from residents and children. For other risks we have also filled unused open ponds 

and erected warning signs around open bodies of water.

Protecting and safeguarding children’s 

rights to education and growth has 

been at the forefront of our efforts 

since the 2017 launch of our Child 

Protection Policy. In accordance 

with SDG 4 (Quality education), 

we have placed significant emphasis 

on providing children with access to 

education. Wilmar was recognised 

by the Global Child Forum (GCF) 

in a benchmark study39 in 2019 to 

be among the top global achievers 

in creating a positive impact on 

children’s rights. We were previously 

assessed as the best performing 

company in Southeast Asia for 

protecting children’s rights in a 

report published by GCF in 201840.

Our estates are equipped with 

schools and crèches for children of all 

ages, which includes transportation 

and safe bus stops. 

All children of compulsory school-

going age that live in Wilmar 

plantations are required to attend 

full-time education programmes. In 

2019, we supported 8,807* children 

of compulsory school-going age in 

their education through provision of 

school facilities within plantations, 

free transportation to schools, 

subsidies in school fees and uniforms. 

This translates to around 92.2% of 

such children at our plantations 

attending schools in 2019. This is 

monitored by a census at each estate. 

We also operate 143* crèche across 

our estates in Indonesia, Malaysia 

and Ghana. As of December 2019, 

these crèches tend to 4,655 children 

of Wilmar employees. In Ghana a 

further 18 children from surrounding 

communities attend Wilmar crèches.

In Australia, we have developed 

a series of child safety education 

programmes in schools and 

kindergartens. Called the ‘Cane 

Train’, this programme is aimed at 

educating children who live or go 

to school around sugar mills and 

distilleries. It outlines what sugar 

production looks like and how to 

stay safe in the surroundings.

The focus on child safety 

and prevention of accidents 

involving children in our estates 

has been effective, with a 

reduction in serious incidents 

from 2018 to 2019.







We have conducted annual child safety assessments since 2018, and we report the results annually based on 

data from July in the preceding year to June in the current year. The focus on child safety and prevention of 

accidents involving children in our estates has been effective, with a reduction in serious incidents from 2018 

to 2019. Measures that have contributed to this are:

Educating caretakers and children: 

Wilmar provided training to schools, parents and children on safety around plantations—

especially in relation to food handling, fire, natural disasters, and haze. Furthermore, 

we educated students at Wilmar-owned schools on sexual harassment issues.

Protecting the health of children and families:  

 

Wilmar implemented an immunisation programme for children at our Sabahmas Estate, 

and worm prevention medication was offered to children at our Kiabau estate. We also 

provided families of all employees with face masks as protection from haze pollution 

in Indonesia.

All inclusive of permanent and part-time employees. 

Temporary workers generally do not join unions due to the 

monthly dues, but interests are protected as the agreements 

set the minimum conditions to be met. 

2. 

Following local regulations in Ghana, management staff is 

excluded to prevent a conflict of interest. 

3. 

Data on Myanmar is not disclosed for regulatory/sensitivity

We have begun a collaboration with 

Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) 

and consumer companies including 

Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive, PepsiCo, 

Neste and Procter &amp; Gamble to develop 

a Child Protection and Safeguarding 

Implementation Manual. This is done 

alongside a series of capacity building 

workshops to enable suppliers to learn, 

discuss and adopt pragmatic measures 

to strengthen the rights and protection 

for children. We conducted the first 

workshop in November 2019 in Jakarta 

and 70 participants from supplier 

companies, government representative, 

trade unions, and civil society organisations 

attended. Amongst the speakers were 

the commissioner of the Indonesian 

Child Protection Commission (Komisi 

Nasional Perlindungan Anak (KPAI)) and 

representatives from the Indonesian Palm 

Oil Association (Gabungan Pengusaha 

Kelapa Sawit Indonesia (GAPKI)), the Palm 

Oil Labour Unions Network (Jaringan Serikat 

Pekerja dan Serikat Buruh Sawit Indonesia 

(JAPBUSI)) and the Centre for Child Rights 

and Corporate Social Responsibility (CCR 

CSR).

There is also a collaborative effort in 

Malaysia with Earthworm Foundation (EF), 

Archer Daniel Midland Company (ADM), 

Avon and Nestlé to develop a directory of 

social services to guide the private sector in 

improving the health, safety, and education 

of children living on or near plantations. 

The Children in Plantation (CiP) Directory—

available in English and Bahasa Malaysia—

is the first publication of its kind in the 

country. It contains four priority areas: 

education, community engagement, birth 

registration, and other child protection 

related services for children and youth 

living in rural areas of Sabah.

According to a 2019 independent 

benchmark international report on the 

state of children’s rights and business 

published by the Global Child Forum (GCF), 

Wilmar ranked amongst the top global 

achievers in creating a positive impact on 

children’s rights. Scoring 7.4 out of 10, 

Wilmar surpassed the industry and company 

average score of 5.6. Moreover, our scores 

have doubled since 2014 thanks to our 

intensified efforts in addressing children’s 

rights and well-being in our operations and 

surrounding communities.

ETHICAL TREATMENT:

ELIMINATING THE RISK OF FORCED, TRAFFICKED OR BONDED LABOUR 

WORKING WITH UNIONS AND ESTABLISHING 

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS

Wilmar forbids any form of forced, trafficked 

or bonded labour within our operations 

or supply chain. Wages, identification 

documents and personal belongings are 

not withheld from employees and workers, 

unless with their consent. Secure lockers are 

provided for workers to store their personal 

belongings.

At our Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil 

operations, Wilmar recruits personnel directly 

without engaging third-party agencies. This 

eliminates any risk of force, coercion or 

contract misrepresentation. In Nigeria and 

Ghana, we limit use of any contracted agent 

to logistical and administrative purposes. To 

prevent any risk of exploitation, all monetary 

transactions are directly between Wilmar 

and the workers.

Wilmar respects collective bargaining, and 

the right of all employees to form and join 

trade unions. In the absence of a proper 

collective agreement or association, workers 

are free to join any other unions.

In Indonesia, our strong working relationship 

with labour unions helps ensure continuous 

improvement for our workers’ quality of life 

at our oil palm estates. Wilmar’s work on 

converting workers’ employment status to 

permanent ones and providing subsidies 

and wages would not have been possible 

without collaboration with the unions. We 

also recognise that unions serve as effective 

mechanisms for raising grievances. To date, 

five collective bargaining agreements 

(CBAs) (Perjanjian Kerja Bersama) have 

been established in across several locations. 

These have been formed in partnership 

with Serbundo and HUKATAN-Konfederasi 

Serikat Buruh Sejahtera Indonesia (KSBSI). 

The agreements in West Sumatra and West 

Kalimantan cover multiple Wilmar sites. 

While our Malaysian mills and plantations 

are not unionised due to a lack of union 

presence in Sabah and Sarawak, ongoing 

engagement with workers on pay and 

conditions has been established and all 

estates have dedicated social and welfare 

committees to address wages. In Ghana, 

managerial staff are precluded from 

union membership to prevent conflict of 

interest. However, in Nigeria all permanent 

staff and management are eligible for 

union membership. This is in line with 

the regulations set out in the respective 

countries. 

WORKERS UNIONISED OR COVERED BY CBAs

Sustainability Report 2019  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Our Grievance Procedure is open to all 

external and internal stakeholders, but is 

primarily used by external stakeholders 

for cases related to our suppliers. All our 

employees, workers, and local communities 

have separate dedicated site-level remedial 

mechanisms and resolution processes for 

any complaints.

In 2016, BSR conducted an assessment 

that found workers in Indonesia had a low 

level of awareness of available grievance 

mechanisms. To facilitate a greater level of 

engagement, in 2019 Wilmar contributed 

to a programme organised by RSPO 

and Ulula—an organisation involved in 

transparency and accountability for social 

development—on trialling a mobile 

phone-based grievance reporting tool at 

our Sabahmas estate in Sabah, Malaysia. 

The tool allows workers to raise concerns 

anonymously, make enquiries, or provide 

feedback related to working conditions 

directly with RSPO. Ultimately, RSPO hopes 

to make more tools available to assist 

members in addressing and improving 

labour conditions. 

Similarly, Wilmar has developed a 

customised reporting mobile phone 

application for our sugar mills, farms and 

bioethanol operations in Australia. The 

application can be used to report potential 

issues allowing for images to easily be 

attached thus eliminating the need for a 

paper-based reporting system and enabling 

Wilmar to swiftly allocate the appropriate 

resources to tackle any logged issues.

IMPLEMENTING REPORTING MECHANISMS AT OUR SITES

READ MORE 

ON THE ULULA 

PILOT PROJECT

Providing a safe working environment and 

upholding high health and safety standards 

remains an ongoing priority. In accordance 

with health and safety policies, we ensure 

that all measures and facilities are up-to-date 

and conduct regular training for workers. 

All workers are provided with personal 

protective equipment (PPE) and share best 

practice between sites. Free medical care is 

also given to all workers and their families 

across all estates.

Indonesia 

We have in place an air pollution and haze 

emergency response procedure that was 

established in 2018. This covers the provision 

of adequate PPE measures, such as the 

wearing of face masks, following procedures 

for workers with respiratory issues, issuing 

stop-work orders in dire situations, and 

following established procedures for medical 

treatment or evacuations. A similar haze 

response procedure is available in Malaysia. 

In North Sumatra, we are undergoing trials to 

gather sufficient data around implementing 

mandatory rotation systems for workers 

handling pesticides. This rotational system 

will require these workers to switch roles 

every three months to work with no chemical 

exposure. This is to minimise prolonged 

exposure and maintain safe chemical 

levels for our workers. Once successfully 

implemented in North Sumatra, the rotation 

system will be scaled up and implemented 

throughout our plantation operations. As 

part of our partnership work with Verité, a 

review will be conducted in 2020.

India 

In India, national safety weeks are organised 

by SRSL on health and safety programmes 

for employees. At the same time, awareness 

trainings are also conducted for housewives 

to understand better and safer utilisation of 

liquid petroleum gas (LPG) at their homes.

Australia 

Wilmar Sugar Australia supports the national 

‘R U OK?’ initiative through efforts to 

raise mental health awareness amongst 

employees. This encourages them to reach 

out and support colleagues who may be 

going through a difficult time.

In October 2019, there was a fire incident 

at one of our mills at Burdekin, which 

was quickly contained and extinguished. 

Our comprehensive safety and health 

procedures ensured a rapid response 

allowing all employees and workers to be 

safely evacuated.

ENSURING SAFE AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS

Wilmar invests in the capabilities of our 

workforce. Workers and employees have 

access to leadership training programmes 

to further develop their managerial skills and 

to allow for better transitions into leading 

roles. Rather than limit these opportunities 

to single job categories, we provide job 

rotation to broaden exposure and develop 

wider skills. We provide long-term incentives 

for both senior and junior management. We 

also offer soft-skill management training 

programmes and personal development 

holistic growth initiatives for all employees 

in order to increase transferrable skills for 

future employment opportunities. 

Wilmar’s retention and development 

programmes are guided by our Equal 

Opportunity Policy. Besides rewarding 

performance, we encourage all our 

employees to approach their line manager 

or human resources department to discuss 

career prospects and potential training 

opportunities that may lead to career 

progression. 

Since 2016, total Group turnover rates have 

been relatively low, signifying a consistent 

and satisfied workforce.

Each year we simulate cane rail incidents in 

all four of our Queensland milling regions 

to better prepare crews for emergency 

situations. One of our new initiatives involved 

using GPS technology to help improve 

emergency service response times. A mock 

railway incident in the Herbert region in 2019 

enabled us to trial Wilmar’s new track layer 

over the Google Earth system. Cane train 

crews were able to provide police, fire and 

ambulance crews with exact GPS coordinates 

of the training incident, enabling the fastest 

possible emergency response time.

Cane rail incident simulations

In Australia we 

continue to place a top 

priority on health and 

safety, including our 

1,600-kilometre cane 

rail network.

We work persistently to reduce the occurrence of workplace 

accidents and injuries. At our oil palm plantations, our lost 

time injury frequency rates (LTIFR) decreased by more than 

50% in Sarawak compared to 2018. In Central Kalimantan, 

rates have been steadily declining over the past few years, 

now 70% less than 2016. However, we see increased rates at 

all other sites, almost double at Sabah and a 76% increase 

in Nigeria compared to 2018.

At our mills, LTIFR have decreased across all of our Indonesia 

operations. In Central Kalimantan and Sabah, rates have also 

been steadily declining since 2016. Our Nigeria mill also 

showed a 65% drop in the past year. With many workers 

joining the new mill with little prior safety experience, it 

took some time for the strict safety measures at our Nigeria 

mill to be fully implemented. Also, an experienced EHS 

officer was employed towards the end of 2018 and the 

changes implemented since has helped to improve safety. 

While these improved rates are a testament to our stricter 

health and safety measures, our Group-wide operational 

health and safety data collection system has improved 

which allows for more accurate reporting figures. 

Rates remain relatively low at our palm refineries and there 

were no recorded accidents at our sugar plantations or 

Indonesia and India refineries in 2019.

LTIFR PER 200,000 WORKING HOURS 2016-2019

1. 

The 2019 LTIFR figures for Nigeria &amp; Myanmar plantations and Australia &amp; India mills have been updated from data presented in Wilmar’s Annual 

Report 2019 after further review by site operations and are accurate as of 25 May 2020.

2. 

While we have data for Myanmar in 2016 and 2017, it is not comparable as reporting initially followed harvesting cycles and not calendar years.

3. 

As this is the first year of reporting for India, there is a need to review the robustness of their reporting systems and data.

We regret to report seven workplace-

related fatalities in 2019. Three occurred 

in Indonesia, three were in Malaysia, and 

one fatality occured at one of our refineries 

in India. Two of the deaths were related to 

the employees’ own pre-existing health 

conditions. One was a workplace accident 

involving a tractor, two were from falls, and 

one from entanglement in an empty fruit 

bunch (EFB) conveyor belt. One recorded 

fatality was linked to the use of a lathe 

machine for metalwork during an employee’s 

personal day off. 

Structural conditions of equipment or 

work areas related to these incidents have 

been assessed and improved. Workplace 

standard operating procedures (SOP) 

have been updated to address tractor and 

conveyor belt safety, and trainings have 

been conducted on these safety measures. 

Safety barriers and sensors have now been 

installed on our lathe machines. To ensure 

that employees do not enter premises 

and use equipment on their days off, we 

now provide security guards with on-duty 

employee lists. Mill managers have also 

created related compliance procedures 

that will result in disciplinary action if not 

adhered to. 

Recognising that we continue to see an 

unacceptably high number of fatalities, 

Wilmar implemented site-level reviews 

in 2019. The findings indicated that the 

standards aimed at improving planning

Sugar consumption is rising in many parts 

of the world, particularly in developing 

countries in tandem with lower domestic 

sugar prices.41 We are aware that 

excessive sugar consumption can lead 

to adverse health effects and commit to 

full transparency by including nutritional 

labelling on all our products. As such, 

our CSR Sugar business has a range of 

products called ‘Better for You’ which 

contain alternative sugar products with  a 

naturally low glycemic index.

Our operations in Australia and New 

Zealand also support a nutrition information 

website—Sugar Nutrition Resource 

Centre—which publishes sugar and 

nutrition facts, reviewed by a panel of 

independent scientific experts. The aim is 

to provide science-based information within 

the context of the region to help address 

issues around the role of sugar in nutrition. 

The information provided is in line with the 

Australian Dietary Guidelines. Newsletters 

and resources addressing topics such as 

obesity, dental health and sugar tax are 

also made available.

Sustainability Report 2019  |  Wilmar International Limited 

Working with communities

Wilmar respects the rights of Indigenous peoples and 

local communities’ lands, territories and resources. 

This includes surrounding community members in the 

vicinity of our operations and smallholders who may 

also have rights to Indigenous or local territories and 

the explicit right to develop their own land. 

Smallholders account for 40% of the 

world’s palm oil production and are a 

critical part of the palm oil industry. In 

comparison to companies with access 

to resource and agronomic expertise, 

smallholders are faced with unique 

challenges in meeting sustainability 

compliance. Smallholders account 

for 10.1% of Wilmar’s supply base. 

In 2019, we received 392,868 metric 

tonnes (MT) of FFB from 16,064 

scheme smallholders and 594,418 

MT of FFB from 18,099 independent 

smallholders—4.0% and 6.1% of our 

total supply respectively. 

Out of 42,849 total hectares (including 

35,391 planted hectares) owned by 

scheme smallholders, 5,095 hectares 

(11.9%) in Indonesia and Ghana are 

RSPO certified. This contributed to 

15,241 MT of CSPO and 3,843 MT of 

CSPK in production in 2019, about 

2% of our total certified output. We 

also sourced 31,955 MT of FFB from 

independent smallholders that was 

RSPO certified, accounting for 5.4% 

of the total independent supply 

sourced.

SMALLHOLDER FFB VOLUMES 

SOURCED 2019 (MT, %)

We are committed to supporting the 

inclusion of smallholders into the 

supply chain. This is done through 

consultation and collaboration with 

the farmers, providing technical 

assistance, and supporting them in 

achieving compliance with our NDPE 

policy for palm oil smallholders. 

We are working to ensure that 

100% of our smallholder suppliers 

are supported by smallholder 

programmes. This means that each 

scheme and independent smallholder 

linked to our supply chain will have 

access to a platform for expertise 

and the sharing of best practice 

in order to meet their targets for 

sustainable production and economic 

growth. We encourage our third-

party suppliers to develop their 

own programmes and welcome 

support from governments, CSOs 

and customers to assist smallholders 

in reaching compliance.

100% of our scheme smallholders are 

covered by a Wilmar programme. We 

particularly strive to help our palm 

oil scheme smallholders achieve 

certification under applicable national 

certifications and, where relevant, 

RSPO guidance.

For our independent smallholders, we 

have programmes specific for each 

country to engage all smallholders. 

We target to benefit 100% of 

independent smallholder palm oil 

suppliers enrolled in/covered by our 

smallholder support programmes by 

2020 for Ghana, 2023 for Nigeria, 

and 2025 for Indonesia. These 

programmes are sometimes linked 

to sustainable certification, but is 

not exclusively an objective for our 

independent smallholders.

ASSISTING SMALLHOLDERS 

In 2018, we launched the Adum Smallholder 

Scheme designed to provide assistance 

to 300 smallholders in developing 1,400 

hectares of their farmlands into a smallholder 

oil palm plantation by employing sustainable 

and best agricultural practices. The 

programme introduced an alternative 

livelihood scheme (ALS) to help diversify 

income through activities such as baking, 

poultry farming, and beekeeping. 

In August 2019, the New Planting Procedure 

for the project area was completed and 20 

hectares of planting was initiated but yet to 

allocate out. We are on track to complete 

all planting by 2020 before being allocated 

to all farmers. In the meantime, the farmers 

can benefit from the ALS trainings provided 

earlier.

In 2017, we launched the Pilot Outgrower 

Scheme with four co-operatives from 

the surrounding areas of Wilmar’s Biase 

Plantation Ltd. (BPL) at Cross River state. 

Under the programme, BPL works with 

outgrowers to establish their plantations 

during planting season, following our 

sustainable agricultural procedures. The 

company also provides low interest funding 

for the entire project. Since the start of the 

programme, we have provided agricultural 

assistance to 43 independent smallholders 

covering 150 hectares. 

In 2019, we have been in discussions with 

the Central Bank of Nigeria to scale up the 

programme in Phase Two with hopes to 

cover 60 farmers by 2020 (200 hectares) 

and 400 farmers in 2021 (1500 hectares). 

We target to cover the remaining 1,540 

farmers in Nigeria by 2023. 

Since the start of setting our target in 

2018, 8,699 independent smallholders 

have participated in our ISPO certification 

training programme, collectively covering 

9,389 hectares. The programme covers 

training on best management practices 

and sustainability requirements.

Throughout 2019, we also partnered 

with four co-operatives of independent 

smallholders in Riau and Jambi to achieve 

ISPO certification. The co-operatives 

consist of 735 smallholders who manage 

a total of almost 1,863 hectares of land. 

The smallholders received assistance 

on practices such as integrated farmer 

guidance programmes, farmer organisation 

empowerment, and implementing a 

traceability programme to help track palm 

oil from the plantations to the refinery. One 

co-operative achieved ISPO certification in 

2019, with three more to follow in 2020.

We also have a voluntary fertiliser 

programme for our Indonesian independent 

smallholders which covers aspects of 

fertiliser, price incentives and best practice. 

Since 2017, participation has increased 

from 8,864 to 15,572, accounting for a 75% 

increase by 2019.

In Malaysia programmes are being 

implemented at three of our mills in 

Sabah until 2020 to assist independent 

smallholders. This is in collaboration with 

Wild Asia’s smallholder programme and 

entails building capacity to achieve MSPO 

and RSPO certification, classroom training 

and a fertiliser credit scheme. Out of the 

720 smallholders supplying our mills, 220 

of them are covered by this programme. 

In total, more than US$ 3.27 million was 

invested in smallholder engagements in 

2019.

In Latin America, we are working with 

our first-tier palm oil suppliers to build 

capacity and provide training to their 

smallholder suppliers through innovative 

local partnership platforms. 

In 2019 we began the second phase of our 

Wilmar Small Growers Support Colombia 

(WISSCo) programme, called WISSCo2. We 

plan to reach 437 smallholders in Colombia 

to enhance their sustainable practices and 

encourage them on their path to certification 

by training trainers, training smallholders, 

and implementing audit assessments. This 

follows the completion of our first two-year 

training programme under WISSCo. The 

programme is fully sponsored by our joint 

venture partner, Olenex, and customer, 

FrieslandCampina. 

Through the Wilmar Supports Sustainable 

Entrepreneurs (WISSE) programme, we 

initially trained 3,300 smallholders as 

sustainable entrepreneurs. We are now 

training an additional 1,800 smallholders 

and began a follow-up programme in 

September 2019 to assist 900 of these 

scheme smallholders in becoming RSPO 

certified. In 2019, pre-audits of two mills 

were carried out and a ‘toolbox’ was created 

containing SOPs, templates and document 

appropriate for smallholder certification. We 

are scheduled to carry out training in 2020. 

The programme will take three years and 

is sponsored by Olenex and its customers, 

through a crowd funding scheme called 

Mariposa.

We have implemented training programmes for sugar outgrowers in Myanmar covering 

good farming practices for land preparation, planting systems, cane nutrient requirements, 

fertiliser application, weed control, and the safe handling and application of chemicals. 

In July 2019, our India sugar operations began a best management practice training 

programme for cane growers associated with SRSL in collaboration with Solidaridad 

Asia, which covers:

• 

Training and capacity building to create awareness about new cane varieties, innovative 

technologies of certain grub and weed menaces and mechanisation.

• 

Adopting wide-row planting to benefit from higher productivity, water saving, and 

raising intercrops for additional income.

• 

No-trash burning practices and using in-situ mulching to conserve moisture, control 

weeds, and enrich soil fertility. A unique audio tune has also been activated on 

mobiles phones of field staff to create mass awareness amongst supplying farmers, 

which can be heard when the farmers call Wilmar employees on their mobile phones.

• 

On-site production of vermi-compost to improve soil health through recycling farm 

waste and in-situ mulching of trash while avoiding burning. 2000 ready-made ‘vermi-

beds’ have been supplied to farmers cost-free in the project area to date.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT 

Many of our operations are in rural areas 

of developing countries and our activities 

have direct and indirect impacts on the 

livelihoods of employees, their families, 

and the neighbouring communities. We 

want to ensure we contribute in a positive 

way as good corporate citizens in the rural 

communities where we operate. 

We are committed to respect and uphold 

legal and customary land tenure rights 

of communities and individual rights of 

Indigenous and local communities. Prior to 

any new planting, Free, Prior and Informed 

Consent (FPIC) must be granted to ensure 

local communities have clear and specific 

avenues to negotiate the conditions of 

any project. This is in accordance with the 

United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 

Indigenous People (UNDRIP) and the High 

Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA) toolkit. We 

expect the same of our suppliers. 

In land-related planning, participatory 

mapping is carried out to involve the 

communities, governments, and supporting 

NGOs. If a dispute or conflict arises, we 

will honour long-term relationships with 

the communities and amicably solve issues 

with all stakeholders, for example through 

mediation. Our operations teams will also 

work to identify and provide remediation 

whenever Wilmar has caused or contributed 

to negative human rights impacts, such 

as in relation to Indigenous and local 

communities’ rights and labour rights. 

While there are formal avenues to 

raise grievances through our grievance 

mechanism and via site-level complaints 

mechanisms, a dedicated protocol related to 

the no exploitation component of our NDPE 

policy will be published in 2020 to better 

address breaches of legal and customary 

Indigenous and community rights. 

We also seek to support food security for 

local communities through assisting with 

crop diversity and/or security of food prices.

Respecting community rights

We provide infrastructure and programmes 

to facilitate community self-reliance at our 

operations for worker families and local 

communities. This includes the provision 

of schools, maintaining worker housing, 

and establishing public facilities in and 

around plantations. In 2019, Wilmar invested 

US$ 10 million in community development 

initiatives and provisions. Some examples 

of community programmes are shown in 

page 108-109.

Community infrastructure and programmes



In April 2018, a complaint was submitted 

to the RSPO against one of Wilmar’s 

subsidiaries, PT. PHP regarding plasma co-

operation with the local community. The case 

was closed in September 2018, passing the 

case to RSPO’s Investigation and Monitoring 

Unit (IMU) to monitor implementation of 

the action plan. The investigation by RSPO 

was concluded in January 2020 with the 

resolution agreement signed by all parties 

in April 2020.

In September 2018, Wilmar commissioned 

Earthworm Foundation (EF) to conduct 

a comprehensive evaluation into issues 

raised against Wilmar’s internal systems on 

social grievance and resolution at three of 

its subsidiaries in Pasaman Barat in West 

Sumatra, including that of our subsidiary PT. 

Primatama Mulia Jaya. These issues date 

back to a land acquisition in the 1990s and 

reflect the challenges of the complex land 

use and ownership matters with overlapping 

or un-delineated land rights in concessions 

in Indonesia. Hundreds of stakeholders in 

Pasaman Barat were engaged, including 

members of the affected community, 

village heads, community and customary 

leaders, smallholder co-operative units, local 

NGOs, and Wilmar management. Multiple 

specific community-related issues and 

recommendations were identified to address 

these concerns and achieve resolutions. We 

began working on implementing Earthworm 

Foundation’s recommendations to address 

specific gaps while continuing engagement 

with the affected communities in an attempt 

to resolve the related conflicts in Pasaman 

Barat. 

In November 2018, Wilmar explored a 

desktop-based risk assessment related 

to Wilmar in Pasaman Barat with the 

Forest Peoples Programme (FPP) and the 

RSPO Investigation Monitoring Unit. We 

communicated this position to FPP and 

the RSPO after we shared the report in 

March 2019. 

There are currently three active RSPO 

complaint cases involving Wilmar and local 

communities in West Sumatra. In October 

2019, we published the latest updates 

via our Sustainability Brief detailing the 

progress of conflict cases in Pasaman 

Barat. Wilmar continues to engage and 

work closely with the RSPO to ensure the 

cases are handled properly and with higher 

accountability and will transparently report 

bi-annually on our progress to resolve 

intrinsic issues within the region. 

Update on the

Closed RSPO complaint case

Pasaman Barat Community conflicts

on PT. Permata Hijau Pasaman (PHP) 

Wilmar takes every allegation of human 

rights violations seriously and ensure 

follow up by a thorough investigation 

into the cause.

We are committed to respect and 

uphold legal and customary land 

tenure rights of communities and 

individual rights of Indigenous 

and local communities.

Wilmar has ongoing school redevelopment programmes in Indonesia, Nigeria and Ghana to 

ensure that schools are upgraded with adequate facilities including computer labs, science 

labs and libraries. We also aim to ensure that all settings are equipped for extracurricular 

activities, such as music, arts, sports and uniformed groups. The redevelopment programme 

annually benefits between 6,500 and 7,000 children from pre-primary school age through 

to secondary school age.

Wilmar provides in-kind contributions for disaster relief efforts in times of need, such as 

the unprecedented floods in North Queensland in February 2019. This is in addition to 

the ongoing support we provide to community festivals and events through our various 

sponsorships and donations. We are also proud supporters of youth programmes, including 

partnering with the North Queensland Cowboys National Rugby League team to host junior 

rugby league clinics in our milling regions.

In support of the 2019 Australia bushfires, Wilmar Sugar Australia donated AUS $20,000 to 

the Victorian Bushfire Appeal as monetary aid. We have also been approached to provide 

sugar to beekeepers in several states where bushfires have destroyed hives and natural 

vegetation. The Queensland government has purchased the first order of 35 pallets of sugar, 

which was delivered in March 2020. One of our employees was also a volunteer firefighter 

during this time to assist efforts in New South Wales. 

We were honoured to be recognised for our continuous community support at the inaugural 

Hinchinbrook Business Awards, where we received the Heart of Hinchinbrook Community 

Spirit Award 2019. The judging panel commended Wilmar for our commitment to the local 

community, and the contribution made to the social fabric of the region.

In India, our SRSL operations have close relationships with surrounding communities. We 

have contributed to infrastructure by providing access to drinking water, office buildings, 

canteens and banking facilities. The operations provided drinking water and food provisions 

to the communities as well as monetary donations in the face of the massive flooding that 

took place in 2019. Medical check-ups and dispensaries are provided to employees, safety 

training programmes are given to homemakers who live in the area, mosquito fogging is 

implemented, and vaccinations are provided to local communities.

Our operations in Australia are 100 years old with communities built around these areas 

to specifically support these operations. There is therefore a high dependence on our 

provisions. We have placed a significant focus on children’s safety education programmes. 

We run ‘Cane Train’ safety awareness campaigns for the community. This includes our ‘Cane 

Train’ safety programmes in schools and kindergartens, multimedia advertising campaigns, 

and media releases highlighting the potential hazards of ignoring signals and warnings at 

cane train crossings. In 2019, we expanded our ‘Use your Train Brain’ campaign, with the 

development of print, TV and radio ads, postcards, billboards, and collateral for children.

63 In the course of compiling data for our 2015 Sustainability Report, we discovered that methodology for collating incidents differed across our sites, 

with some sites using national or regional thresholds for reporting, and others using international Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 

standards. Due to these inconsistencies, we have excluded LTIR reporting in our 2015 report. We resumed LTIR reporting in our 2016 Sustainability 

Report after setting a more consistent reporting standard across the Group.

64 Robust systems for our accident reporting for our Nigeria mills were still being established prior to 2018. We will now include accident reporting 

moving forward.

GRI content index

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a multi-stakeholder 

standard for sustainability reporting, providing guidance on 

determining report content and indicators. GRI is the first 

and most widely adopted global standard for sustainability 

reporting and has been designed to enhance the global 

comparability and quality of information on environmental 

and social impacts, thereby enabling greater transparency 

and accountability of organisations. Sustainability reporting 

based on the GRI Standards should provide a balanced 

and reasonable representation of an organisation’s positive 

and negative contributions towards the goal of sustainable 

development. 

This report has been prepared in accordance with the latest 

version of the GRI Standards: Core option.

Sustainability Report 2019  |  Wilmar International Limited 

The Management is responsible for the 

preparation of the Subject Matters in 

accordance with the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting 

Standards. The Board has ultimate 

responsibility for the company’s sustainability 

reporting.

Our responsibility is to form a conclusion on Wilmar’s preparation of the Subject Matters 

based on our work. We performed our work in accordance with International Standard 

on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) (Revised) – Assurance Engagements 

other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (the “Standard”). This 

Standard requires that we plan and perform our work to form the conclusion. The extent 

of our work performed depends on our professional judgment and our assessment of 

the engagement risk.

Our review was limited to the information on the select indicators set out within the Report 

from 01 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 and our responsibility does not include:

Our review was limited to the information on the select indicators set out within the Report 

from 01 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 and our responsibility does not include:

• 

Any work in respect of sustainability information published elsewhere in Wilmar’s 

annual report, website and other publications,

• 

Sustainability information prior to 01 January 2019 and subsequent to 31 December 

2019, and

• 

Management’s forward looking statements such as targets, plans and intentions.

As a basis for the assurance engagement, we have used the criterion of “Accuracy” 

as defined by GRI and specific criteria determined by Wilmar as being relevant for its 

sustainability performance. We consider these reporting criteria to be relevant and 

appropriate to review the Report.

Our limited assurance engagement has been 

planned and performed in accordance with 

the ISAE 300065 Assurance Engagement 

Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical 

Financial Information. 

A limited assurance engagement consists of 

making enquiries and applying analytical and 

other review procedures.  Our procedures 

were designed to provide a limited level 

of assurance and as such do not provide 

all the evidence that would be required to 

provide a reasonable level of assurance. 

We have complied with the independence 

and other ethical requirements of the 

Accounting and Corporate Regulatory 

Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional 

Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants 

and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), 

which is founded on fundamental principles 

of integrity, objectivity, professional 

competence and due care, confidentiality 

and professional behaviour.

Our firm applies Singapore Standards 

on Quality Control 1 of the Institute of 

Singapore Chartered Accountants and, 

accordingly, maintains a comprehensive 

system of quality control including 

Management’s and Board 

of Directors’ responsibility 

Auditor’s responsibility 

Reporting criteria

Assurance standard used 

and level of assurance

Auditor’s independence 

and quality control

An asterisk symbol (*) in the 

Sustainability Report denotes statements 

and claims on which we have performed 

limited assurance procedures. 

*

The Management is responsible for 

the collection and presentation of the 

information and for maintaining adequate 

records and internal controls that are 

designed to support the sustainability 

reporting process. For the purpose of the 

Sustainability Report 2019, there are no 

legally prescribed requirements relating 

to the verification of sustainability reports.

documented policies and procedures 

regarding compliance with ethical 

requirements, professional standards 

and applicable legal and regulatory 

requirements.

We have the required competencies and 

experience to conduct this assurance 

engagement. Our professionals have both 

the required assurance skills and experience 

in the applicable subject matters including 

environmental, social and financial aspects

The procedures performed depend 

on our judgement including the risk of 

material misstatement of the specific 

activity data, whether due to fraud or error. 

While we considered the effectiveness 

of Management’s internal controls when 

determining the nature and extent of our 

procedures, our review was not designed to 

provide assurance on internal controls. We 

believe that the evidence we have obtained 

is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 

basis for our conclusion.
