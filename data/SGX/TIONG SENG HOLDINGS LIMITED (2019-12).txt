BOARD STATEMENT 

 

The Board is pleased to present Tiong Seng Group’s third Sustainability Report. Tiong Seng aims to be 

the trusted investment choice in the real estate and built environment sector through delivering 

excellence and creating long-term value for our stakeholders. The Board considers sustainability 

issues as part of the business strategic formulation and decision-making processes. In this report, we 

are proud to share our sustainability approach on managing environmental, social and governance 

(ESG) issues that are important to us and our stakeholders.  

 

Board Assurance 

We believe strong sustainability governance is critical to our success. The Board plays an important 

role in the selection and review of ESG factors that are material to us and oversees the management 

of the performance relating to these factors. This report adheres to the Singapore Exchange (SGX)-ST 

Listing Rules 711A and 711B and references the internationally recognised Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI) Standards. 

 

Sustainability Initiatives 

As an established contractor and property developer, we are committed to contributing to a safe, 

high quality and sustainable built environment by using innovative technologies and adopting 

sustainable practices. We recognise the impacts that our operations and activities may have on 

society and the environment and seek to mitigate any potential negative impacts by implementing 

relevant measures. These measures include developing a comprehensive information management 

system to reduce paper consumption while streamlining our work processes, adopting efficient and 

sustainable construction methods and utilising mobile water recycling systems at our construction 

sites in Singapore to recycle water and reduce the silt introduced into drainage systems. In addition, 

we work closely with our suppliers, contractors and sub-contractors to identify opportunities to 

improve our sustainability performance.  

 

Upholding high environmental and occupational health and safety standards in all our projects is of 

utmost importance to our business. We provide relevant environmental, health and safety (EHS) 

training to site staff, workers and sub-contractor’s personnel through our satellite EHS training 

centres at several of our project sites across Singapore. 

 

In the past year we received a Platinum Star award from the Building Construction Authority for our 

sustained leadership, excellence and innovation in Singapore’s built environment. We additionally 

secured $125 million worth of green loans and environmental performance-linked facilities from 

OCBC Bank and DBS Bank, of which $70 million will exclusively be used for green projects. Apart from 

diversifying our sources of funding, these facilities will allow us to focus on our environmental and 

green objectives to make a positive difference in our society. 

Resilience against COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented the world with a major and evolving challenge. Tiong Seng has 

taken immediate actions to address this challenge to minimise business disruptions and support 

recovery efforts. The Board monitors developments relating to COVID-19 closely to ensure that we 

comply with laws and regulations strictly, including the temporary ceasing of our construction 

activities following the Singapore government’s Circuit Breaker measures, and the implementation of 

Safe Management Measures once our operations reopen. Our utmost priority is to ensure the health 

and safety of our workers and employees, whilst preserving jobs.

Materiality Assessment  

 

In 2017, a formal materiality assessment was conducted to identify the ESG topics that are most 

important to our business and stakeholders. The materiality assessment was guided by the GRI 

Principles of Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement. The material topics were identified and 

prioritised based on inputs from our stakeholders, consideration of trends and developments in the 

construction and real estate development sectors as well as global and local sustainability issues. In 

2019, we re-validated the list of material topics identified in the past two years to ensure they remain 

relevant to our business and stakeholders.

Managing Our Supply Chain 

Our suppliers and sub-contractors play an important role in helping us deliver quality work as we rely 

on them for various construction and building materials as well as providing reliable and timely 

services for our operations. Before engaging the services of our suppliers and sub-contractors, they 

are assessed based on their financial capacity and business track record, human resource capability, 

quality of work, and other relevant criteria, such as environment, health and safety records. In 

addition, we conduct regular assessments on the performance of our suppliers and sub-contractors in 

order to maintain high operational standards.

ENERGY, POLLUTION AND EMISSIONS 

 

2019’s Highlights 

 

 

 

The usage of electricity and diesel accounts for our total energy consumption and the corresponding 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that we emit. We understand the importance of reducing our 

contribution to climate change and therefore strive to reduce our GHG emissions through the 

adoption of renewable energy projects and improvement of our energy efficiency.  

 

Dust and exhaust gas generated in our operations pose a threat to the health of workers on site and 

compromise the air quality of surrounding areas. We also recognise that noise and vibration 

generated by tools and machines during construction activities can have significant health effects. 

Hence, various measures have been taken to manage and reduce air and noise pollution from our 

operations to safeguard the health of our workers and surrounding communities. In addition, we

comply with the National Environment Agency (NEA)’s regulations and industry standards to improve 

air quality and to protect the environment by using instrumentation devices to measure and monitor 

defined parameters of air quality and noise emission. We ensure that the Pollutant Standards Index 

(PSI) reading remain below 50 and the average noise level is kept below 75 dB(A) during the day (7am 

to 7pm) and below 65 dB(A) at night (7pm to 10pm), at applicable sites. 

 

In 2019, we introduced the use of battery-operated tool technology to reduce electricity consumption 

on site. We have also launched a “Save Energy” campaign on site and in our headquarters to reduce 

non-essential use of air-conditioning and lighting and ensure that air-condition temperatures are set 

at a minimum of 25 centigrade. 

 

Our electricity consumption was 245,475 kWh [884 Giga Joules (GJ)] in 2019, an increase of 59% from 

154,635 kWh in 2018. Our electricity intensitya increased from 1.03 kWh per square metre of project 

area in 2018 to 2.10 in 2019. There was an 26% increase in our diesel consumption, from 375,478 

litres per year in 2018 to 472,832 litres (17,158 GJ) in 2019 with the diesel intensity1 increasing from 

2.51 to 4.05 litres per square metre of project area. The total energy consumption from electricity 

and diesel is 18,042 GJ in 2019. The increase of energy consumption and intensity in 2019 was due to 

the increase in size of project sites as they progress towards the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) 

stage. Notwithstanding the increase in energy consumption, we have met all our 2019 targets.  

 

We strive to minimise our environmental footprint by ensuring that our electricity consumption 

remains below 10 kWh per m2 of GFA and our diesel consumption remains below 6 litres of diesel per 

m2 of GFA. The variation in the on-site energy intensity depends on the phase of construction and 

whether workers’ quarters are included in the construction sites, which contributes substantially to 

energy demand. Lower energy intensities were recorded in 2017 and 2018 as our construction sites 

had less or no workers’ quarters. We will continue to review the data trends and adjust our targets 

accordingly.

direct (scope 1) GHG emissionsc and indirect (scope 2) GHG emissionsd, and the total GHG emissions 

intensity which is calculated based on total GHG emissions over m2 of GFA. 

 

The total GHG emissions from electricity and diesel have increased by 28% from 1,078 tonnes of 

carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in 2018 to 1,379 tCO2e in 2019 while the GHG emissions intensity1 

has increased from 0.0073 tCO2e per m2 in 2018 to 0.012 tCO2e per m2 in 2019.

WATER 

 

2019’s Highlights 

 

 

Singapore’s total water demand is expected to double by 2060, with the non-domestic sector 

accounting for 70% of Singapore’s water demand according to PUBe. High levels of water use put 

significant strains on water resources and result in wastewater pollution that could lead to the 

degradation of water quality. Poor water quality and water stress can compromise important 

ecosystem services and affect the quality of life of local communities. The consequences can be 

severe particularly in water-scarce Singapore, where the threat to water security is expected to be 

further exacerbated by the impacts of climate change.  

 

At Tiong Seng, we are committed to reducing our total water withdrawal by using water-saving 

features and increasing our efforts to recycle water where applicable. At our construction sites, 

NEWater (recycled water) is used in lieu of potable water and push-button water taps are installed in 

toilets and washrooms to reduce water consumption. 

 

To support the Singapore Government’s efforts to conserve water and to minimise water wastage, 

water recycling plants are installed at each of our project sites. These water recycling plants use 

filtration systems to recycle water collected from rain water and site run-offs and the filtered water is 

used for construction purposes. The filtered water is also used for the cleaning of construction 

vehicles and the flushing of toilets. Excess filtered water is discharged as “clean water” into public 

drains.

As a result of our water conservation efforts, our water withdrawal from the Public Utilities Board was 

reduced by 30% from 43,617 m3 in 2018 to 30,443 m3 in 2019. Our water intensityf decreased by 13% 

from 0.30 m3 per m2 of project GFA in 2018 to 0.26 m3 per m2 of project GFA in 2019, achieving our 

target for 2019.  

 

In 2020, we target to keep our water withdrawal below 1 m3 per m2 of GFA. The variation in our water 

consumption depends largely on the phase of construction and whether there is a presence of 

workers’ quarters at the construction sites.

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE 

 

2019’s Highlights 

 

 

Construction activities may generate large amounts of waste which puts a strain on our natural 

resources and ultimately leads to environmental degradation. Proper waste management is necessary 

to avoid air, water and soil pollution, which pose a threat to the environment and human health. 

Similarly, effluents must be disposed properly especially where substantial quantities of chemicals and 

nutrients (principally nitrogen, phosphorous, or potassium) are present. Failing to do so would affect 

water quality and in turn negatively impact the ocean's biodiversity and aquatic ecosystems.  

 

We strive to ensure proper management and disposal of effluents by conducting regular testing of 

water discharged and complying with discharge quality standards. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) 

Meters have been installed at the water discharge points to monitor the quality of water discharged 

into public drains. The monitoring is conducted using closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage and 

readings obtained from the TSS Meters.

15 

We follow a robust framework to reduce, reuse and recycle the construction waste generated from 

our operations. In addition, several measures have been taken to monitor the quantity and 

composition of waste generated. Separate waste bins are placed at our construction sites for the 

collection of various waste types - general construction waste, steel, timber, and food waste. In order 

to monitor and improve on our waste management performance, vehicles carrying waste are 

weighed at the work site’s weighing bridge before they leave for the respective disposal sites. We also 

work with NEA-licenced waste collectors to ensure that the waste generated is properly disposed of. 

Our waste management performance is tracked on a regular basis through monthly reviews and data 

submitted to the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) each year under the Green and Gracious 

Builder Scheme.  

 

Further, we adopt innovative technologies and processes to reduce waste. In lieu of conventional 

construction methods, the Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) and pre-cast off-site 

production methods are used to reduce the need for wet work at our construction sites. We also 

utilise system formwork in our construction activities, which replaces and can be reused more than 

conventional metal and timber formworks. In addition, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is used 

in the management of steel design to reduce steel use and waste on site. 

 

General construction waste increased from 1,535,000 kg in 2018 to 1,736,600 in 2019. Timber waste 

and plywood waste also increased from 25,450 kg and 32,600 kg respectively in 2018 to 159,130 kg 

and 73,680 kg in 2019. On the other hand, rebar waste was reduced from 251,000 kg in 2018 to 

27,400 kg in 2019. The general construction waste, timber and plywood intensities increased from 

10.25 kg per m2, 0.17 kg per m2 and 0.22 kg per m2 respectively in 2018 to 14.89g kg per m2, 1.36 kg 

per m2 and 0.63 kg per m2 in 2019. The rebar intensity decreased from 1.68 kg per m2 in 2018 to 0.23 

kg per m2 in 2019. We were not able to meet our 2019 target of maintaining or reducing our general 

construction waste intensity. 

 

The increase in general construction, timber and plywood waste and their respective intensities was 

due to increase in size of project sites as they progress towards the TOP stage. At times, adjustments 

to planned construction methodology were necessary to be made on sites due to various constraints 

and projects specific requirement, further contributed to the higher consumption of materials 

including those that were of one-timed usage.

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY  

 

2019’s Highlights 

 

 

At Tiong Seng, we are committed to safeguarding the health and safety of our own employees and 

sub-contractors. Amid COVID-19, we will continue to monitor the outbreak and maintain close 

communications with all our employees, foreign workers and the relevant authorities. Where 

appropriate, we will provide support to our workers and make any special arrangements to ensure 

their needs and general well-being are met during this difficult period. 

Employee Health &amp; Safety  

 

We have an occupational health and safety (OHS) policy in place to protect all employees against 

possible occupational risks and prevent accidents from happening in the workplace. Information on 

the OHS policy is provided to all employees and new employees are informed of the policy during the 

Quality, Environmental, Occupational Health &amp; Safety (QEHS) induction programme. For new 

employees at our construction sites, the First-Day Environment, Health and Safety induction 

programme provides an overview of the OHS policy implemented at Tiong Seng. The Corporate EHS 

team participates in forums and seminars on a regular basis to keep abreast of the latest regulations 

and to re-examine the existing OHS policy to ensure regulatory compliance.

Safety updates, initiatives and our corporate health and safety targets are shared with our employees 

during daily tool box meetings and monthly EHS committee meetings held at all project sites. Our 

employees are encouraged to take part in safety initiatives, which include quarterly safety rewards, 

demonstrations, talks, and creating safety posters. Each year, safety awards are presented to projects 

with the best safety record. We provide our employees with OHS training relevant to their work scope 

and offer health reviews to eligible employees annually.   

 

We carry out risk assessments and safety inspections of machines and equipment on a regular basis 

to ensure that they are maintained in good condition and meet safety requirements. In addition, we 

conduct Construction Safety Audit Scoring System (ConSASS) audits every six months, to assess the 

welfare of the workers’ quarters and conduct inspections of toilet facilities regularly.  

 

The accident frequency rateh increased from 0.8 accidents per million man-hours in 2018 to 1.37 in 

2019. In 2019, the workplace injury ratei is 431 which was below the rate of 465.5 for the 

construction industry in Singapore during the same period. There were no high-consequence work-

related injuries in 2019 and the main injuries were splashes or ingress of particles to the eye, 

lacerations to hands and arms and ankle injuries from slips, trips and falls.  

 

In 2019, to eliminate work-related hazards and minimise risks, Tiong Seng introduced mandatory cut-

resistant gloves where the risk assessment identifies the potential for cuts. We have also successfully 

trialled the use of Body-Worn Cameras as part of our efforts to influence behavioural safety on sites. 

In addition, we have introduced the use of podium steps and height-adjustable working platforms 

instead of ladders in our new construction sites. 

 

 

 

 

Sub-contractor Health &amp; Safety 

 

We strive to ensure the safety of our sub-contractors by creating a safe working environment at our 

construction sites and assessing the safety performance of our sub-contractors. 

 

 

 

 

 

h Excludes injuries that resulted in less than three days of sick leave, per Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s 

definition. Data includes all workers and staff under Tiong Seng Group employment at the stated projects and 

Singapore head office, as well as workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace is 

controlled by the Tiong Seng. 

i According to MOM, workplace injury rate =   number of fatal and non−fatal workplace injuries

number of workers 

× 100,000. A workplace 

injury is any personal injury or death resulting from a workplace accident, including work-related traffic injuries.

Information on Tiong Seng’s Environment, Health and Safety policy and health and safety targets is 

provided to our sub-contractors before and during commencement of work. Regular dialogues are 

held to allow our sub-contractors to share any concerns or issues that they may have relating to 

health and safety. Our sub-contractors are also provided with updates and information on incidents 

reported during our daily tool box meetings and monthly EHS committee meetings at all project sites. 

 

We require all our contractors to have a minimum BizSAFE Level 3 certification and we have achieved 

our 2019 target in this respect. They are also required to participate in briefings relating to risk 

assessment and safe work procedures as well as training relevant to their work scope. We will only 

engage new contractors who are not BizSAFE Level 3-certified if they can achieve the BizSAFE Level 3 

certification within three months of the date of the new contract agreement. In addition, all 

contractors (including our second and third tier suppliers) are encouraged to attain the Biz-SAFE-STAR 

status within two years of their Level 3 certification. In addition, safety inspections and audits are 

carried out every six months to ensure that machines and equipment used by sub-contractors are in 

proper working condition. Besides conducting an evaluation on each sub-contractor, we provide 

training to the members of its management team and share best safety practices with them.  

We have taken various measures to prevent workplace injuries and fatalities, which include providing 

additional training, developing management plans and carrying out a weekly inspection of our sites. 

We also adopt the Design for Safe Construction (DfSC) principles in our projects and offer various 

training courses to our employees and contractors such as the Incident Blackbox Learning.  

 

 

 

 

TSC EHS Satellite Training Centres 

Various satellite EHS training centres have been established at our project sites across Singapore to 

provide our site staff, workers and sub-contractor’s personnel with specialised training relating to 

OHS requirements and best practices in order to raise environmental and OHS standards.  

 

The training programme, which includes a mixture of classroom-based and practical training sessions, 

covers topics ranging from working height safety/scaffolding safety, electrical safety, lifting safety, 

excavation safety, hot-work safety, confined space safety, tunnel safety to good environmental 

practices. All participants are required to complete a 30-minute theory test and a practical work-at-

height test at the end of the training. A helmet sticker is issued to participants who pass the test.

Training &amp; Education  

We continue to invest in the professional development of our employees to align with our changing 

business needs. At Tiong Seng, we provide various learning opportunities throughout our employees’ 

careers to ensure that they develop the skills needed to perform their duties and drive excellence in 

operations and safety.  

We ensure that our workers are sent for Coretrade Training to equip them with the specific skills they 

need based on their job scopes and we assist them to obtain certification to perform certain tasks or 

to operate certain machineries. In 2019, each employee received an average of 57.7 hours of training, 

a slight increase from 55.4 hours in 2018.  

At Tiong Seng, we offer our chargehands (i.e. worker leaders) an opportunity to develop skills such as 

leadership through the Chargehand Grooming Programme. We also have a comprehensive 

Scholarship Training Programme which aims to hone the skills and build the careers of our scholars 

through an Immersion Programme, a Talent Development Programme and a Management Executive 

Programme. Our Undergraduate, Diploma and ITE Scholarship Sponsorship Programme offer 

scholarships to talented students undertaking tertiary education at local institutions. In addition, we 

have a Talent Management Programme in place to identify and retain talented employees and to 

support employee career progression, such as from worker to supervisory level.  

Despite the challenges of COVID-19, Tiong Seng continues to engage its staff through various means 

and initiatives to facilitate learning and innovation, maintain productivity and boost employee morale 

by encouraging self-created learning and training amongst employees via Webinars.  

 

 

 

Employment  

At Tiong Seng, we are committed to providing our employees with a working environment free from 

discrimination, irrespective of race, sex/gender, religion, national origin, age, disability, genetic 

information, marital status, or any other classification protected by law. We seek to support women, 

minorities, veterans and individuals with disabilities and strive to empower all our employees to reach 

their full potential.

Tiong Seng had 1,094 employees in 2019, a decrease from 1,341 in 2018, which was due to reduced 

number of projects in operation.  In 2019, our monthly new-hire rate was 1.50%, a drop from 2.36% 

in 2018, while our monthly turnover rate was 2.50%, a slight decrease from 2.63% in 2018.k 

 

 

Diversity and Equal Opportunity  

Tiong Seng strives to create a culture that promotes diversity and equality in the workplace. This 

culture enables us to gain greater access to a diverse pool of talents who drive business growth. A 

diverse and inclusive workforce is also crucial to the achievement of social and economic 

development goals.  

We recruit and hire our employees based on merit, skills and experience through fair selection 

processes. Every year, we conduct employee performance reviews in a fair and transparent manner 

to ensure fair and equal progression.

LOCAL COMMUNITY 

 

2019’s Highlights 

 

 

We strive to contribute to local communities by supporting various meaningful initiatives. Through 

the ‘Tiong Seng Bursary’, we provide deserving and financially disadvantaged students an opportunity 

to pursue a full-time undergraduate degree programme in engineering at the Singapore Institute of 

Technology.  The bursary covers the recipient’s educational expenses and fees for educational 

activities organised by the institute.

We recognise that our operations and activities have potential positive and negative impacts on the 

local communities in which we operate. Local communities benefit from the provision of upgraded 

facilities and housing but may be affected by noise and other environmental impacts originating from 

our construction activities. Therefore, we strive to mitigate our negative impacts and amplify our 

positive impacts on local communities.  

 

Safety around our sites 

 

Tiong Seng is committed to protecting the safety and comfort of local communities around our work 

sites by implementing EHS policies that ensure their welfare. A 24-hour hotline is in place for local 

communities to provide feedback on issues such as unsafe practices, noise pollution and other 

disturbances. 

 

 

 

 

Social Responsibility 

 

Our involvements in the local communities enable us to identify and channel our efforts to address 

local needs and concerns. We strive to address those needs by focusing on philanthropic activities, 

which include providing scholarships and bursaries to talented students at Ngee Ann, Nanyang and 

Singapore Polytechnics, BCA Academy, Institute of Technical Education (ITE), Nanyang Technological 

University (NTU), National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore Institute of Technology 

(SIT). We also contribute to community clubs and trade organisations through donations. In 2019, we 

contributed donations towards the SIT bursary which would eventually benefit up to 5 SIT students on 

a yearly basis who may otherwise not have the financial means to attend university. During the year, 

we awarded a scholarship to 1 student and we aim to increase the number of scholarships to 3 in 

2020. 

We seek to build good relationships within the real estate development community and the general 

public by sharing our experiences at industry events, forums and learning initiatives, such as the Lean 

Construction initiative led by the Ministry of Manpower and the publication of the HR Guidebook with 

the BCA. By sharing our expertise, we hope to do our part in developing and increasing the pool of 

talent in the construction industry.
