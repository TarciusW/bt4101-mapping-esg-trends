2019


About this Report and Contents

This is the ﬁ fth Group Sustainability Report by Singapore 

Telecommunications Limited (Singtel). It covers the 

sustainability performance of our operations in Singapore, 

where Singtel is headquartered, and Optus, our wholly-

owned subsidiary in Australia, for the ﬁ nancial year 1 April 

2018 to 31 March 2019 (FY2019). 

This Sustainability Report (SR2019) covers the company’s 

strategies, initiatives and performance in relation to 

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues. 

All data, statistics and improvement targets are for the 

Group’s operations in Singapore and Australia unless 

stated otherwise. Group-level ﬁ gures are in Singapore 

dollars, using the exchange rate of A$1 to S$0.9898. No 

restatements were made from the previous report except 

revenue-related indicators in FY2018 on Page 19 which 

have been retrospectively adjusted to take into account 

Singtel Group’s adoption of all applicable Singapore 

Financial Reporting Standards (International) from 

1 April 2018, and staff  training-related ﬁ gures of Optus for 

FY2018 due to errors in certain training hours recorded 

which aff ected the Singtel Group ﬁ gure on Page 27. There 

were no signiﬁ cant changes to the organisation and our 

supply chain during the reporting cycle.

This report captures the highlights and achievements 

of FY2019 and should be read together with Singtel 

Sustainability and Sustainability Report 2019 webpages, 

which contain our corporate sustainability information 

and additional annexes like GRI Index and EY assurance

In 2019, Singtel celebrates 140 years 

of heritage. From the ﬁ rst telephone 

service in Singapore in 1879 to our 

latest developments in 5G, one 

thing that remains unchanged is 

our commitment to ensuring the 

sustainable growth of our business 

and meeting the long-term needs of 

all our stakeholders.

Today, the topic of sustainability has 

become even more pressing, fuelled 

by global economic volatility, climate 

change, breaches in business ethics 

and trust, growing social service 

needs and changing consumer 

expectations on the role of 

businesses. Increasingly, many of 

these environmental, social 

and governance (ESG) issues are 

coming under close scrutiny by 

regulators and investors. 

With our regular stakeholder 

engagement and materiality 

assessments, the Singtel Board 

and management have earlier 

identiﬁ ed and deliberated on these 

emerging trends which shaped our 

sustainability strategy and helped 

us to set time-based targets with 

intended outcome and impact. 

We are pleased to share the highlights 

of how we have progressed, where we 

believe we can do better and our focus 

going forward.

LEAVING THE SMALLEST 

ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT

2018 recorded some of the most extreme 

temperatures and weather conditions 

for Singapore and Australia not seen in 

decades. In Australia, extreme climate-

related events continued to disrupt 

businesses and cause catastrophic 

damage to community and the 

wider ecosystem. These underscore 

the importance of our strategy and 

mitigation plans to address the long-

term eff ects of climate change and 

product stewardship, both of which are 

material topics for the Singtel Group.

As the ﬁ rst company in Asia excluding 

Japan to have our carbon reduction 

targets approved by Science Based 

Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2017, we 

continue to focus on energy effi  ciency 

measures to reduce our energy and 

carbon emission levels. 

While many of these programmes such 

as chiller replacements are multi-year 

initiatives, we are already seeing the 

fruits of these eff orts in levelling our 

energy growth. We have signiﬁ cantly 

reduced the carbon intensity of our 

business, even while our network 

infrastructure and customer base 

continue to grow. 

The October 2018 Intergovernmental 

Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report 

has set a new 1.5 degrees Celsius limit for 

global warming, down from the earlier 

2 degrees Celsius. To achieve and even 

exceed our 2030 target of 42% Scope 1 

and 2 absolute carbon reductions, we 

are exploring long-term renewable 

energy supply options. These eff orts will 

also pave the way for our aspiration to 

be carbon neutral by 2050.

A FUTURE-READY, DIVERSE AND 

INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE

Singtel is committed to fostering a 

diverse and inclusive workplace that 

is reﬂ ective of the markets we serve so 

we can better understand our diverse 

customer base. Our eff orts were 

recognised globally this year, when we 

were one of four Singapore companies 

included in Bloomberg’s 2019 Gender-

Equality Index for supporting women in 

the workforce, in leadership and at the 

Board level.

OVERVIEW

ENVIRONMENT

SOCIAL

GOVERNANCE

A third of our board members, 

management and staff  across the 

Group are women. During the year, two 

more senior female executives joined 

the Optus leadership team, including 

the Deputy CEO of Consumer Australia. 

We will continue to create a pipeline 

of female talent and leadership in 

all our enterprise businesses and 

technical groups.

We are updating our Optus Disability 

Action Plan for inclusive employment, 

physical accommodation and customer-

facing channels, and continue to mobilise 

support for inclusive employment in 

Singapore via the Singapore Business 

Network on DisAbility, which we are 

currently co-chairing. 

As we deepen our digitisation eff orts, 

we are taking a proactive approach 

to ensure our leaders and workforce 

make a smooth transition into the 

digital economy. We invested 

S$26.1 million in the year in staff  

learning and development across 

both Singapore and Australia to 

upgrade our skills.

ENABLING THE MOST 

CONNECTED COMMUNITIES

Beyond helping our staff  to grow 

with our business, Singtel recognises 

that we are also well-positioned to 

support the inclusion and progress of 

the communities in which we operate. 

Our long-term community strategy 

is developed from our rigorous 

assessment of material social issues 

and engagement with the government 

and social service sectors. 

We partnered the Australian e-Safety 

Commissioner in a series of national 

awareness campaigns launched on 

Safer Internet Day in February. As our 

mobile networks expand in regional 

Australia, our Digital Thumbprint 

programme continues to be embedded 

into our community engagement 

because we believe it is critical for 

consumers, both young and old, to 

maximise opportunities with our high-

speed mobile data access without the 

unintended consequences such as 

cyber bullying, screen time addiction 

and increased privacy risks. 

The #DQEveryChild movement by DQ 

Institute, for which Singtel has been a 

strategic partner and funder from its 

beginnings, has grown into a global 

coalition of member organisations 

such as IEEE Standards Association, 

the Organisation for Economic Co-

operation and Development and World 

Economic Forum. We are part of the 

working group to establish this digital 

intelligence framework as a global 

standard for digital literacy, skills and 

readiness to ensure people, especially 

children, have the social, emotional 

and cognitive abilities to thrive in our 

digital world. Meanwhile, our Thai 

associate AIS announced in February 

its intention to bring this programme to 

Thai students.

The Singtel Group Future Makers social 

innovation programme, launched in 2016, 

continues to expand in scope and reach. 

Last year, together with our regional 

associates AIS, Globe and Telkomsel, 

we supported ten regional social impact 

start-ups that are developing technologies 

and innovations targeting areas like 

healthcare, disability enablement and 

domestic violence. With an alumni of 

46 social impact start-ups in Australia and 

Singapore, our plan in the new year is to 

support their next stage of growth, both 

locally and across our regional markets.

GOING FORWARD

While we have made signiﬁ cant 

progress in our sustainability journey, 

we recognise that there are areas 

where we need to improve on. 

Australia has introduced a new Modern 

Slavery Legislation, which we will use to 

update our Supplier Code of Conduct 

and engagement process in the new 

ﬁ nancial year to ensure that our supply 

chain operates to the highest level of 

human and labour rights as well as 

environmental practices. With our 6,800 

direct suppliers and many more in their 

own supply chain, these eff orts will take 

time. Hence, we are adopting a risk-

prioritised approach to due diligence 

and supplier engagement.

In our sustainability report next year, 

we will report on our achievements 

against our mid-term goals set in 

2015. We will undertake a new round 

of formal stakeholder engagement 

and materiality assessment as well 

as a Sustainable Development Goals 

prioritisation exercise to set our 

new mid-term targets for 2025 and 

reﬁ ne our corporate sustainability 

strategy to guide our programmes. 

We hope to obtain your valuable input 

and perspective to help shape our 

sustainability agenda and strategy. 

On behalf of the Board and 

Management of Singtel, we wish 

to thank all who have been with us 

throughout our sustainability journey. 

We look forward to your continued 

partnership and support.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND ESG ACCOUNTABILITY

Sustainability is governed across various levels in our 

organisation – from the Board and Management to the 

business units and working groups. To embed sustainability 

across the organisation, our management performance 

takes into account various Environmental, Social and 

Governance (ESG) KPIs which form part of their balanced 

scorecard. For example, Singtel Group CEO has speciﬁ c 

ESG KPIs tied to her performance-based compensation, 

such as creating a bigger impact in the four areas of our 

community strategy: enabling innovation, digital citizenship, 

volunteerism and community involvement, and ensuring 

safety and health considerations in corporate processes 

and decision making. More information on how we govern 

sustainability at Singtel is on our website.

OVERVIEW

ENVIRONMENT

SOCIAL

GOVERNANCE

Details of our stakeholder engagement, materiality assessment process, value chain assessment and life-cycle analysis 

are on our website.

We plan to conduct Singtel Group’s third formal stakeholder engagement exercise and materiality review in the ﬁ rst half of 

calendar year 2020. At the same time, we will revisit the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) we previously established 

using a more data-driven methodology to help us prioritise the relevant SDGs at the target level. This approach will help us to 

focus on those targets which are of greatest need in the regions where we operate as well as those which we can inﬂ uence as 

a leading communications service provider. The results from these interdependent reviews will allow us to strengthen alignment 

among Singtel Group’s materiality matrix, the SDGs we support and our mid to long-term goals.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MATERIALITY REVIEW

Regular engagement with our stakeholders provides a core input for determining our material focus areas. We engage 

internal and external stakeholders to understand their concerns and emerging priorities. This keeps us agile and allows 

us to initiate collaboration and be part of formulating or facilitating a solution. 

Our Group-wide materiality review was based on four key metrics: our ongoing stakeholder engagement, in-depth 

survey with management and external stakeholders, life-cycle assessment and peer review exercise. The assessment 

was based on the GRI Standards’ materiality principle for deﬁ ning report content and aimed to identify any shift in 

priorities and emerging areas of concern.

Good Health 

and Well-being 

Ensure healthy lives and 

promote well-being for 

all at all ages

ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE

CLIMATE CHANGE AND CARBON 

Singapore named 2018 the ‘Year of Climate Action’ and 2019 the ‘Year towards Zero Waste’. In October 2018, the 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report targeted global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius 

by the end of the century, compared to the earlier 2 degrees Celsius. It forewarned disastrous consequences if the 

target is not met. 

Singtel’s journey in climate action and environmental sustainability began much earlier, as we recognised that it is 

not an overnight journey (see Figure 2 and Table 1).

We continue to adopt a holistic approach in addressing the threat of climate change through mitigation and 

adaptation eff orts, focusing on improving our energy performance and effi  ciency measures, as well as building 

resilience across our operations.

We are committed to minimising our environmental impact and building operational 

resilience to the eff ects of climate change for our business and the communities. 

The Singtel Group Environment Strategy guides our focus on climate action and product stewardship (see Figure 1).

climate change emerged as a concern 

of moderate importance by our 

stakeholders. They also assessed that 

its impact to our business is moderate. 

Energy effi  ciency was then Singtel

In our following 2017 stakeholder 

engagement and materiality review, 

our stakeholders assessed that our 

key impact on climate change 

was mainly from the business’ 

growing carbon footprint. Our 

business resilience and continuity 

during major natural climate 

disasters were the major business 

risks we faced from the potential 

impact of climate change (see 

Figure 3).

Singtel’s Eff orts on SBTi and TCFD

SBTi 

We provide a progress update of our 

ongoing eff orts and results from organic 

energy effi  ciency initiatives in this report. 

However, these eff orts alone will not be 

able to move the needle in achieving 

a signiﬁ cant reduction in our carbon 

footprint. Hence, we are currently 

requesting for proposals from suppliers of 

larger scale sources of renewable energy 

over a longer period of time leading up to 

2030, and aligned with our SBTi targets. 

We plan to report on the assessment 

outcome in next year’s report.

In October 2018, the IPCC released an 

updated report calling for governments 

and corporates to work towards a 

more aggressive target of &lt;1.5°C. 

Singtel was an early adopter of the 

SBTi in 2016, having our carbon targets 

based on &lt;2°C approved in 2017. 

SBTi acknowledged the early work of 

companies like Singtel and has given 

us up to ﬁ ve years from the original 

approval date to update our scenarios 

and targets. 

While this needs to be done before 

2022, our current focus and priority are 

to identify the roadmap and initiatives 

we can take to exceed our original 

approved absolute carbon reduction 

targets. We also plan to work towards 

a more aggressive aspiration target of 

being carbon neutral by 2050.


TCFD

We endorsed the TCFD recommended 

framework in mid-2017 and have 

made progress towards its adoption. 

The topic of climate risks has since 

been embedded in our updated 

corporate risk register and reviewed 

at various levels of management 

and the Board with mid to long-term 

targets. 

During the year, we began our 

engagement with various parts of 

the business to identify key indicators

these climate-related ﬁ nancial risks 

and opportunities may be, organised 

by physical, transitional or liability risks 

that have an impact on Singtel Group’s 

income and balance sheet performance 

in the long run (see Table 2). Our next 

steps include verifying the ﬁ nancial data 

and modelling to validate how material 

these indicators are to Singtel’s long-

term ﬁ nancial performance.

Internal: Having identiﬁ ed the 

relevant indicators, our focus for 

the next two years is to engage our 

internal stakeholders in progressively 

identifying the ﬁ nancial data sources 

to build, test and reﬁ ne the historical 

data allocated to climate-related 

risks. We believe that baselining 

historical ﬁ nancial information is 

critical before we begin overlaying 

forward-looking assumptions and 

modelling, which will be based on 

previous and emerging scenarios 

as well as sensitivity analysis on the 

diff erent climate change scenarios. 

External: We will engage our external 

stakeholders to test and reﬁ ne 

these indicators identiﬁ ed above, 

especially with the growing interest 

by investors and major funds. We also 

recognise that these stakeholders 

are also starting their own journey 

of understanding and applying the 

TCFD guidelines.

CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE

Climate change resilience is important to the Singtel Group 

as we continue to integrate resilience and adaptation into 

our business and network operations. It is critical for us to 

review current and new climate related risks and trends in 

countries such as Australia that are prone to major cyclones 

and inundations so we can take the necessary steps to 

prepare and respond to these risks.

We continue to contribute as a founding member of the 

Australian Business Roundtable for Disaster Resilience 

and Safer Communities (ABR). We are pleased that ABR’s 

previous research and policy recommendations have been 

recognised with the Australian Government’s formation of 

the National Resilience Taskforce in 2018 and development 

of the National Disaster Risk Reduction (NDRR) Framework 

launched in April 2019, a copy of which can be viewed online. 

ABR will continue to be actively involved in the NDRR Industry 

Advisory Forum, which an ABR representative will chair and 

shape the implementation of the NDRR framework.

During the year, we continued to upgrade mobile sites with 

power generators and batteries to last up to seven days 

without utilising the public grid in cyclone prone regions 

in Australia, as the public power grid is often adversely 

aff ected during cyclones and inundations. We also invested 

in transmission and last-mile diversity and redundancy 

paths for other cyclone prone areas. To strengthen our 

network diversity and redundancy, we invested A$2.14 million 

in another diverse transmission path along the critical 

Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne route to reduce any impact if 

both Optus coastal and inland routes are simultaneously cut.

We spent another A$600,000 on two new SATCATS (mobile 

cell on wheels) to support communities aff ected by bushﬁ res 

in New South Wales and Western Australia and cyclones 

in Queensland. These provide extra network capacity and 

coverage during disaster response eff orts. 

CREATING AN IMPACT: OUR TEN-YEAR JOURNEY WITH NPARKS

Singtel has been working with National Parks Board (NParks) in the past ten years for 

our annual Plant-A-Tree Day in Singapore. We engage staff  to get close to nature by 

planting local tree species at various national parks to raise their awareness of the 

importance of environmental conservation and minimising our environmental footprint 

to reduce adverse impact on Mother Nature. 

For our tenth Plant-A-Tree Day, 200 staff  volunteers and 20 APSN Tanglin School students 

planted 100 tree saplings along the Changi Coastal Park Connector Network. 

In support of 2018 as the Year of Climate Action in Singapore and celebration of our 

tenth anniversary, we collaborated with WWF to reforest Rimbang Baling, which is part 

of the UNESCO Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra, Indonesia. Home to the critically 

endangered Sumatran Tigers, as well as 170 plant and 50 mammal species, Rimbang 

Baling has been vanishing at the rate of three football ﬁ elds a minute. Every Singtel 

staff  volunteer pledged support through WWF Forest Cards and each adopted tree 

was planted by WWF in Rimbang Baling. 



GIVING A HELPING HAND 

In early 2019, bushﬁ res burned in the Huon Valley, south of 

Hobart in Tasmania, depicting contrasting disaster scenes 

in Australia. At its peak, more than 700 residents were living 

at the bushﬁ re evacuation centre in Huonville. Our team 

drove one of our ten Optus Trucks down to the centre to 

lend a helping hand to the local community. 

The Optus Regional LED Screen Truck is a 5,100 kg Fuso 

Canter 615 wide cab decked out with 3.5m x 1.7m screen. 

We set it up in the neighbouring showground area to 

provide charging stations for mobile devices, free Optus 

prepaid handsets and prepaid vouchers as well as water, 

bags and battery packs. We also live-streamed 16 channels 

of emergency service updates on TV screens and broadcast 

updates about the bushﬁ re situation from a local radio 

station. For the young ones, we played a daily movie on the 

TV screen and handed out sweet treats.

their mobile phones during extended power outages in their 

communities, as we recognise how important it is to stay in

WASTE MANAGEMENT

Electronic, packaging and corporate 

waste such as paper are the key sources 

of waste generated from across our 

operations and value chain. We focus on 

reducing and recycling our own waste, 

collaborating with partners and suppliers, 

and redesigning our product off erings to 

minimise our impact in this area.

E-waste

The Singapore Government is 

tackling e-waste with the Extended 

Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme 

to be implemented in 2021. Singtel 

is committed to playing our part in 

contributing towards this eff ort. 

E-waste is the most material waste 

stream in our sector, due to the potential 

pollutive nature of metal, plastic and 

battery from mobile phones. Our focus is 

on increasing the recovery and recycling 

of mobile phones from our customers. 

In Australia, we recycle over 98% of our 

own e-waste and continue to support 

the Mobile Muster programme, a 

national industry-wide collaboration 

stewardship scheme that allows 

customers to recycle their old mobile 

phones at any Optus retail store. 

We also promoted the Planet Ark 

National Recycling Week 2018 together 

with Optus Sport host Mel McLaughlin 

FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF ReCYCLE 

On World Environment Day in 2017, we launched 

ReCYCLE, a national mobile phone recovery and 

recycling project with SingPost. Customers can drop 

off  their unwanted phones at our retail outlets or 

mail them using special postage-waived envelopes 

via any of Singapore’s 700-plus letter boxes. 

To mark the ﬁ rst anniversary of ReCYCLE, we 

conducted a lucky draw to encourage consumers

to recycle their e-waste. We saw a 500% increase 

in number of envelopes received during the 

campaign period.

Since its launch, we have seen a 400% compounded 

growth in collection rates. Our eff ort has recovered 

over 24,000 kg of mobile phones, batteries and 

accessories.



Optus Sport host Mel McLaughlin championing e-waste recycling eff ort to beneﬁ t the environment, 

equivalent to planting 259 trees

to encourage customers to recycle their old mobile phones at Mobile Muster 

collection points. 

Through these eff orts, we diverted more than four tonnes of e-waste or 53,437 

handsets and batteries from landﬁ ll in Australia in 2018, saving 10 tonnes of 

carbon emissions and conserving 50 tonnes of mineral resource.

As a member of Mobile Muster, we also support its ‘Take 3 for the Sea’ 

campaign, which aims to raise awareness of plastic pollution and simple 

solutions to prevent it. Take 3 targets coastal litter reduction through the 

education of consumers by delivering education programmes in schools, 

surf clubs and communities around Australia.

launched the PrintLess campaign by 

going digital and reducing traditional 

printing. This helps us to lower our 

environmental footprint and reduce 

paper and ink costs from printing and 

copying, while enhancing information 

security and management.

In FY2019, we digitised about 18,000 

personnel ﬁ les, totalling three million 

pages. We have also digitised the 

signing of 100% of all employee-related 

contracts and letters. This paperless 

strategy has helped us reduce monthly 

printing volume for HR-related matters 

by 47%.

APCO’s Optus Performance Report 2018

OPTUS’ COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING 

Strategy, targets, governance: 

Developed a new four-year Sustainable Packaging Strategy 2018-2021 

to explore the viability of more than 50 aspirational targets to reduce 

packaging waste in line with the new APCO framework in the 13 focus areas.

Governance: 

Created a new Sustainable Packaging Checklist for our internal stakeholders 

to align packaging best practices for existing and new products.

Key achievements: 

 Recall un-sold SIMs close to 

expiry and then push them out to 

quicker-selling channels. Those 

SIMs that cannot be redistributed 

or already expired are recycled. 

A total of 490,000 SIM cards was 

recycled as part of this initiative, 

preventing about 1.47 tonnes of 

material entering landﬁ ll and 

saved A$2 million per annum.

Goal: 

By 2025, we aspire to make all packaging 100% reusable, recyclable or 

compostable by working with industry partners for design and material 

innovation.

 Developed a new retail bag 

made from renewable paper 

which is 100% recyclable, 

biodegradable and also uses 

soy-based inks, which are 

renewable and low in volatile 

organic compounds (VOC), 

diverting 110 tonnes of material 

from landﬁ ll per annum and 

resulting in savings of about 

A$120,000 in printing costs.

Our people are key to the Group’s long-term growth and success. We want to be an

OUR APPROACH

The Singtel Group employs over 24,000 people worldwide, 

with about 12,600 in Singapore and 7,800 in Australia. 

We provide a fair, performance-based work culture that 

is diverse, inclusive and collaborative. We empower and 

invest in equipping our workforce with relevant skills 

and knowledge to help them thrive in this digital age 

and our highly disruptive and competitive industry. 

Above all, ensuring the safety and well-being of our 

people is of utmost importance to us. 

In Singapore, besides abiding by the Ministry of 

Manpower’s (MOM) Employment Act, we practise 

fair employment that is aligned with the tripartite 

guidelines set by MOM, National Trades Union 

Congress (NTUC) and Singapore National Employers 

Federation (SNEF). In Australia, we adopt the fair 

employment framework that is approved by Fair 

Work Australia and governed by our Employment 

Partnership Agreement (EPA). 

We have fostered a very strong and 

collaborative partnership with the Union 

of Telecom Employees (UTES) since it was 

formed in 1982, which laid the foundation for 

facilitating employee development, promoting 

the well-being of our people and supporting 

business growth for our Singapore operations. 

In Singapore, we had 5,272 bargainable 

employees (42%) and in Australia, 2,989 

employees (39%) who were covered by 

EPA as at 31 March 2019. 

 

We continued to support NTUC’s U Care Fund 

with an annual donation of S$100,000. We also 

disbursed S$77,600 to about 100 schooling 

children of our staff  under the joint Singtel-

UTES Bursary Awards scheme during the year. 

In August 2018, we successfully negotiated and 

renewed our Collective Agreement 2018 with 

UTES for our bargainable staff , certiﬁ ed by the 

Industrial Arbitration Court of Singapore.

GOVERNANCE

OUR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

A key focus for the year was 

driving digital initiatives across 

the Singtel Group and leveraging 

automation, artiﬁ cial intelligence, 

analytics and agile methodology to 

improve productivity and customer 

experience.

 

As part of our ongoing Robotic 

Process Automation (RPA) 

programme, more than 180 bots 

have been deployed across the 

organisation to manage repetitive 

administrative tasks. For example, 

Group Consumer deployed and 

trained a telesales bot in two weeks 

to capture and process the details 

of customers who subscribed to 

the World Cup package via our 

hotline. By the end of the sign-up 

period, it successfully handled 70% 

of all subscriptions, allowing our 

agents to spend more time with 

customers and manage more 

complex requests. This resulted in a 

smoother and seamless experience 

for customers.

 

Group Enterprise also launched a fully 

automated incident management 

solution to help our customer support 

staff  to manage incident tickets more 

effi  ciently. The solution uses our Artiﬁ cial 

Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) 

Predictive Service Incident Management 

Engine, which enables us to resolve 

a range of incidents automatically 

without manual intervention, improving 

effi  ciencies by 37%.

 

The HR team deployed 18 new bots 

across Singapore and Australia to 

improve engagement with our people. 

We also started using AI/ML to develop 

predictive capabilities to aid in talent 

development, engagement and 

retention. Our new People Intelligence 

Toolkit helps our people managers to 

focus on staff  development. Predictive 

capabilities also provide our leaders 

with customised insights into the factors 

driving staff  turnover in their business 

units. The time saved through Future 

of Work digital initiatives enables us to 

engage our people better and build 

greater trust in the organisation.























We are focused on going high-

tech to free up valuable time and 

capacity to provide a high-touch 

experience and engagement for 

our people and this will enable us to 

build a high-trust organisation.

MULTIGENERATIONAL WORKPLACE

To support employees across all generations to stay 

relevant and be resilient to changes happening in this 

rapidly evolving industry, we actively promote the 

SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace (SFDW) programmes 

to raise the digital literacy of our workforce.

DIFFERING ABILITIES

We value the inclusion of persons with diff ering abilities 

in our company, in line with our aim to build an inclusive 

workplace and society. In Singapore, we work closely 

with national agency SG Enable on training, internship 

and employment of persons with disabilities, who form 

a critical talent pipeline given the current labour crunch.

We continue to support SG Enable’s Institute of Higher 

Learning Internship Programme for tertiary students with 

disabilities and took on three students – one with hearing 

impairment and two with Autism Spectrum 

Disorder (ASD) – who did their internship with our 

business units for work experience. At the same 

time, our staff  had the opportunity to interact 

and work with persons with disabilities, thereby 

shaping a more inclusive workplace and mindset.

As one of the founding members and the 

current co-chair, Singtel participates actively in 

the Singapore Business Network on DisAbility 

(SBNoD), set up in 2015. The SBNoD group of 

companies has been supporting SG Enable’s 

12-week RISE Mentorship Programme for tertiary 

students with disabilities since its launch in 2017. 

During the year, Singtel ﬁ elded three middle 

management members as mentors for two 

students and one young working adult – one with 

cerebral palsy and two with hearing impairment.

Investing in our people is critical to our success. We manage our human capital 

investment by attracting and nurturing our talent, as well as looking after their 

professional growth and personal well-being during their career with us. Every 

employee undergoes regular, formal performance and career development 

reviews, and we encourage leaders to have frequent informal performance 

conversations with their team members.

To support and accelerate Singtel’s digitisation eff orts, we introduced new initiatives

such as Professional Conversion programmes and hackathons to equip our employees

with new skills to stay relevant. To this end, we also launched a new community and

collaboration space, Singtel@8George, where we hosted more than 300 sessions to

engage and train our talent across the Singtel Group during the year.

TALENT ATTRACTION AND 

RETENTION

We believe that developing and 

engaging young talent are key to 

building internal capabilities in 

this global competition for talent 

and meeting our Future of Work 

aspirations. Today, we have a robust 

young talent pool, comprising interns, 

cadets, apprentices, scholars and 

management associates. We partner 

a growing number of institutions like 

polytechnics and universities to help us 

build a pipeline of future-ready talent. 

In FY2019, we awarded S$1.85 million in 

scholarships and apprenticeships to 

80 tertiary students in Singapore, 

giving them industry-relevant training 

as well as employment and progression 

opportunities. 

We launched a new programme, 

Digital Leadership Experience, aimed 

at grooming digital leaders who are 

high performers through a structured 

two-year programme. It gives them 

meaningful and impactful experiences 

to equip them with what it takes to lead 

a digital business, which is vital 

to Singtel.

TRAINING AND EDUCATION

It is vital for our employees to 

keep abreast of the latest industry 

developments and be future-ready. 

We off er our people a rich and diverse 

range of training and educational 

programmes, centred around our 

four key learning pillars: Compliance, 

Company, Business and Future. These 

programmes focus on personal

SINGTEL GROUP LEARNING FIESTA

Digital learning was the key emphasis 

of our 11th Singtel Group Learning Fiesta 

2018. It accounted for 87.4% of a record-

breaking 97,328 learning places created 

during the event. Our collaboration with 

learning partners enabled staff  to learn 

on-the-go using any digital device of 

their choice for any topic that they wish 

to explore.

To help our employees take ownership 

of their own lifelong learning journey, 

we introduced agiLEARN to enable 

them to do bite-sized and just-in-time 

learning anytime, anywhere. They could 

also develop learning content using blog 

and video on relevant topics, such as 

digital hacks and design thinking. 

SKILLSFUTURE FOR DIGITAL 

WORKPLACE AND ELECTIVES

To ride on the rising digital awareness 

among our staff  since the rollout of 

our SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace 

programme in late 2017, we introduced 

ten new digital electives in 2018 to further 

develop the digital knowledge of our people, 

especially those in non-technical roles. 

These one-day electives, in collaboration 

with partners in academia and consultancy, 

served as a useful introduction to cutting-

edge developments such as cyber 

security, data analytics, Python coding 

and blockchain in a simple, digestible 

form to help raise the digital quotient of 

our workforce. In FY2019, a total of 1,500 

employees enrolled in these electives for a 

deeper appreciation of these technologies.

Tan Chee (middle), our service delivery 

manager who started his career 

with NCS 19 years ago in hardware 

support, signed up for the Professional 

Conversion programme in 2018 and 

spent six months learning new tools 

and platforms necessary to automate 

processes for clients, before moving 

into his new role which focuses on this 

new specialisation of automation in the 

service delivery management team.

FY2019 Training and Development Investment Breakdown by Learning Pillars 

EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY

The safety and security of our 

employees are our top priority, and we 

strive to ensure the physical and mental 

well-being of our people. During the 

year, we completed the surveillance 

audits by our external auditor for 

both OHSAS 18001 and Singapore 

Standard SS506 management system, 

conﬁ rming our compliance with the 

standards requirements. We also 

successfully renewed our bizSAFE 

Partner certiﬁ cation in April 2018, as 

part of ongoing eff orts to motivate 

our service partners – vendors, 

suppliers and contractors – to raise 

their workplace safety and health 

(WSH) standards through the bizSAFE 

programmes. bizSAFE is a national 

certiﬁ cation programme that assists 

companies to build up their WSH 

capabilities so that they can achieve 

quantum improvements in safety and 

health standards at the workplace.

It is our priority to make WSH second 

nature for our staff , management 

and vendors as we recognise that 

everyone has a role to play in building 

a progressive safety and healthy culture 

in the company. We are committed to 

leading industry eff orts to strengthen 

capabilities and build a progressive 

culture in WSH for Singtel towards 

Vision Zero - zero accident and fatality.

In September 2018, we revised our Health 

and Safety policy, now known as the 

Singtel Group Health, Safety and Security 

(HSS) Policy. It aims to encourage our 

people to embrace security and manage 

such risks as part of our corporate culture 

and help the company mitigate security 

threats and breaches. 

With the rapid changes in our industry, 

we actively keep our employees abreast 

of market developments by providing a 

series of outreach programmes, inviting 

subject experts to give staff  insights into 

best practices and create awareness at 

our quarterly HSS events.

One outreach programme also gave 

hands-on opportunities to more than 200 

employees to perform rescue operation 

in a mock-up conﬁ ned space and expose 

them to various work-at-height structures 

at our service partner training centre. 

EMPLOYEE WELLNESS

During the year, we embarked on a large 

scale renovation of our Singtel Recreation 

Club (SRC) housed at Comcentre, our 

headquarters in Singapore. We wanted 

to create a larger, even more comfortable 

recreation space to enable our people to 

exercise, play and connect with one another 

and their families after working hours. The 

newly renovated SRC boasts an extensive 

array of recreation facilities for all to enjoy: 

gym, rock-climbing wall, karaoke, games 

rooms and a pub aptly named Pub@SRC.

3  New indicator tracked from FY2019.

4  Optus training hours for FY2019 included user testing of certain e-learning modules.

5  Workplace health and safety metrics are based on the International Labour Organization (ILO) deﬁ nitions, subject to country deﬁ nition of lost work shifts e.g. Optus excludes weekends 

from medical leave when calculating these rates.

6 

Based on ILO deﬁ nition, this excluded time lost as a result of permanent incapacity for work. A male employee was caught in an accident involving several vehicles in FY2018, which 

resulted in a prolonged medical leave of absence of more than 200 days as of end-FY2019.

Community

The Most Connected Communities

The Singtel Group is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen in all the markets 

where we operate, driving positive and sustainable change for our communities.

OUR APPROACH

Investing in our community is an integral part 

of our sustainability strategy. Our decisions 

are guided by our strategic community 

investment framework (see Figure 1). 

The Singtel Group aims to play a signiﬁ cant 

role in enabling the progress, development and 

inclusion of vulnerable segments in the society. 

Through our key partnerships, programmes 

and staff  engagement initiatives, we combine 

our collective resources and leverage our skills 

and core competencies to make a positive and 

sustainable change to communities in need.

Our community strategy contributes towards 

the various UN SDGs: 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11. 

Our community programmes and approach 

are also aligned with the National Council of 

Social Service (NCSS) Strategic Thrusts 

2017-2021 (see Figure 2). We are one of the 

few private sector representatives on the 

NCSS strategic review committee, as we 

are recognised for our eff orts to engage the 

sector strategically and in a holistic manner.

INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE GROUPS

Singtel Touching Lives Fund (STLF) is our ﬂ agship corporate 

philanthropy programme to support the education of children 

and youth with special needs in Singapore. We raised 

S$3 million in 2018, bringing our total funds raised for STLF to 

S$42 million since its inception in 2002 (see Story on page 30). 

We also donated S$5.3 million to non-STLF charitable 

organisations and contributed over S$500,000 of in-kind 

sponsorship of telecommunications and media services to 

charities, social enterprises and nation-building activities 

in Singapore during the year.

We conducted 12 workshops for 2,750 senior citizens in 

Singapore who learnt to use smartphones and social 

media apps, as well as online safety tips like protecting 

their online privacy and against scams.

We continue to support the cancer cause given its 

pervasiveness in society (see Story below). In Australia, 

we contributed A$679,500 to Tour de Cure 2018. 21 

Optus employees took part in this event as riders and 

volunteers and visited 15 schools to raise awareness.

We continue to work closely with the Australian 

Business and Community Network (ABCN), of which 

we are a founding member, to improve opportunities 

and outcomes for vulnerable youth in high-needs 

schools across Australia. For our active participation, 

Optus was awarded the ABCN 2018 Award for the 

Most Outstanding Member Company. 

In 2018, we ran 36 core ABCN programmes, engaging 

over 500 Optus staff  mentors and volunteers working 

with about 1,200 students.

CREATING AN IMPACT: OUR TEN-YEAR JOURNEY WITH SINGAPORE CANCER SOCIETY 

In 2009, Singtel became a strategic 

partner of Singapore Cancer Society (SCS), 

supporting its “Help the Children and 

Youth Programme” (HCY). We are the title 

sponsor of the Singtel–Singapore Cancer 

Society Race Against Cancer and our 

annual grant of S$250,000* goes towards 

helping children and youth whose lives 

are aff ected by cancer. These children 

and youth may be cancer patients or their 

parents are suff ering from cancer. 

In the past decade, this programme 

has received more than S$2.3 million – 

from Singtel grants as well as registration 

fees paid by Singtel employees, 

their families and friends when they 

participated in the annual run.

Arthur Lang (right), Singtel’s CEO of 

International Group, raised an additional 

S$51,000 for Singapore Cancer Society 

under CEOs Against Cancer



962 children and youth have since 

beneﬁ tted from the SCS HCY 

programme. 

The one-on-one tuition scheme 

off ered under HCY was very popular as 

it was designed to help those who are 

academically weak and from ﬁ nancially 

challenged families. The tuition scheme 

achieved the desired outcomes of 

improved grades as well as increased 

conﬁ dence and self-esteem of the 

students enrolled in the scheme. 

The programme also covers school 

allowance, grants and bursary, 

achievement awards and family 

bonding events.

(STLF) is the company’s ﬂ agship 

philanthropy programme. When 

it started in 2002, the programme 

supported vulnerable children 

and youth in the community. 

We sharpened our focus and 

concentrated on education for 

children with special needs. Our 

six beneﬁ ciary schools are: APSN 

Chaoyang School, APSN Tanglin 

School, APSN Delta Senior School, 

Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore 

School, Eden School and MINDS 

Lee Kong Chian Gardens School.

Singtel engages our employees, 

business partners, customers 

The six schools served about 

1,600 students in 2018. The schools 

off er each student a customised 

curriculum based on their abilities 

and needs, with the aim of 

maximising their potential towards 

independent living and integration 

into the community. At the end of 

the curriculum year, more than 170 

students achieved the outcomes 

listed in the table below.

SINGTEL CARNIVAL 2018

The annual Singtel Carnival is a mass volunteering platform 

for our staff . It is Singapore’s largest carnival designed and 

planned exclusively for children with special needs. In its 

sixth year, Singtel Carnival 2018 was organised by 1,700 staff  

volunteers and attended by more than 1,400 students with 

special needs from 14 Special Education schools. Themed 

‘Carnival in Space’, the event was graced by the President of 

the Republic of Singapore.

ENGAGING OUR PEOPLE

The way we engage the community and involve our people 

through general and skilled volunteering is a key driver of 

our staff  engagement. Our annual staff  engagement surveys 

consistently show that what we do in the community and for the 

environment is one of the top three drivers of staff  engagement. 

We encourage our people to volunteer on an individual or 

team basis. We believe that active employee volunteerism not 

only helps our communities but also contributes to the holistic 

development of our people in terms of empathy, perspective 

and character building. Besides giving our employees paid 

volunteer leave, we encourage business units to adopt 

VolunTeaming, our concept of teambuilding with a volunteering 

element to involve the vulnerable segment of the community.

Over the years, we have also increased skilled volunteering 

opportunities for our people in areas such as our Future 

Makers social innovation programmes, digital citizenship, 

ABCN and Better Together overseas volunteering programme.

BETTER TOGETHER 2018

The Singtel Group has been extending our volunteering 

outreach to support communities in countries where our 

associates operate. Better Together 2018 was the eighth year 

of our annual overseas volunteering programme which saw 

three expeditions. 

Our skilled volunteering expedition to Thailand had 32 

volunteers from Singtel, Optus, AIS and Globe who mentored 

Thai undergraduates and high school students from the Good 

Kids Great Hearts (GKGH) programme to help them improve 

their conﬁ dence and competence in conversational English.

Better Together in the Philippines was in partnership with Globe 

and saw 47 volunteers from Singtel, Optus, Globe and Optus’ 

call centre partners, Convergys and 24/7, who delivered our 

Digital Thumbprint programme in two elementary schools in 

Cagayan de Oro. They also planted trees in Bukidnon together 

with Hineleban Foundation, Globe’s environment partner. 

Our regional associate Bharti Airtel and its philanthropy arm 

Bharti Foundation hosted 23 volunteers from Singtel, Optus and 

Airtel who carried out classroom sessions in four Satya Bharti 

schools. These schools are part of Bharti Foundation’s ﬂ agship 

rural education initiative, the Satya Bharti School Programme 

which provides free quality education in rural India.

The Eight Core DQ Competencies

Singtel believes ﬁ rmly in the 

education and promotion of 

responsible digital citizenship. We are 

honoured to have been involved in 

the development and implementation 

of the DQ framework right from the 

beginning. A global standard for 

digital literacy and skills is important 

in developing education programmes 

for people, especially children, so that 

they have the social, emotional and 

cognitive abilities to thrive amid the 

challenges of our digital world.

DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP AND ONLINE SAFETY

The rise of mobile and technology in this digital age has 

resulted in better connectivity and convenience for people. 

However, this has also created unintended consequences as 

children and youth have become increasingly vulnerable to 

the associated risks, such as device and gaming addiction, 

inappropriate online content and cyber bullying.

Singtel aims to play a proactive role to mitigate such risks by 

educating our customers and promoting responsible digital 

citizenship among vulnerable children and youth. These 

interventions support our eff orts towards the UN Sustainable 

Development Goal 3 on Good Health and Well-being.

Since 2014, the Singtel Group Digital Thumbprint Programme 

has created and implemented educational programmes, 

leveraged our technology and provided resources, as well as 

partnered leading community organisations to empower and 

equip responsible digital citizens to thrive in the digital era. 

In Singapore, we continued our strategic collaboration with DQ 

Institute – from helping to fund the #DQEveryChild programme 

development in 2016 to implementing the programme and 

bringing it to the primary schools in Singapore. During the year, 

with Singtel’s support, #DQEveryChild reached 120 primary 

schools, more than 40,000 primary school students and 1,200 

teachers and parents in Singapore. In February 2019, our Thai 

associate AIS also announced its collaboration with DQ Institute 

to promote digital intelligence or DQ of children in Thailand.

Digital Citizenship

Each year, Digital Thumbprint programme reaches

DQ is a comprehensive set of digital competencies required 

to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution (see Figure 3). Its 

fundamental competence is digital citizenship which enables 

individuals to use technology safely and responsibly. It was 

subsequently identiﬁ ed as a global common framework for 

digital literacy, skills and readiness by the Coalition for Digital 

Intelligence, comprising OECD, IEEE Standards Association 

(IEEE SA) and DQ Institute, and in association with the World 

Economic Forum. Singtel is also involved as a member of the 

standardisation working group of IEEE SA.

In Australia, our Digital Thumbprint with Kids Helpline is an 

early intervention programme delivered free to primary 

schools. Using Optus technology, we bring Kids Helpline 

counsellors into classrooms and create a safe environment 

where students can discuss positive online behaviours 

and interactions. Over 10,000 primary school students in 

Australia access this programme each year.

In addition, our Digital Thumbprint programme reaches 

more than 37,000 high school students in Australia annually. 

In May 2018, 16 Optus employees were trained to deliver 

Digital Thumbprint workshops to students, enabling them 

to contribute directly towards teaching students about 

positive online presence and behaviour. 

After the successful run of our inaugural Digital Smarts Day 

last year, we hosted two this year, which were attended by 

345 primary and high school students. Based on our Digital 

Thumbprint programme, partners like Kids Helpline and 

ABCN delivered cyber wellness and digital citizenship 

education to students at these sessions, facilitated by our 

trained staff  volunteers. 

Parents play a critical role in educating and inﬂ uencing a 

child’s usage of digital technology and media and his online 

behaviour. During the year, we upgraded notAnoobie, our 

cyber wellness mobile application for parents launched in 

mid-2014. Available at www.notAnoobie.online, parents 

can get up-to-date information on cyber issues like fake 

news and arm themselves with knowledge on gaming 

addiction and how to identify cyber bullying, as well as 

useful digital parenting tips.

EDUCATION AND EMPLOYABILITY

One key area we focus on is support for youth with 

disabilities so that they will be ready to join the workforce 

and lead independent lives. This is a natural extension of our 

long-term support for special education through STLF.

We play an active role in connecting the broader ecosystem 

of partners to advance the disability employment agenda 

in Singapore. Together with other like-minded companies, 

Singtel became a founding member of the Singapore 

Business Network on DisAbility (SBNoD) that hopes to 

advance equitable employment opportunities for persons 

with disabilities through awareness, shared expertise, 

network and resources. During the year, Singtel, as the 

co-chair of SBNoD, continued to support SG Enable’s 

mentorship and internship programmes for tertiary 

students with disabilities as well as universities career fairs 

and CV clinics. 

Since 2015, we have placed nine interns with various 

disabilities like vision, hearing and physical impairment 

and Autism Spectrum Disorder across our organisation. We 

have also ﬁ elded 13 staff  mentors from Singtel’s middle and 

top management for the RISE Mentorship programme. 

In Australia, we continued our Pathways2Employment 

Programme as part of our commitment to helping 

young people build conﬁ dence and skills and provided 

opportunities for them to secure employment with Optus 

Retail. During the year, we delivered eight sessions across 

ﬁ ve states, equipping 185 young people with job interview 

and retail skills. They were supported and coached by 60 

Optus Retail employees across Adelaide, Melbourne, Perth, 

Queensland and Sydney. All students received an Optus 

Retail Certiﬁ cate, with 23 of them obtaining employment at 

our Optus ‘yes’ stores over Christmas.

We strive to deliver a superior customer experience by 

focusing on the quality of our products and services and 

customer care, as well as the range of innovative services 

and value that we off er to our customers.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

Our customer experience strategy focuses on constantly 

raising the bar for customer satisfaction. We focus on 

providing the best value and experience to our customers, 

and deepening our engagement and relationship with them 

in this highly competitive market.

Singtel has in the past few years revamped the way we 

engage and serve customers as they adopt a new digital 

lifestyle. 

We have digitised our sales and call centre operations. 

Around 25% of all consumer sales transactions are now done 

online for our customers in Singapore. Over 65% of customer 

care transactions are done on a self-help basis. By using 

technologies such as visual interactive voice response as 

well as virtual and live chat agents, customers no longer 

have to spend time waiting to talk to call centre agents. 

Our digitisation eff orts have raised staff  productivity and 

generated positive feedback from customers, with customer 

journey experience scores hitting 88%. 

The Singtel Group is committed to being a responsible and innovative leader in the 

markets where we operate. Our strategy is underpinned by delivering an unparalleled 

customer experience while embracing responsible business practices across our 

operations and supply chain.

Our transformation seeks to give 

customers the best of both worlds by 

having a digitally augmented store 

that provides a highly personalised, 

omni-channel experience, such as 

interactive touch walls and a digital 

queue experience.

Since its revamp in January 2018, Singtel’s 

ﬂ agship store at Comcentre in Singapore 

has been winning awards. This includes the 

Best Retail Concept of the Year Award at the 

Singapore Retailers Association Retail Awards 

2018, in recognition of the shop’s innovative use 

of advanced retail technologies.

The new store concept seamlessly combines 

online and offl  ine customer touchpoints by 

integrating online and in-store shopping carts. 

Other innovative features include a smart 

WiFi-based queue system, 24x7 self-serve 

kiosks where customers can pick up SIM cards, 

pay bills or top up prepaid cards as well as 

automated checkouts linked to e-wallets. There 

are also customer service robots moving around 

the shop to assist customers. These features 

have helped to improve store traffi  c by 30%.

despite intense mobile market competition. 

At the annual HWM + HardwareZone Tech Awards 2019, 

we clinched all three Readers’ Choice awards for telcos – 

Best Mobile Service, Best Fibre Broadband and Best Pay 

TV Service Provider. This is our ﬁ rst time winning all three 

awards and our tenth consecutive win for Best Mobile and 

Best Fibre Broadband Service Provider. 

In Singapore, for every ten customer complaints via the 

media, social media, our website and management, we 

received 29 compliments in FY2019, up from 27 last year. 

In Australia, the monthly average for Telecommunications 

Industry Ombudsman (TIO) complaints for phone and 

internet users about Optus was 2,736 complaints, down 

19% from a year ago.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE QUALITY

The Singtel Group is committed to off ering our customers 

a great network and service experience. We continuously 

enhance the reach, reliability and quality of our networks in 

Singapore and Australia.

ENHANCING NETWORK RELIABILITY

Ensuring consistency in network and service performance 

is critical. We continue to invest in new base stations and 

towers, upgrade our technologies and increase our user 

capacity. 

Our total capital investment was S$1.72 billion in FY2019 

(Singtel S$587 million, Optus A$1.14 billion), with S$183 million 

and A$633 million invested in our mobile networks in 

Singapore and Australia respectively.

ENSURING QUALITY STANDARDS

In Singapore, Singtel adheres to the Quality of Service 

standards set by the Info-communications Media Development 

Authority of Singapore (IMDA) for the services that we off er. 

The regulator publishes periodic performance reports on the 

various operators in Singapore covering broadband, mobile 

and ﬁ xed telephone services. We continue to meet or exceed 

the quality of service standards for service coverage, network 

availability, network latency, installation and fault repair time. 

These reports can be found at www.imda.gov.sg. 

No ﬁ ne was imposed on Singtel during the year by IMDA for 

any breach of telecommunications and broadcast regulations. 

There was also no legal action regarding anti-competitive 

behaviour and violation of anti-trust legislation against the 

Singtel Group.

SINGTEL GROUP FUTURE MAKERS PROGRAMME

We continue to support charities, social entrepreneurs 

and social enterprises that leverage technological 

innovation to address social causes and scale their 

impact in the community. This is achieved through the 

Singtel Group Future Makers, our social innovation 

programme which we launched in 2016.

Now in its third year, Future Makers continued to expand 

its footprint, with our Indonesia and Thailand associates 

Telkomsel and AIS joining the regional programme with 

Singtel, Optus and Globe from the Philippines. Future 

Makers 2018 attracted over 3,000 applicants across the 

ﬁ ve countries. 48 selected start-ups secured more than 

S$1 million in funding and support, after participating in 

rigorous capacity building and mentorship workshops. 

Over four months, the Group’s team of in-house subject 

matter experts and external partners from the social 

and private sectors volunteered their time and skills 

to advise our impact start-ups on their technology 

solutions and business models. As part of the regional 

ﬁ nals held in Australia, Future Makers ﬁ nalists from the 

ﬁ ve countries attended the Impact Investment Summit 

Asia Paciﬁ c 2018 and received further capacity building 

at Optus. They also gained valuable insights from 

impact investors, corporates, foundations, government 

representatives and the social sector, and explored with 

them potential opportunities to scale their solutions 

regionally.

SOCIAL

GOVERNANCE

The Singtel Group strives to reduce 

the negative impact of our products 

and services. Our responsibility 

encompasses governance and anti-

corruption as well as safety, data 

privacy and fair communications for 

our stakeholders in the marketplace.

CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

Today, the perceived health risks 

associated with the emission of 

Electromagnetic Energy (EME) 

from mobile devices, base stations 

and tower infrastructure remain 

a concern for our customers, the 

community and regulators. This 

is despite the lack of conclusive 

evidence on adverse health eff ects 

caused by mobile phone usage.

More information on our eff orts to 

ensure compliance with both local 

and global standards related to EME 

is on our website.

In Singapore, we continue to 

engage the National Environment 

Agency (NEA) during the year, 

which conducted nine radiation 

measurements at locations of 

concern island-wide. The results 

showed that our mobile base stations 

complied with the radio frequency 

radiation levels and safety guidelines 

set by International Commission on 

Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection 

(ICNIRP). The ﬁ ndings were shared 

with the stakeholders who raised 

the concern. We also submitted a 

monthly report to IMDA on newly 

commissioned base stations to 

ensure that their Eff ective Isotropic 

Radiated Power or transmission 

power is within its guidelines. 

In Australia, we conduct audits of base 

stations and undertake predictive EME 

modelling and testing to ensure compliance 

at our sites with the Australian standards. 

We publish the EME reports of all our sites 

at www.rfnsa.com.au. The Australian 

Communications and Media Authority 

received ﬁ ve complaints relating to Optus in 

2017-2018 but no breach was found.

CUSTOMER DATA PRIVACY 

AND PROTECTION 

Customer Data Privacy and Protection 

is the most important topic that 

emerged from our materiality review 

and identiﬁ ed by our stakeholders. We 

conduct our business in compliance 

with data protection laws – the 

Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) 

in Singapore and the Privacy Act and 

Telecommunications Act in Australia. 

These laws cover rules governing the 

collection, use, disclosure and care 

of personal data. Singtel’s Group 

Chief Information Offi  cer is our Data 

Protection Offi  cer and reports to the 

Board Risk Committee on this matter. 

Every year, all employees must go 

through a mandatory online refresher 

course on customer data privacy and 

protection. We continue to educate our 

employees by issuing comprehensive 

guidelines and regular e-newsletters 

to help them understand and comply 

with the PDPA. These guidelines cover 

various aspects under three categories 

- collecting, disclosing and disposing of 

personal data. Our e-newsletter reminds 

staff  of the importance of customer data 

and carries case studies of breaches and 

ﬁ ndings by the Personal Data Protection 

Commission (PDPC) of Singapore, 

learnings and preventive actions. 

During the year, we recorded 

28 incidents in Singapore, nine of 

which were referred to us by PDPC. 

These incidents were mainly due to 

human error, resulting in documents 

containing personal data being 

sent to the wrong email or postal 

addresses. In addition, the service 

of an employee was terminated as 

he abused his access to customer 

information. 

 

In Australia, we proactively probed 

our complaint online tracker 

database to check if any complaint 

should have been directed to our 

Data Protection Offi  ce. This helps us 

with analytics and to spot systemic 

issues. From our active search, 

we picked up 254 customer data 

related incidents caused mainly 

by staff  error and negligence, 

and mostly aff ected individuals. 

We reported four data breaches 

cases to the Offi  ce of the Australian 

Information Commissioner. Two 

cases due to human error resulted in 

unintentional disclosure of individual 

customer details. The other two 

cases involved phishing and process 

errors which either disclosed contact 

details to a third party or published 

contact details of a select group 

of customers in online and printed 

directories. 

We take a serious view of these 

incidents and will continue to 

educate our staff  and improve 

practices and processes to reduce 

the recurrence of such lapses. Since 

FY2018, we have made it mandatory 

for every employee in Singapore 

and Australia to complete an online 

privacy training annually. We will 

continue to implement additional 

safeguards against mishandling of 

information by authorised staff  and 

also remind our people to be vigilant 

when handling customer data. 

The relevant authorities did not ﬁ ne 

or impose non-monetary sanction 

against the Singtel Group over these 

incidents.

Ethical and Responsible Business Practices

FAIR MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS

We recognise that fair marketing practices and transparency 

in our communications are critical to build trust and loyalty 

among our customers. Our marketing code sets out the 

requirements that Singtel organisations and representatives 

must follow to ensure that all marketing activities comply 

with various laws and guidelines such as the Singapore Code 

of Advertising Practice. 

There were no cases of non-compliance with regulations 

and voluntary codes concerning marketing communications 

at Singtel in Singapore during the year. We received a 

customer complaint via the Advertising Standards Authority 

of Singapore: a customer was incorrectly advised by our 

hotline offi  cer on the early re-contract fee waiver terms 

stated in an online advertisement. 

In October 2018, ACCC ﬁ ned Optus A$10 million for 

misleading conduct in relation to the Direct Carrier Billing 

(DCB) service. This relates to third party content, including 

premium content such as news websites and apps such as 

games and ringtones. We ceased off ering the DCB service 

from 24 August 2018, other than a limited number of services 

for one-off  content for TV shows, magazines and mobile 

gaming, all of which require expressed customer agreement 

to each purchase being charged to the customer’s Optus 

account. We acknowledged that some customers might 

have inadvertently subscribed to content they did not want 

or could not easily unsubscribe from. We committed to 

undertake a comprehensive review of customers aff ected by 

this activity and provided refunds where appropriate.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

We continue to manage the Group’s exposure to corruption 

risks by applying and emphasising good corporate governance, 

business ethics and transparency while applying robust internal 

controls in business processes as our core approach. 

We ensure that the Group’s zero tolerance policy towards fraud, 

corruption and unethical actions is strictly adhered to. Our 

Group policies on Fraud Investigation and the Whistleblower 

Programme underpin our fraud risk management framework 

and processes. The Singtel Group Anti-Bribery and Corruption 

Policy reinforces our long-standing zero tolerance approach to 

bribery and corruption of any form that is set out in our Code 

of Conduct. All Singtel Board members, employees and third 

parties who represent us such as suppliers, contractors and 

business partners, must comply with this policy at all times. 

More information on this topic is on our website. 

Every year, all employees must go through mandatory 

online refresher courses, including Code of Conduct, Fraud 

awareness and Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy. For 

instance, during the year, we engaged the Corrupt Practices 

Investigation Bureau of Singapore to conduct eight sessions of 

Marketplace and Customers

Ethical and Responsible Business Practices

anti-bribery and corruption talk as part of staff  training. More 

than 700 employees in Singapore attended. 

We received a total of 133 cases via our whistleblower 

channels during the year (see Figure 1). After investigation, 

34 cases were substantiated and 59 cases were not, with the 

remaining 40 cases under investigation at the end of the year. 

Three of the substantiated cases took place outside Singapore 

and Australia. In addition, we closed the 17 matters received in 

the prior year that were still under investigation as at 31 March 

2018, of which eight were substantiated. 

Highlights of the 42 substantiated cases:

• 26 cases of employee or sales agent misconduct and 

inappropriate behaviour involving unethical behaviour, 

conﬂ ict of interest, breach of code of conduct and corruption

• 8 cases of fraud by staff  for forging customer documents 

or submitting fraudulent timesheets, claims or referrals

• 6 cases involved breach of policy and gaps in business 

processes by employees or our sales agents 

• 1 customer service complaint and 1 case related to identity 

theft in Australia

OVERVIEW

ENVIRONMENT

SOCIAL

GOVERNANCE

When these cases came to our attention, independent 

internal investigations were immediately conducted 

by our Internal Audit or investigation teams led by our 

subject matter experts. When an alleged corrupt or 

other criminal act by an employee was substantiated, 

the employment of persons of interest was terminated 

and the matter was reported to the relevant law 

enforcement authority.

In early 2019, the Australian Parliament passed 

legislation that requires large organisations to maintain 

a whistleblower service and to comply with provisions 

concerning protection of whistleblowers that make 

certain types of disclosure. We are currently reviewing 

the Optus hotline and the Singtel Group Whistleblower 

Policy to ensure that they meet the requirements of 

the legislation.

During the year, there were no incidents of staff  

dismissal or disciplinary action nor termination or non-

renewal of business partners for corruption. However, 

in April 2019, we were ﬁ ned A$25,000 by the NSW Land 

and Environment Court for non-disclosure of payments 

to attend ticketed political fundraising events made 

in 2014 and 2015, totalling A$5,400, when submitting 

planning applications for sites in Thredbo and Perisher. 

We acknowledged the administrative error and noted 

that the Court found that the off ence arose from 

carelessness, and it was certainly not intentional, 

reckless or negligent.

MOST WELL-GOVERNED AND

TRANSPARENT COMPANY 

Singtel was named the most well-governed and 

transparent company in Singapore for the fourth 

consecutive year in the Singapore Governance and 

Transparency Index 2018 by CPA Australia, NUS Business 

School’s Centre for Governance, Institutions and 

Organisations, and Singapore Institute of Directors.

The Singapore Governance and Transparency Index 

(SGTI) assesses companies on board responsibilities, 

rights of shareholders, engagement of stakeholders, 

accountability and audit, as well as disclosure and 

transparency. The index is closely aligned with 

Singapore’s Code of Corporate Governance and 

G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. 

Singtel topped a list of more than 600 Singapore-listed 

companies, Reits and business trusts, with a score of 

129 points out of a maximum 143 points.

During the year, we published Optus’ inaugural Tax

Ethical and Responsible Business Practices

SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY 

CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

The Singtel Group has an extensive 

supply chain ranging from mobile and 

network equipment and infrastructure 

suppliers to content providers, security 

and managing agents. Given the complex 

nature and the wide geographical 

presence of our supply chain, we believe 

that collaboration with socially and 

environmentally conscious suppliers will 

help us mitigate a signiﬁ cant proportion 

of our sustainability risks. Results from our 

earlier Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and 

Social Hotspot Analysis are testimony to 

the need for responsible procurement 

practices in our business. More details 

are on our website. 

All new suppliers are assessed against 

ESG criteria through our sustainability 

questionnaire as part of their on-

boarding tender process. This is applied 

to tenders above $200,000 across 

the Singtel Group. 100% of such new 

suppliers were assessed against the 

criteria during the year.

We have earlier identiﬁ ed four key 

groups of suppliers who pose higher 

risks in our supply chain: Devices, 

Network equipment, IT hardware and 

Off shore call centres. In FY2019, Network 

equipment and Devices surfaced as 

pressing areas of concern due to the 

ban on certain Chinese 5G network 

manufacturers in some major markets. 

We placed additional scrutiny on 

14 suppliers with elevated risk and 

gathered responses of their self-

assessments to better manage this risk 

and reduce Singtel Group’s exposure.

During the year, we undertook a Security 

Compliance Assessment and visited 21 

off shore facilities to ensure that they 

were set up according to the agreed 

regulatory security architecture and 

controls.

We also updated a three-year sustainable 

supply chain management roadmap for 

FY2020-FY2022 (see Figure 2).

FY2020

Re-Calibrate Risk 

Framework

- Collaborate with industry-leading 

subject matter experts 

- Conduct gap analysis on 

current supplier risk 

management framework

- Conduct assessment to cover 

top 80% of suppliers by spend

FY2021

Step Up Communication

- Develop e-learning modules for 

supplier and staff 

- Extend assessment to cover up to 

83% of suppliers by spend

FY2022

Supplier Audit 

Programme

- Broaden supplier audits by third 

party beyond direct off shore/

outsource operations

Programme Impact

Benchmark Supplier Self Assessments 

and other supplier engagement tools 

to industry standard

FY2020: RECALIBRATION OF 

SUPPLIER RISK MANAGEMENT 

FRAMEWORK 

We will assess the state of our 

sustainable supply chain framework 

and determine the steps needed to 

achieve best-in-class standard. We 

will work with third party and industry 

experts to conduct an independent 

assessment of our policies and 

processes to facilitate this. Our initial 

steps include benchmarking our initial 

supplier engagement tools, such as 

supplier self-assessment (SSA). We 

will send out the new SSA to our top 

80% suppliers by spend, and other 

targeted suppliers with exposure to 

high risk areas based on factors like 

category and country of manufacture.

FY2021: SUPPLIER 

COMMUNICATION 

We will step up communication 

with our suppliers. We will also 

develop in-house e-learning 

modules to help staff  as well as new 

and existing suppliers understand 

our sustainability position and 

expectation. We will continue with 

our SSA outreach, expanding 

assessments to a larger scope and 

number of suppliers by spend and 

risk exposure.

FY2022: SUPPLIER AUDIT 

PROGRAMME

We aim to put in place a supplier 

audit programme to actively 

manage our key suppliers and 

ensure their compliance through 

third party site audits.

SAFETY OF OUR CONTRACTORS 

We want to inculcate good Workplace Safety and Health 

(WSH) practices among all our contractors. A key initiative is 

the Singtel Safe Contractor Accreditation (SCA) scheme, a 

set of Singtel’s WSH standards for contractors who perform 

high-risk technical or physical work introduced in April 2016. 

During the year, we worked closely with 98 SCA accredited 

contractors, who went through their ﬁ rst year of surveillance 

audit to maintain their validity of their accreditation. Those 

who fail to do so will be disqualiﬁ ed from obtaining future 

contracts with Singtel (see Figure 3). 

 

In addition, 68 contractors categorised under the high-risk 

group have all attained the bizSAFE Star status which is the 

highest achievement under the bizSAFE programme by the 

WSH Council in Singapore. 

The WSH Council recognised Singtel’s eff orts and 

commitment to helping our service partners achieve 

continuous WSH improvements, hence we successfully 

renewed our bizSAFE Partner certiﬁ cation in April 2018 

for the next two years.

RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS

We respect and support the human rights of 

individuals regardless of who they are, and where they 

live. There are risks that we need to address to prevent 

breaches in our supply chain and tackle the growing 

global concern on modern slavery. 

As a signatory of the UN Global Compact since 2007, 

we are committed to upholding its ten principles 

including human and labour rights. The UN Universal 

Declaration of Human Rights and UN Guiding 

Principles on Business and Human Rights also guide 

our approach and policy development to help us better 

assess, mitigate and combat modern slavery impact in 

our operations and supply chain.

We took steps to ensure that we have robust measures 

to comply with the new Modern Slavery Act in 

Australia, which was passed in end-2018, among which 

is a Modern Slavery Act statement by the company. We 

examined our Supplier Code of Conduct and Master 

Service Agreement to ensure that they, especially the 

sustainability-related clauses, are aligned with the 

requirements of the Act and our suppliers are expected 

to conform to the revisions. We also looked into salient 

risk areas within our supply chain. We are currently 

developing an overarching human rights policy and 

plan to launch it by late FY2020 along with a Modern 

Slavery Statement in response to the new Australian 

Government legislation.

2.1 When compiling the information speciﬁed in Disclosure 302-1, 

the reporting organisation shall:

 

2.1.1  avoid the double-counting of fuel consumption, when 

reporting self-generated energy consumption. If the 

organisation generates electricity from a non-renewable 

or renewable fuel source and then consumes the 

generated electricity, the energy consumption shall be 

counted once under fuel consumption;

 

2.1.2  report fuel consumption separately for non-renewable 

and renewable fuel sources;

 

2.1.3  only report energy consumed by entities owned or 

controlled by the organisation;

 

2.1.4  calculate the total energy consumption within 

the organisation in joules or multiples using the 

following formula: Total energy consumption within 

the organisation = Non-renewable fuel consumed + 

Renewable fuel consumed + Electricity, heating, cooling, 

and steam purchased for consumption + Self-generated 

electricity, heating, cooling, and steam, which are not 

consumed (see clause 2.1.1) – Electricity, heating, cooling, 

and steam sold:

MANAGEMENT’S AND bOARD OF DIRECTORS’ 

RESPONSIbILITy 

The Management is responsible for the preparation of the 

Subject Matters in accordance with the Global Reporting 

Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards. The 

Board has ultimate responsibility for the company’s 

sustainability reporting.

The Management is responsible for the collection and 

presentation of the information and for maintaining 

adequate records and internal controls that are designed 

to support the sustainability reporting process. For the 

purpose of the Sustainability Report 2019, there are no 

legally prescribed requirements relating to the veriﬁcation 

of sustainability reports.

AUDITOR’S INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITy CONTROL

We have complied with the independence and other ethical 

requirements of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory 

Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics 

for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA 

Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of 

integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, 

conﬁdentiality and professional behaviour.

Our ﬁrm applies Singapore Standards on Quality Control 1  

of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and, 

accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality 

control including documented policies and procedures 

regarding compliance with ethical requirements, 

professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory 

requirements.

We have the required competencies and experience to 

conduct this assurance engagement. Our professionals 

have both the required assurance skills and experience in 

the applicable Subject Matters including environmental, 

social and ﬁnancial aspects.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIbILITy 

Our responsibility is to form a conclusion on Singtel Group’s 

preparation of the Subject Matters based on our work. 

We performed our work in accordance with International 

Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) 

(Revised) – Assurance Engagements other than Audits or 

Reviews of Historical Financial Information (the “Standard”). 

This Standard requires that we plan and perform our work 

to form the conclusion. The extent of our work performed 

depends on our professional judgment and our assessment 

of the engagement risk.

Independent limited  

assurance Statement 

Our review was limited to the information on the select 

indicators set out within the Report from 01 April 2018 to  

31 March 2019 and our responsibility does not include:

•	

Any	work	in	respect	of	sustainability	information	published	

elsewhere in Singtel Group’s annual report, website and 

other publications,

•	

Sustainability	information	prior	to	01	April	2018	and	

subsequent to 31 March 2019, and

•	

Management’s	forward	looking	statements	such	as	

targets, plans and intentions.

REPORTING CRITERIA

As a basis for the assurance engagement, we have used 

the criterion of “Accuracy” as deﬁned by GRI and speciﬁc 

criteria determined by Singtel Group as being relevant for 

its sustainability performance. We consider these reporting 

criteria to be relevant and appropriate to review the Report.

 

ASSURANCE STANDARD USED AND LEVEL OF ASSURANCE

Our limited assurance engagement has been planned and 

performed in accordance with the ISAE 30001  Assurance 

Engagement Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical 

Financial Information. 

A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries 

and applying analytical and other review procedures. Our 

procedures were designed to provide a limited level of 

assurance and as such do not provide all the evidence that 

would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance. 

 

The procedures performed depend on our judgement 

including the risk of material misstatement of the speciﬁc 

activity data, whether due to fraud or error. While we 

considered the effectiveness of Management’s internal 

controls when determining the nature and extent of our 

procedures, our review was not designed to provide 

assurance on internal controls. We believe that the evidence 

we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 

a basis for our conclusion.

WHAT WE DID TO FORM OUR CONCLUSIONS

We designed our procedures in order to state whether 

anything has come to our attention to suggest that the Subject 

Matters detailed above has not been reported in accordance 

with the reporting criteria cited earlier. In order to form our 

conclusions, we undertook the steps below:

1. Inquiries with Singtel Group’s Sustainability team to 

 

a. Understand principal business operations, 

 

b. Appreciate key sustainability issues and developments,

 

c. Map out information flow for sustainability reporting 

and the controls on information collation,

 

d. Identify data providers with their responsibilities, and 

 

 

e. Recognise the likelihood of possible manipulation of 

sustainability data.

2. Conduct visits to Singtel Group’s offices.

3. Conduct process walk-through of systems and processes 

for data aggregation and reporting, with relevant 

personnel to understand the quality of checks and control 

mechanisms, assessing and testing the controls in relation 

to the concerned Subject Matters in the Report.

4. Interviews with employees and management based 

in Singapore (Group Sustainability, Human Resources, 

Learning and Development, Rewards, Energy, Utilities, 

Workplace Safety &amp; Health, Group Internal Audit, Supply 

Chain, Regulations, Brand Development, Information 

Technology, Customer Resolution &amp; Competitor 

Intelligence) and Australia (Group Sustainability, 

Human Resources, Learning and Development, Energy, 

Utilities, Workplace Safety &amp; Health) to understand key 

sustainability issues related to the select indicators and 

processes for the collection and accurate reporting of 

performance information.

5. Collect samples through sampling methods and obtain 

documentation for the sample to verify assumptions, 

estimations and computations made by management in 

relation to the concerned Subject Matters in the Report.

6. Conduct general media research on the concerned 

Subject Matters.

7. Checking that data and statements had been correctly 

transcribed from corporate systems and/or supporting 

evidence, into the Report.

8. Obtain investigation reports in relation to the concerned 

Subject Matters in the Report.

9. Rely on Optus and Singtel’s management representation 

letter for Singtel Group on the concerned Subject Matters 

in the Report. 

ObSERVATIONS AND AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

Our observations and areas for improvement will be 

raised in a separate report to Singtel Group’s Board of 

Directors and Management. These observations and 

areas for improvement do not affect our conclusion on 

the aforementioned Subject Matters included in the 

Sustainability Report. 

OTHER MATTERS

Our responsibility in performing our limited assurance 

activities is to the Management of Singtel Group only and in 

accordance with the terms of reference agreed with them. 

We do not accept or assume any responsibility for any other 

purpose or to any other person or organisation. Any reliance 

any such third party may place on the Report is entirely at 

their own risk.

CONCLUSION

Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, 

nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe 

that the information in the Report was not presented fairly, 

and calculated in all material respects in accordance with 

the reporting criteria detailed above.
