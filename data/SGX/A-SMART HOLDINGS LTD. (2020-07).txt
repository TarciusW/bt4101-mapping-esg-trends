SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATIONS

The Group acquired controlling stakes in two newly incorporated property development companies in Timor-

Leste, namely Timor Marina Square S.A. and Timor City Square S.A. in FY2019. The Group holds a 69% stake in 

Timor Marina Square S.A. and a 60% stake in Timor City Square S.A. 

TIMOR MARINA SQUARE

Dili, Timor-Leste

The Group’s maiden property development project, Timor Marina Square, is currently in progress in Dili, the capital 

city of Timor-Leste. Situated along the seafront coastal line of Lecidere in Dili, the land is freehold and comprises 

an area of 3,204 square meters. Due to the pandemic, the property development project has encountered a slight 

delay in construction, nevertheless the architectural plans have since been completed and submitted to the Timor 

Building Authorities. Upon completion, it will be comprised of two buildings, one of which is 23-storey luxury 

residential apartments while the other will be a 19-storey tower comprising retail, office and serviced apartments. 

This landmark is well-positioned to target foreign investors from East Asia and South East Asia. 

TIMOR CITY SQUARE

Dili, Timor-Leste

Timor City Square S.A. owns the rights to a 99-year leasehold land comprising a total area of 5,310 square meters. 

Situated at a prime location next to the Central Business District of Dili, Timor City Square S.A. is contractually 

committed to develop a high-rise mixed property within nine years from 2019. The Group plans to time its 

development plans to favourable market conditions, and has received approval from the authorities to build low 

rise shops for short-term leasing in the interim.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

BOARD MESSAGE

Dear Stakeholders, 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present the Group’s third sustainability report on behalf of the 

Group, for the period between 1 August 2019 and 31 July 2020. This Report has been prepared in accordance 

with SGX-ST Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability Reporting Guide, and serves to assess the Group’s sustainability 

strategies and performance as well as to demonstrate the Group’s continued commitment to sustainability. 

The Board considers sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation to ensure the long-term success of 

the Group and has determined the Group’s material ESG factors based on the GRI framework. The GRI framework 

is an industry standard, and serves as a guide for the Board in the monitoring and the report of the Company’s 

performance on ESG factors. The ESG topics selected in the previous sustainability report have been re-evaluated 

for its materiality to the Group in FY2020. The Board and the management are of the view that the material topics 

continued to be the same as those in FY2019, after various and multiple stakeholder engagement. 

The Group has identified material sustainability factors and prioritised these material topics in view of their 

significance of economic, environmental and social impacts as well as their influence on our stakeholders’ 

assessment and decisions, which will be reflected in our ESG factors in this report. The Group remains committed 

to the well-being of our employees, the environment and the communities we operate in. Moving forward, the 

Board and management will continue to improve our sustainability efforts and will actively engage our key 

stakeholders in our pursuit of it.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

The Group strives to achieve high ethical standards in our business operations, with zero tolerance for corruptions, 

frauds and other behaviours violating work ethics. Unethical or illegal events such as corruption, bribery, and 

collusion are strictly prohibited. The disciplinary code and code of conduct is stipulated in the Employee Handbook, 

and we encourage employees to make a report if they suspect any misconduct cases.

Besides communicating with and educating all our employees regarding the anti-corruption policies, these 

policies are also shared with our clients, business partners and suppliers. The composition of employees and 

details of business partners that the Group’s anti-corruption policies and procedures have been communicated 

to are as follows:

For FY2020, the Group has met the target set in FY2019 and there were zero corruption incidents. The Group has 

a target of zero incidents perpetually. 

WHISTLE-BLOWING POLICY

The Audit Committee (“AC”) has in place a whistle-blowing policy and arrangements to allow employees to submit 

complaints confidentially or anonymously to the Chairman of the AC, whom is well known by many employees 

and easily accessible. The policy will allow whistle-blowers to raise concerns on financial improprieties or other 

matters raised, which will be investigated and appropriate follow-up actions will be taken. 

All complaints will be treated with confidentiality and will be brought to the attention of the AC immediately. 

Assessment, investigation and evaluation of complaints are conducted by or at the direction of the AC. Whenever 

necessary or appropriate, independent advisors will be engaged at the Group’s expense. Following investigation 

and evaluation of a complaint, the AC will then decide on recommended disciplinary or remedial action, if any. 

Thereafter, it will be brought to the Board or to an appropriate senior executive staff for authorisation and 

implementation.

The AC receives reports relating to serious offences and criminal activities in the Group and such matters are 

highlighted to the Board during Board meetings. The AC and the Board have access to the appropriate external 

advices, where necessary. Where appropriate or required, a report will be made to the relevant government 

authorities for further investigation or action. The AC is updated annually or from time to time on any changes to 

the accounting and financial reporting standards by the external auditors. No former partner or director of the 

Group’s existing auditing firm has acted as a member of the AC.

For FY2020, there were no whistle-blowing reports received.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

The Group places huge emphasis on caring for the impact that its business activities have on the environment 

and have implemented control activities and monitoring measures in its business activities and workplace. We 

are committed to promoting a green environment by introducing environmentally friendly business practices, 

educating our employees to enhance their awareness on environmental protection and adhering to the relevant 

environmental laws and regulations for all our operational business units. 

During FY2020, the Group has not identified any material non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations, 

including but not limited to “Environmental Protection and Management Act” and “Environmental Public Health 

Act” in Singapore. 

ENERGY CONSUMPTION

Electricity consumption accounts for a substantial part of the energy usage of the Group business operations. As 

such, the Group is committed to optimize the use of resources in all of its business. Our staffs are encouraged to 

take part in energy conservation initiatives in the office such as switching off unnecessary lighting, idle equipment 

or computers when not in use or after working hours, adopting power-saving features for office equipment and 

computers and procuring energy efficient appliances only upon replacement of old appliances or due to new 

business needs. 

The Group strives to take the lead in incorporating environmental protection measures into business operations 

and supports renewable energy investments. During FY2020, 20% of total power consumption is clean energy 

generated from solar systems by Sunseap Energy.

During FY2020, the electricity consumption of the Group was approximately 516,886 kWh and its intensity was 

approximately 96,254 kWh  per S$ million revenue. 

We target to maintain or reduce the electricity consumption intensity in FY2021.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

The printing business requires huge amounts of ink chemicals for our print products. We are committed to 

disposing waste chemicals responsibly and prioritize the proper management of waste in communities where 

we operate in. 

We have a dedicated team of experienced handlers that store chemicals in designated safe areas, in order to 

minimise the risk of any chemical leaks. These safe areas are constantly under surveillance and accessible only 

by authorised personnel. The Group has obtained the Petroleum and Flammable Materials Storage Licence from 

Singapore Civil Defence Force for storing the chemicals in the designated areas. The Group is keenly aware of 

the negative impacts on the environment that could arise from inappropriate handling and disposal of chemical 

waste. As such, the Group only engages NEA licensed waste management company to handle the disposal of 

chemical waste.

In addition, as part of the Emergency Response Plan, the Group has in-place a set of guidelines on how to 

appropriately respond to accidents or hazardous events resulting from chemical spills or fire.

GREENHOUSE GAS (“GHG”) EMISSIONS

The Group’s largest source of in indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) is due to electricity consumption in the office. 

In order to minimize the carbon footprint, the Group has implemented measures to ensure efficient use of 

electricity, listed in the section “Energy Consumption”. During FY2020, the total GHG emissions of the Group was 

approximately 168.92 tCO2e and its intensity was approximately 31.46 tCO2e per S$ million revenue. We target to 

maintain or reduce the GHG emissions intensity in FY2021.

Assessment Report, 2014 (AR5).

 

WATER CONSUMPTION

We encourage our employees to conserve water by promoting water-saving habits in the office. Employees are 

encouraged to turn off the tap when it is not in use and report leaking faucet or pipe to the relevant authority. The 

Group’s only source of water is from a municipal water supplier. During FY2020, the water consumption of the 

Group was approximately 238.69 m3 and its intensity was approximately 41.87 m3 per S$ million revenue. The

RAW MATERIAL

Paper accounts for a substantial portion of the Group’s inputs and is the main raw material used in the Group’s 

business operations. To promote environmental sustainability, the Group is committed to managing and ensuring 

that all raw materials used are necessary. 

To reduce paper usage and minimize paper waste, our sales team works closely with our customers to ensure 

that their requirements are correctly understood. Thereafter, our production team will ensure that the design 

of print jobs enables optimal paper usage. Subject to requests by our customers, we also use recycled paper to 

mitigate the consumption of resources. Our employees are well-trained in the areas of efficient cutting, binding 

techniques and printing colour control which further reduce paper waste. Unusable waste paper will be treated 

as non-Forest Stewardship Council (“FSCTM”) and sold to scrap dealers for recycling. 

In addition, we source our paper from responsible certified suppliers, including those with FSCTM certification, who 

have obtained paper supplies through sustainable forest management solutions.

SOCIOECONOMIC COMPLIANCE

Socioeconomic compliance is one of the key factors for the Group to obtain its social license to operate. The 

management team regularly reviews business activities, puts in place clear policies and procedures with 

the ultimate goal of preventing potential infringement of related laws and regulations. Employees are also 

encouraged to report any suspicion of violation of laws and regulations. During FY2020, there were zero incidents 

of non-compliance with relevant material socio-economic laws and regulations. We aim to keep the target at zero 

incidents perpetually.  

RECRUITMENT AND DISMISSAL

Employees form the foundation in enabling the Group’s development and plays a vital role in providing excellent 

service experience for our customers. As such, we are committed to provide a pleasant working environment for 

our employees. We encourage communication, innovation, continuous learning and foster employee engagement. 

The Company has established relevant policies to fulfil our vision on people-oriented management to ensure 

that we realize the full potential of our employees. The human resources management procedures are formally 

documented in the Employee Handbook, covering employment contract, promotion, performance evaluation, 

transfer, training, working hours, welfare and remuneration. During FY2020, there were no instances where a 

significant portion of the organization’s activities were performed by workers who are not employees.

The termination of any recruitment contract will be based on reasonable, lawful grounds and internal policies 

that are stated in the Employee Handbook. The Group strictly prohibits any unfair or illegitimate dismissals. For 

employees with poor working performance, the Group will give verbal warnings before issuing a warning letter. 

If these measures prove to be ineffective, the Group would then dismiss its employee according to relevant laws.

REMUNERATION AND BENEFITS

We recognize the efforts of all our employees towards building the success of the Group. Employees’ remuneration 

is kept competitive and employees are rewarded based on personal performance. Employees’ remuneration 

package also includes diverse types of leaves and insurance, all of which have been listed in the Employee 

Handbook in details. For instance, leave types include but not limited to medical and hospitalization leave, 

marriage leave, national service (“NS”) leave, compassionate leave, child care leave and maternity and paternity 

leave. The Group has in place an E-Leave System, enabling employees to apply for leave through the online portal 

and check their leave balances. 

The Group also provides medical treatment including outpatient medical and dental care, life insurance, the Group 

Travel Insurance Policy and an Insurance Scheme covering maternity expenses, hospitalization and surgical 

expenses. Other benefits and protection for our full-time employees include the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”), 

allowance for overseas business trips, reimbursement claims, and the Long Service Awards given to employees 

with at least 5 years of service.

The Group adopted the A-Smart Employee Share Option Scheme 2018 (“A-Smart ESOS”) to provide our employees 

and directors of the Group an opportunity to participate in the equity of the Group. The ESOS is ultimately aimed 

to ensure greater dedication, loyalty and higher standards of performance from our employees, and to give 

recognition to those who have contributed significantly to the growth and performance of the Group.

During FY2020, 1,752,000 share options were granted under the A-Smart ESOS, of which 1,658,000 share options 

remained unexercised at 31 July 2020 and 94,000 share options lapsed due to staff resignations.  In FY2020, 8 

employees were granted a total of 36 days of child care leave.

DIVERSITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION

We practise transparency and fair treatment in the recruitment process, and other aspects including remuneration, 

promotion and benefits. Employees’ performance targets are set and mutually agreed upon, the desired behaviour 

aligned to the Group’s values is also shared with the employees. All employees are given fair opportunities based 

on objective assessment, regardless of gender, race, marital status, disability, age or family status.

A-SMART HOLDINGS LTD.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Group highly prioritises workers’ safety in the organisational value system as employees form our key assets 

and is committed to maintaining a safe workplace for our employees. We have conducted training and set up 

safety procedures to improve occupational health and safety awareness of the employees, in order to prevent 

workplace injuries and illnesses.

We developed the Occupational Health and Safety and Security Policy, adhered to by our employees and monitored 

by managers and supervisors, to prevent occupational injuries and illness. The Group aims to achieve the following: 

•	 Identifying and reducing the risks of all types of work activities that have the potential to produce personal 

injury; 

•	 Providing instructions, training and supervision to improve individual’s understanding of workplace hazards, 

including safe work practices and emergency procedures; 

•	 Involving individuals in occupational health and safety matters and consulting with them on ways to recognise, 

evaluate and control workplace hazards; 

•	 Ensuring that everyone (including visitors and sub-contractors) complies with appropriate standards and 

workplace directions to protect their own and others health and safety at work; and 

•	 Providing adequate systems and resources to effectively manage rehabilitation and return to work processes. 

The Group has also set up a Risk Management Team, led by our Office Support Executive and composed of employees 

from different designations and departments, in order to facilitate risk assessment at our operation locations, 

modify Safe Work Procedures and formulate Risk Management Implementation Plan. Certain employees have 

been designated as safety personnel and were sent for Occupational First Aid Courses at government approved 

centres. In addition, we regularly review our Emergency Response Plan and are certified by the Singapore Civil 

Defence Force for fire safety works in our office that have been completed satisfactorily in accordance with the 

requirements of the “Fire Safety Act”.

The Group also assesses the laser cutting machines involved in our printing business in order to ensure 

improvement on health and safety impacts. Laser cutting machines release fume when it is operational, which 

could affect the health of our employees. As such, we have made improvement on safety procedures and have

TRAINING AND EDUCATION

The Group recognizes the importance for Training and Education as it enhances productivity of all employees by 

equipping them with the necessary skillsets. 

Our Training and Development Policy encourages employees to upgrade their skillsets and enhance their 

knowledge. The Human Resource (“HR”) Department is responsible for the facilitation of any staff development 

activities. The Group supports employees to participate in personal and professional training, including formal 

training sessions (individual or corporate), employee coaching and mentoring, on-the-job training, job shadowing, 

job rotation and participation in conferences. As part of our learning and development provisions, the Group will 

also arrange for job-related subscriptions or educational materials to enable employee access to news, articles 

and other relevant materials. 

As a company with a full range of print management services, we are certified based on the FSCTM standards and 

have conducted FSCTM trainings to equip our workers with knowledge on FSCTM overview, job folder and cutting 

ticket. Occasionally, the Group will engage external experts to organise trainings such as equal employment 

opportunities, diversity, leadership training for managers and conflict resolution training for employees. 

Internally, our managers and experts conduct training programs to train new employees or to prepare employees 

for promotions, transfers or new responsibilities, and teams in company-related issues (e.g. new systems or 

policy changes). 

During FY2020, total employee training hours were 40 hours. The detailed summary is as follows:

PROCUREMENT PRACTICE

Suppliers and consultants are important business partners and stakeholders of the Group and relationship 

with these stakeholders are highly valued. The Group’s major suppliers include paper supplies for our printing 

business. 

To ensure that our suppliers meet our requirements with regards to quality as well as environmental and social 

standards, we have formulated an approved list of paper suppliers who are FSCTM Chain of Custody (“COC”) 

certified and the types of FSCTM paper they carried. We have also included these categories on packing labels and 

invoice claims for easy reference. The Purchasing Executive is responsible for compiling suppliers’ records and 

search for the information of FSCTM certified suppliers from the FSCTM Database. Whenever possible, FSCTM paper 

samples are also collected from the certified paper merchant for reference purposes.

LOCAL PROCUREMENT

As part of the Group’s fulfilment of its social responsibilities, whenever possible, the Group strives to select local 

suppliers for our business operation so as to support local companies, create job opportunities for the local 

community and promote local economic development. Local suppliers are suppliers in Singapore and the Group’s 

local procurement statistic in FY2020 is as follows:

CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Group is focused on customers’ health and safety impacts resulting from its services and products. We have 

established appropriate policies and measures to maintain standards of our products and services in order to 

protect customers’ health and safety. We have in place relevant policies and measures to instruct employees to 

take appropriate and standardised steps while servicing our customers. In FY2020, the Group has not identified 

any incidents of non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of 

our products and services.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

CUSTOMER PRIVACY

The Group is committed to protecting customers’ privacy and data at all times and places huge priority and 

attention on data security. To comply with privacy-related laws and regulations, including but not limited to 

the “Personal Data Protection Act”, we engaged an external professional company to handle the destruction 

of personal information of our customers. We strictly abide by all off-site and on-site shredding processes set 

out by professionals and are accredited with the Certification of Destruction, in order to mitigate the risk of 

noncompliance and leakage of personal data. 

The Group has developed its own Information Labelling Procedure to ensure that all staffs are made aware of 

their individual responsibilities regarding the appropriate labelling and information classification. The procedure 

provides clear instructions on the management of restricted documents and lists out each level of confidentiality 

for each individual department. Any employee found to have violated the procedure could be subject to disciplinary 

action, up to and including termination.

During FY2020, the Group did not receive any substantiated complaint concerning breaches of customer privacy, 

or any leaks, thefts, and loss of customer data.
