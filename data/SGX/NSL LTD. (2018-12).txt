About this report

Reporting Scope and Period

Following our inaugural Sustainability Report 

published by NSL Ltd in 2018, this report covers  

the sustainability performance and targets relating 

to our activities within the financial year ended  

31 December 2018. 

Although NSL Ltd encompasses a range of 

businesses across Asia, the Middle East and 

Europe, this report includes data and information 

pertaining to our environmental services, chemicals 

and marina businesses in Singapore and our  

precast business in Singapore and Malaysia. 

These form our core businesses and therefore 

the majority of our impacts. We will consider 

extending the number of geographic locations  

and indicators to be tracked and disclosed in  

future reporting.

Reporting Standard and Assurance

This report has been prepared with reference to 

the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards. 

We have not obtained any independent assurance 

of the information being reported, but will continue 

to work on enhancing our reporting processes and 

the robustness and completeness of our disclosures 

moving forward.

Feedback

This report is made available in soft copy on our 

website at www.nsl.com.sg.

We welcome any questions or feedback on this 

report. Please email to sustainability@nsl.com.sg 

should you wish to contact us.

Sustainability at NSL

NSL relies on its five core values to 

guide organisational culture and 

decision-making towards sustainably 

achieving its vision and mission.

Our formal sustainability committee 

continues to collate information from 

the respective departments responsible 

for planning sustainability efforts, 

and gather data on our performance. 

Progress on our sustainability goals, 

as well as contents of this report, are 

communicated to senior management 

and the board, which monitors our 

sustainability achievements.

We conducted our materiality assessment based 

on the GRI Standards’ Principles for defining 

report content. The chosen material topics 

were reviewed and retained for this subsequent 

report, as we believe our current topics 

remained to be material factors in line with our 

current business strategy, market conditions 

and stakeholder concerns. This also provides 

reporting consistency for ease of performance 

and progress tracking of key indicators.

Protecting the 

Environment

We care for the environment by providing 

green products within our industries, 

minimising waste and emissions, and 

ensuring environmental compliance.


Green Products and Services

New Industrial Wastewater 

Treatment Complex 

We have successfully completed 

the construction of our $40 million 

industrial wastewater treatment 

complex. Novel technologies 

have been deployed to meet and 

anticipate increasingly stringent 

discharge standards. This facility 

allows us to broaden the range 

of environmental services we can 

offer to the increasingly diverse 

customer base. Industries that 

we are able to cater to range 

from petrochemical, automotive 

to pharmaceutical. We are on 

track to start commissioning in 

early 2019 and begin commercial 

operations within the year.

Water is a critical issue in 

Singapore and wastewater 

treatment is vital to the water 

system, as wastewater is obtained 

and recycled. Our investment 

in the wastewater treatment 

capability is a clear demonstration 

of our commitment towards 

supporting Public Utilities Board 

(PUB). It is part of our efforts 

in promoting the growth of 

Singapore’s industrial sector, 

by expanding water treatment 

to maintain environmental 

sustainability objectives. 

This year, we participated in the 

Singapore International Water Week 

2018 to increase awareness of the 

issues, treatment technologies and 

latest developments surrounding 

wastewater treatment in Singapore. 

Sustainability is at the heart of our 

main business offerings, from the 

management of oil and chemical waste 

to supplying the market with certified 

green concrete. Green products and 

services are therefore a highly material 

topic in our approach and achievements 

in sustainability.

Marine Waste Collection 

We have expanded our marine 

slop collection capacity with 

the addition of two vessels with 

Ship Inspection Report (SIRE) 

certification, and installation of a 

new Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) 

system to increase our wastewater 

treatment capability.

Green Concrete 

We continue to offer 45 designs 

of green concrete mix to support 

sustainable construction in 

Singapore, and 35 types in Malaysia. 

Demand for green concrete 

continues to increase, making up 

about a third of the volume of our 

concrete projects in both countries. 

This is primarily due to the real 

estate industry’s move towards 

green building certification. We are 

proud of our role in enabling this 

important market shift.

Waste Management

As a leading provider of waste 

treatment and disposal services, we 

believe waste management is core  

to our business. While we assist other 

organisations with their waste, we 

also strive to continuously monitor 

and reduce the amount of waste 

produced by our own operations. 

In 2018, we used our extensive expertise 

in waste disposal and treatment and 

leveraged our process development 

capabilities to improve our waste 

management performance. This allowed 

us to not only improve our operating 

costs and efficiency, but also reduce our 

environmental carbon footprint, address 

regulatory risks, and provide increasingly 

sustainable products and services.



At our NSL OilChem Waste 

Management facility, we continue 

to leverage our wastewater 

treatment capabilities to treat 

wastewater generated from our 

processes before discharge. All 

incineration ashes are tested 

before disposal at landfills. 

How We Manage and Reduce Our Waste

At Eastern Pretech, concrete 

waste and steel scrap metal 

are the two main types of 

waste that result from product 

rejections. We continue to 

implement stringent quality 

standards in our production 

to minimise waste. To further 

minimise concrete waste, we 

are exploring ways to recover 

and recycle the aggregates  

in our concrete waste.

Alongside the industrial waste 

from our operations, we aim  

to reduce our general and food 

waste from Raffles Marina and 

office sites, while increasing 

awareness of recycling efforts. 

We collaborate with waste 

collectors to ensure the 

recyclability of waste paper 

collected. Also, we partner 

with catering providers to limit 

food waste in our canteen.

The following data presents the 

hazardous waste generated by Eastern 

Pretech and NSL OilChem operations 

in 2018 by disposal method. 

Hazardous waste from Eastern 

Pretech Malaysia is disposed off in 

accordance with Environmental 

Quality (Scheduled Wastes) 

Regulations 2005 by a contractor 

approved by Malaysia’s Department 

Of Environment (DOE).

We have provided hazardous waste 

in percentage, as the total number 

is commercially sensitive.

We will extend 

tracking of waste 

to include non-

hazardous waste 

in 2019. We aim 

to increase the 

percentage of waste 

recycled by 5%.

Air Quality, Noise and 

Dust Pollution

Our operations can inevitably impact air 

quality through creation of dust and noise 

pollution. To curb this, we continue to 

conduct boundary noise measurements 

and noise mapping of our facilities. Air 

emissions, dust exposure and chemical 

effluents are closely monitored. Adding on, 

audiometry tests are put in place for staff.

To reduce noise levels, we continue 

to utilise low-noise saw blades in the 

sawing of hollow-core slabs for our 

precast operations.

We are continually working to  

reduce the noise exposure levels  

at our worksites.

We will continue to maintain our 

emissions below allowable limits 

at all times.

Environmental Compliance

Environmental compliance is a 

priority at NSL. We are committed 

to improving our risk assessment 

processes, emergency preparedness and 

monitoring, as guided by international 

best practice and standards. We also 

work closely with regulators such as 

Ensuring an Up-to-date

Approach to Meeting

Environmental Compliance

the National Environment Agency (NEA), 

Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and 

Public Utilities Board (PUB) on maintaining 

transparency. We aim to minimise risk of 

incidents arising from non-compliance 

in focal areas such as discharge of water, 

handling of hazardous materials and fire. 

NSL prioritises environmental compliance 

with utmost importance. However, despite  

all our best efforts and precautions, there 

were some minor instances of lapses over  

the course of the year.

In response to the fire at our NSL OilChem 

Waste Management fixation plant in 

March 2017, we immediately engaged an 

international fire and risk consultant to 

conduct a fire safety review for the entire 

plant operations. We continue to implement 

the recommendations from the fire and risk 

assessment review. Our licence to operate the 

incinerator was reinstated in September 2018. 

We have also faced summons from NEA and 

PUB in our Singapore operations regarding 

water discharge and in our Malaysia precast 

operations regarding compliance of 

waste storage facilities. In an effort to 

rectify the current situation, we are 

in the process of responding to 

the concerns raised.

We aim to work 

with the respective 

authorities to review 

and update our waste 

storage and discharge 

procedures. 

Our Performance

Targets

At NSL OilChem, we have successfully 

completed our conversion to  

ISO 14001:2015 for environmental 

management and compliance. We 

have also started the construction of  

a new shelter for flammable and non-

flammable materials storage.

Caring for  

Our People

Our people are at the heart of 

what we do. We are focused in 

the aspects of talent acquisition, 

development and retention, along 

with ensuring employee health, 

safety and well-being.




Labour Practices, Employee 

Training and Welfare

NSL Ltd has over 2,000 employees, 

with more than half located in our 

Singapore and Malaysia operations. 

We know that attracting, developing 

and retaining the right people is 

key to the long term success of 

our business, therefore our labour 

practices are critical areas of interest 

to both internal and external 

stakeholders.

1 An average headcount 

over the year was used for 

Eastern Pretech Singapore 

as the headcount reduced 

significantly over the reporting 

period due to consolidation of 

our precast production from 

Singapore to Malaysia.

In 2018, the main change to the 

business was to focus efforts on 

ensuring fair labour practices and the 

consolidation of our precast production 

from Singapore to Malaysia for cost 

effectiveness and better synergy. 

We managed staff expectations by 

working closely with unions and 

relevant statutory bodies throughout 

this significant change for placement 

assistance and provision of market 

competitive retrenchment benefits.

Four key areas of our human 

capital strategy are fair labour 

practices; talent attraction; 

training and development; and 

welfare and well-being.

We focused on skills assessment  

and providing the appropriate  

How We Manage Our Talent

training to equip our 

employees with the right 

skills to excel in their jobs. 

To support our ongoing 

commitment towards 

talent acquisition and skills 

development, we have 

participated in several 

government-initiated  

programmes to upskill and 

employ the local workforce.

We have met the following 

targets for 2018 set out in the 

preceding sustainability report. 

We are committed to extend fair labour 

practices to every employee across our 

businesses, regardless of function.

We continue to place emphasis on 

ensuring responsible recruitment and 

management of our labourers and 

migrant workers. In Malaysia, we are in 

the process of seeking approval from 

local authorities to construct our own 

accommodation for migrant workers. 

Construction is expected to begin in 

middle of 2019.

Less than 4% of our employees are 

covered by collective bargaining 

agreements in 2018.

We continue to recruit through various 

sources such as headhunters, agencies, 

job advertisements, and partnerships 

with institutes of higher learning. 

At our Environmental Services division, 

we participated in the Earn and Learn 

Programme for Institute of Technical 

Education (ITE) students to develop 

local talent in Singapore. 

NSL also worked with the Employment 

and Employability Institute (e2i) on the 

professional conversion programme 

for both administrative and technical 

support roles. We would continue to 

support this programme in 2019.

Enhancing the skills and knowledge of 

our employees is pivotal in nurturing 

talents and creating a sustainable 

talent pipeline. We strongly support 

learning and development by investing 

in our staff through providing various 

means of learning, mentorship, 

specific need-based trainings and 

on-the-job training opportunities. For 

example, effective supervisory skills 

programmes were organised for our 

staff to develop management skills. 

Training and Development

Human Dimensional and Emotional 

Quotient (EQ) workshops were also 

organised for key management staff 

to understand their personality 

types and better manage staff. Team 

building exercises were conducted for 

management and executive-level staff 

to promote effective communication 

and teamwork. Quarterly plant 

tours at our NSL OilChem and NSL 

Chemical facilities also help staff 

assimilate with the business.

We believe the welfare and well-being 

of our staff are crucial for our business. 

We continue to provide annual health 

screenings to our staff across the 

group. We also organised the annual 

family day at the zoo, which saw an 

attendance of around 370 staff, family 

and friends. 

Through our NSL Sports and 

Recreation Club, activities are 

organised across the group to create 

opportunities for staff bonding and 

interaction across all subsidiaries. This 

year, we held activities ranging from 

lunchtime talks or events – cooking 

and art classes – to our weekly sports 

classes and events – body combat, 

badminton and Zumba.

Workplace Health and Safety

Workplace health and safety is 

crucial in our industry as it underpins 

how we operate, from planning to 

execution.

Safety &amp; Health committees at 

each subsidiary assess operational 

requirements and schedule staff to 

attend compulsory safety trainings, 

such as Occupational First Aid Course 

with automated external defibrillator, 

handling of chemicals, lifting and 

forklift operations. 

At NSL OilChem, we placed emphasis 

on road safety. Targeted driver safety 

training was conducted by the traffic 

police for our drivers. In addition,  

we engaged ComfortDelgro to 

conduct defensive training. This 

training involves a theory lesson 

followed by an evaluation of driver’s 

performance using in-vehicle sensors 

to identify safe, moderate and unsafe 

driving patterns. 

To ensure our readiness during an 

emergency, staff continue to be 

trained or refreshed in mandatory 

safety trainings required for Company 

Emergency Response Team (CERT). 

In addition, we also conducted an 

emergency preparedness talk for  

our operators, laboratory technicians 

and supervisors on fire response  

and terrorists. 

Our CERTs conducted regular drills 

and simulation activities at various 

facilities, including a simulation of 

a waste oil fire at Raffles Marina. 

We also increased our lagoon-side 

security measures at the marina to 

prevent any potential accidents. This 

includes both physical barriers and 

surveillance of open areas, as well as 

automation of security gates.

As integrity and respect are two of our 

core values, business ethics and trust 

guide our operations.

We continue to ensure staff awareness 

of our code of conduct. Employees 

are reminded of key messages, such 

as assessing conflicts of interest and 

corruption, as well as upholding our  

no gift policy during festive periods.

In 2018, we conducted a review 

of our disciplinary actions and 

procedures across all business 

units and implemented changes to 

ensure policies are consistent across 

the group. 

We continue to enforce a strict 

whistle-blowing policy. 

In 2018, we met our target of having 

no incident of corruption or legal 

actions for anti-competitive behaviour 

or monopoly practices. All incidents 

of whistle-blowing on suspected 

breach of code of conduct will be fully 

investigated and accordingly enforced.

Our Performance

• Maintain zero corruption

• Maintain zero anti-

competitive behaviour

• Ensure 100% of staff  

are aware of our code  

of conduct

Product Quality and  

Customer Satisfaction

As a market leader, we are committed to 

continuously check product and service 

quality, as well as customer satisfaction. 

We solicit formal and informal feedback 

from our customers through surveys to 

assess our service quality.

We embrace the challenges and 

opportunities presented by digital 

innovation across our businesses,  

using analytics and automation to 

improve efficiency.

At NSL OilChem Waste Management, 

tracking devices were installed on 

trailers and tanks in an expansion 

of the previously reported vehicle 

tracking system. This increases visibility 

and allows us to better optimise tank 

utilisation. Currently, we are looking 

into using vehicle tracking for precast 

delivery. NSL Fuel Management 

Services continues to improve fuel 

efficiency by adopting automated 

level monitoring in tanks to avoid 

the need for manual measurement. 

We initiated the digitisation of 

our administrative office activities 

and records. Moving ahead, we are 

targeting to include automation in 

tracking order status and completion, 

routing and invoicing to improve 

customer experience. 

Digital Innovation

Customer Service

This improves data accuracy and 

facilitates a centralised inventory 

management.

At Eastern Pretech, we implemented 

a Building Information Modelling 

(BIM) software to meet Building 

and Construction Authority (BCA) 

requirements at building sites. 

To date, we have completed the 

migration from AutoCAD to BIM 

software for up to 90% of projects.

Innovation is core to our business 

and allows us to ensure we are 

providing novel, high-quality products 

across our businesses. We work with 

customers on design and materials 

to meet their specific requirements. 

For example, we are developing 

high strength concrete to reduce 

the weight of precast concrete 

components to meet crane size 

requirements at construction sites. 

We are exploring new products, such 

as architectural concrete facade 

cladding, in anticipation of increasing 

market demand. 

As our customer satisfaction 

survey is conducted every two 

years, performance in 2018 

will be captured in our 2019 

survey and will be reported in 

our 2019 Sustainability Report 

in due course.

We initiated a project to improve 

efficiency and traceability of QC 

processes at our NSL OilChem 

business. Our new Laboratory 

Information Management (LIM) 

system seeks to improve reporting 

as well as keep track of chemical, 

manpower and equipment usage.
