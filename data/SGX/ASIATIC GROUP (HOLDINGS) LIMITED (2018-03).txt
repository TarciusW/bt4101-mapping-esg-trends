Board Statement 

 

 

 

The Board of Directors (the ”Board”) is pleased to present Asiatic Group (Holdings) Limited’s (and its 

subsidiaries, collectively known as the “Group” or “Asiatic”) inaugural sustainability report. As a group, 

we are committed to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders by upholding responsible practices 

across our operations.  

The Board recognises the importance of managing Environment, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) matters 

and considers these matters as part of the Group’s strategic formulation. We have been working closely 

with the management team to identify, manage, and monitor the matters that are relevant and material 

to our operations.  

Through this sustainability report, we intend to lay the foundation for a transparent reporting on our 

sustainability performance. We strive to build on this foundation and continuously seek opportunities to 

improve our performance and develop our sustainability management practices over the coming years.

About the Report 

This year marks the issuance of our inaugural Sustainability Report. We seek to establish the Group’s 

steadfast commitment towards sustainability and our stakeholders. The report summarises our approach 

and performance in managing material ESG matters for our business.  

Reporting Framework 

This report has been prepared with reference to Global Reporting Initiatives (“GRI”) standards. The GRI has 

been selected as the framework for reporting as it is internationally-recognised and provides a 

standardised approach for Asiatic to report on the material ESG matters. Reference has also been drawn 

from the Sustainability Reporting Guide of Practice Note 7F of the Catalist Rules in meeting the primary 

components as set out in Rule 711(B) of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) 

Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist. 

Reporting Scope 

The scope of this report encompasses our core business segments, namely energy operations in Cambodia 

and fire protection solutions in Singapore. For this year, we have considered the Group and the following 

subsidiaries’ operations as described in Table 1 in our scope of reporting, unless otherwise stated. We have 

adopted a progressive approach towards the inclusion of our operations for reporting and will consider 

expanding our scope as we mature in our sustainability journey.

Corporate Profile 

Our Business 

Our group has been listed on Catalist of SGX-ST since April 2003. We take pride in our reputation as an 

innovative engineering management specialist, responsible for the development of Energy, Controlled 

Power and Fire Protection Solutions. We operate in two niche business areas, namely, the planning, 

development &amp; provision of energy services, and the provision of total fire protection solutions. Our 

operations span across Cambodia, Singapore, and Malaysia, with headquarters based in Singapore.  

Figure 1. Our geographical presence 

 

Energy 

We are a service provider for industries and communities, with operations predominantly in Cambodia. 

Phnom Penh Power Plant and Sihanoukville Power Plant provide electricity to the national grid while PPSEZ 

Power Plant delivers electricity to the industrial factories and facilities located within the industrial park. 

In aggregate, these three operational power plants have an installed capacity comprising more than 45 

Megawatts (“MW”).

Our People 

At Asiatic, we attribute our success to our people. We continuously seek to promote and build an all-

inclusive, diverse, and collaborative environment to enhance work productivity and efficiency, which we 

believe will contribute to the growth of the Group.  

Comprising a total of 198 employees across our operations in Singapore and Cambodia, with more than 

60% of our workforce coming from our Cambodia’s operations, a significant portion of our employees are 

hired on permanent contract and full-time basis.  Asiatic has notably a higher proportion of male employees 

(84%) as compared to female employees (16%), due to the nature and field of business we are in which 

tends to attract more male applicants as opposed to female applicants. 

The Group remains committed to providing employment opportunities that are fair and meritocratic-based. 

We do not discriminate against any individual’s ethnicity, religion, age, or gender. We also maintain a strict 

no child and forced labour practice in our hiring process.

Our Sustainability Approach 

Sustainability Governance 

Our sustainability approach is driven by the directives and inputs from the Board. The Board sets the 

strategic direction for sustainability growth across the Group and is the core body responsible for the 

integration of sustainability principles across our operations. Involved in the formulation of sustainability 

policies and initiatives, are, the executive directors of energy and fire protection solution business. 

Together, they work collaboratively in driving key sustainability initiatives.  

The respective head of departments in the energy and fire protection solutions provides further support 

by monitoring the adherence and execution of all sustainability policies and practices on the working-level, 

which includes tracking the performance of the Group’s material matters.

Stakeholder Engagement 

Asiatic attaches great importance to open engagement with our key stakeholders. We understand that our 

stakeholders play a critical role in ensuring the sustainability of our business. We strive to address their 

evolving needs by providing accessible channels for feedbacks and interacting with them regularly. Our 

stakeholder engagement approach is summarised below.

Materiality Assessment 

Asiatic considers material sustainability matters as ESG matters that significantly impact the Group’s 

operations and key stakeholders. Together with core members who drive and oversee sustainability 

matters within the Group as illustrated in Figure 6 above, a materiality assessment workshop was 

conducted to identify and prioritise critical ESG matters based on their significance and relevance to our 

business, both from internal and external stakeholders’ perspectives. We worked closely with an 

independent consultant to conduct our first materiality assessment through a four-step approach as 

outlined below. 

Figure 7. Materiality assessment approach 

 

 

From our materiality assessment process, we have identified three key ESG matters as reflected in Figure 

8 below.

Regulatory 

Compliance 

Why is it important for us?  

At Asiatic, we recognise the importance of having strong corporate 

governance. It promotes the efficient allocation of resources in 

managing the Group’s risks and opportunities, protects our 

reputation as a business, and more importantly, deliver value that is 

sustainable to our stakeholders. All in all, while maintaining full 

compliance with the necessary laws and regulations in the countries 

we operate in.  

Any substantiated non-compliance cases could lead to detrimental 

impacts, both financially and reputationally to our business. As such, 

we stand by our commitment to uphold a high standard of corporate 

governance in line with the Code of Corporate Governance 2012 and 

Code of Corporate Governance 2018 for financial years commencing 

from 1 January 2019 onwards. We further seek to ensure that all 

relevant laws and regulations are met.  

Our detailed corporate governance practices can be found in the Corporate Governance Report in our 

FY2018 Annual Report. 

Our Approach 

Policy 

 

Our corporate governance framework provides a foundation on the Group’s 

corporate governance practices. 

 

The Quality Policy in our fire protection solution business embodied the 

commitment to always comply with relevant laws and regulations 

Commitments and 

Target 

We strive to always comply with all applicable socioeconomics and 

environmental regulation. The Group has a perpetual target of zero confirmed 

cases of non-compliance to regulatory requirements. 

Our Initiatives  

To achieve a high standard of corporate governance, we have in place our corporate governance 

framework, which comprises oversight by the Board and the various Board committees, the involvement 

of independent external auditors, as well as a set of robust internal controls and processes that are 

internally audited by an accredited external party. The audit review procedures conducted yearly include

Zero 

confirmed non-compliance cases 

 

 Achieved in 

FY2018

checks on compliance with appropriate legislation and regulations, and the management of all corporate 

risks identified. 

Further, our stance to maintain strong corporate governance is reflected through the Quality Policy as 

adhered to by our fire protection solution business segment. The Quality Policy was developed as part of 

the Group’s established Quality Management System (“QMS”) which is ISO 19001:2015 certified. Through 

our QMS, we ensure that our operations are in line with the applicable statutory and regulations and quality 

professional services are provided to our customers. 

The Group also has in place a whistle-blowing policy which provides a direct avenue for all internal and 

external stakeholders to raise concerns on all matters relating to misconduct, including actions of non-

compliance and improprieties in financial reporting, in writing to asiatic@asiatic.com.sg. All feedback 

received will be kept in confidence and handled directly by the audit committee, who will ensure that an 

independent and fair investigation is subsequently carried out with appropriate follow-up actions. 

All policies are reviewed annually by the management, and employees will be informed of any changes 

promptly. Our employees are expected to faithfully adhere to all ethical and legal requirements to preserve 

our group’s integrity and reputation. 

Our Performance 

For this reporting period, we are glad to share that were no confirmed cases of non-compliance, and there 

were no complaints received under our whistle-blowing policies.

Workforce Health and 

Safety 

Why is it important for us? 

The health and safety of our people are of utmost importance 

to Asiatic. We strive to keep a safe and healthy workplace for 

our employees, sub-contractors, and visitors. We believe that 

everyone has the right to work in a safe environment. 

The Group understand that any lapses in our safety 

performance will have adverse consequences to our employees 

and the reputation of our business. We take extensive 

precautionary measures and ensure that they are appropriately 

adhered to in our day-to-day operations. We are cognizant that 

management holds a fundamental responsibility in ensuring the 

health and safety of our people. 

 

Our Approach 

Policy 

 

Asiatic’s occupational health, safety and security policy sets out our 

commitment to preventing all work-related injuries and illness.  

 

Through this policy, we are committed to identify and prevent risks in our 

operations, implement appropriate safe work practices, and provide relevant 

training to our employees. 

Commitments and 

Target 

As a group, we have a perpetual target of zero work-related incidents and 

illnesses in our workplace. 

Our Initiatives 

At Asiatic, we prioritise prevention over cure. With this responsible conduct in mind, we have developed a 

risk management process with reference to Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) (Risk Management) 

Regulation1 and WSH Code of Practice2 to eliminate and reduce workplace hazards and risks. The risk 

management process outlines the necessary roles and responsibilities within an organisation and further, 

 

1 The Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulation is part of Singapore’s Workplace Safety and Health Act. 

2 The Code of Practice was developed and published by Workplace Safety and Health Council in collaboration with the Ministry of Manpower, 

Singapore. 

Our perpetual target is to have 

zero

provides guidance on how to identify hazards, evaluate risks, and implement mitigation measures to 

eliminate or control the risks identified. We have also established a risk management committee to oversee 

the implementation of the risk management procedures. Comprising of both managerial and senior staff-

level employees, the committee will carry out regular discussions and report to senior management, as 

required, on any significant findings and developments regarding workplace health and safety. The figure 

below summarises the flow of Asiatic’s risk management process. 

Figure 9. Asiatic’s risk management process 

 

 

On an annual basis, Asiatic further undergoes an external audit in verifying that Asiatic has met satisfactory 

workplace health and safety outcomes in entitling them for BizSafe recognition. Where gaps have been 

identified, we seek to rectify and monitor for progressive improvements to the performance over a period 

of time. As a testament to our ongoing efforts, Asiatic has managed to attain several certifications detailed 

in Table below which demonstrate our commitment in providing a safe workplace for our people.

Furthermore, we provide risk management-related training and certification for select employee at least 

once every two years who would then be equipped to share with others the relevant skills and expertise to 

excel in their roles assigned and to mitigate the occurrences of work-related injuries. Fire drills and 

evacuation exercises are also carried out to instill increased alertness and emergency preparedness in all 

our employees. On the other hand, it provides a refresher on the safety practices, precaution measures, 

and emergency exit routes that employees are required to be aware of. 

Creating a safe and healthy work environment is a shared responsibility. At Asiatic, employees are 

encouraged to be actively involved in preventing any work-related injuries and illness. We expect 

employees to maintain a clean and orderly work area, report any incidents, participate in safety 

improvement activities, and work with our contractors to ensure the implementation of the safety 

management system among others. 

Our Performance 

As a testament to our effort in creating a safe and healthy work environment for all employees, we 

managed to achieve zero fatalities, injuries, and occupational illness for FY2018. Additionally, we track 

the absentee rate of our employees as an indicator of our workers’ wellness and health. The details of the 

absentee rate for operations in both Singapore and Cambodia for this reporting period are respectively 

presented in the figure below.

Energy Efficient Operation 

and Greenhouse Gas 

(“GHG”) Emissions 

Why is it important for us? 

With the ratification of the Paris Agreement3, the risks and impacts of 

climate change are increasingly becoming more apparent. Nations and 

corporates alike are aware of the urgency to implement mitigation 

measures in addressing the impacts their business’ activities pose to the 

environment and communities in which they operate in.  

Given that our energy business is primarily based on the usage of fossil 

fuel, we are mindful of the environmental impacts it brings. Whilst we 

acknowledge the challenge for our business to address this matter, we 

will strive to continue providing a stable and reliable supply of energy to 

our customers as demand arises4. For this material ESG matter and 

reporting period, we have included our energy operations in Cambodia. 

We will consider expanding our scope to include other operations as we 

mature in our sustainability reporting journey. 

Our Approach 

Policy 

 

We believe in investing in good environmental housekeeping practices to limit 

our environmental footprint and ensure that we stay compliant with all 

relevant regulations and laws at countries we operate in. 

 

Commitments and 

Target 

We are committed to managing our environmental footprint whilst ensuring 

a stable supply of electricity to meet the needs of the communities we serve. 

 

We aim to conduct a thorough maintenance regime for all engines at our 

power plants at least once a year. 

 

Our Initiatives 

At all our power plants, we pro-actively conduct internal inspections and maintenance of the equipment on 

a regular basis, on top of our once yearly thorough maintenance regime of each engine to ensure that they 

are in optimal condition, and ready for operation on-demand throughout the year. Through our inspections, 

 

3 The Paris Agreement central aim is to limit global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius by end of the century. For more information, please 

refer to: https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/what-is-the-paris-agreement 

4 Our power plants in Cambodia are generally required to operate during periods of power outage or low power supply from the grid. As 

generation is on an on-demand basis and not continuous, this thus pose a limiting factor in setting a quantitative target to have substantial 

reduction in carbon intensity. 

 

Our perpetual target is to 

conduct a thorough 

maintenance 

regime for all engines at 

our power plants at least 

once a year. 

Achieved in 

FY2018 

 






19 

 

the respective teams seek to identify any nonconformity to regulatory specifications and deficient areas 

for improvement which helps prevent any unnecessary fluctuations in our energy consumption usage as 

well as ensure safe and efficient operations. 

Our Performance 

For FY2018, we consumed 110,348 gigajoules (“GJ”) of direct energy and 4,706 GJ of indirect energy, 

used to generate approximately 10.49 Gigawatt-hour (“GWh”) of electricity that was sold during the year. 

Direct energy refers to the primary source of energy consumption in our operations, that is heavy fuel oil, 

whereas indirect energy is the electricity purchased from external suppliers. 

Correspondingly, direct carbon emissions which makes up more than 90% of our power plants’ operations 

account for the largest proportion of our GHG emissions, and the remaining pertains to indirect carbon 

emissions. Measured with reference to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) Guidelines5, 

our total carbon emissions for the year amounted to 9,362 metric ton of carbon dioxide (“tCO2”) and 

additionally, carbon emissions intensity amounted to 0.89 tCO2/MWh. 

We have also achieved our goal in FY2018 in carrying out the maintenance regime for all engines at our 

power plants. We will continue to review and refine our practices as we endeavour to better manage the 

energy consumption and GHG emissions levels attributed to our business’ operations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 Carbon emissions and carbon intensity are calculated with reference to 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. 

Case Study 

The waste-to-energy power plant in Malaysia  

 

Malaysia is the second largest palm oil producer in the world 

after Indonesia. With a significant area of palm oil 

operations, the country produced a massive number of 

empty fruit bunches to be converted into electricity.  

 

The Group captures this opportunity by entering into a joint-

venture agreement with Maju Intan Biomass Power Plant in 

Teluk Intan, Perak, Malaysia. This biomass power plant is 

situated near more than 20 palm oil processors. It generates 

approximately 12.5MW of electricity and has been 

synchronised to supply the national grid since 2014.
