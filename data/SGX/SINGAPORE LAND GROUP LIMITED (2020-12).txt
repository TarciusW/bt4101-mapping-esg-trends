2020 (“SR2020”) covers ESG performance data from 

our core business operations in Singapore, including 

commercial offices, retail properties, development 

projects, information technology business and head

OUR SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT

BOARD STATEMENT

Singland’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) is committed 

to building a sustainable business that positively 

impacts the environment and society. The Board, 

supported by the Sustainability Steering Committee 

(“SSC”), considers sustainability issues as part of its 

strategic business plans, determines the material ESG 

factors, and oversees the management and monitoring 

of material sustainability issues through regular reviews 

of performance indicators. The Board also approves the 

Group’s annual sustainability reports. 

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

Singland’s Board has overall responsibility for managing 

the Group’s sustainability issues, including sustainability 

reporting. It has oversight of the identification, 

management and implementation of material ESG 

factors through the Sustainability Steering Committee 

(“SSC”). The SSC is supported by the Sustainability 

Working Committee (“SWC”), which helps define and 

prioritise sustainability topics and establish performance 

targets. The SSC, chaired by the CEO, is responsible 

for implementing Singland’s sustainability strategy 

and programmes. With the retirement of the CEO in 

September 2020, the SSC is now chaired by the COO. 

The Board has direct oversight over the SSC through the 

Audit Committee (“AC”). The SWC works with various 

business units and functions to collect and validate 

performance data for reporting.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The Board has the responsibility to ensure Management 

maintains and reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 

risk management and internal controls systems. Our 

group-level risk management system also covers 

sustainability risks, including environmental risk, climate 

change risk and compliance risk. 

This risk management system is steered by the Risk 

Management Committee (“RMC”), which comprises 

the President/CEO, COO and the respective Heads of 

Department of the Group. With the retirement of the 

CEO in September 2020, the RMC is now chaired by the 

COO.

We 

apply 

the 

precautionary 

principle 

in 

risk 

management and proactively take measures to 

mitigate our business operations’ potentially adverse 

environmental impacts. As part of our Occupational 

Health and Safety (“OHS”) management system, we 

maintain a risk register that describes the potential OHS 

risks present within the organisational activities. Our 

approach is to promote a risk-aware culture to reduce 

workplace incidents.

As we advance our sustainability strategy, we are 

committed to evaluating and understanding climate 

change’s financial risks using the TCFD framework.

CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS

Our plans include assessing climate-related risks and 

opportunities and establishing goals and targets 

for addressing climate-related issues. In line with its 

sustainability responsibilities, the Board will continue to 

have direct oversight of climate-related issues, including 

monitoring and overseeing progress against goals and 

targets for addressing climate-related issues. 

The SSC is responsible for setting ESG targets, including 

greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. 

We already disclose our greenhouse gas emissions and 

energy consumption against targets each year in our 

sustainability report.

As we advance our sustainability strategy, we are 

committed to evaluating and understanding climate 

change’s financial risks using the TCFD framework.

THE BOARD DIVERSITY

The Board’s Nomination Committee seeks to ensure 

that the Board is composed of an appropriate balance 

and diversity of age, race, skills, experience, and gender. 

Singland welcomed a new female director to Singland’s 

10-member Board in 2020.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Singland reports its corporate governance structure, 

policies and practices in detail in its Annual Report 

following the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 

(“2018 Code”) and accompanying Practice Guidance 

issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore 

(“MAS”). For more information on Singland’s corporate 

governance, please refer to UIC’s Annual Report 2020 

at http://uic.com.sg/investor-relations/annual-report/.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Non-compliance with laws and regulations can 

adversely 

affect 

Singland’s 

business 

operations, 

financial performance, and reputation. Singland’s policy 

is to conduct its business with integrity and comply with 

applicable laws. 

We have put in place mechanisms to stay abreast of 

the latest regulatory developments and provide the 

necessary training to relevant employees. To promote 

a culture of compliance and accountability, we have 

adopted a group-wide Code of Conduct, Whistle-

Blowing Policy, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy 

and Conflict of Interest and Insider Trading Policy.

In 2020, there were no incidences of regulatory non-

compliance with socio-economic or environmental 

regulations.

ANTI-BRIBERY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

Singland takes a zero-tolerance position against all forms 

of corruption, including bribery, extortion, fraud and 

money laundering. Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 

(“ABC”) policy prohibits bribery and corruption in all 

forms. Included in the Company’s Code of Conduct, 

the ABC policy requires all employees to adhere to the 

highest ethical conduct standards. Besides employees, 

we communicate the ABC policy to our suppliers, 

contractors, and business partners. Employees are also 

required to declare any conflict of interest during their 

employment with Singland.

The Company’s RMC has oversight over fraud and 

corruption 

risk 

management. 

Adequate 

internal 

controls have been established at an operational level 

to reduce fraud and corruption risks.

In 2020, there were no confirmed legal cases of 

corruption brought against Singland or its employees.

ANTI-COMPETITION

At Singland, we are committed to promoting fair 

competition. We comply with Singapore’s Competition 

Act and prohibit anti-competitive conduct. There were 

no legal actions for anti-competitive behaviour, anti-

trust, and monopoly practices against Singland in the 

reported period.

WHISTLE-BLOWING POLICY

Our Whistle-blowing Policy provides a safe and 

confidential 

channel 

for 

our 

employees 

and 

business partners to raise their concerns to senior 

management. All whistle-blowing reports are handled 

with confidentiality, and the policy protects the 

whistleblowers from retaliation. All whistle-blowing cases 

received through designated channels are referred to 

the Audit Committee for follow up action. 

The “Whistle-blowing Policy” is publicly available on 

the company’s corporate website at www.uic.com.sg/

whistle-blowing-policy. 

ETHICAL MARKETING

As a responsible property developer, we strive to help our 

customers make informed decisions by providing them 

with all material information related to our products and 

services.

Singland adheres to the Singapore Code of Advertising 

Practice and relevant applicable rules and regulations 

to support high ethical standards in advertising. We 

require our employees to abide by the principles of 

ethical marketing in selling and leasing activities. 

In 2020, there were no incidents of non-compliance 

concerning our marketing practices.

EMPLOYEE TRAINING

All new employees undergo an orientation programme 

which covers the Code of Conduct, Whistle-Blowing 

policy and procedures, the Anti Bribery and Corruption 

Policy, the Anti-Competition policy, data protection and 

ethical marketing practices. 

PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION

Singland is committed to safeguarding customer 

privacy and personal data. We comply with Singapore’s 

Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) and guidelines 

issued by the Personal Data Protection Commission 

(“PDPC”) to manage and protect personal information 

relating to our customers, shareholders, prospects, 

employees and business partners. Our Personal Data 

Protection Policy requires our employees to ensure 

personal data is only collected, used, stored, and 

disposed of according to the PDPA and the relevant 

data privacy laws and guidelines. 

In 2019, the company received four complaints from 

the PDPC, two of which submitted by visitors to one of 

our commercial buildings concerned the handling 

of personal data by outsourced security personnel , 

following the PDPC’s implementation of the new advisory 

guidelines in respect of NRIC and other national 

identification numbers on 1 September 2019. The 

company explained to PDPC the lapses and remedial 

actions taken by its outsourced security and no further 

queries were received from PDPC. The remaining two 

cases involving handling of personal data by our staff 

have been officially closed following the company’s 

confirmation that all necessary measures have been 

taken to ensure compliance with PDPA and PDPC 

guidelines.

Consequently, the company had stepped up its efforts 

to comply with the PDPA and PDPC guidelines through 

various initiatives by December 2019, including:

a) Comprehensive PDPA training of the Group’s 

Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and related data 

protection representatives of relevant business units;

b) Raising awareness of nine PDPA principles and 

guidelines among company’s employees through 

internal campaigns;

c) Reviewing and establishment of internal workflows 

and procedures concerning the collection, usage, 

storage and disposal of personal data, to comply 

with the PDPA and PDPC guidelines.

In 2020, there were no incidents of non-compliance with 

Singapore’s PDPA.

The Company’s “Personal Data Protection Policy” is 

available on our corporate website at www.uic.com.

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

In a year like no other, we embarked on a transformational 

journey.

The Government unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 

2030 to advance Singapore’s national agenda on 

sustainable development over the next 10 years. This 

plan demonstrates the determination, ambition and 

resilience of our nation state.

As part of a group-wide rebranding, United Industrial 

Corporation Limited was renamed Singapore Land 

Group Limited in April 2021. This initiative stems from 

acknowledging the history and brand equity associated 

with the name and seeks to align both internal and 

external stakeholders to a common purpose and brand 

identity. In line with this brand refresh, we are also striving 

towards becoming a more responsible business, and 

place greater emphasis on key ESG factors that will 

positively impact our stakeholders.

For this Sustainability Report 2020, we have started 

aligning the disclosures with the SASB Real Estate 

Sustainability Accounting Standard and the TCFD 

recommendations. This is in addition to the integration 

of the United Nations SDGs in our materiality review.

We secured our first green and sustainability-linked 

loans totaling $300 million in March 2021. As a major 

developer and manager of real estate, we strongly 

believe that the adoption of green financing represents 

an important step towards integrating sustainability into 

our future business strategy and operations. Proceeds 

from this green loan go towards a major upgrading of 

Singapore Land Tower which achieved the Building and 

Construction Authority (“BCA”)’s Green Mark GoldPlus 

certification in 2020.

I am pleased to share that we are still on target to have 

all our commercial properties achieve BCA’s Green 

Mark certification by 2030, through the adoption of 

environmentally friendly features and upgrading of 

the buildings’ infrastructure. This is aligned with the 

Singapore Green Plan 2030, to green 80% of all buildings 

in Singapore.

ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS

There is an old saying that if you want to go fast, go 

alone. If you want to go far, go together. However, when 

it comes to progressing our ESG goals, we must act fast 

and aim far.

We are very proud of the long-standing relationships that 

we have cultivated with many of our tenants, and we are 

prepared to listen, engage and collaborate with them 

to fulfil our ESG goals. In 2020, we launched a campaign 

to raise awareness of saving water and electricity in the 

workplace and encouraged participation from them.

As we emerge from the disruptions caused by the 

pandemic, 

such 

efforts 

to 

promote 

sustainable 

practices are essential. We have plans to ramp up such 

stakeholder engagement initiatives in the coming years. 

We also remain committed to helping those who 

are less fortunate and those who may be severely 

impacted by the pandemic through various Corporate 

Social Responsibility (“CSR”) programs. We channeled 

our resources towards social enterprises like Project 

Dignity and SDI Academy, who were able to multiply 

our contribution towards their projects and programs to 

help many others.

The development and well-being of our employees 

cannot be overstated. As we adopted extensive use of 

technology in our daily work, our employee engagement 

programs also had to adapt to new normal. We will 

continue to utilize these platforms to foster strong team 

spirit and enhance knowledge sharing opportunities 

particularly in the area of environmental and social 

sustainability.

A COMMON PURPOSE

We are cognisant that climate change and social 

impact are long-standing issues that cannot be solved 

through the efforts of a single company but we hope 

to do our part. We will continue to set goals to strive for 

and reaffirm our commitment to doing the right thing by 

people and the planet.

On behalf of the Board of Directors and the management 

team, I would like to thank all our stakeholders and 

investors for their support and contribution to our 

progress to push this agenda forward.

MATERIALITY

We remain focused on managing our most important 

sustainability 

topics 

identified 

through 

periodic 

materiality 

assessment. 

In 

assessing 

materiality, 

we consider our business operations’ economic, 

environmental and social impact, our key stakeholders’ 

views and the megatrends in sustainability relevant 

to our sector. We also refer to GRI’s Construction and 

Real Estate Sector Disclosures to select the appropriate 

material disclosures. Starting from this report, we have 

also adopted SASB’s Real Estate Accounting Standard 

to have a sharper focus on financially material ESG 

issues to serve investors’ information needs.

We have continued to build on the first materiality 

assessment conducted in 2017 through annual 

reviews. In 2020, the review process comprised an 

internal stakeholder engagement survey to seek 

employees’ views on prioritising our material topics and 

benchmarking peer reports. Based on the latest insight, 

except for employee turnover, we have determined that 

the material factors reported in our SR2019 remain valid. 

Though not considered material, we have continued to 

disclose employee turnover.

Singland is committed to supporting the transition 

to a low-carbon economy as envisioned by the Paris 

Agreement, the UN SDGs and the Singapore Green 

Plan. We aspire to steer our business towards net zero-

emissions by making our buildings and projects efficient 

and resilient.

The 

buildings 

and 

construction 

sector 

has 

a 

complex environmental footprint, including materials, 

greenhouse gas emissions and water. Our approach is 

to integrate sustainability in the design and construction 

to the operation and maintenance of our buildings and 

development projects. Our policies aim to minimise the 

impact of our operations on the environment. 

We have recognised energy consumption, carbon 

dioxide emissions and water use as our material 

environmental impacts. Our efforts focus on exploring 

ways to enhance the energy and water efficiencies of 

our buildings. We have established targets to measure 

and report our progress. 

This 

report 

presents 

Singland’s 

environmental 

performance relating to our corporate office, retail and 

commercial office buildings, development projects, and 

information technology business.

ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

We have adopted a robust Environmental Management 

System (“EMS”) to continuously improve our buildings’ 

performance. We are also making progress toward 

adopting international environmental management 

system standards such as ISO 14001. West Mall has 

already received ISO 14001:2015 (Property and Facility 

Management for Shopping Mall) certification for its 

EMS. 

CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions from buildings’ 

operation account for an estimated 28% of total 

global energy-related CO2 emissions. The buildings 

sector specifically faces physical risks from climate 

change, such as direct damage to assets and financial 

implications from water stress, extreme weather and an 

increase in global temperatures. Decarbonising existing 

and future global building stock is crucial to mitigating 

climate change risks.

In general terms, our potential climate-related risks 

include transition risks emerging from a range of issues, 

including but not limited to lost business opportunity, 

regulatory exposure, more stringent building design 

rules, carbon pricing and taxes, water stress, the physical 

risk to our assets, employee health and safety, and 

reputation risk. Simultaneously, there are opportunities 

to meet the growing demand for green office and retail 

spaces by sustainability-conscious tenants, reduced 

operating cost resulting from energy-efficient and water-

conserving buildings and enhanced access to green 

finance.

Our target of transitioning all the buildings we own 

to a BCA Green Mark Certification by 2030 and our 

commitment to meet at least the BCA Green Mark Gold 

for each new development will help us mitigate some 

short-term and long-term climate-related risks. 

Our plans include an in-depth study of climate-related 

risks and opportunities for our business, including a 

climate-related scenario analysis within two years. The 

insight gained from the climate risk assessment will help 

us align our governance, strategy, risk management 

and metrics and targets to support the Group’s 

transition to lower-carbon operations. The assessment 

will help us develop a process for managing climate-

related risks and set a science-based target for reducing 

greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2021, the government unveiled the Singapore Green 

Plan 2030, of which one key focus is combating climate 

change through sustainable living. Earlier in 2018, 

Singland made the ‘Singapore Climate Action Pledge’ 

to support the Year of Climate Action declared by 

the then Singapore’s Ministry of the Environment and 

Water Resources. As part of our climate action pledge, 

six out of nine buildings have completed at least 50% 

replacement of LED luminaires at common areas. The 

replacement of LED luminaries contributes to achieving 

Green Mark certification for all our buildings by 2030, 

and helps the Company play its part in supporting the 

Singapore Green Plan 2030. 

As part of Singland’s efforts to raise awareness about 

climate change, a number of our buildings including 

Clifford Centre, Singapore Land Tower and Marina 

Square switched off their façade and non-essential 

lights during Earth Hour 2020.

GHG EMISSIONS

At the operational level, driving energy efficiency during 

construction and building management remains 

our core priority to limit our business’s carbon dioxide 

emissions. We track and report Scope-1 and Scope-2 

CO2 emissions. Our Scope 1 emissions result from diesel 

consumed at our development project sites, petrol 

consumption in vehicles, and diesel and refrigerants 

used in buildings. Our Scope 2 emissions are from 

electricity use across our corporate office, buildings 

(retail and commercial office), development projects 

and information technology business.

In 2020, the total GHG emissions for commercial office 

and retail buildings were 25,551 tonnes of CO2 with a 

GHG emissions intensity of 56.4kg CO2e/m2.

For buildings, Scope 2 emissions account 99.7% of total 

GHG emissions.

The Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity for our commercial 

office and retail buildings in 2020 was 56.2kg CO2/m2.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY

The buildings and construction sector accounted for 

38% of total global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2019, 

according to the 2020 Global Status Report for Buildings 

and Construction. Electricity continues to be the primary 

source of energy consumed by buildings representing 

nearly 55% of global electricity consumption.

Our approach is to pursue energy efficiency measures 

such as passive and low-energy designs to minimise 

energy intensity from the commercial office and retail 

properties we manage. Our BCA Green Mark certified 

buildings in Singapore promote energy efficiency 

through sustainable design and operational practices. 

In 2020, West Mall completed the replacement of 

35 air handling units (“AHUs”) with new AHUs fitted 

with electronically commutated (“EC”) fans. The 

replacement has improved West Mall’s indoor air 

quality, minimized air conditioning system downtime 

and optimised energy usage for the mall.

The total energy (electricity) consumed in both retail 

and commercial office buildings was 62,335MWh, with 

a building energy intensity of 138kWh/m2. 

Our target is to reduce our commercial office buildings’ 

electricity intensity by 8% by 2025, using 2015 as the 

base year. We target to maintain the electricity intensity 

of our commercial office buildings at 149 kWh/m2 in 

2021.

Energy consumption across our portfolio decreased in 

2020 due to a decline in shoppers, tenants and visitors to 

our malls and commercial offices during the COVID-19 

Circuit Breaker and beyond.

ELECTRICITY SAVING CAMPAIGN

As part of Singland’s sustainability efforts, electricity-

saving decals were printed for distribution to all tenants’ 

office premises. All building managers from the SWC 

assisted with the decal distribution to tenants. These 

decals were applied near light switches to remind users 

to switch off lights when not in use.

2020, Singland embarked on a campaign to encourage 

all tenants, visitors and shoppers in our buildings to 

conserve water and electricity.

Electricity- and water-saving decals were printed for 

tenants’ premises, and our Sustainability Working 

Committee’s (SWC) building managers took charge of 

the distribution.

Water-saving decals were also applied in common 

pantries and in restrooms to remind users to practice 

water-saving habits.





SINGLAND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

WATER EFFICIENCY

Water scarcity and water stress have become global 

concerns leading to calls for water efficiency and 

conservation. Singapore is vulnerable to water stress 

due to the lack of natural freshwater resources. 

In our commercial office and retail buildings, water use 

includes building maintenance, toilet flushing, sanitary 

faucets, washing and cleaning floors, cooling towers, 

and HVAC systems. In our development projects, water 

is used for building construction. Our entire water supply 

in Singapore is from the public utility.

We are committed to reducing water use intensity in 

our buildings and construction. In 2020, SGX Centre 

conducted renovations for the building’s restrooms 

and upgraded sanitary fittings like basin taps, bib taps 

and urinal flush valves to the 3-ticks water saving label, 

and was awarded the Water Efficient Building (“WEB”) 

Certification by the Public Utilities Board (“PUB”). Across 

Singland’s portfolio, installation of water-efficient taps 

and auto sensors and flush valves also contributes to 

our efforts to promote water-efficiency. Our buildings’ 

maintenance teams perform regular checks of the 

water systems to prevent wastage due to water leakage.

In 2020, the total water consumption in retail and 

commercial office buildings was 364 megalitres, with a 

building water intensity of 0.80 m3/m2. The total water 

consumption included 7.99 megalitres of NEWater, 

Singapore’s high-grade reclaimed water. Supplied 

by the public utility PUB, NEWater is being used in UIC 

Building mainly for air-conditioning chillers.

Water consumption intensity across our portfolio 

decreased in 2020 due to a decline in shoppers, 

tenants and visitors to our malls and commercial offices 

during the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker and beyond. While 

cleaning of common areas was stepped up, we have 

still achieved a reduced water intensity across our 

portfolio in 2020 compared to 2019.

Our target is to achieve a water intensity of 1.14 m3/m2 

for all our commercial office and retail buildings by 

2025. In line with this, we have a water intensity target of 

1.165 m3/m2 for 2021.

WATER SAVING CAMPAIGN

Singland also embarked on a Save Water Campaign in 

2020, printing water saving decals for our commercial 

office and retail buildings’ restrooms to remind users to 

save water. All building managers from the SWC assisted 

in the decal distribution. The decals were applied in all 

toilets and at common pantries.

WASTEWATER

Wastewater produced in our buildings is discharged 

into the municipal drainage system for centralised 

sewage treatment. At our development sites, we work 

closely with our contractors to manage and monitor 

construction wastewater quality and the required 

treatment before discharge into the drainage system.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

We are committed to minimising waste in our operations. 

Waste is primarily produced in our value chain involving 

tenants, visitors and contractors. Almost all of the waste 

generated at our buildings and development projects 

is non-hazardous. We ensure all waste is disposed of by 

licensed waste management companies according to 

local regulations. 

We have implemented waste management procedures 

at our retail and commercial office buildings to 

collect, store, and dispose of waste. Our efforts include 

awareness campaigns and engagement with our 

tenants for reducing waste at our premises. 

In our development projects, waste is generated by 

contractors, which primarily includes construction and 

demolition waste. We require all main contractors to have 

an ISO 14001 certified environmental management 

system covering waste management measures.

While we currently do not report waste management 

data, we are on track to establishing a general waste 

management reporting system. With more accurate 

reporting, we strive to engage our retail and office 

tenants in active waste reduction and recycling. 

Singland’s commercial office and retail properties 

participated in Starhub’s RENEW e-waste collection 

programme in 2020. In total, 2,609kg of e-waste was 

collected for recycling in 2020. Singland continues to 

support national e-waste collection programmes in 

Singapore.

In line with the National Environment Agency (“NEA”)’s 

push towards a zero waste nation, West Mall completed 

the commissioning of an on-site food waste digester in 

October 2020 to enable tenants to segregate and treat 

food waste on-site. A total of 48.9 tonnes of food waste 

was processed in 2020.







ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

We take regulatory compliance seriously. Compliance 

with the applicable environmental health and safety 

regulations throughout our operations is crucial for 

our reputation and uninterrupted business operation. 

In development projects, we require our contractors to 

comply with the relevant rules and regulations relating 

to environmental issues such as noise, vector control 

and wastewater discharge.

In 2020, there were no reportable incidents of significant 

non-compliance with environmental laws.

HEALTH AND SAFETY 

Ensuring our people’s health and safety in our buildings 

and project sites is an integral part of our corporate 

responsibility. We also recognise that unfortunate 

mishaps within our properties and development 

projects can affect business continuity and corporate 

reputation. Our target is to have a zero-accident 

workplace. To this end, we are committed to promoting 

a culture of workplace safety and health throughout 

our business operations.

We have implemented OHS policies and management 

systems to protect our employees, tenants, contractors, 

vendors, customers, guests, visitors to our buildings, 

and workers at our development sites. Singland’s 

senior management regularly reviews the health and 

safety policies, performance and practices across our 

businesses. Our OHS teams periodically review and 

evaluate our operations and health and safety systems 

and conduct annual audits on our properties to ensure 

compliance with legal requirements.

We have established OHS targets and track and report 

performance against these targets. 

In Singapore, we follow bizSAFE, a five-step national 

programme to help companies build up capabilities 

in addressing workplace safety, health and security. 

Marina Square and UIC Technologies have obtained 

the bizSAFE Level 3 certification, and West Mall’s bizSAFE 

certification is currently in progress. For UIC Building, our 

facility management services provider has attained 

bizSAFE Level Star, the highest level achievable for 

certification by bizSAFE.

BUILDINGS

The health and safety of the tenants and visitors to 

the buildings we manage are our top priorities. With 

the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and raising 

of Singapore’s Disease Outbreak Response System 

Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, Singland’s 

Building Management Services and retail operations 

teams activated the Company’s Pandemic Response 

Plan comprising:

1. Implementation of thermal imaging cameras for 

temperature screening of tenants and shoppers/ 

visitors 

2. Limiting of access points into all buildings for effective 

crowd control

3. Safe Entry registration and Health Declaration prior 

to entry into Singland’s office buildings and retail 

malls

4. Placement of safe distancing markers at lobby 

receptions, within lift carriages and other appropriate 

areas

5. Application of antimicrobial coating at high human 

touch points, e.g. lift buttons and lift lobbies

6. Provision of hand sanitisers at high human traffic 

stoppage points, e.g. main lobbies of office buildings, 

concierge areas, central atrium of retail malls

7. Stepped-up cleaning of common areas

Clifford Centre also installed permanent Ultra Violet-C 

(UVC) emitters within the building’s air-conditioning 

system for disinfection of any accumulated mould, virus 

and bacteria growth to enhance ventilation hygiene 

levels for tenants and visitors.

In addition to the above, we have implemented a 

comprehensive set of measures, guidelines, systems 

and procedures to keep people safe in our buildings. 

Also, we have set-up Emergency Response Teams to 

deal with any safety or health emergencies.

Our fire safety measures include modern fire control 

equipment, regular fire drills, awareness campaigns, 

standard operating procedures and training for our 

building management employees and occupants 

to ensure an orderly response to fire emergencies. We 

have implemented a rigorous regime of preventive 

maintenance and regular inspections of our buildings’ 

lifts and escalators for safe operation.

CORPORATE OFFICE COVID-19 MEASURES

With 

the 

emergence 

of 

the 

COVID-19 

pandemic, ensuring the health and wellbeing 

of our employees and maintaining the highest 

cleanliness and hygiene levels in the buildings has 

become ever more critical. A Safe Management 

System and appropriate standard operating 

procedures (“SOP”) were set up to ensure 

Singland’s workplaces remain safe as employees 

were allowed to return to the office.

As part of Safe Management System SOPs, 

a 

Safe 

Management 

Taskforce 

comprising 

key management staff of the Company was 

established. Their responsibilities are to:

• Set the direction for safe management 

measures 

within 

Singland 

in 

line 

with 

government advisories

• Take decisions on Company guidelines with 

regard the COVID-19 pandemic situation

• Review any non-compliance and corrective 

action 

plans 

highlighted 

by 

the 

Safe 

Management Committee.

As part of Safe Management System SOPs, a Safe 

Management Committee comprising employees 

from Singland’s various office locations was 

formed. Their responsibilities are to:

• Identify potential safe management risks and 

implement safe management measures in the 

workplace

• Communicate potential risks to employees

• Escalate 

cases 

of 

non-compliance 

with 

Safe Management System SOPs to the Safe 

Management Taskforce

• Take 

corrective 

action 

to 

remedy 

non-

compliance. 

OHS PERFORMANCE

We regularly monitor the safety performance of our buildings. In 2020, there were no fatalities and no cases of 

occupational diseases. There were two non-fatal injuries among the employees, and a contractor reported one 

incident. There were five cases of injuries involving the public, tenants and visitors at the buildings. 

Please refer to Sustainability Performance Data on page 34 for more details.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

Accidents and mishaps are recognised safety hazards 

in the building construction sector globally. We work 

closely with our contractors to ensure stringent health 

and safety measures at our development project 

sites. We have developed comprehensive policies 

and procedures to ensure health and safety at our 

development projects under construction.

We require all main contractors to hold the OHSAS 

18001 or equivalent certification to ensure a robust 

occupational health and safety management system. 

We engage our contractors through weekly meetings 

where safety reports, safety challenges and preventive 

actions are reviewed and discussed.

We engage our contractors and sub-contractors by 

reviewing and simplifying the work processes to reduce 

or eliminate all safety issues on site.

Our development sites undergo external safety audits 

twice yearly, and the auditor’s reports are reviewed and 

submitted to the Ministry of Manpower.

We had only one active development project in 2020. 

There were no fatal injuries during the year. However, 

there was one non-fatal injury at the project site that 

resulted in 118 lost man days. The total number of hours 

worked in the year was 725,832. The work-related injury 

rate or formerly reported as Accident Frequency Rate 

(AFR) was 1.4.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

In 2020, Singland had no incidents of non-compliance 

with laws, codes and regulations concerning health 

and safety at buildings and development projects.

Please refer to Sustainability Performance Data on page 

34 for more details.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE QUALITY 

Singland is a diversified real estate company with a 

business model that focuses on developing high-quality, 

efficient and resilient retail, commercial office and 

residential properties. We take a life-cycle approach 

to embed quality and safety through all stages of our 

buildings and development projects. 

Quality standards and sustainability guidelines are 

carefully incorporated, starting from the planning and 

design stage to construction and building operation 

and management. High standards of architectural 

design and workmanship on structural, electrical and 

mechanical works remain central to our buildings and 

projects. Our buildings and projects are designed to 

provide comfort and convenience to residents, tenants, 

shoppers and visitors.

We are focused on providing best in class customer 

service to our tenants in the operation and management 

of our retail and commercial office buildings. We are 

committed to delivering high levels of customer service 

and addressing complaints satisfactorily. We constantly 

seek feedback from our tenants to understand their 

needs and expectations.

Our new development projects follow BCA’s Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS). A score-based 

rating system, CONQUAS serves as a national standard for assessing the quality of building projects.

BUILDINGS

Singland has committed to achieving Singapore’s BCA Green Mark for all existing retail 

and commercial office buildings by 2030. Our target for all new development projects is to 

achieve a minimum Green Mark Gold certification.

The BCA Green Mark is a green building rating system established by BCA to evaluate 

a building for its environmental impact and performance. BCA Green Mark certified 

properties include sustainability features such as climate-responsive designs, energy and 

water efficiency, sustainable construction materials, efficient waste management systems 

and good indoor air quality.

In addition to the above, Clifford Centre completed upgrading works for two of the building’s passenger lifts and 

three sets of escalators in 2020 to improve tenants’ and visitors’ experience in the building.

The following list details the BCA Green Mark certified buildings under the Singland group:

In addition, tenants are one of the Company’s key 

stakeholders, and we are focused on journeying with 

all our retail and commercial office tenants to tide 

over the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 

pandemic. In 2020, Singland provided over S$32 million 

in rental relief to tenants, which included passing on of 

property tax rebates and cash grant from the Singapore 

government. We also worked closely with tenants 

and offered flexibility in rental payments and lease 

restructuring for tenants who faced severe operational 

and cash flow issues.

CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

We are equally mindful of the safety and health of 

our home buyers, tenants and their employees, and 

visitors and shoppers. Our buildings’ and projects’ 

designs carefully consider the safety and health of all 

occupants and users.

We also support community programmes and initiatives. 

Marina Square and West Mall, in partnership with the 

Health Promotion Board, host complimentary workout 

sessions to promote healthier living. Marina Square 

hosted weekly Healthy Workplace Ecosystem sessions, 

and West Mall hosted fortnightly Zumba sessions. The 

workouts were suspended with the raising of Singapore’s 

DORSCON level to Orange in February 2020. In February 

2021, West Mall has been able to resume their fortnightly 

Zumba workouts, and Marina Square with weekly Fight 

Do sessions.

To strengthen the nation’s fight against the COVID-19 

pandemic, Singapore’s Smart Nation and Digital 

Government Office conducted regular TraceTogether 

education roadshows. Between October 2020 and 

January 2021, Marina Square and West Mall were 

identified as venues for the roadshows and supported 

these efforts by hosting TraceTogether education 

booths.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS

Our subsidiary UICT focuses on three main IT offerings: 

systems integration, IT services and payroll software 

and human resource outsourcing services. UICT was 

conferred the HP Top Commercial PC Growth Partner, 

DELL Data Centre Compute &amp; Solutions Partner of the 

Year and DELL Platinum Partner awards in 2020. 

In 2020, there were no incidents of health and safety 

non-compliance resulting from the use of our buildings.

PEOPLE

We are committed to nurturing an inclusive workplace 

where all employees are valued, trusted and empowered. 

Our policies provide a safe workplace, promote diversity, 

shun discrimination, develop people, and offer equal 

growth opportunities. We believe open communication, 

engagement, 

mutual 

respect, 

teamwork 

and 

collaborative work culture are fundamental to creating 

productive and high performing organisations. 

Our objective is to be an employer of choice and to 

hire, retain and develop the right talent to support our 

business goals and ambitions.

EMPLOYMENT

The Group employed 349 full-time employees as at 

31 December 2020. Our property business accounted 

for 65% of the total headcount with the remainder 

employed in our information technology business. 

During the year, Singland hired 29 new employees, of 

which 14, or 48%, were women. 

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

Singland is an equal opportunity employer. Our policies 

foster diversity and inclusion in our workforce. Our 

people come from different age groups, with diverse 

backgrounds and bring varied skills and experiences 

to our workplace. In 2020, women accounted for 50% of 

our workforce.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HR 

department’s Employee Engagement Team organized 

virtual events such as mental health and mindfulness 

talks, mid-week trivias, Virtual Zumba, an online terrarium 

workshop, an essential oils workshop, and lunchtime 

webinars during Singapore’s Circuit Breaker and 

beyond to help employees stay connected and socially 

engaged whilst working from home. 

Keeping with Singland’s annual durian party tradition, 

boxes of freshly deshelled durian and longans were 

also delivered to Singland and MCH employees in July, 

which was warmly received.

TALENT MANAGEMENT

Our talent management focuses on constantly 

evaluating the skills needed to deliver business results 

and filling the gaps through training and hiring. 

Succession planning and ensuring a talent pipeline for 

key leadership positions remain essential in managing 

our human capital.

MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19

To facilitate the return of staff to the office post-

Circuit Breaker, an online system was created to 

enable employees to easily submit their travel 

and 

health 

declarations 

and 

temperature 

readings online. Staff were also issued with care 

packages containing masks, hand sanitizers and 

a thermometer. Staggered reporting and lunch 

hours have been implemented as Singland seeks 

to do its part to ease the morning and mealtime 

crowd. Within the office, cleaning of common 

spaces and high-touch surfaces has been 

stepped up. 

HR Department’s employee engagement team 

also organized webinars for employees during the 

Circuit Breaker to promote employee health and 

mental well-being whilst national work-from-home 

arrangements were being implemented. More 

information on this can be found in the “People” 

chapter within this Sustainability Report.

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

In line with our HR strategy of hiring, developing 

and retaining diverse talent, we have put in place a 

comprehensive performance management system. 

Our organisation-wide performance appraisal process 

enables employees and their managers to set clear 

goals, establish training and coaching needs, share 

feedback and agree on key performance areas. 

The performance appraisal system also ensures fair 

compensation and rewards for employees. Performance 

appraisals are conducted annually and cover all full-

time employees.

TRAINING

We provide opportunities for personal and professional 

growth to our employees. Our training and development 

programmes enable our employees to update their 

skills and competencies to support career growth and 

performance. 

Last year, we set a target of at least 10 hours of average 

training per employee in 2020. Due to the impact of 

COVID-19, training schedules were disrupted in the first 

half of 2020. With the Company’s effort to digitize and 

streamline work processes, there will be more related 

training opportunities for employees in 2021.

To enhance Singland’s organisational capabilities and 

the personal growth of our employees, we sponsor 

curriculums that build leadership and management 

skills besides the usual technical and functional training.

We aim to maximise the value of learning and 

development investments through conducting training 

needs analysis, effective engagement with training 

providers, establishing a structured process to evaluate 

training effectiveness, capitalising on training subsidies 

and grants provided by the government, and leveraging 

on online resources and educational platforms to 

deliver learning solutions designed to optimise business 

and customer outcomes.

SUSTAINABILITY TRAINING

As we pursue ambitious ESG goals, we are taking steps 

to boost our organizational knowledge and capability.

In 2020, the members of our SWC and senior executives 

from various departments attended an ESG data 

management workshop to learn skills for improving 

data quality and reliability.

17 colleagues from the SSC and SWC completed the 

GRI Standards Certified Training Course in 2020 to learn 

sustainability reporting skills.

RE-EMPLOYMENT

Singapore Land Group supports the rehiring of retiring 

employees beyond the statutory retirement age of 62 

years. We offer re-employment contracts on an annual 

renewal basis to eligible employees who continue to 

utilise their skills and expertise, enabling them to stay 

productive in the workforce. In 2020, we re-employed 24 

retiring employees.

SOCIAL SECURITY

In Singapore, we contribute to the Central Provident 

Fund (CPF), a comprehensive social security savings 

plan managed by the CPF Board under the Ministry 

of Manpower, for Singapore citizens and permanent 

residents. The CPF helps employees to fund their 

retirement, 

healthcare, 

homeownership, 

family 

protection and asset enhancement.

HUMAN RIGHTS

The Company is committed to upholding nationally and 

internationally recognised human rights. Our policies 

prohibit child labour, forced labour and discrimination 

across our business and value chains. We respect our 

employees’ right to join a lawful labour union.

Our human resource policies promote a diverse 

and inclusive workplace culture based on merit and 

performance. As a signatory to the Tripartite Alliance for 

Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) pledge, Singland is 

committed to applying fair, responsible and progressive 

employment practices. Our policies bar discrimination 

in job advertisements, hiring, pay, promotions and 

growth opportunities.

As of 31 December 2020, 20% of our employees were 

represented by Singapore Industrial and Services 

Employees’ Union (SISEU) and Union of Security 

Employees 

(USE), 

and 

the 

respective 

Collective 

Bargaining Agreements covered them.

We have assessed child labour and forced labour risks 

to be extremely low in our operations in Singapore. 

In 2020, there were no incidents of child labour, forced 

labour and discrimination in our operations.

COMMUNITY

OUR CSR INITIATIVES

Singland is committed to being a positive force in the 

communities where it operates. Our CSR initiatives 

include 

monetary 

assistance 

and 

employee 

volunteerism to help local communities. The company 

focused its CSR activities in 2020 around a central 

objective of lifting poverty through training and 

employment. In line with this theme, Singland dedicated 

a large part of its CSR efforts in 2020 to social enterprises 

such as SDI Academy and Project Dignity.

SDI ACADEMY

SDI Academy is a social enterprise that aims to deliver 

language, vocational and computer skills through ed-

tech to migrant workers and refugees to upskill and allow 

for better integration with society. In a show of support for 

Singapore’s migrant workers who were confined to their 

dormitories for extended periods during and beyond 

the nation’s COVID-19 circuit breaker, four cohorts of 

Singland volunteers took time to support and connect 

with migrant workers in weekly ‘Speak English Sessions’ 

on SDI Academy’s virtual platform. Singland also 

sponsored the sign-up fees of 4,500 migrant workers on 

SDI Academy’s Linger App, which facilitates and assists 

migrant workers’ learning of the English language.

REINVEND SOLUTIONS (RVS)

ReinVend Solutions is a vending machine solutions 

provider. In 2020, Singland partnered with RVS in their 

charity GiftBack! program and provided complimentary 

space at West Mall, Marina Square and Singapore 

Land Tower for placement of their GiftBack! vending 

machines. The GiftBack! vending machines provided 

an additional sales channel at no cost to seven 

disadvantaged beneficiaries like Rainbow Centre, Lion 

Befrienders, The Art Faculty and Bishan Home for the 

Intellectually Disabled to sell their handicraft products.

PROJECT DIGNITY

Project Dignity is a social enterprise with a mission 

to 

restore 

dignity 

to 

the 

differently-abled 

and 

disadvantaged by providing training to adults with 

disabilities and special needs and placing them in 

gainful employment. As part of Singland’s contribution 

during 

the 

COVID-19 

pandemic, 

the 

company 

sponsored 3,000 bento boxes from the social enterprise 

Dignity Kitchen for healthcare personnel at Changi 

General Hospital (CGH) and Singapore General Hospital 

(SGH). Singland employees also banded together to 

pen “Love Notes” comprising words of encouragement 

to our healthcare personnel, to express the company’s 

appreciation of our healthcare workers.

Notes – Environmental Data:

1.  Building (Retail) refers to Marina Square Mall (excluding Marina Square Hotels) and West Mall.

2. 

Building (Commercial) refers to Clifford Centre, Singapore Land Tower, SGX Centre, The Gateway, Stamford Court, Abacus Plaza, Tampines 

Plaza and UIC Building (since 2018). 

3. 

There was one (1) development project in 2020 and 2019 respectively and seven (7) in 2018. The development project in 2020 and 2019 refers 

to The Tre Ver, which Singland owns 50% in a joint venture with UOL Group. 

4. 

Energy in Corporate Office, Buildings and UIC Technologies refers to purchased electricity, and in 2020, fuel data was added to Buildings and 

UIC Technologies. For Development Projects, energy refers to both purchased electricity and fuel in all reporting years.

5. 

Our corporate office sits within Clifford Centre (Level 22 and 24) and forms a subset of the building energy and GHG emissions reported. 

Energy consumption and GHG emissions data for the Corporate Office in 2018 was estimated based on the measured consumption during 

the period of 20 Jul 2018 - 31 Dec 2018.

6. 

Scope 1(Direct) GHG emissions include emissions from fuel and refrigerants. Scope 2 (Indirect) GHG emissions refer to purchased electricity.

7. 

GHG emissions calculations are based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Scope 1 emissions refer to CO2, CH4 and N2O. Greenhouse 

Gas Protocol Emission Factors from Cross Sector Tools, March 2017 was used to derive CO2e emissions. Scope 2 emissions refer to CO2; 

Singapore electricity grid emission factor was used to derive CO2e emissions.

8. 

Water used at all our properties is from municipal sources.

9. 

Water data for Corporate Office is unavailable, as water is not separately metered. 

10. Environmental data for all Buildings includes general water consumption of common toilets and pantries, as well as central air-conditioning 

systems, except for individual tenant’s office equipment electricity usage. Environment data for SGX Centre represents Singapore Land 

Group’s 48.6% ownership share of the property.

11. Intensity calculations for all Buildings use Gross Floor Area (GFA) as the denominator. We adopt BCA’s definition for Gross Floor Area (GFA). All 

covered floor areas of a building, except otherwise exempted, uncovered areas for commercial uses, are deemed the gross floor area of the 

building. Generally, car parks are excluded from GFA computation.

12. For development projects, 100% of the environmental data were reported. Intensity calculations use value of work completed as the 

denominator.

Notes – Health &amp; Safety Data: 

1. 

Workplace safety and health data in 2018 &amp; 2019 covered employees and contractors working in buildings only. From 2020 onwards, all 

personnel working in the corporate office and buildings are covered and reported under the Property Management category.

2. 

Contractor data for Property Management covers cleaning and security contractors only. In 2020, there was one injury involving a landscape 

contractor.

3. 

Work-related Injury Rate or formerly reported as Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) for development projects includes main contractors’ and 

subcontractors’ hours.

4. 

Number of lost days reported for Property Management for the year 2018 and 2019 exclude employees and contractors working at the 

Corporate Office.

Notes – Employee Data:

1. 

Average training hours per employee = Total training hours for the year / Number of employees as at 31 December.

2. 

For employee data in 2018, temporary and fixed-term employees were reported under one category.

INDEPENDENT LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT

TO THE DIRECTORS OF SINGAPORE LAND GROUP LIMITED

(FORMERLY KNOWN AS UNITED INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION LIMITED)

CONCLUSION

We were engaged by the Board of Directors of Singapore Land Group Limited (“Singland”, or the “Company”, and 

together with its group of companies, the “Group” ) to provide limited assurance on the accompanying Singland 

Sustainability Report 2020 for the year ended 31 December 2020 (“the Report”) and the selected Global Reporting 

Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards disclosures (Selected GRI Disclosures) as identified below.

Based on the evidence we obtained from the procedures performed as described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities 

section of our report, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that:

(a) 

the Report has not described the sustainability practices on a comply-or-explain basis with reference to the 

following components as listed under Rule 711B of the Singapore Exchange’s (SGX) Listing Manual:

– Material environmental, social and governance factors;

– Policies, practices and performance;

– Targets;

– Sustainability reporting framework; and

– Board statement

(b) 

the Selected GRI Disclosures as identified in the table below, are not calculated, in all material respects, in 

accordance with the relevant topic-specific disclosures requirements in the GRI Standards: Core Option.

INDEPENDENT LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT

BASIS FOR CONCLUSION

We conducted our limited assurance engagement in 

accordance with Singapore Standard on Assurance 

Engagement 3000 Assurance Engagements other than 

Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information 

(SSAE 3000). Our responsibilities are further described in 

the Auditors’ Responsibilities section of our report.

We have complied with the independence and other 

ethical requirements of the Accounting and Corporate 

Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional 

Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and 

Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), which is founded 

on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 

professional competence and due care, confidentiality 

and professional behaviour.

Our firm applies Singapore Standard on Quality Control 

1 and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system 

of quality control including documented policies 

and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 

requirements, professional standards and applicable 

legal and regulatory requirements.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT

Management is responsible for:

– preparing and presenting the Report in accordance 

with the GRI Standards and Rule 711B of the SGX 

Listing Manual, and the information and assertions 

contained within it; 

– determining 

Singland’s 

objectives 

in 

respect 

of sustainable development performance and 

reporting, including the identification of stakeholders 

and material issues; 

– establishing and maintaining appropriate internal 

control systems that enable the preparation and 

presentation of the Report and the selected GRI 

disclosures that are free from material misstatement, 

whether due to fraud or error; 

– preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying 

and ensuring that the Group complies with laws 

and regulations applicable to its activities; and

– ensuring that staff involved with the preparation 

and presentation of the Report are properly trained, 

information systems are properly updated and that 

any changes in reporting encompass all significant 

reporting units.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the 

Group’s sustainability reporting process.

AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES

Our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance 

engagement in accordance with SSAE 3000 and to 

express a conclusion based on the work performed. 

SSAE 3000 requires that we plan and perform the 

engagement to obtain limited assurance about 

whether the Report is free from material misstatement. 

The extent of our work performed depends on our 

professional judgement and our assessment of the 

engagement risk.

A limited assurance engagement consists of making 

inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the 

preparation of information presented in the Report, 

and applying analytical and other evidence gathering 

procedures, as appropriate. These procedures included:

– inquiries of management to gain an understanding 

of Singland’s processes for determining the material 

issues for Singland’s key stakeholder groups;

– interviews with senior management and relevant 

staff at group level and selected business unit level 

concerning sustainability strategy and policies for 

material issues, and the implementation of these 

across the business;

– interviews with relevant staff at the corporate and 

business unit level responsible for providing the 

information in the Report;

– visits to offices and data centres operating in 

Singapore selected on the basis of a risk analysis 

including the consideration of both quantitative 

and qualitative criteria;

– inquiries of the design and implementation of the 

systems and methods used to collect and report on 

the GRI Disclosures, including the aggregation of the 

reported information;

– comparison of the GRI Disclosures presented in the 

Report to corresponding information in the relevant 

underlying sources to determine whether all the 

relevant information contained in such underlying 

sources has been appropriately included in the GRI 

Disclosures; and

– reading of the information presented in the Report 

to determine whether it is in line with our overall 

knowledge of, and experience with, the sustainability 

performance of the Group.

SINGLAND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

The procedures performed in a limited assurance 

engagement vary in nature and timing from, and 

are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance 

engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance 

obtained in a limited assurance engagement is 

substantially lower than the assurance that would 

have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 

engagement been performed.

Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control 

structure it is possible that errors or irregularities in the 

information presented in the Report may occur and 

not be detected. Our engagement is not designed to 

detect all weaknesses in the internal controls over the 

preparation and presentation of the Report, as the 

engagement has not been performed continuously 

throughout the period and the procedures performed 

were undertaken on a test basis.

RESTRICTION ON USE

This report has been prepared for the Directors of 

Singland for the purpose of providing an assurance 

conclusion on the Report and Selected GRI Disclosures 

and may not be suitable for another purpose. We 

disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any 

reliance on this report, to any person other than the 

Directors of Singland, or for any other purpose than that 

for which it was prepared.
