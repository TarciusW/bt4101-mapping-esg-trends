BOARD STATEMENT 

 

The Board is pleased to present the Group’s third Sustainability Report, covering financial year 2020 (the   

“Report”). 

 

The Board of Directors (“Board”) considers sustainability in the formulation of our long-term strategies. The 

key material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors for RafflesEducation have been 

approved by and will be under the oversight of the Board.  

 

As our Group continues to lay the groundwork for long-term growth, we are cognisant that sustainability 

means more than just financial accountability. It is also about our progress towards tracking and achieving 

our ESG goals and ensuring long-term value creation for our stakeholders.  

 

We firmly believe that building a sustainable business is vital to our continued success and that we must 

be fully accountable for our impact on the environment, our students, our people and our community.  

 

Going forward, we will continue to integrate sustainable practices and policies in operations across our 

offices and campuses as well as engaging staff, faculty and students in RafflesEducation’s sustainability 

efforts.

MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY 

 

At RafflesEducation, sustainability is managed at all levels. We are committed to incorporating 

environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations in the formulation and setting of our business 

strategies and operations. For us, sustainability is not an option, it is a key to our corporate value. 

 

The COVID-19 pandemic has, however, proven the viability of the ESG agenda for our Company and its 

stakeholders. It has specifically raised the significance of social factors in the current moment and 

environmental factors in the long term. 

 

We, at every level in the organization play a part in creating a responsible and sustainable business. We 

strive to contribute and foster the sustainable development of our Company, our industry and the society 

that we live in. We use our resources efficiently and with our transparent processes and collaborative 

business approach, we work to generate value and continuously improve the entire value chain.

GOVERNANCE 

 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  

 

Corporate Governance serves as the backbone of our business. We believe that having strong corporate 

governance, incorporating ESG considerations, is key to creating a sustainable future. At RafflesEducation, 

the board plays a key role in setting governing standards. Our corporate governance framework is 

anchored on competent leadership, effective internal controls, a strong risk culture, and accountability to 

stakeholders. In addition, the board reviews and approves the company's risk management, internal control 

framework and sustainability plans and is well informed of the company's activity and work together with 

management in mapping the right direction and defining risk tolerance limit and realistic goals for the 

company. 

 

Our Corporate Governance statement is set out in our Annual Report 2020 from pages 47 – 66.  

 

ETHICS AND TRANSPARENCY 

 

We always conduct our business in a fair and ethical manner, considering the interests of all our 

stakeholders to achieve long-term and sustainable growth. It also entails effective risk management, which 

is more relevant than ever in an age of digitalisation as issues related to data protection and cybersecurity 

come to the fore.  

 

 

PROACTIVE ANTI-CORRUPTION PRACTICES 

 

At RafflesEducation, we are committed to carry out our business with integrity through our zero-tolerance 

approach towards any form of corruption and bribery and ensuring our employees comply with the anti-

corruption and anti-bribery laws of all the jurisdictions that we operate in. We have mechanisms entrenched 

in our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy as well as whistle blowing guidelines for employees and the 

public to raise any concerns via a dedicated email account on any form of potential and committed 

improprieties relating to matters concerning financial reporting, internal controls, corruption, bribery and 

fraud. All employees are provided with copies of the anti-bribery and anti-corruption directive and whistle 

blowing guidelines, which all employees are required to acknowledge receipt and confirm understanding 

of.   

 

For this reporting period, no offence was reported (FY2020: zero incident). We target to maintain zero 

record of corruption incident for the financial year ending 30 June 2021. 

 

 

PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION 

 

The Company prioritizes employees and stakeholder’s personal data and ensure that their personal data 

are kept safe and secure. Our data privacy strategy set out in our Personal Data Protection (“PDP”) Policy 

incorporates strong governance on strengthening privacy controls to drive a responsible business culture, 

supported by continuous awareness on safe privacy practices and information management. With our 

extensive range of policies and procedures, we seek to enhance our corporate framework with continuous 

risk assessment and management of internal controls to perform and operate our business.

GOVERNANCE 

 

 

RISK MANAGEMENT 

 

At RafflesEducation, the Risk Management Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight 

of risk, reviewing the Group’s risk appetite and risk profile in relation to capital and liquidity, in particular, in 

identifying and managing three main categories of risks – Preventable Risks, Strategy Risks and External 

Risks.  

 

Preventable Risks are risks within the organization such as employees’ illegal or unauthorised actions and 

the risks from breakdown of operational processes that ought to be avoided or eliminated. 

 

Strategy Risks are risks that are not inherently undesirable but its expected high returns generally requires 

the Group to take on significant risks to its earnings and capital, which must be managed, albeit not  through 

a rules- based control model.   

 

External risks are risks from events outside the Group, which are beyond its control or influence, such as 

natural or political disasters and major macroeconomic shifts that management could only focus on 

identification and mitigation of impact.  

 

Further details on our Risk Management and Internal Controls approach can be found in our Annual Report 

2020 on pages 58 – 60. 

 

 

CYBER SECURITY RISK 

 

The Group recognises that cyber threat is one of the key concerns in today’s business dealings. The 

ongoing digitalisation has exposed Information Technology (“IT”) related threats to the Group’s businesses 

that might result in compromising confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Group’s information assets 

and system, such as data confidentiality breaches, host exploitation, network security vulnerability, 

intentional data alteration, data loss or theft, phishing &amp; hacking, domain based threat and unauthorized 

access due to lack of internal control, etc.  

 

We take these threats seriously and we have been consolidating all of our IT policies and procedures to 

manage these risks to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Group’s information assets 

are protected at all times. We have implemented and will continue to enhance our recovery strategy, 

backup and restore procedures, and email security to prevent any form of IT threats. 

 

For the past few years, we managed to reduce our physical server footprints significantly. We used to have 

several server clusters with high maintenance costs.  All of our employees are now using Office 365 that 

allow a 1TB data storage, which reduces our costs substantially. This has enabled us to decommission 

most of our server activities thus reducing the cost for running the servers. We are currently in the midst of 

proposing for a smaller server capacity that is sufficient to run other operational services that are not hosted 

in cloud 

 

In summary, there were no red flags identified in managing potential cyber security risks in the current 

reporting period. With current solutions in Office 365, it has greatly prevented the severity of end-user 

security attacks.  

 

We will continue to review the portfolio of our Company’s performance to ensure the correct safeguards 

are in place to manage increasingly sophisticated threats to IT security and ensure that appropriate controls 

are in place to mitigate potential cyber-related risks. We also target to reduce administration effort by 

transitioning hardware and software to Office 365 so our IT team can work on higher value activities in the 

coming years. 

 

 

 


ENVIRONMENT 

 

 

WASTE AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 

 

At RafflesEducation, we are aware that effective waste management is critical for the conservation of 

limited natural resources, and represents an important resource in its own right. We aim to reduce our 

environmental footprint by encouraging our employees to observe green practices to conserve energy, 

reduce waste, reduce of paper usage and other initiatives to minimise the negative impact that will have 

on the overall environment. 

 

We have continuously been making efforts to circulate information and documents digitally by sharing 

information electronically through One Drive, instead of by way of hard copies. Where possible, our lectures 

are delivered through our online Learning Management System such as TEAMS, Sharepoint and Moodle 

by uploading teaching materials and final assessment as well as vetting and moderation. All applications 

for admission to our schools are only accepted online. If printing of papers is required, eco ink, eco print 

and double-sided printing are adopted.  

 

We are taking steps to achieve zero paper utilization from 2021, in regard to graduating documents for our 

graduating cohorts. Digital documents would replace conventional documents such as physical degree 

scrolls and transcripts, qualification statements and professional development certificate. Through the use 

of blockchain technology, we expect to achieve an estimated 77% nett savings per student on related 

printing and paper costs.   

 

We would also be implementing a management system in our university next year where student records 

would be scanned and stored digitally in our PLUTO system. This system would essentially cut down on 

our reliance on and utilization of physical files and storage space across our campuses.  

 

In view of the growth in global waste production, we have been focusing on digitising our operation, 

reducing, re-using and recycling (“3Rs”) waste through reduction of consumption as well as reusing and 

recycling of all materials. Waste paper and used computer peripherals are sold to recycling companies. In 

addition, we collaborate with the fashion industry by turning unwanted clothing into wearable art pieces. 

We also practise waste segregation by providing sufficient special recycling bins for collection of different 

recyclable materials and we consistently encourage and remind all our employees to reduce waste by 

segregating and placing discarded items into the respective bins. We also strive to incorporate this 

sustainable development culture into the building plans and construction methods of all our future 

international schools and institutions of learning. 

 

And last but not least, we have discontinued the practice of mailing printed hard copies of the Company’s 

Annual Reports and circulars to our shareholders effective financial year ended 30 June 2020 to be in line 

with our effort in contributing to the environment. The annual reports and any circulars will, instead, be 

available for download at the Company’s corporate website at https://raffles.education as well as at 

SGXNet website. 

 

As we integrate our environmental efforts into our business operations, we encourage our shareholders to 

support our sustainability efforts towards sustaining a clean and green environment and at the same time 

help to improve efficiencies in delivering cost reductions for the Group. 

 

We target to minimize our environmental impact and resource consumption and to be part of Green+Leader 

in the coming 2 – 3 years. We also target to establish an environmental framework that consist of 

environment impact assessment and commitments within the Group.

HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT AND RELATION 

 

Human capital development is extremely important for continuous corporate growth. It is constantly being 

assessed and redefined to suit the times and the needs of the Group thrust it into the spotlight. 

 

The COVID-19 crisis has brought a renewed focus on human capital and employees in a few aspects. Our 

business is extremely people-centric, and therefore the ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain talent 

is critical to our sustainability. Our Group’s Human Resource strategy has been focusing on better ways to 

manage our employees and communicate significantly. The strategies can be seen amongst others through 

our implementation on shifting to remote work and virtual collaboration in communication, productivity, 

feedback, talent acquisition and others. The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the way our employees 

experience work. We ensure that all our employees have equal access to technology for remote work. For 

those who do not have, we help to provide other alternative for them to do work and participate. 

 

COVID-19 has impacted our human capital directly with a decrease of 49 employees to 1,492 hired as of 

30 June 2020 compared to a total of 1,541 employees in previous reporting year.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 

 

In implementing sustainable diversity management, every employee is valued and respected, irrespective 

of gender, ethnic or religious belief, age, cultural and social background, languages, physical ability, lifestyle 

choice or other personal characteristics. Fostering a culture of diversity has played a key role in 

RafflesEducation sustained success of our workforce. These principles are laid down in the Group’s 

mandatory minimum employment standards, which apply globally and across all of its locations. In this 

Reporting period, RafflesEducation was not notified of any discriminatory behaviour. Should violations 

become known, these would be sanctioned according to the legal instruments available locally.  

 

The international nature of the Group is evident not only in the workforce but also on the management level. 

Wherever possible, local management positions are held by local executives. Furthermore, the Group 

seeks to fill an increasing number of Group management positions with international candidates. It also 

encourages international collaboration through RafflesEducation expat programme, which supports 

employees in gaining experience in another country where the Group is represented.

 FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 

 

Employees are our assets. We undertake fair employment practices and created an inclusive workplace 

culture and provide equal employment opportunities to achieve a fair working environment, regardless of age 

and gender. Our Group’s human resource planning ensures only suitable candidates are hired for the jobs 

through our fair recruitments and selection process. The Group embraces diversity and we recognize the 

importance of creating a wide inclusive environment where employees can treat each other respectfully, 

honestly and equally. 

 

The Group conducts annual performance appraisals for all employees to validate their merit performance to 

complete job tasks. Objective evaluations aid in the recognition of employees’ competency and gaps, 

potentially allowing adjustments to the training program. 

 

Continuing education trainings complement performance evaluations by establishing an active 

communication channel between employer and employees. Employee gatherings strengthen bonds and 

builds a strong working relationship between employees for an efficient workplace synergy.

POSITIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT 

 

RafflesEducation  recognizes  that  a  positive  work environment  is  essential  to  attract,  motivate  and  

retain  talents. A total well-being programme has been put in place to promote personal development, health 

and work life harmony.  Initiatives include a comprehensive medical benefits plan, flexible work 

arrangement, employee engagement initiatives, etc.  

 

Under the leadership of the Group’s Chairman and CEO, Mr. Chew Hua Seng, the Group will continue to 

build on its strong foundation and strive to continue to be a premier education provider. 

 

 

TRAINING AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT 

 

 

Due to the pandemic situation, the upskilling of our employees is carried out through online platforms to 

meet strategic targets in the changing working environment. We believe acquisition of higher skills and 

knowledge would enhance the Company’s human capital and contribute to employee satisfaction, which 

strongly correlates with performance improvement.

COMMITMENT TOWARDS A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORKPLACE 

 

Occupational health and safety (“OHS”) are of utmost importance to RafflesEducation. We are committed 

to having a safe and healthy learning environment and workplace for all and are in the midst of drawing up 

a framework towards OHS that will include identifying material issues, setting of policies, and ensuring 

accountability within the Company.  

 

ZERO TOLERANCE ON HARASSMENT 

 

We have zero tolerance for direct or indirect 

discrimination, victimisation, intimidation, bullying 

or harassment in the workplace. 

 

Any  non-compliance  incidents  can  be  reported 

to  Group  HR  and can  be  subjected  to 

disciplinary  action.  Our standards for labour 

standards are communicated to all employees. 

Our  talent  policies  and  initiatives  are  aimed  at 

strengthening  our  team as well as creating  an 

equitable,  and  safe  workplace  where  our  team 

can  thrive  and  work  together  for  high-impact 

urban transformations. 

 

RafflesEducation is committed to and strongly 

supports a policy   that allows   employees to work 

in an environment free from any unwelcomed 

harassment or abuse by fellow employees or 

others.  

 

We view sexual harassment as a serious 

misconduct that undermines the integrity and 

respect of the working relationship of employees in 

the workplace. Sexual harassment is also regarded 

as a serious violation of the Company’s Rules and 

Code of Conduct and the Company will not hesitate 

to report such violations or misconduct to the police. 

 

STUDENT CENTRIC 

 

When our students expect quality education and 

good experiences, we at RafflesEducation focus on 

understanding our students and putting them first in 

everything we do. 

 

We  strive  to  understand  what  they  are  seeking 

and  continuously improve  the quality of our 

courses to meet    their   needs   and   expectations.   

We  use  a   combination    on   internal   and   external  

measurements to assess how we are doing and to 

improve the quality of our product services. 

 

We have conducted our Student Satisfaction 

Surveys in 2019 and 2020 for services rendered 

that cover the area of facilities and environment, 

teaching-learning resources, student support 

services, student grievances, general satisfaction 

and overall satisfaction rates. 

 

 

The benchmark for each area is 75% out of a total score percentage.
