ABOUT THIS REPORT

social and governmental factors identified by the Group. The report aims at enabling all stakeholders 

to understand the progress and sustainability directions of the Group. It has been uploaded to the

“Philippines office”)3 and the United Kingdom (the “United Kingdom office”)4, which is consistent with

BOARD STATEMENT 

Responding to changes with innovative solutions is key to the success of Azeus. Among the most 

significant changes faced by our society today, issues related to sustainability, such as climate change, 

require our most urgent attention.

Azeus’s management philosophy is to embrace sustainability in the management of our business 

and operations and the interaction with our stakeholders. Issues such as customer privacy, talent 

development, environmental management and economic performance impact every aspect of 

our business operations. Therefore, the Board has always prioritized these key issues in strategic 

formulation in order to develop and adopt appropriate management tools. 

The Board recognizes its responsibility in overseeing the management of sustainability issues and 

monitoring our performance in relation to them. Through communication with key stakeholders, 

we identify the environmental, social and governance factors that are material to the Group and to 

stakeholders on a regular basis. These issues represent the focus of both our effort during the reporting 

period and this report.

Acknowledging the importance of sound sustainability management, a dedicated sustainability task 

force will be established to coordinate all related work within the Group, including the formulation of a 

group-wide sustainability policy. The task force will comprise representatives of different departments 

with diverse backgrounds to ensure that our sustainability journey is guided by overarching principle 

of inclusiveness. By actively listening to the voice of our stakeholders, we look forward to building a 

more sustainable model of development that will benefit all of our employees and business partners.

performance.

The Board is responsible for ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal 

financial, operational and compliance controls, and risk management policies. The management is 

responsible for internal control and for ensuring compliance therewith. The Group establishes the 

Audit Committee that comprises of Independent Non-Executive Directors to assist the Board in 

discharging its internal control review responsibilities, such as reporting to the Board at least annually

SUSTAINABILITY RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

Azeus considers risk management as an integral part of operational management and resource 

planning to meet with increasing demands for sustainability. Considering the potential impacts of 

material sustainability topics on operation and strategic planning, the Group has identified a range of 

sustainability-related risks and opportunities with the support of external consultants. 

Risk

Responses and Opportunities

Customer Privacy

There is security risk in collecting, handling, and 

storing customer information given the rapid 

change of cyber technologies. Loss or breach of 

customer privacy can result in financial loss and 

non-financial reputational damage

Improving System Security

The Group implements procedures to safeguard 

confidential information, such as establishing the 

Code of Conduct and Information Classification 

Policy for ensuring that information assets 

receive an appropriate level of protection.

Talent Attraction and Retention

Improving Employment Management 

System

The Group provides fair employment system 

and practices through establishing a set of 

employment policies. 

Providing Learning and Development 

Opportunities 

Azeus Institute provides training programmes 

which focus on a wide spectrum of topics to train 

skilled employees in the IT industry, as well as in 

Sales and Marketing.

Occupational Health and Safety

 

 

Improving Employee Wellbeing and Health

Stringent management policies and regulations 

are in place to avoid injuries and health problems. 

For example, the Group establishes the Safety 

Committee and Health and Safety Guidelines to 

administer the safety and health program. 

Environmental Protection 

Improving Environmental Management 

System

The Group addresses the environmental-related 

risks through implementing the environmental 

management system and green procurement 

policy, which advocates the environmental 

initiatives not only internally, but also externally. 

Hiring and retaining skilled employees is a 

challenge for the IT industry. Loss of skilled 

employees can deplete the Group’s institutional 

knowledge base and erode the competitiveness.

The prolonged use of display screen equipment 

puts our workers at high risks of associated 

occupational hazards and injuries. There are 

also risks for workers working alone. The loss 

of working days due to employees’ injuries and 

diseases can lead to decrease of production 

capabilities of the Group.

Climate change is an inevitable challenge in 

today’s global context. Extreme weather brought 

about by climate change directly or indirectly 

affects the ability of the Group to access 

resources and sustain operations.

United Kingdom Office 

Apart from providing Health and Safety Guidelines which outline the good practices at offices, the Group 

also establishes the Health and Safety Policy for the United Kingdom office, which aims at ensuring 

a safe working environment for employees working alone and providing guidance on the avoidance 

and reduction of risks related to health and safety. Risk assessment is conducted for identifying the 

improvement of procedures and safety equipment. The Line Managers are kept informed and are 

assigned to continuously review the risks

Going forward, the Group has set out the following social targets for occupational health and safety:

Training and Education 

Azeus promotes a culture of lifelong learning and supports our employees to achieve their full potential. 

The Group office establishes the Training and Development Policy to help fulfil our commitment to the 

continuous development of our employees through a planned and structured approach to learning. 

The Group proactively assesses the training needs of employees through the Training Needs 

Assessment (“TNA”). Based on the organizational direction, needs of employee and project, as well as 

the changes of processes and procedures, the TNA group which consists of management team and 

Human Resources department performs the assessment to identify and analyse the training needs. 

The identified training needs will then be submitted to Azeus Institute for subsequent arrangements. 

The Azeus Institute provides training programmes on a wide spectrum of topics such as orientation, web 

programming and product testing. After the training, the trainer will conduct evaluation and arrange 

discussion with the participants to gather feedbacks for improving subsequent training courses and 

projects.

The Group will annually assess, record and disclose our GHG emissions. Annual monitoring of emission 

data will help with formulation of more accurate emissions reduction targets in the coming years.

To further reduce emissions of air pollutants, the Group encourages employees to use public 

transportation to travel. To understand more about our air emissions and provide stakeholders with a 

more comprehensive overview of our environmental performance, the Group will continue to improve 

its data collection system and cover other air emissions, including ozone-depleting substances, 

nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and other significant air emissions among the value chain.  

The Environmental Management Representative (EMR) should ensure that the specified waste 

management practices are followed by employees and contractors while the Administration 

Department is responsible for identifying the noncompliance and corrective actions.
