BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE



Board Statement

OVERVIEW OF SUSTAINABILITY 

The Board is pleased to present the Fraser and 

Neave,	Limited	(“F&amp;N”	or	the	“Group”)	third	

Sustainability Report in accordance with the 

internationally recognised Global Reporting 

Initiatives	(“GRI”)	Standards	(Core)	which	is	

in compliance with the Singapore Exchange’s 

(“SGX”)	Listing	Rules	711A	and	711B.	This	

report encapsulates the Group’s overarching 

approach	to	sustainability,	providing	greater	

clarity to our stakeholders on material issues from 

Environmental,	Social	and	Governance	(“ESG”)	

factors	that	may	impact	our	business,	as	well	as	

strategies that we have implemented to mitigate 

these	risks.	This	year,	we	made	great	strides	

toward achieving ambitious 2020 sustainability 

goals. Each of the Group’s commitments and 

targets are described in detail on pages 23 to 25 

of this report. We remain committed to reducing 

our	environmental	impact,	enhancing	the	Group’s	

economic	value,	fostering	mutually	beneficial	

relationships with our communities and ensuring 

the	health	and	safety	of	our	staff.	

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

The Board has overall responsibility for 

sustainability and incorporates sustainability 

issues as part of its strategic formulation. While 

it continues to take the lead in the Group’s 

sustainability	direction,	the	Board	has	tasked	the	

Sustainability and Risk Management Committee 

(“SRMC”)	with	responsibility	for	steering	the	

Group’s	sustainability	efforts.	The	SRMC	is	

supported by the Sustainability Development 

Committee	(“SDC”),	which	is	chaired	by	Mr	Lee	

Meng	Tat,	Chief	Executive	Officer,	Non-Alcoholic	

Beverages and comprises business CEOs and 

senior executives across various functions. 

The SDC supports the SRMC and monitors the 

progress of the Group’s sustainability initiatives. 

2020 AND BEYOND

Today,	the	responsibility	to	do	even	more	than	what	

we	have	done	so	far	to	transform	F&amp;N,	sustainably,	

is even greater. As one of the leading consumer 

groups	in	Singapore	and	the	region,	we	will	

continue to anchor sustainability in the Group and 

advance toward a sustainable circular economy.

As one of the leading consumer 

groups in Singapore and the 

region, we will continue to 

anchor sustainability in the 

Group and advance toward a

Message from Chairman of SDC

OVERVIEW OF 2019 SUSTAINABILITY 

REPORT

GRI 102-14

At	F&amp;N,	sustainability	is	an	integral	part	of	our	

operations. F&amp;N’s vision is to be a stable and 

sustainable	Food	&amp;	Beverage	(“F&amp;B”)	leader	in	

the	ASEAN	region,	and	in	the	following	pages,	we	

provide an insight into how F&amp;N shows leadership 

for the sustainability challenges faced.

This report has been prepared in accordance 

with	the	GRI	Standards	(Core),	which	represent	

global best practice in sustainability reporting. 

By	adhering	to	GRI	Standards,	we	are	able	to	

demonstrate performance for F&amp;N’s material 

sustainability issues consistently over time. We 

have improved our data collection processes 

by aligning and integrating them with the Thai 

Beverage	Public	Company	Limited’s	(“ThaiBev”)	

parameters. 

ThaiBev has been a member of the DJSI World and 

DJSI	Emerging	Markets	since	2016,	and	constantly	

works on improving their sustainability processes 

through learning and best practice sharing. They 

first	became	the	Beverages	industry	leader	in	the	

RobecoSAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment 

in 2018 and continues to retain the title in 2019.

By benchmarking our sustainability processes 

and	performance	against	the	industry	leader,	we	

ensure that our processes and performance would 

further improve through best practices sharing 

and knowledge transfer. 



Mr Lee Meng Tat

Chairman of Sustainability 

Development Committee

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

ACHIEVEMENTS AND PROGRESS IN 2019

For	the	first	time	this	year,	we	have	external	

verification	on	the	sustainability	data	disclosed	

in this report. Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance 

(“LRQA”)	has	conducted	an	external	assurance	

on selected F&amp;N HSE disclosures. The external 

assurance serves to ensure the accuracy of the 

sustainability data disclosed in this report. LRQA’s 

assurance statement can be found on page 92 of 

this report.

Created by the global index provider FTSE 

Russell,	the	FTSE4Good	Index	Series	is	designed	

to measure the performance of companies 

demonstrating	strong	ESG	practices.	This	year,	

our	subsidiary,	Fraser	&amp;	Neave	Holdings	Bhd	

(“F&amp;NHB”),	has	been	rated	by	FTSE4Good	Bursa	

Malaysia	Index	(“F4GBM”)	with	positive	results,	

and included as part of the F4GBM. This indicates 

the strong ESG practices in place at F&amp;NHB. 

Consumer Health and Safety is our most important 

sustainability topic and has been key to the 

success of our business over the decades. I am 

glad	that	we	continue	to	lead	in	this	area.	90%	of	

our	ready-to-drink	(“RTD”)	beverages	sold	today	in	

Malaysia contain less than 5g of sugar per 100ml 

(below	the	sugar	sweetened	beverages	excise	

duty	threshold)	and	consumers	have	responded	

positively to the reformulated products. This 

ensures that we continue to provide healthier 

beverages,	which	do	not	compromise	on	taste,	to	

our consumers. More information regarding other 

initiatives promoting good health and safety for 

our consumers can be located on page 77 of 

this report.

Waste generated by packaging has been 

increasingly in the spotlight globally. The material 

issue	of	Packaging	has	consequently	been	

adjusted in the F&amp;N materiality matrix to reflect 

its high importance to F&amp;N. We are committed 

to sourcing sustainably and supporting efforts 

to reduce the usage of packaging materials. At 

the	Singapore	Packaging	Agreement	(“SPA”)	

Awards	2019	held	on	17	Jul	2019,	F&amp;N	Foods	

Pte	Ltd	(“FNFS”)	had	received	a	Merit	Award	

for its initiative to reduce the packaging used 

while	still	maintaining	the	integrity	and	quality	

of the product. With support from the National 

Environment	Agency	(“NEA”)	in	Singapore,	

FNFS had also launched a nationwide recycling 

initiative,	Recycle	N	Save,	on	31	Oct	2019.	50	

Smart	Reverse	Vending	Machines	(“RVM”)	are	

scheduled to be placed island-wide by March 

2020 in a bid to encourage the public to recycle 

the packaging of their consumed beverages. 

With	the	launch	of	this	initiative,	F&amp;N	reinforces	

its commitment to play its part in protecting the 

environment by ensuring that its packaging is 

environmentally	friendly,	and	at	the	same	time,	

encouraging and rewarding consumers who 

recycle	the	cans	and	bottles.	At	Times	Printers,	

packaging waste is also reduced by decreasing 

the amount of paper used for the packing of 

books and magazines through reusing the 

aluminium plate interleaf paper and the slit waste 

from the paper reel outer roll.

At the heart of our sustainability approach is 

Innovation. We encourage employee-driven 

innovation at dedicated conventions where 

teams submit ideas for continual improvement 

and showcase their projects to share learnings 

and	knowledge	to	help	improve	the	efficiency	

and	product	quality	of	F&amp;N’s	manufacturing	

operations. Our employees at F&amp;N Dairies 

Thailand	(“F&amp;NDT”)	initiated	the	award	winning	

Gemba Kaizen project at Rojana Plant where the 

team re-looked the mechanism of the display box 

at the packing line and incorporated the Karakuri 

Kaizen	mechanism	(leveraging	on	gravitational	

energy).	This	innovation	in	production	contributed	

towards	significantly	reducing	the	packing	line’s	

electricity	usage	and	frequency	of	machine	faults.

PLANS FOR 2020

2020 will be an exciting year for sustainability at 

F&amp;N. The 2020 Group sustainability performance 

will be assessed against our 2020 Group 

sustainability targets. This outcome will impact 

the setting of the new 2025 Group sustainability 

targets,	which	are	slated	to	commence	in	2021.	

We will also engage a range of stakeholders to 

determine our new material topics and materiality 

matrix for 2021. We will continue to embed 

sustainability	throughout	our	business,	and	lead	by	

example for long-term value creation. 

F&amp;N appreciates your interest in our 2019 

Sustainability Report and is very grateful for your 

continuous support.

FRASER AND NEAVE, LIMITED &amp; SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

About F&amp;N

WHO WE ARE 

GRI 102-2 to 102-10

F&amp;N originated more than a century ago from the 

spirited	decisions	of	two	enterprising	young	men,	

John	Fraser	and	David	Neave,	who	diversified	from	their	

printing business to pioneer the aerated water business 

in	Southeast	Asia	(“SEA”)	in	1883.

The	entrepreneurial	spirit,	embodied	by	our	founders,	

remains	in	today’s	F&amp;N.	As	a	soft	drink	company,	

F&amp;N seized the growth opportunities and ventured 

into the beer brewing business in 1931 in partnership 

with The Heineken Company and built a very 

successful	beer	empire	in	Asia	Pacific	–	through	its	

joint	venture	company,	Asia	Pacific	Breweries	Limited	

(“APB”).	In	1959,	it	entered	the	Dairies	business	by	

forming a canned milk joint venture with Beatrice 

Foods	of	Chicago,	and	in	2007,	it	acquired	Nestle’s	

liquid	canned	milk	business	in	Thailand,	Malaysia,	

Singapore	and	Brunei,	and	accelerated	its	growth	in	

the	dairy	business.	Today,	F&amp;N	is	the	largest	canned	

milk	producer	in	SEA.	In	1985,	the	Group	diversified	

into the Properties business. Starting with the 

redevelopment of its soft drinks and brewery sites in 

Singapore,	F&amp;N	soon	grew	its	property	arm	–	Frasers	

Centrepoint	Limited	(“FCL”,	now	known	as	Frasers	

Property	Limited)	to	become	one	of	the	leading	

property companies in Singapore with multi-national 

businesses	in	residential,	hospitality,	retail,	commercial	

and industrial properties.

In	2012,	F&amp;N	divested	its	equity	stake	in	APB	to	realise	

a	substantial	value	for	shareholders.	In	2014,	the	Group	

demerged FCL through a listing on the Singapore Stock 

Exchange,	thereby	transferring	value	to	shareholders.

Today,	F&amp;N	is	a	leading	Asia	Pacific	Consumer	Group	

with expertise and prominent standing in the F&amp;B and 

Publishing &amp; Printing industries. Leveraging its strengths 

in	marketing	and	distribution,	research	and	development	

(“R&amp;D”),	brands	and	financial	management,	as	well	as	

years	of	acquisition	experience,	the	Group	provides	key	

resources and sets strategic directions for its subsidiary 

companies across both industries.

FRASER AND NEAVE, LIMITED &amp; SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Our Supply Chain 

The	preparation,	production	and	packaging	of	our	beverages	and	consumables	for	printing	requires	a	range	of	

raw	materials,	equipment,	and	other	goods	and	services.	In	FY2019,	we	engaged	with	over	4,500	global	and	local	

suppliers	across	our	supply	chain.	F&amp;N	worked	with	manufacturers,	wholesalers,	retailers,	importer/merchants,	

contractors,	professional	services	providers,	etc	and	spent	a	total	of	about	$1.5	billion	on	products	and	services.	

Sourcing 

To provide the highest quality standards for our customers and consumers, 

we have also been seeking out and working with suppliers who meet high 

quality in standards and are socially, ethically and environmentally responsible. 

To ensure the sustainability of our business, we have risk management 

mechanisms in place to manage issues associated with the commodities upon 

which we rely. 

Production

We have implemented a standardised safe production process, in accordance 

with international standards, throughout our operations. We strive for eco-

efficient processes, in which we optimise the socio-economic value we create, 

while minimising our negative environmental and social impacts from all 

production stages. 

Distribution  

We have a fully integrated and extensive distribution system to ensure that 

our products are efficiently distributed to our customers and consumers. Our 

focus is to minimise the environmental and social impacts from transportation 

by managing energy usage while safeguarding the safety of our personnel 

and local communities. We also continuously innovate our processes and 

implement digital technologies to drive efficiency. 

Marketing and Sales

Responsible marketing and sales practices are of great importance to F&amp;N. We 

demonstrate societal responsibility by providing healthier product options and 

informative product labels. We also work with regulators and seek feedback 

from our customers on our products to improve our marketing practices.

Post-Consumption Packaging Management  

We minimise the impact of post-consumer waste by delivering innovative 

and environmental-friendly packaging. We continuously seek out sustainable 

packaging that also meets the needs of our consumers. In addition to applying 

Circular Economy principles throughout F&amp;N, we also promote environmental 

awareness in the communities we operate.

Our Sustainability Approach

MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE 

STRUCTURE

F&amp;N Board of Directors recognises the importance of 

sustainability in the Group’s business operations and 

performance and oversees the overall strategic plan 

including considering sustainability and environmental 

issues as part of its strategic formulation.

The SRMC ensures sustainability risks and 

opportunities are considered at the highest level of 

F&amp;N by providing strong support to the management 

team. The SRMC has the responsibility of steering and 

aligning company-wide sustainability strategy. 

Headed	by	CEO	Non-Alcoholic	Beverages,	and	

supported	by	senior	personnel	from	key	functions,	

regions	and	levels,	the	SDC	supports	the	SRMC	by	

providing	general	direction,	monitoring	and	reporting	

the progress of F&amp;N’s sustainability projects.

The SDC is supported by the Sustainability 

Development	Working	Team,	which	consists	of	

cross-functional representatives that takes on the 

various	roles	of:	Sustainability	Reporting	Secretariat;	

Pillar	Heads;	Sustainability	Initiative	Champions;	and	

Data	Owners.	Together,	they	monitor	the	progress	of	

designated	goals,	drive	initiatives	at	operational	level,	

identify	challenges	in	performance,	and	gather	data	

for reporting.

In	FY2019,	the	SRMC	and	SDC	each	convened	three	

times on sustainability matters. 

All F&amp;N Directors and employees pledge to adhere 

to	F&amp;N’s	Code	of	Business	Ethics	&amp;	Conduct,	which	

includes	principles	related	to	integrity,	respect	

and excellence. The Code is reviewed with new 

employees	as	part	of	their	induction	programme,	

while	updates	are	communicated	to	staff	by	email	and	

are also made available on our intranet.

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

OUR MATERIAL ISSUES

We	undertook	our	first	materiality	assessment	in	2017	to	assess	our	most	important	sustainability	issues.	This	assessment	was	

based	on	three	steps:	Identification;	Prioritisation;	and	Validation.

Identification

We conducted a comparative analysis 

of sustainability issues identified by 

global initiatives (such as the Sustainable 

Development Goals) and best practices of 

industry peers in the industry. These issues 

were discussed with the SDC to identify issues 

most material to F&amp;N. We also surveyed our 

employees to obtain their views and seek 

further confirmation on the key issues. A list of 

15 material issues were identified.

Step 1 

Prioritisation

To prioritise the material sustainability issues 

identified in Step 1, we engaged department 

heads, the C-suite, and the Board in a 

materiality workshop. The workshop involved 

an in-depth discussion of each identified 

material sustainability issue, including the 

likelihood of impacts to our business and 

stakeholders, and the extent to which they 

would affect our sustainability. Each material 

issue was then plotted, based on importance, 

on a scale from moderate to high.

Step 2 

Validation

We were able to develop a preliminary 

materiality matrix based on the outcome 

from Step 2. It was then validated through 

engagements with the SDC and the Board.

Step 3

FRASER AND NEAVE, LIMITED &amp; SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Our Sustainability Approach

FY2019 MATERIALITY MATRIX

Following the initial materiality assessment in 

2017,	we	review	and	update	our	15	materiality	

issues every year to identify priority sustainability 

issues across our value chain. 

Over	the	past	year,	public	awareness	on	plastics	

waste	have	grown	considerably,	both	globally	and	

locally,	and	is	now	an	issue	of	key	importance	

to	business,	governments	and	the	public.	The	

Singapore government has designated 2019 

as	the	“Year	Towards	Zero	Waste”	while	the	

Malaysian Government published a ‘Roadmap 

Towards	Zero	Single-use	Plastics	2018-2030’.	

At	F&amp;N,	the	SDC	has	also	assessed	that	the	

‘Packaging’ materiality topic is increasingly 

important to F&amp;N’s business and its stakeholders 

By mapping our material issues to the United Nations 

Sustainable	Development	Goals	(“UN SDGs”),	 

we have aligned our business and sustainability 

goals to contribute to the UN SDGs. This allows 

us to focus on how our sustainability initiatives for 

each	material	issue	translate	towards	fulfilling	the	

respective UN SDGs. 

F&amp;N will conduct a materiality assessment exercise in 

2020 to help ensure our strategy is focused in the right 

areas,	to	assess	the	changing	sustainability	landscape	

and to understand and prioritise the issues that matter 

to our business and our stakeholders.

and	has	shifted	it	to	the	upper	right	quadrant	of	

the materiality matrix.

For	a	more	holistic	reporting,	this	year	we	had	

subsumed:

a)	 the	‘Health	and	Nutrition’	topic	under	

‘Consumer Health and Safety’ and ‘Creating 

Value	for	Society’;	and	

b)	 the	‘Route	Planning’	topic	under	‘Energy	

&amp; Climate Change’ to be aligned with the 

circular economy approach. 

As	at	FY2019,	the	Group	has	now	13	materiality	

issues.

Our Sustainability Approach

CIRCULAR ECONOMY

A	circular	business	model	can	be	defined	as	

the	way	an	organisation	creates,	delivers	and	

captures value with and within closed material 

loops and chains. F&amp;N is committed to work 

towards a more circular economy by preserving 

the	value	of	resources	for	as	long	as	possible,	and	

applying	circular	economy	principles	of:	

i)	

prioritising	renewable	inputs;	

ii)	 keeping	products	and	materials	in	use;	and	

iii)	 recovering	by-products	and	waste.

Our approach to managing materiality topics is 

guided by these principles. More than half of our 

materiality	topics	have	links	to	circular	economy:

• 

Innovation: we creatively design new 

solutions for products and processes which 

contribute	to	resource	efficiency	and	the	

prevention	of	waste;

• 

Water Stewardship: we manage water use 

and	recover	and	reuse	water	where	possible;

• 

Effluents and Waste: we minimise waste 

(in	production	and	post-consumption)	and	

help to create by-products from the residual 

liquid	and	solid	waste;

• 

Packaging: we reduce raw materials needed 

and aim to ensure that packaging can be 

recycled,	reused	or	composted;

• 

Energy and Climate Change: we reduce our 

energy	needs,	use	renewable	and/or	recover	

energy	from	our	operations;

• 

Sustainable Sourcing: we favour suppliers 

whose environmental practices adhere to 

circular	economy	principles;	and

• 

Creating Value for Society: we raise 

awareness,	for	example,	through	our	School	

Recycling Programmes.

These links are explored in more details in the 

chapters which follow.

CONTRIBUTING TO SDGS

F&amp;N’s success is based upon long-term value creation for our stakeholders. We achieve this by maintaining 

leadership in our core markets, and by leveraging innovative technologies and our employees’ expertise to 

meet consumers’ evolving demands. 

The ‘Economic Performance’ section presents an overview of our economic performance, which provides us 

with a firm foundation to continue delivering the products that our customers love. 

In the ‘Innovation’ section, we share highlights of R&amp;D efforts to introduce new products and packaging,  

and improve upon existing products and processes, for our brands to stay relevant to consumers.  

We become increasingly aware of how innovation can maximise the positive environmental and social 

impacts—and minimise negative impacts—of our products and processes each year. We implement  

initiatives to achieve this and have highlighted it in this section as well.

INNOVATION

Innovation is central to long-term value creation. 

We	continuously	evolve	to	deliver	new	and	unique	

product	offerings	which	cater	to	consumers’	

changing	needs,	for	example,	towards	more	

beverage	choices,	flexibility	and	affordability.	

Through	innovation,	we	also	improve	the	operational	

efficiency	of	our	manufacturing	processes	and	better	

manage our impacts on the environment. The idea of 

the ‘circular economy’—of decoupling our activities 

from	the	consumption	of	finite	resources—is	one	

which drives us to make continual improvements. 

We continuously innovate for longer shelf life and 

better recyclability of our products.

Over	the	past	year,	we	launched	new	products	

with lower sugar content and more convenient 

packaging to meet the diverse needs of our 

customers. We have also been implementing 

employee-driven innovative manufacturing 

processes that increased productivity and 

improved environmental performance.

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

Our Approach

Our R&amp;D unit is based in Singapore and supported 

by teams in Malaysia and Thailand. The unit drives 

In	2019,	the	F&amp;N-NTU	F&amp;B	Innovation	Lab	was	

opened in Singapore to develop innovative products 

and recipes. In line with F&amp;N’s commitment 

to	deliver	sustainable	business	practices,	this	

collaboration with Nanyang Technological University 

(“NTU”)	will	see	the	furthering	of	our	green	efforts,	

innovation and supports ongoing renovation of 

our products to ensure consistent delivery of good 

tasting and healthy products to consumers.



as well as catering to the health and nutritional 

needs of our consumers. The collaboration will 

foster circular economy research that will result in 

better	food	products,	greener	packaging	and	the	

conversion of spent product produced from food 

processing into valuable resources. 

 

Consumer-Focused Innovation

At	F&amp;N,	we	continuously	deliver	new	and	unique	

product	offerings	to	meet	consumers’	evolving	

needs.	We	strive	to	deliver	our	“Pure	Enjoyment.	

Pure Goodness” promise to our consumers by 

offering:	choices	in	different	product	categories,	

healthier options without compromising on taste and 

convenience	through	differentiation	in	packaging	to	

cater to customers’ needs.

We draw upon local knowledge to develop products 

that our consumers love. We launched several new 

products	during	FY2019,	with	each	one	undergoing	

comprehensive	tests,	before	they	even	reach	

the	shelves,	to	ensure	that	they	are	safe	for	our	

consumers	and	of	the	desired	quality.

Our R&amp;D are guided by the following five principles: 

Innovation &amp; creation 

of products and 

packaging based 

on sensory science 

(a scientific method 

of measuring 

and interpreting 

consumers’ response 

to prototypes/

products based on 

the senses of taste, 

smell and touch).

Scientific advances

for application  

in our processes 

and products.

Technical 

developments 

that support 

quality 

improvement and 

cost optimisation. 

Regulatory 

compliance

of our local and 

export business.

Quality products

that meet food 

safety standards.

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

Healthier Options

We invest heavily in the development of healthier 

products and in extending product options to best 

suit	the	expectations	of	different	types	of	consumers.	

Over	the	past	15	years,	we	have	made	significant	

efforts	to	reduce	the	sugar	content	across	our	range	

of	beverages:	in	2004,	our	beverages	contained	an	

average	9.5g/100ml	of	sugar,	and	this	has	fell	over	

39%	to	5.3g/100ml	in	2019.	

This	year,	we	have	successfully	reformulated	our	

product	portfolio	in	Malaysia,	aimed	at	improving	

the	health	and	well-being	of	customers.	Today,	

about	90%	of	our	RTD	beverages	sold	in	Malaysia	

are	healthier	options	(below	the	sugar	sweetened	

beverages	excise	duty	threshold	in	Malaysia).

More information on our healthier options can be 

found in the ‘Consumer Health and Safety’ chapter.

Increased Convenience 

We	differentiate	our	products’	packaging	to	cater	 

to	the	different	needs	of	consumers.	For	example,	

due	to	the	demand	for	greater	convenience,	 

we launched the F&amp;N Sweetened Condensed Milk 

Squeeze	Tube	and	single	serve	‘Stix’.	These	are	

portable	and	convenient	to	use,	as	well	as	providing	

more	suitable	portion	sizes,	and	hence	contributes	

to consumer health and safety. These innovative 

products	come	in	3	flavours	including	full	cream,	

strawberry and chocolate.

We are conscious of our responsibility to manage 

the environmental impacts associated with 

our product packaging. We have implemented 

innovative processes to reduce the PET resin used 

in	packaging	of	key	products	(as	detailed	on	page	

59),	and	we	are	continuously	seeking	solutions	to	

go even further in reducing our post-consumption 

waste	(as	detailed	on	page	47).	

Process Innovation 

Our R&amp;D and Manufacturing teams continuously 

seek	out	the	most	up-to-date	technical	and	scientific	

advances	to	improve	the	efficiency	of	our	operations	

while minimizing environmental impacts. Over the 

years,	we	have	implemented	innovative	technologies	

to	reduce	post-consumption	waste,	automate	

processes	to	enhance	efficiency	and	improve	fleet	

efficiency	and	safety.	

Drawing on innovative technologies to 

produce Healthier and Better Products

(A) Aseptic Cold-Filling Polyethylene 

Terephthalate (“PET”) line 

 

The Aseptic Cold-Filling PET line at the Shah 

Alam plant has been producing 100PLUS 

Active,	F&amp;N SEASONS,	and	OYOSHI since 

March 2018. Employing state-of-the-art 

technology,	the	new	line	allows	the	use	

of	thinner,	lightweight	containers,	thereby	

reducing the use of PET resin packaging 

material by over 208 metric tonnes  

in FY2019. 

 

The new line is able to maintain a sterile 

environment within the aseptic chambers 

for	156	consecutive	hours,	meaning	less	

production downtime and also allows us to 

bottle	our	products	gently,	with	no	additional	

thermal stress and no added preservatives. 

 

This has accelerated our expansion into more 

product	offerings,	such	as	the	3	new	healthier	

variants of F&amp;N SEASONS	–	Watermelon	

Lychee	Tea,	Apple	Pomegranate	Tea	and	 

Pu-Erh Chrysanthemum Tea. 

Future Ready Investments

This year, we have invested approximately $50 million in capital to 

elevate our product innovations and drive cost competitiveness. 

Process innovation projects implemented are described in F&amp;NHB’s 

Annual Report 2019, and include: 

- 

200 bpm drinking water line and warehouse at Kota Kinabalu 

Industrial Park, Sabah, Malaysia

- 

New product development transformation programme, including 

reformulating products with lower sugar and new product 

packaging

- 

Sophisticated Automated Storage Retrieval System (“ASRS”) for 

our new warehouse at Shah Alam plant, Malaysia

- 

Solar roofing to generate renewable energy at Rojana Plant,

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

Employee-driven Innovation 

We empower our employees to lead when it 

comes to innovation. Our employees actively 

participate	in	ThaiBev’s	Way	of	Work	(“WOW”)	

Awards,	an	annual	award	to	promote	the	concept	

to	improve	work	processes	(Simplicity),	enhance	

capabilities	(Efficiency)	and	Competitiveness.	

19 teams from F&amp;NHB participated this year and 

won the 3rd runner-up award for an enterprise 

workflow	improvement	project	and	1st	runner	up	

award for a project on ‘Quality Excellence’.

Continuous Improvement Project

This	year,	our	employees,	at	F&amp;NDT,	initiated	

a Gemba Kaizen project at the Rojana plant 

encouraging continuous improvements to 

enhance processes and reduce costs.  

Through	this	project,	the	team	reviewed	the	

mechanism of display boxes at the packing line 

and incorporated the Karakuzi Kaizen mechanism 

(leveraging	gravitational	energy).	This	initiative	has	

reduced electricity consumption in the packing 

line	and	reduced	the	frequency	of	machine	 

jams	by	almost	90%	and	was	recognised	by	 

the Technology Promotion Association  

(Thailand-Japan)	2019	in	the	Thailand	Kaizen	

Award 2019 with a gold medal.

Excel as One Convention (“EAO”)

EAO (previously known as “Winning as One”) 

is an annual convention held for the past  

13 years in Thailand to allow cross-functional 

F&amp;N teams to present their ideas to enhance 

our productivity, cost savings and/or product 

quality. 

This year’s convention was held in August 2019 

with the theme of “Continuous Improvement 

&amp; Innovation Excellence”. Teams successfully 

identified solutions which resulted in cost 

savings or cost avoidance of THB18.44 million 

(approximately $800,000) per year. 

This year’s convention saw continuous 

improvement activities at the Small Group 

Activities, Kaizen and Quality Control Circle. 

New awards were given for the Innovation 

category and Lean category. 

Lean Production Management

We recognise that lean management is important 

in our production. Our employees at Rojana plant 

initiated a project to increase productivity of the 

Sweetened Beverage Creamer production line 

through	effective	packaging	materials,	storage	and	

transportation.	The	team	improved	the	process	flow,	

including:	designing	and	building	a	storage	room	

near	to	the	filling	room	to	reduce	travel	distances	for	

forklifts;	reducing	the	lead	time	of	changing	foil	roll	

to	reduce	downtime;	and	installing	a	roller	conveyor	

machine to reduce workload. This project will help 

to achieve annual cost savings of THB13 million 

(approximately	$600,000)	and	at	the	same	time	

reduce the risk of accidents caused by forklifts.

Digital Efficiency 

In	Malaysia,	we	implemented	an	Enterprise	

Workflow	project	which	digitised,	simplified	and	

integrated the processes of our sales team with 

the	IT	application.	Through	this	project,	sales	

colleagues can perform sales transactions with the 

web-based system anywhere and anytime. 

This resulted in reducing the processing time from an 

average	of	14	days	to	just	a	day	(with	an	associated	

reduction of administration time of about 10 hours per 

month	for	our	sales	team).	Paper	usage	for	our	sales	

team	has	also	reduced	by	70%.

Our Approach

We recognise the importance of diversity in terms 

of	cultural	background	and	age,	as	well	as	having	

a	good	gender	balance,	to	enrich	the	workplace	

with fresh perspectives that help us to meet our 

business objectives. 

F&amp;N	strives	to	offer	equal	opportunities	for	all	people	

without	regard	to	race,	gender,	religion	and	any	

other	factor	unrelated	to	employment	requirement.	

We comply strictly with prevailing legislation on 

employment rights in our countries of operation 

including	no	hiring	of	minors.	In	Singapore,	F&amp;N	

employs	older	staff	beyond	the	statutory	requirement	

age of 62 as we support older employees who desire 

to	find	employment	opportunities	beyond	retirement.

In	terms	of	gender,	while	the	number	of	female	

employees	stands	at	about	38%	of	total	employees,	

our	positive	approach	to	gender	equity	can	be	

seen	by	women	representing	around	44%	of	total	

managerial positions. 

As	of	30	Sep	2019,	F&amp;N	has	over	7,700	employees.	

Most	work	full-time	and	about	85%	are	on	a	

permanent	contract.	Around	30%	of	employees	have	

been with F&amp;N for over 10 years and in the past year 

our	employee	turnover	rate	was	about	19%.	

Our people differentiate F&amp;N from its peers and determine our success. We strive to create a stimulating work 

environment where talent is nurtured and rewarded, and employees are engaged, challenged and empowered 

to perform to their highest potential. We constantly look to hire and retain talent who will enable us to 

maintain our competitive edge and expand in the international market. F&amp;N contributes to the UN SDG 8’s 

target to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all.

Human Capital Roadmap and Strategy

F&amp;N has a strategic plan to establish ourselves as 

a preferred employer. This is guided by our Human 

1. 

Clear Structure and Roles

 

We use the ‘Beverest’ TPMS to integrate our 

Human Capital processes and systems across 

the Group. This helps us to make sure that 

each employee is aware of the expectations 

and	responsibilities	for	their	role,	their	team	

and for the Group as a whole. Beverest TPMS 

is the foundation for a range of Human 

Capital-related	processes,	from	recruitment	

and on-boarding to career development.

2. 

Market-Oriented Compensation and 

Benefits

 

We pay employee competitive wages and 

offer	competitive	benefits.	In	addition,	

the Group carries out regular reviews to 

ensure that our remuneration packages 

remain in line with its peers’ and in harmony 

throughout the Group. Benefits provided to 

full-time	employees	include	life	insurance,	

health	care,	disability	and	invalidity	

coverage,	parental	leave,	retirement	

provision,	and	stock	ownership	options	

(share-based	incentive	plans).

 

F&amp;N’s Human Capital policies go beyond 

standard labour regulations and statutory 

requirements.

 

This	year,	three	unions	in	Malaysia	have	

adopted performance bonus terms in their 

terms and conditions of employment. This is 

the start of extending the performance-based 

reward culture to our production employees.

Proactive Succession and Workforce 

Planning

 

Through our annual Talent Review and 

Succession	Planning	process,	we	identify	

employees who have the potential to become 

future leaders at F&amp;N. Working alongside 

the	Talent	Management	team,	identified	

future leaders chart their individual career 

development pathways to ensure they are in 

the best position to succeed at a high level. 

 

Talent Management is closely linked with 

succession	planning,	and	in	combination,	

provide us with a steady pipeline of future 

leaders who are able to support our business 

needs.	Initiatives,	including	job	rotations,	

transfers	and	project	assignments,	allow	

exposure to the various operations within the 

company.

6. 

Engaging Corporate Culture

 

F&amp;N promotes a culture of engagement and 

inclusion. At the heart of this are our Global 

Values which emphasise that optimal outcomes 

happen when we work together. We saw an 

overall participation of about 230 employees at 

our Global Values sessions in Singapore this 

year,	from	workshops	to	townhall	sessions.	

Some of our main activities were a paper holding 

game,	marshmallow	and	sticks	challenge	and	

balloon tower game. The objective was to 

encourage	effective	communication,	teamwork	

and	practical	problem-solving	skills,	all	of	which	

are core principles behind Global Values. 

 

Senior management interact with employees 

through various channels such as town 

hall	meetings	and	briefings,	CEO	roadshow	

sessions,	intranet	updates	and	quarterly	

employee email newsletters. 

 

Employees are encouraged to partake in 

sports and other physical activities through our 

in-house	gym	facilities,	membership	of	internal	

sports	clubs,	and	in	employee	badminton	or	

golf tournaments. F&amp;N involves employees 

in a wide range of activities to promote 

togetherness	and	collaboration,	such	as	the	

‘Fit &amp; Nature’ plogging activity and community 

outreach to spread festive cheer.

 

An engaging culture also means an active 

feedback	platform.	At	F&amp;NHB,	employees	

are	encouraged	to	share	real-time	feedback,	

ideas and suggestions directly with senior 

management	via	F&amp;N	Voice,	a	WhatsApp	

mobile messaging platform.

Caring for F&amp;N Family

Since 2003, F&amp;NHB has been 

presenting the Chairman’s 

Award to academically 

high-achieving children of 

employees. The award is 

an employee appreciation 

initiative and provides 

motivation for their children 

to strive for excellence. 

About $66,000 in cash 

was awarded to about 100 

recipients this financial 

year. To date, F&amp;NHB has 

disbursed about $1.3 million 

to over 2,000 children 

through this programme.



7. 

Strategic Talent Acquisition and  

On-boarding

 

F&amp;N strives to promote from within and 

maximise opportunities for the excellent 

talent already available to us. Where this is not 

possible,	our	Human	Capital	team	ensures	that	

we are able to recruit and welcome external 

applicants with abilities that match the Group’s 

needs. Our interviewers are trained to ensure 

that	the	interview	process	is	fair	and	effective.	

Our Beverest TPMS is used to ensure that all 

new	recruits	benefit	from	a	comprehensive	

and consistent on-boarding programme across 

the Group. This includes a mix of self-serve 

e-learning and one-on-one support.

 

Our ‘Future-ready Manager Programme’ 

ensures that we replenish and grow our 

pool of future executives. We use a variety 

of assessment tools as part of a rigorous 

process to recruit the most suitable 

candidates.	As	soon	as	they	join	the	team,	

the successful candidates begin a formal 

two-year programme to get a wide variety of 

experience.

MARKET PRESENCE 

GRI 202-2

F&amp;N’s hiring practices are aligned with the 

interests of the local economies in which 

we	operate,	and	we	are	determined	to	be	

the employer of choice and a role model for 

others.	We	are	proud	that	100%	of	our	senior	

management in Singapore and Thailand and 

91%	of	our	senior	management	in	Malaysia	are	

hired from the local community. This helps to 

keep the value created by F&amp;N within the local 

economy and ensures that we understand the 

local markets.

Our compensation packages have been 

standardised across the Group to ensure that 

the highest expectations are being embodied 

across our operations. These standards are 

strictly	maintained	and	also	reviewed	frequently	

to allow for necessary adaptations with local 

circumstances.

F&amp;N does not participate in nor condone forced 

or	child	labour,	the	use	of	intimidation	or	any	

manipulation of workers.

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

CREATING VALUE FOR SOCIETY

GRI 413-1

Our Approach

In	each	market	that	we	operate,	we	undertake	a	

number of long and short-term programmes that 

serve	to	create	greater	social	equity.	To	that	end,	

we have developed four main thematic areas 

where	we	focus	our	community	endeavours:

1. 

Strengthening Vulnerable Groups 

 

Inequality	of	wealth	and	opportunity	is	a	

major global challenge. Our consumers and 

employees come from all segments of society 

and	inequality	undermines	the	development	

and potential of both our business and our 

communities. To take leadership in tackling 

this	issue,	we	have	chosen	to	focus	on	

strengthening vulnerable groups such as 

underprivileged children. Through investing 

in educational programmes including both 

technical	skills	and	soft	skills,	F&amp;N	works	

towards	promoting	a	more	equal	society	in	

terms	of	diversity,	equal	opportunities	and	

social	inclusion,	where	business	and	society	

together	flourish.

We will continue to provide outreach 

and engagement programmes across 

Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand by 

exploring and implementing appropriate 

outreach programmes to address 

community needs.

Our Target: 

At F&amp;N, we believe that sustainable business development occurs when our communities develop alongside 

us. This firstly means that we ensure our operations minimise negative impacts on our surrounding 

communities, and it also means that we strategise our investments to create value where the strengths of our 

business intersect with the needs of society.

In the next section, we detailed our commitment and initiatives to strengthen vulnerable groups, promote 

environmental protection and support active lifestyles.

2. 

Promoting Environmental Consciousness

 

While companies have a critical role to play in 

minimizing	environmental	footprint,	sustainable	

development	means	a	partnership,	and	this	

includes behavioural changes at the individual 

level.	Besides	maintaining	eco-efficiency	in	our	

operations	(see	pg.	76-94),	we	have	taken	the	

task of promoting environmental consciousness 

in our communities as another priority. As F&amp;N 

continues to move towards a circular economy 

model	of	business,	we	are	sharing	lessons	and	

also learning from communities about how to 

implement our ideas.

3. 

Spreading Festive Cheer

 

In addition to basic needs and environmental 

sustainability,	our	community	development	

programme includes a priority related to  

our	brand	promise,	which	is	delivering	 

Enhancing Social Well-being

“Pure	Enjoyment.	Pure	Goodness”	to	all.	 

We believe that spreading festive cheers helps 

our communities connect with each other and 

strengthen	relationships	between	different	

cultures.	Here,	we	aim	to	promote	diversity	and	

fosters national unity in our communities.

4. 

Promoting Healthy Lifestyle &amp; Nutrition

 

As	a	F&amp;B	business,	F&amp;N’s	products	

contribute to the health and well-being of our 

communities.	Therefore,	we	consider	it	our	

obligation to facilitate responsible consumption 

and balanced lifestyles. This is mostly 

accomplished through the consumption of 

F&amp;N products to maintain a healthy lifestyle in 

line with consumer needs. We also prioritise 

community investments that support sports and 

active lifestyles to better care for our consumers 

while also creating value for communities.

1. Strengthening Vulnerable Groups 

MALAYSIA: Empowering Youths with Basic Computer Skills

F&amp;NHB continued to provide youths from underprivileged 

backgrounds at Montfort Boys Town with opportunities 

to develop their capabilities and reach their full potential, 

through the ICDL certification course. 

The ICDL course, held since 2011, is part of the F&amp;NHB 

IT Corner programme which was established in 2010. 

Designed for youth with different levels of digital literacy, 

the ICDL course helps beginners improve and fully grasp 

basic computer skills for common real-world application. 

F&amp;NHB has so far invested about $62,000 in the 

programme. To date, over 500 students from Montfort Boys 

Town have successfully graduated from the ICDL course and 

have found suitable placements in the working world.

MALAYSIA: Leadership Programme for Underprivileged 

Youth

Since 2015, F&amp;NHB has been partnering with Leaderonomics, 

a social enterprise dedicated to transforming communities 

through leadership development. Our programme aims to 

nurture discipline, develop interpersonal skills, boost self-

confidence and encourage teamwork among the young 

residents of Rumah Ilham.

This year, the boys from Rumah Ilham also had the chance 

to apply their leadership and basic business skills gained 

from the leadership programme when they set up a booth 

for two days to raise funds towards education fees for the 

Home’s residents.

MALAYSIA: Free Kindergarten &amp; Tuition Classes 

The collaboration between F&amp;NHB and KCHF is part of the 

F&amp;NHB E.L.I.T.E. programme which provides educational 

assistance to underprivileged children.

Aimed at empowering the children to take ownership 

of their own learning, the F&amp;NHB E.L.I.T.E. programme 

offers marginalised children the opportunity to attend 

kindergarten and tuition centre for free. The programme 

promotes greater access to education and gives the 

children a chance with early education that helps to shape 

their academic and personal life trajectories.

To date, F&amp;NHB has invested over $120,000 in the 

programme and a total of 487 children have benefited 

from the F&amp;NHB E.L.I.T.E programme.

2. Promoting Environmental Consciousness

SINGAPORE: Recycle N Save

A circular economy will be one in which businesses work 

alongside consumers to ‘close the loop’ of production.  

The Recycle N Save initiative is a collaboration between the 

NEA of Singapore and F&amp;N in a joint effort to encourage 

Singaporeans to adopt a more circular lifestyle by offering them 

the convenience of recycling used cans and bottles with the 

help of RVM. Singapore’s Environment and Water Resources 

Minister, Masagos Zulkifli (center of photo) showed his support 

by gracing the launch event for the Recycle N Save initiative.

Launched on 31 Oct 2019, following favourable response from 

the public to the pilot initiative at Waterway Point in Punggol 

in January last year, the RVM has been updated. The new 

RVM can hold up to 600 aluminium cans and plastic bottles. 

Plans are in place to progressively roll out 50 RVMs island-

wide by March 2020.



MALAYSIA: F&amp;NHB Fit &amp; Nature Programme

This year, F&amp;NHB has kick-started its “Fit &amp; Nature” initiative, 

to encourage Malaysians to lead an active lifestyle as well as 

to generate greater awareness on environmental protection. 

The inaugural session was held in collaboration with the 

local council, with F&amp;NHB’s “Fit &amp; Nature” activity organised 

in conjunction with the official launch of the Terengganu 

drawbridge. The eco-friendly exercise programme involved 

plogging, a combination of jogging and collecting litter.

Two more sessions were organised and attracted 

overwhelming participation from employees. F&amp;NHB 

employees took part in a wide range of tasks that not only 

encouraged employees to do their bit to tackle issues 

affecting the environment and learn about the latest 

F&amp;N products, but also cultivated camaraderie amongst 

colleagues to build their morale at the workplace.



MALAYSIA: School Recycling Programmes 

Since 2006, F&amp;NHB has been partnering with schools 

across Malaysia to educate the next generation on the 

importance of circular economy principles. F&amp;NHB sponsors 

a recycling competition between schools nationwide, with 

prizes ranging from about $70 to $450. Over the past year, 

F&amp;NHB has expanded this programme to 756 schools in 130 

states of Malaysia, through a partnership with Solid Waste 

Corporation Management.

2. Promoting Environmental Consciousness

THAILAND: Water Conservation Programme

As a F&amp;B company, water is an essential resource for the 

production of our products. F&amp;NDT has worked with the 

Government of Thailand to conduct a water conservation 

programme to return water back to nature. Themed ‘Return 

Water to Nature’, this is a circular economy initiative in 

action, and 350 employees worked together to build three 

check dams at Namtok Chet Sao Noi Saraburi located near 

the F&amp;NDT Pak Chong factory.



3. Spreading Festive Cheer

MALAYSIA: Celebrating Festivals With Our Communities

This year, our employees in Malaysia brought the joy of 

Chinese New Year to over 500 underprivileged children and 

senior citizens from 10 homes across Malaysia. During the 

visits, F&amp;NHB contributed much-needed provisions such 

as diapers, toiletries, F&amp;N beverages and milk powder to 

the homes. Besides distributing red packets and mandarin 

oranges to the residents, F&amp;NHB employees also treated 

them to packed lunches as both parties bonded together 

over food. 

The Seratus Ikhlas, Setulus 100PLUS campaign, organised by 

F&amp;NHB, in collaboration with Media Prima Television Networks, 

has spread Ramadan and the Hari Raya festive cheer to more 

than 3,000 people from underprivileged communities across 

Malaysia during the fasting month this year.

The one-month campaign saw 100PLUS Ambassadors and 

celebrities from the Seratus Ikhlas 100PLUS squad visiting 

homes of single mothers, the homeless and senior citizens 

to personally present Ramadan contributions, courtesy 

of F&amp;NHB, and participate in gotong-royong and other 

community activities at a Tahfiz school, mosques and an old 

folks home.

To continue the spirit of giving and sharing during the 

fasting month, F&amp;NHB also hosted break-fast sessions with 

children from different homes in Malaysia and contributed 

Raya clothes and ‘duit raya’ for the children.

4. Supporting Sports and Active Lifestyles 

SINGAPORE: OCBC Cycle 2019

In its 11th edition, the OCBC Cycle 2019 saw over 6,800 

cyclists participating, and it was the first ever recipient of 

the Singapore Environment Council’s Eco Event certification. 

In support of the event’s green efforts, 100PLUS deployed 

the manual can crusher and recycling bins beside the Site 

Hydration tent to encourage recycling of the paper cups and 

cans.

MALAYSIA: Official Partner for the National Sports Council

As the official partner of National Sports Council, we 

supported Malaysian athletes during their trainings and 

competitions by providing 100PLUS to meet their hydration 

and energy needs. For athletes competing abroad in 

international tournaments, we also supported them with 

100PLUS Active in sachet version, making it convenient for 

them to keep hydrated on their travels.

A proud advocate of local sports development, we 

recognise our local sports personalities through the annual 

Sportswriters Association of Malaysia-100PLUS Awards, and 

we have been the main sponsor of this award since 2006.

MALAYSIA: Grassroots Programmes 

Since 2011, 100PLUS has sponsored the Ministry of 

Education-organised League known as Liga Kementerian 

Pendidikan Malaysia. The Football League encourages 

children from different parts of Malaysia to develop their 

football skills. 

Since 2003, 100PLUS has been the official partner for all 

Badminton Association of Malaysia (“BAM”) events and 

activities, including the Malaysian Open and Malaysian 

Masters. We have been supporting the BAM in organising 

the 100PLUS National Junior Circuit, a premier youth 

development competition to motivate young and rising 

players to excel in the game.

MATERIAL ISSUES COVERED

In the following pages, we will explain our targets, management approach and performance for each of our 

eco-efficiency areas of focus. We will show that eco-efficiency is not only just about reducing the environmental 

impacts of our operations, but also often makes good business sense for F&amp;N. 

During the year ended 30 September 2019, F&amp;N did not receive any monetary fine or sanction for non-compliance 

with environmental laws or regulations. 

Our Environmental, Safety and Health Policy 

All of our operations are guided by the following principles, to:

WATER STEWARDSHIP 

GRI 303-3 (2018); GRI 303-5 (2018)

Our Approach

While none of our sites are in high water-stress 

areas,	many	regions	in	Singapore,	Thailand	and	

Malaysia	have	faced	floods	in	recent	years	and	the	

effects	of	climate	change	are	expected	to	intensify	

water	stress	in	the	future.	Therefore,	with	the	

guidance	of	our	ESH	Policy,	and	in	line	with	our	

commitment	to	the	circular	economy	principles,	we	

are committed to responsible water stewardship.

Water is a fundamental element of our products 

and our business is dependent on a reliable supply 

of	water.	A	lack	of	effective	water	management	

can therefore have serious implications. We have 

a range of water assessment and action policies 

that	are	applied	across	our	facilities.	This	includes:	

efficiency	measures;	the	safe	return	of	waste	water	

from	our	operations;	and	mitigating	risk	in	supply.	

A localised approach to water management is 

essential. We look beyond our own operations 

and act collectively with other stakeholders in 

each of the regions in which we operate. We take 

every opportunity and approach to reduce water 

consumption and meet our 2020 water intensity 

target and are carrying out various projects and 

initiatives to achieve this.

Water Saving at Soya 

Plant

At our FNFS Soya plant, water is used for batch soaking of 

soya beans and continuous flushing of foreign materials in 

the separator. 

Through tighter manual control of the water feeding 

process, such as installing a level alarm at the soya soaking 

tanks and level control valve at stone separator, water is 

prevented from overflowing.

Water reduction during 

Clean-in-Place process

At our FNFS plant, Clean-in-place (“CIP”) for transfer 

piping is carried out after production runs. 

With new piping configurations to carry out CIP 

simultaneously, we can reduce the number of CIPs 

required from five times to just once or twice.

Our Performance Highlights

Over	the	past	year,	our	water	intensity	increased.	

This is because of two additional production 

lines	at	Shah	Alam	plant,	which	offer	significant	

benefits	(e.g.	reduction	in	packaging	materials)	

but have higher water consumption than other 

lines. 

None of our water withdrawal is from areas of water 

stress. We remain committed to achieving our 

2020 water intensity reduction targets. Total water 

consumption	(i.e.	withdrawal	minus	discharges)	

during	the	year	was	about	1,940	megalitres	(“Ml”).	

This is inclusive of water consumed during our trial 

runs.	More	information	about	effluents	is	included

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE

GRI 303-4 (2018); GRI 306-2

Our Approach

The F&amp;B manufacturing process involves the 

generation	of	both	liquid	(effluent)	and	solid	wastes.	

We	strive	to	reduce	impacts	from	our	operations,	and	

this means complying with relevant regulations. 

Under the guidance of our Environmental Policy and 

the	principles	of	a	circular	economy,	F&amp;N	explores	

opportunities to review how ‘waste’ can be put to 

alternative uses. Our ultimate aim is that ‘waste’ is 

seen	not	as	a	problem,	but	as	a	source	of	new	value	

for our supply chain or for another organisation’s 

supply chain. Applying initiatives to promote a more 

circular economy for our operations and consumers 

enhances our ability to conserve natural resources 

and	improve	efficiency.

This	chapter	focusses	on	waste	and	effluents	in	our	

own	operations.	Please	refer	to	the	‘Packaging’	(pg.58)

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

To reduce solid waste intensity 

ratio by 5% from 2017 to 2020

Target: 

and	‘Sustainable	Sourcing’	(pg.66)	chapters	for	

further insights about how F&amp;N work throughout the 

value chain with suppliers and customers.

Each respective Business Unit has an approach 

to waste appropriate for their activities and hold 

regular departmental meetings where issues 

relating	to	waste	are	discussed.	For	example,	at	

F&amp;N	Creameries	(M)	Sdn	Bhd	(“F&amp;NCM”)	our	

Environment Monitoring Committee oversees the 

company’s management of the environment with 

regards to waste management. At F&amp;N United 

Limited	(“F&amp;NUL”)	in	Thailand,	an	Organizational	

Sustainable Policy has been implemented with a 

commitment emphasising waste reduction and a 

3R	project	(Reduce,	Reuse,	Recycle).

We	believe	that	our	aspiration	for	“zero	discharge,	

zero	waste	and	zero	landfill”	starts	from	each	

individual.	As	such,	we	organise	activities	to	enhance	

environmental awareness among our employees 

through communication platforms such as the 

intranet,	emails	and	internal	recycling	programmes	

as well as activities like ‘plogging’ and the F&amp;NHB 

Go	Green	Carnival.	At	some	sites,	such	as	FNFS,	

workers are encouraged to post any suspicions of 

non-compliance,	including	photographic	evidence,	

to a dedicated WhatsApp chat group.

 

F&amp;N applies strict minimum standards for the 

quality	of	our	effluent	discharges,	based	on	our	

Environmental	Management	System,	and	applies	

these standards throughout our operations. Waste 

water	from	our	industrial	effluent	treatment	plant	

in	Malaysia	is	treated	and	repurposed	for	cleaning,	

toilet	flushing,	utilities	and	other	functional	purposes.	

Rejected water from our Thai water treatment plant 

and boiler is transferred to a pond for watering of 

grass and plants. This is an example of the circular 

economy principle of converting ‘waste’ to a resource.

Another example is our dairy manufacturing plants 

in Thailand and Malaysia. They are leading the way 

in	our	commitment	towards	achieving	zero	effluents	

and	solid	waste	by	converting	100%	of	industrial	

sludge from production into organic fertiliser. This 

is	then	distributed	to	local	farmers.	Over	1,000	MT	

of industrial sludge from our waste water treatment 

plants were converted into fertiliser this year.

F&amp;NHB Go Green Programme

Following the success of 2018’s F&amp;NHB Go 

Green++,	a	nation-wide	employee	recycling	

programme	in	Malaysia,	we	continue	to	focus	

on	packaging	materials,	to	generate	greater	

awareness of applying the 5Rs philosophy 

(Refuse,	Reduce,	Reuse,	Repurpose,	Recycle)	

among employees. 

Our employees continued their enthusiasm in 

collecting recyclable packaging materials and 

we	collected	almost	24,000	kg	of	recyclables	

(an	average	of	12.5	kg	per	Malaysian	employee)	

throughout the 6-month programme. There 

was also a significant increase in employees’ 

knowledge on the 5R philosophy.

Our Performance Highlights

We have a target to reduce solid waste intensity 

by	5%	from	2017	to	2020.	This	year,	we	and	

achieved	a	26%	reduction	in	solid	waste	intensity	

as	compared	to	2017,	putting	us	well	above	our	

target	of	5%.	The	significant	reduction	was	driven	

by the successful ‘Waste to Wealth’ programme 

at Pulau Indah plant and the ‘War against Waste’ 

programme in Thailand. 

Close	to	80%	of	the	Group’s	solid	waste	was	

reused,	recycled	or	recovered	in	2019.

As	part	of	the	programme,	the	F&amp;N	Green	Carnival	

was organised at our Kota Kinabalu plant this year. 

The activities for the carnival were designed to 

enhance 5R awareness amongst employees as well 

as share F&amp;N’s Sustainability journey in a fun way. 

The information and activities in the Green Carnival 

included:

• Recycling tetra packaging by Tetra Pak Malaysia

• Recycling industrial waste into useful materials by 

KPT Recycle Sdn Bhd

• F&amp;N’s sustainability commitments and initiatives

• Upcycling workshop using beverage cartons

Inspired by the success of this programme in 

Malaysia,	F&amp;NDT	launched	a	“Circular	Economy”	

project,	to	enhance	the	awareness	of	our	employees	

and surrounding communities about aiming for 

zero	solid	waste.	During	the	project	launch,	our	

employees visited schools around the Rojana plant 

to educate students about the circular economy. This 

include donating recycling bins to the schools.

PACKAGING

Our Approach

We strive to ensure our packaging protects the 

integrity	of	the	contents	and	fulfils	the	visual	and	

functional expectations of our consumers. There is 

increasing stakeholder awareness of the importance 

of	environmentally-friendly	packaging,	especially	

in	relation	to	plastics.	In	Malaysia,	the	government	

recently	released	a	‘Roadmap	Towards	Zero	Single-

Use Plastics 2018-2030’ setting out their vision to 

phase out single-use plastics over the next decade. 

The	Singapore	Government	released	a	Zero-Waste	

Masterplan	in	August	2019,	which	includes	a	circular	

economy approach to resource management. F&amp;N 

is	committed	to	supporting	these	efforts	and	will	be	

reassessing	our	approach	over	the	next	year,	as	well	

as establishing relevant targets when we set new 

sustainability goals for 2025. 

There is scope for innovation in packaging and we 

have	been	exploring	it	over	the	years	(more	details	

are	included	in	the	‘Innovation’	chapter	of	this	report).	

This has helped us reduce the volume of packaging 

material used as a percentage of product. 

Circular economy principles are particularly important 

for	our	industry:	the	frequency	of	purchases	can	

translate	into	a	large	amount	of	packaging,	and	so	

‘closing the loop’ is a priority. We are fully committed 

to reducing F&amp;B waste by increasing shelf life 

and	providing	appropriate	portion	sizes,	as	well	

as increasing the recyclability of the primary and 

secondary packaging used in our products and 

sourcing more renewable packaging materials. 

One such initiative would be to progressively 

introduce rPET into the manufacturing of bottles 

used across our range of beverage products and we 

have since started with the 100PLUS 4G bottles.

We reduced our PET resin use in packaging 

materials	for	some	of	our	products	(including	

100PLUS ACTIVE and F&amp;N SEASONS and OYOSHI)	

by	over	208	metric	tonnes	this	year.	On	top	of	that,	

the products have a longer shelf-life resulting in less 

waste	disposal.	Currently,	more	than	90%	of	our	

beverages’ packaging contains recyclable material.

We are also active in campaigns to encourage 

recycling;	more	information	is	included	in	the	‘Creating	

Value	for	Society’	chapter	(pg.43-49)	of	this	report.

Switching from TR Aluminium Board to TR PBU Board

FNFS has transitioned away from the use of aluminium foil for the drinks packaging of our F&amp;N FRUIT TREE FRESH 

Sugarless Apple Juice. This has been achieved without compromising both the product or packaging quality and has saved 

approximately 430 kg of aluminium foil. This also contributes to our logistics and fuel efficiency as the overall weight per 

product has been reduced by 0.5 grams. 

FNFS won a ‘Merit Award’ in July 2019 for this initiative as part of the annual SPA Awards which recognises signatories who 

have made notable efforts and achievements in reducing packaging waste.

Preform Reduction in PET Bottles

This project aims to reduce the preform for our 

250ml 100PLUS PET	Bottles.	The	quantity	of	

packaging materials used would be reduced whilst 

maintaining	the	high	product	quality.	This	project	

was	recently	initiated,	and	we	will	be	able	to	monitor	

the data from the beginning of 2020. 

In	Thailand,	and	as	described	in	the	earlier	

‘Innovation’	chapter,	this	year,	we	also	implemented	

a packaging reduction initiative for cartons of 2kg 

pouch sweetened beverage creamer. Through this 

initiative,	the	weight	of	paper	carton	has	reduced	by	

90g,	with	savings	of	150	metric	tonnes	of	cartons	

and	over	$650,000	in	cost	savings	per	year.

Another initiative implemented this year was to 

increase	the	size	and	weight	of	shrink	film	roll	and	

modify	the	support	of	auto	pack	to	fit	the	larger	roll.	

With	this,	the	usage	of	shrink	film	has	reduced	by	

almost 22 metric tonnes per year.

Overall,	our	PET	usage	intensity	has	decreased	by	

almost	20%	between	2004	and	2019.

Our Approach

Climate	change	is	a	defining	global	challenge	of	the	21st	century.	As	one	of	the	main	priorities	for	our	2020	Vision,	F&amp;N	is	committed	to	

reduce	our	energy	consumption	and	GHG	emissions	intensity	ratio.	As	part	of	our	efforts,	we	also	feel	the	responsibility	to	help	minimise	

carbon	footprints	across	our	value	chain,	ranging	from	manufacturing,	packaging,	storage	and	logistics,	to	end	use	and	disposal.

Singapore	has	pledged	to	reduce	GHG	emissions	intensity	ratio	by	36%	by	2030,	compared	with	2005	levels	and	to	reach	peak	

GHG	emissions	by	2030.	Malaysia’s	government	has	targeted	a	45%	reduction	in	GHG	emissions	intensity	ratio	by	2030	from	a	2005	

baseline,	and	Thailand	has	a	reduction	target	of	30%	by	2036	from	a	2010	baseline.	

F&amp;N	has	an	initial	target:	between	2017	and	2020,	we	aim	to	reduce	energy	and	GHG	emissions	intensity	ratios	by	5%.	F&amp;N	will	review	

and look into setting longer-term targets beyond 2020 in due course.

As	with	the	other	eco-efficiency	topics,	the	framework	for	our	approach	is	our	Energy	Management	Policy.

Our Energy Management Policy

All our operations are guided by the following principles, to:

• fulfil and enhance the energy management system as energy conservation is one important part of our operations

• well manage and utilise energy conservation technology and best practices as part of our continuous improvement 

• implement and improve energy management system to comply with relevant laws and regulations

• conduct energy improvement programme to optimise business operations

• promote, support and manage energy conservation efficiently

Our employees, business partners and stakeholder groups are all aware of our Management Policy and have given their 

support for our goals. We regularly review the policy to ensure that it is valid and up to date.

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

Operations	processes,	including	manufacturing,	

storage	and	transportation,	require	energy.	We	

have	applied	a	range	of	initiatives,	based	on	

circular	economy	principles,	to	improve	our	

energy performance. Our energy and climate 

Improving energy efficiency in our operations 

makes business sense just as much as it helps 

to reduce our environmental impacts. Energy 

efficiency contributes to a circular economy 

by limiting the resources needed to produce 

valuable goods and services. 

change related activities are broken down 

into five priority areas. The first four relate to 

minimising	our	own	direct	and	indirect	impacts,	

and the final one relates to how we are adapting 

to	climate	change	risks:

As part of our innovative approach across 

the	group,	we	have	a	range	of	initiatives	that	

include:	process	solutions	to	eradicate	wasted	

energy	(for	example	installation	of	Variable	

Speed	Drives);	and	behavioural	solutions	to	

reinforce a culture of good practice throughout

1. Energy Efficiency in Our Operations

MALAYSIA:

VSD for Cooling Tower

Through installation of Variable Speed Drives (“VSD”), the 

motor speed of cooling tower fan is modulated based on 

an analogue input from a temperature sensing device.

Energy Saving:

&gt;330,000MJ/year

Cost Savings:

About $11,000/year

FRASER AND NEAVE, LIMITED &amp; SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES  |  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Eco-efficiency 

MALAYSIA:

Intelligent Flow 

Controller (“IFC”) for 

Main Air Compressor

The installation of IFC for Main Air Compressor helped in 

stabilising the pressure of compressed air and avoiding 

the pressure fluctuation. This elimination of fluctuation is 

estimated to save up to 5% of electricity usage.

Energy Saving:

&gt;360,000MJ/year

Cost Savings:

About $13,000/year

SINGAPORE:

Air Compressor Unit 

replacement

Replacing old fleet of air compressors with newer and 

technologically advanced air compressor units are more 

energy efficient. It is estimated that this project has 

resulted in an energy saving of about 1 million kWh/year 

(equivalent to about 1,000 MT CO2). 

 

Energy Saving:

&gt; 1,000,000kWh/year

Cost Savings:

About $10,000/year 



Energy efficiency can make a significant 

contribution.	However,	we	must	also	recognise	

that in order to ultimately decouple our activities 

from	GHG	emissions,	we	should	look	into	

transitioning from hydrocarbon-based energy 

to renewable energy. Renewable inputs are 

an essential part of the transition to a circular 

economy,	and	F&amp;N	is	committed	to	be	a	part	of	

this transition. We have begun by sourcing more 

of our electricity from low-carbon and renewable 

sources.	Further	to	this,	we	are	also	exploring	

options to generate our own renewable energy 

at our sites.

2. Renewable Energy Sourcing and Generation

THAILAND:

Solar Energy Proposal

A proposal to install a solar PV system at our Rojana 

plant will provide an alternative source of energy for our 

operations. This will enable F&amp;NDT to significantly reduce 

energy consumption from the grid and utilise renewable 

energy for its operations. We will expand and model this 

onto other plants after the successful implementation at 

Rojana plant.

Plant Capacity:

999 kWp 

(1,300 MWh)/year

Cost Savings:

About $285,000/year

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

In addition to making improvements to our own 

operations	through	energy	efficiency	and	renewable	

energy	use,	F&amp;N	is	looking	into	sharing	best	

practices and encouraging improvements along 

our full value chain. We are still at the beginning of 

Optimal route planning can help us to reduce costs 

and be more environmentally friendly. We have 

therefore streamlined our distribution networks over 

the past few years.

Our	Malaysia	operations	made	significant	progress	

in recent years by switching from single-deck trucks 

to double-decker trucks. We have also increased 

the product load per truck deck thereby reducing 

the	number	of	trips.	For	FY2019,	we	have	an	

estimated	cost	savings	of	about	$100,000.	

We have implemented the Oracle Transport 

Management	(“OTM”)	system	that	has	an	efficient	

control over the overall logistics operations in Malaysia 

which	comprises	in-bound,	out-bound	and	export	of	

containers. Our Distribution team now has full visibility 

of all the transportation activities throughout the entire 

supply	chain.	With	this	web-based	system,	we	are	able	

to	improve	our	operational	efficiency	through:

•	

Optimised	operational	planning	–	our	team	can	

plan	and	optimise	shipments	based	on	cost,	

service	level	and	asset	utilisation;	and

these	efforts,	but	we	understand	it	is	important	to	

support our business partners and customers to 

reduce their own GHG emission impacts. As we do 

this,	we	will	look	for	opportunities	for	collaborations	

for circular economy initiatives.

•	

Improved	fleet	management	–	our	team	can	

better	manage	the	fleets	by	transporters,	from	

driver	and	equipment	assignment,	dispatch,	

asset	tracking,	event	management	and	supplier	

payment.	With	the	GPS	integration	into	OTM,	

our planners can track the trucks at any time to 

ensure safety and timely arrival at destinations.

F&amp;NHB has put in capital investments of more than 

$260 million since 2014 on new production lines 

and warehouses across our production facilities 

in various locations. This decentralization strategy 

also means that our manufacturing and warehouse 

operations	are	closer,	resulting	in	shorter	routes	to	

market and lower carbon emissions from logistics. 

About $26 million has also been invested in 

a sophisticated ASRS at our new integrated 

warehouse at Shah Alam plant. This will eliminate 

the need for forklifts thus further reducing the carbon 

footprint of our warehouse operations. Read more 

about the ASRS in page 32 of this report.

SUSTAINABLE SOURCING 

GRI 204-1

Our	target	for	‘Sustainable	Sourcing’	specifically	

relates to palm oil. Although this represents a 

relatively	minor	proportion	of	our	expenditure	(&lt;3%	

of	total	expenditure	on	products	and	services),	

it has potentially major indirect impacts as 

irresponsible palm oil cultivation has caused—and 

continues	to	cause—significant	environmental	and	

social damage. We understand that our actions and 

business practices pertaining to the support of the 

production	of	sustainable	palm	oil	is	important	and,	

having become an ordinary member of RSPO in 

August	2017,	we	reiterate	our	support	for	the	use	of	

Certified	Sustainable	Palm	Oil	(“CSPO”)	in	products.

Our Approach

During the past year we have engaged with over 

4,500	global	and	local	suppliers	across	our	supply	

chain,	including	manufacturers,	wholesalers,	

retailers,	importer/merchants,	contractors	and	

professional services providers. We recognise that 

sustainability	in	our	own	operations	is	insufficient	

and we have to also work with business partners to 

ensure best practice across our supply chain. 

Circular economy principles include reassessing 

what	is	meant	by	a	‘resource’:	for	example,	one	

organisation’s waste may end up becoming a 

valuable	resource	for	another	organisation.	Hence,	

we look to understand suppliers’ needs and establish 

mutually	beneficial	partnerships	for	circular	economy	

solutions. The Group works closely with our suppliers 

to ensure standards and practices for food safety 

and the environment are maintained throughout the 

value	chain.	For	example,	F&amp;NHB	is	a	member	of	the	

Supplier Ethical Data Exchange and conduct regular 

audits on their suppliers to ensure standards and 

practices for food safety and the environment are 

maintained throughout the value chain.

As a market-leading F&amp;B company, we constantly work with our business partners, suppliers and vendors to 

deliver mutually sustainable solutions that create long lasting value. We also lead by example, encouraging 

others to improve sustainability performance throughout their supply chain.

The following chapter outlines some of the ways we work with and influence other companies. We are 

committed to Sustainable Sourcing and the next chapter explains our process for this.

Since	2013,	our	Thai	dairy	operations	have	

been working with local farmers on improving 

milk	quality.	We	continue	to	introduce	new	

technologies	and	equipment	(for	example,	milk	

machine testers and automatic jet cleaning 

milking	machines)	to	help	farmers	increase	their	

productivity,	improve	milk	quality	and	reduce	

waste	(as	part	of	a	circular	economy	approach).	

Halal Sourcing Partnership Programme

As a major manufacturer of halal products in 

Malaysia,	F&amp;N	recognises	that	it	is	in	a	position	

to facilitate the development of the nation’s halal 

industry. F&amp;NHB and Halal Industry Development 

Corporation signed a memorandum of agreement 

for the Halal Sourcing Partnership Programme. 

We also organised seminars and produced 

quarterly	educational	newsletters	for	them.	

This	year,	we	worked	with	one	of	our	milk	suppliers	

in	Thailand,	to	provide	a	champagne	tank	and	

piping route to the Thepsathit community to tackle 

the water shortage problem during the annual dry 

seasons. Around 50 employees volunteered in this 

programme	and	more	than	200	residents	benefitted	

from this programme.

Through	this	collaboration,	F&amp;NHB	shared	halal	

industry best practices whilst providing technical 

advice and knowledge to small and medium 

enterprises. The programme involved pitching 

sessions in Penang and Kuala Lumpur where 

37 SMEs competed to showcase their products. 

Successful companies then underwent further 

screening,	coaching	and	monitoring	to	elevate	

their	capability	to	be	qualified	as	halal	vendors	for	

multinational corporations.

Highlights

1. Helping 690 farmers in 

improving milk quality by 

sponsoring three milking 

tester machines to three milk 

cooperatives.

2. Organised quarterly 

seminars for 120 farmers 

from four milk cooperatives, 

covering various topics 

including procurement 

policy, quality evaluation, 

cost reduction and long-term 

supply.

3. Supported 45 farmers in the 

cow feed production project, 

using Napier grass for total 

mix ration production to 

improve milk yield and 

reduce cost.

Special Recognition

The Animal Husbandry Association of Thailand has recently recognised Mr. Chatchawal 

Maneetap, Agricultural Business Manager in F&amp;NDT for his work to support the Thai 

animal production industry in Thailand. He contributed to the invention of simple to use 

cleaning equipment for milking machines, for which he received the Thailand Kaizen 

award. Mr. Maneetap also helped to introduce antibiotic and somatic cell count control 

in fresh milk, which is helping farmers nationwide.

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

At F&amp;N, we adopt a holistic approach to health and safety across our operations including creating a proactive 

safety culture and healthy workforce, embodying our brand promise of “Pure Enjoyment. Pure Goodness” 

through product safety and nutrition, as well as enabling consumers to make informed purchasing choices 

through accurate and appropriate labelling and responsible marketing.

The first chapter in this section outlines our approach to Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”), including 

the systems and teams involved. It explains how best practice in OHS is cascaded to all of our employees, and 

how we have set ourselves challenging targets.

Consumer Health and Safety is in focus for the next chapter. F&amp;N’s approach here is embodied by our brand 

promise: “Pure Enjoyment. Pure Goodness.” We will show how we use a range of tools to ensure the safety and 

nutrition of our products.

The final chapter in this section is about labelling and communication: how do we make sure consumers are 

aware of the contents and nutritional qualities of our products.

Our Approach

Working as a team is the only way to achieve our 

aim of zero lost time injury. We cultivate a proactive 

‘safety	first’	culture	for	employees	so	they	are	aware	

of their responsibilities for both themselves and 

their colleagues. This includes advocating a healthy 

lifestyle	through	awareness	of	nutrition,	physical	

activity and stress reduction measures.

To further strengthen our commitment to a safety 

culture,	a)	LTIFR;	and	b)	number	of	Safety	and	Health	

initiatives were incorporated in FY2019 at F&amp;NHB 

as part of shared key performance indicators for all

Safety Pyramid

Creating a Safety Culture

F&amp;N has established ESH systems and monitoring 

processes across our operations. Beyond 

compliance	with	national	regulations,	our	safety	

practices adhere to international standards 

including ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 for our 

major	sites.	All	employees,	workers	and	activities	

are	covered	by	our	ESH	systems,	and	all	workers	

receive	adequate	training	and	safety	equipment	

wherever appropriate. 

Each	plant	has	its	own	Safety	Committee,	with	

membership comprising management and workers. 

And	this	year,	at	F&amp;NHB,	we	have	also	set	up	a	

Safety and Health committee for our corporate 

office	and	regional	sales	offices.	These	committees	

oversee our safety systems and programmes to 

ensure	their	effectiveness	and	meet	every	month	

to discuss accidents or near-misses and determine 

appropriate actions to reduce risks. They also 

conduct	audits	on	our	ESH	systems,	develop	annual	

safety	plans,	and	initiate	programmes	to	increase	

awareness of health and safety issues among 

employees. 

Employees are encouraged to report any 

potential risks or hazards. They can do this 

by informally telling a safety representative or 

supervisor,	or	via	a	more	formal—and	if	preferred,	

anonymous—reporting to their respective safety 

committees. 

On	the	ground,	we	have	Company	Emergency	

Response Teams. They are trained to mobilise 

quickly	and	ensure	the	safety	of	our	employees	

should any incidents occur. 

Throughout	F&amp;N,	all	our	Business	Units	have	

implemented	and	strictly	followed	the	Accident/

Emergency Preparedness and Response 

procedures.

Healthy Workforce

Our	Health	Risk	Assessment	Committee	is	staffed	

with trained personnel who can comprehensively 

review areas where employees may be exposed 

to health risks. We focus on ensuring that an 

environment is conducive to employees’ well-being.

 

Our work environment is enhanced with ergonomic 

facilities	to	prevent	office-related	injuries	and	

includes shower facilities to help employees 

integrate physical activity into their daily work life. 

Employees access company-organised events such 

as	badminton	tournaments	and	Zumba	classes	and	

free medical check-ups. A gym was also set up at 

F&amp;NHB’s	headquarter	office	this	year	to	encourage	

office	employees	to	stay	healthy.	

Air	quality,	brightness,	temperature	and	noise	levels	

are monitored in all our facilities. We conduct regular 

monitoring on noise levels at our facilities. For all 

workers	working	at	area	with	high	noise	level,	we	

provide hearing protector to reduce the noise exposure 

level. We also conduct audiometric tests regularly for 

all	at-risk	workers,	with	follow	up-doctor	consultations	

where	hearing	impairments	were	identified.

In	2019,	325	employees	from	FNFS	attended	a	total	

of 736 hours of OHS training while 99 employees 

from	F&amp;NCM	benefitted	from	819.5	hours	of	

training.	The	training	topics	included:

• 

Fire Prevention and Safety

• 

Chemical and Gas Handling Management

• 

First Aid Training and CPR

•	

Forklift	Driver	Certification

• 

Scheduled Waste

•	

Confined	Space

• 

Electrical Safety

• 

Working at Height

• 

Radiation Safety and Health 

In	FY2019,	we	conducted	a	safety	roadshow	

in Singapore to foster awareness amongst our 

employees on safety topics. Topics presented 

included	driving	safety,	fire	safety	traffic	

management,	occupational	health,	and	healthy	

eating. Over 560 employees attended the event.










75

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

We	have	incorporated	SGSecure	(the	Singapore	

government’s	initiative	to	sensitise,	train	and	

mobilise our communities to prevent and deal with 

a	terror	attack)	into	our	OHS	management	systems.	

This included registering an ‘SGSecure Rep’ with 

the	Ministry	of	Manpower	(“MOM”),	reviewing	our	

Standard Operating Procedures and conducting 

risk assessments to identify terror risks. During 

2019,	we	have	also	provided	SGSecure	training	to	

our employees to increase awareness on how to 

manage our safety and security risks. 

Additionally,	in	order	to	provide	the	employees	with	

easy access to information on rules and regulations 

pertaining	to	security,	safety,	environment	and	health	

in	FNFS,	all	employees	were	issued	a	guidebook	on	

rules,	regulations	and	good	practices	pertaining	to	

security,	safety,	environment	and	health.	

In	Malaysia	and	Thailand,	we	organised	regular	

activities to engage our employees on safety topics. 

Some of these activities included SHE awareness 

week,	an	internal	ISO	45001	audit	and	training,	

monthly newsletter and sharing sessions from local 

regulatory bodies.

All	workers	(employees	and	contractors)	have	

access to occupational health services in relation 

to	their	relevant	activities.	This	includes	hygiene,	

ergonomics,	protective	equipment,	and	first	aid	

kits. F&amp;N is advised by accredited consultants on 

OHS	matters.	For	example,	FNFS	is	advised	by	

Concord Associates who is accredited by both the 

Singapore	Workplace	Safety	and	Health	(“WSH”)	

Council	and	MOM.	The	F&amp;N	Corporate	office	

engages Greensafe International Pte Ltd on OHS 

matters and they are similarly accredited by WSH 

and MOM. Where any work-related health matters 

occur,	F&amp;N	pays	relevant	treatment	costs	and	allow	

for	any	required	time	away	from	work.

We	offer	healthcare	insurance	to	employees	based	

on	staff	category	and/or	job	levels.	Malaysia	and	

Thailand	offer	health	care	for	all	and	we	help	to	

facilitate good health coverage for all workers 

by organising an annual health screening and 

encouraging all employees to participate. Any work-

related illnesses will receive follow-up consultations 

with	doctors,	if	identified.

CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY 

GRI 416-1, 416-2

Consumer Health and Safety is more than a top 

priority,	but	a	core	principle	embedded	in	our	culture.	

We	live	by	our	brand	promise	of	“Pure	Enjoyment.	

Pure	Goodness”	by	producing,	marketing	and	selling	

our brands responsibly and enabling consumers to 

make informed purchasing choices. We consistently 

maintain the highest standards so that customers 

have	full	confidence	when	purchasing	and	

consuming our products.

Our Approach

Quality &amp; Safety

Our 136 years of success are built on mutual trust 

with our consumers and we are committed to 

enhancing	their	future	well-being.	This	requires	a	

holistic approach to safety across the life cycle of our 

products.	In	previous	chapters,	we	have	described	

how consumer health is a key part our innovation 

efforts,	and	about	our	processes	for	suppliers	as	part	

of our food safety assurance. 

In	our	own	operations,	we	adhere	to	all	health	and	

safety regulations applicable to the F&amp;B industry for 

the markets in which we operate. All F&amp;N products 

are manufactured under stringent international 

quality	and	food	safety	standards.	Our	plants	are	

certified	with	FSSC	22000,	ISO	22000	and	HACCP	

Food	Safety	management	systems,	and	all	stages	of	

our production processes are subjected to rigorous 

quality	control	procedures.

Other	certifications	include:	Food	Safety	Management	

System	ISO	22000;	Quality	Management	System	ISO	

9001;	Accredited	Laboratory;	Good	Manufacturing	

Practice;	and	Hazard	Analysis	and	Critical	Control	

Point standards. Our SRMC regularly reviews our key 

risks in relation to Consumer Health and Safety. 

We	are	committed	to	providing	the	highest	quality	

products and ensuing product integrity. From 

manufacturing	to	distribution	and	storage,	we	

protect the entire product lifecycle. In the ‘Packaging’ 

chapter,	we	also	described	how	our	product	

packaging and labelling are designed to ensure our 

customers’ health and safety. 

Apart	from	packaging,	storage	and	distribution	

of products are important to maintain product 

integrity. Our Singapore production facility follows 

strict standard of operation procedures so that 

all our products are stored and transported in 

good	conditions,	such	as	within	the	tolerated	

temperature,	lighting	and	stress	on	packages.	

F&amp;NCM in Malaysia also engages with third party 

experts on cold storages and distribution to ensure 

supply chain security and integrity and maintain 

product	quality.	They	also	conduct	annual	audits	to	

ensure that their storage and distribution are of the 

highest standards.

We facilitate feedback from our customers through 

many communication channels for our customers’ 

convenience. Customers can contact us through 

our product website or by sending us an email 

with	regards	to	their	enquiries.	We	have	also	set	up	

accounts	on	social	media,	such	as	Facebook	and	

Line	application,	for	customers	to	stay	connected	

with us and keep up-to-date on our products. In 

Singapore,	we	have	set	up	a	hotline	for	customer	to	

directly	contact	us	with	their	enquiries.	

We will offer at least one healthier 

choice option in all our product 

categories by 2020

Target: 

We are committed to product quality and food safety and have obtained local and

Halal Assurance 

All	our	products	are	halal	certified	by	the	Department	

of Islamic Development Malaysia and other 

relevant	authorised	certification	bodies.	Each	of	

our	manufacturing	plants	has	a	Halal	Committee,	

responsible for halal compliance in our supply chain 

(from	materials	selection	and	purchasing,	to	the	storage,	

warehousing,	and	transportation	of	our	products).	

During	the	year,	in	Malaysia,	we	held	94	workshop	

sessions	involving	over	1,100	employees	in	

order to raise halal awareness. Employees with 

responsibility in halal matters for F&amp;NHB also 

attended a series of professional training sessions 

related to halal internal audit and assurance. The 

halal awareness training was also conducted to 

their key transporters in 2019. 

We also prohibit non-halal food and drinks within 

factory	premises	including	offices	and	canteens.

Nutrition Charter

To	safeguard	our	consumers’	well-being,	while	at	

the same time providing them with great tasting 

products,	we	are	committed	to	developing	products	

and undertaking initiatives to promote health and 

nutrition. The F&amp;N Nutrition Charter outlines our 

commitment to develop products that are healthy 

for consumers and guides us throughout product 

development. The principles of the Nutrition 

Charter	are:

• 

F&amp;N product developments are led by our group 

philosophy	of	“Pure	Enjoyment.	Pure	Goodness”	

- our commitment to consumers that we will 

deliver products that are not only great-tasting 

but	also	packed	with	nutritional	goodness;

•	

To	develop	products	based	on	proven	scientific	

evidence	and	research,	and	consumer	insights	

and	tastes	relevant	to	evolving	Asian	lifestyles;

• 

To actively self-regulate and ensure 

accountability	via	strong	corporate	governance;

•	

To	provide	safe,	high-quality	and	affordable	

products	to	all	our	consumers;	and

• 

To innovate and renovate to meet the changing 

needs of all our consumers and ensure 

consistent delivery of good taste and the right 

nutritional values.

Towards Healthier Options

We put much emphasis on developing healthier 

products,	such	as	by	adding	vitamins	and	minerals	

to	boost	products’	benefits.	Many	of	our	products	

carry	the	‘Healthier	Choice’	Symbol	or	Logo:

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

Our philosophy of ‘Pure Enjoyment. Pure Goodness’’ 

means innovating constantly to satisfy changing 

consumer	preferences.	For	example,	OYOSHI	tea	

products	are	brewed	from	high	quality	organic	tea	

leaves;	our	soya	bean	milk	is	made	with	first	grade	

non-GMO	(genetically	modified	organisms)	soybeans;	

and none of our products sold in Malaysia and 

Thailand	contain	Partially	Hydrogenated	Oils	(‘trans	

fatty	acids’).	We	provide	alternative	and	healthier	

options by innovating our products for consumers 

with	food	intolerance,	such	as	lactose	free	milk.

Another	aspect	of	the	healthier	offering	is	our	

commitment to reducing sugar content in our 

products.	This	year,	we	have	successfully	re-

formulated	about	90%	of	our	RTD	products	to	below	

the	5g/100ml	sugar	content.	This	included:

• 

Full range of 100PLUS RTD variants

• 

Full range of F&amp;N Fun Flavours Carbonated Soft 

Drinks,	except	F&amp;N	Mixer	

• 

F&amp;N SEASONS Asian Drinks

• 

F&amp;N SEASONS Soya 



Similarly,	in	Singapore,	F&amp;N	also	continues	to	

support the Singaporean Government’s Sugar 

Reduction	Commitment	initiative	by:	

• 

Ensuring that all our RTD beverages contain 

less	than	12g/100ml	of	sugar.

•	

Continuing	to	innovate,	renovate	and	promote	

lower sugar beverages

Since	2004,	F&amp;N	has	taken	deliberate	steps	

in reducing sugar content in our beverages. 

Today,	we	are	pleased	to	report	a	reduction	of	

39%	in	sugar	index	(grams	of	sugar	content	per	

100ml)	across	our	range	of	beverages.	This	also	

represents	an	8%	reduction	against	last	year.

• 

Sugar index is calculated by total volume 

of	sugar	(gram)/total	production	volume	of	

beverages	(million	litre).

•	

39%	reduction	from	FY03/04	to	FY18/19,	

compared	to	31%	reduction	from	last	reporting	

(FY03/04	to	FY17/18)

•	

Decrease	in	FY	18/19	due	to:	product	portfolio	

mix and sugar reduction projects in MY and SG

•	

Beverages	include	Isotonic,	CSD,	Water,	Tea,	

Soya	and	Juice	(Ambient)

Nutrition for Soon-to-be Mothers

This year, BEAR BRAND collaborated with Nestle Mom &amp; Me Club to educate consumers about 

the importance of folate to expecting mothers. Soon-to-be mothers were provided with product 

knowledge during the in-store promotional exercise and servings of BEAR BRAND High Folate 

Sterilised Milk were handed out to mothers who were in their first trimester of pregnancy.

Our Performance Highlights 

In	FY2019,	F&amp;N	maintained	our	health	and	safety	

standards	with	no	significant	incidents	of	non-

compliance	with	regulations	resulting	in	a	fine,	

penalty or warning.

We	are	making	good	progress	towards	offering	at	

least one healthier choice in each RTD product 

category by 2020. There are currently healthier 

options	in	14	out	of	15	(93%)	product	categories.	

We currently do not have a healthier option available 

for the ‘Energy’ product category as we believe that 

reducing the sugar level of our energy drinks too 

drastically would result in a loss of its functionality 

and	purpose,	which	is	to	provide	our	consumers,	

who	require	it,	with	an	energy	boost.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE LABELLING 

GRI 417-1; GRI 417-2

Our packaging and labelling are the primary methods 

by which we communicate information about our 

products’	quality,	nutrition,	safety	and	disposal	to	

consumers. It is therefore essential that our labelling 

is	comprehensive	and	clear,	allowing	our	busy	

customers to make informed purchasing decisions.

Our Approach

Our labelling adheres to Singapore Food 

Regulations as well as to the guidelines set down 

by Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority in Singapore. 

We adhere to the Food Act in Malaysia and all 

requirements	of	the	Food	and	Drug	Administration	

in Thailand. All information disclosed on our 

labels is subject to a review process involving a 

range of internal experts including our R&amp;D and 

Scientific	&amp;	Regulatory	Affairs	teams,	plus	dietician	

advice. Labels are then submitted to government 

authorities	for	verification	and	endorsement.

We	go	beyond	mandatory	requirements	and	for	all	

products	we	provide	information	on	ingredients,	

sourcing,	energy	per	serving	size,	recommended	

daily	allowances	of	the	different	nutritional	

components,	expiry	dates	and	nutrition	tips.	

In order to make it as easy as possible for 

consumers to understand fundamental information 

(calories	and	contribution	to	recommended	daily	

Calorie	intake),	we	include	‘front	of	pack	labelling’	

for most of our ready-to-drink products. 

We take care to ensure that our marketing and 

advertising activities do not violate any ethical 

standards. We adhere to the Malaysian Code of 

Advertising Practice in Malaysia and the Consumer 

Protection	Act	of	B.E.	2522	(1979)	in	Thailand.	

In	Malaysia,	we	are	a	signatory	to	the	‘Responsible	

Advertising to Children’ initiative and have pledged to 

restrict marketing to children under 12 years of age.

1.	 We	are	working	towards	our	target	for	Water	Stewardship	to	reduce	the	water	intensity	ratio	at	our	plants	across	the	Group	by	5%	from	

2017	by	2020	in	FY2019.	We	saw	a	decrease	by	about	4%	on	our	Group	water	intensity	ratio	as	compared	to	FY2017.

2.	 We	have	also	met	our	target	for	Effluents	and	Waste	to	reduce	solid	waste	intensity	ratio	by	5%	across	the	Group	from	2017	in	FY2018.	

We	have	achieved	a	reduction	of	around	25%	on	our	Group	solid	waste	intensity	ratio	as	compared	to	FY2017.

3. We are working towards achieving our targets on Energy and Climate Change of reducing the Group’s energy and GHG emissions 

intensity	ratios	by	5%	between	2017	and	2020.	Our	energy	and	GHG	emissions	intensity	ratios	have	increased	by	about	1%	and	5%	as	

compared to FY2017. 

 

This is mainly due to the commissioning 2 new operation lines at our Shah Alam plant in Malaysia. As they have a higher water and 

energy	consumption,	our	water,	energy	and	GHG	intensity	ratio	would	tend	to	increase	due	to	the	increase	usage.
