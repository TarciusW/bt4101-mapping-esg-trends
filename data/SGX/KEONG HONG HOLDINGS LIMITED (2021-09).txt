CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE 

OFFICER’S MESSAGE

Dear Stakeholders,

We are pleased to present our Sustainability Report (“Report”) for the financial year ended 30 September 2021 

(“FY2021”), which details the Group’s achievements in Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters.

Keong Hong Holdings Limited (“Keong Hong” or “the Group”) recognises that robust corporate governance practices 

underpin a successful sustainability strategy. Good corporate governance has enabled the Group to achieve our 

sustainability goals, navigate changing expectations of our stakeholders with regards to sustainability as well as manage 

risks and opportunities presented by environmental changes. It has also played an important role in ensuring compliance 

with the latest regulatory requirements and in the effective management of the sustainability performance of the Group.

One of the most serious environmental challenges facing us today is climate change. As part of our efforts to contribute 

to global initiatives in combating climate change, we have incorporated the United Nations Sustainable Development 

Goals into this year’s report, highlighting our contributions to the attainment of global sustainability targets including 

the goal of climate action. The Group is also making strides in reducing our emissions footprint; we have entered into 

a renewable energy power purchase agreement at our Chin Bee Factory to utilise solar energy and reduce the carbon 

emissions from our operations. We have also obtained a Green Loan project financing facility for the refurbishment of 

Grand Hyatt Hotel Singapore, which is a Green Mark Platinum project.

We also continued to contribute to the preservation of the natural biodiversity in the Maldives, where comprehensive 

programmes have been developed to minimise waste generation, energy consumption and ensure the survival and 

continued growth of natural coral reefs in the surrounding area which are at risk due to rising global sea temperatures.

Technology has once again played an integral role in elevating our operational, business and sustainability performance. 

We have enhanced our manufacturing and quality management processes with leading-edge cloud technology and 

virtual reality software as part of our continuous drive to innovate. These have enabled us to enhance our workmanship 

and productivity as well as improve the resilience of our operations to business interruptions amid the ongoing COVID-19 

pandemic.

Our customers’ and employees’ safety and well-being are of foremost importance to us given the ongoing pandemic. 

In light of this, the Group’s stringent hygiene measures and safety protocols for our operations remain in place and in 

compliance with the local regulatory requirements of the countries in which we operate.

In conclusion, we would like to thank our stakeholders, especially our business partners and suppliers for their 

contributions to our sustainability efforts.

REPORTING

PRACTICE

Reporting Principles &amp; Statement of Use

This Report has been produced in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards “Core” option 

covering the financial period from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021. The GRI standards were selected as it

SUSTAINABILITY

STRATEGY OVERVIEW

Our Mission

To be a forward-looking company with a commitment to corporate social responsibility, built on a strong foundation 

of transparency, governance and ethics that creates value for our stakeholders.

Our Vision

To build a better world in an environmentally sustainable way and to improve the quality of the environment and the 

communities where we live and work.

Our ESG Strategy and Focus

As a part of our commitment to sustainability, we have obtained Green Financing Facilities for financing green projects 

mainly related to the A&amp;A works to Grand Hyatt Hotel Singapore, which will help it to achieve Green Mark Platinum. 

We adhere to the Green Loan Principles as prescribed by the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association in the key aspects 

regarding the use and management of proceeds, processes for project evaluation and selection and reporting. In 

addition, a power purchase agreement to install solar panels at the Chin Bee Factory will deliver renewable solar energy 

to the factory, further reducing the carbon emissions due to energy use at the factory. This arrangement is expected 

to lead to energy savings and help the Group realise our environmental sustainability goals.

The Group has established a good reputation in the building, construction, and hotel management industries in 

Singapore and Maldives. The Group has leveraged on expansion opportunities, achieved new revenue streams and 

unlocked new capabilities and possibilities while at the same time keeping in mind our sustainability targets. Keong 

Hong has also been lauded for adopting highly innovative solutions to our construction projects to reduce wastage, 

increase efficiency and productivity.

Since December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 has posed unprecedented challenges to the world, with health and 

safety risks remaining elevated in 2021. However, the Group remains vigilant to the potential impact on employees 

and workers and has taken effective occupational health and safety measures to protect their welfare. Robust safety 

measures, such as strict safety guidelines, safety distancing, no-touch Thermal Temperature checks and wearing of 

masks in all of our construction sites, developments and properties including the Kooddoo Airport, Mercure Maldives 

Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort in Maldives, to ensure the health and safety of our guests and 

employees.

In addition, the Group is committed to prevent pollution and injury in all its construction operations and to provide 

customers with reliable, prompt and quality service at competitive cost. We are committed to provide quality products 

and services to meet customer requirements through the timely delivery of projects complying with applicable legal and 

other requirements, quality workmanship, good safety standard and minimising impact to the environment.

Keong Hong is conscious of the impact that our projects have on the environment and shall continue monitoring and 

measuring these impacts. The Group will uphold our energy saving standards and invest in technologies to improve 

waste management and reduce emissions and effluents.

The Group will continue to ensure that our employees have a high standard of employee benefits and that there are 

both racial and gender diversity in our workforce to provide unique perspectives on issues that the Group faces. The 

Group will also continue supporting charitable organisations to improve the welfare of the community.

FOCUS 2:

QUALITY AND INNOVATION

The Group is a leader in adopting leading digital tools and technology technologies in its production processes. 

Technology adoption has enhanced our productivity and improved the quality and productive capacity of our business. 

We aim to foster a digital-first culture and strategy in a bid to evolve and thrive in a digital economy. As part of our 

commitment to quality, we have established a robust quality management system and have been ISO 9001:2015 

certified.

We will continue our sustainability development efforts and improve the quality of our service, and our target is to 

achieve BCA Construction Quality Assessment System (“CONQUAS”) Assessment rating of at least 94.5.

Technology Adoption

GRI 203-1, 203-2

Our construction projects have brought about indirect economic benefits to the local community and the industry 

through the Group’s efforts to enhance quality and productivity through technology integration. Our construction 

projects require the expertise of direct/indirect suppliers and specialists – concrete, reinforcement, tiles/stone and 

furniture which generates business opportunities within and among the supply chain.

We have upgraded our digital capability in Building Information Modelling (“BIM”), Virtual Design and Construction 

(“VDC”) and Virtual Reality (“VR”). We are proud to be one of the pioneers in adopting the Digit-alpha capability 

transformation Programme, a pilot project with VR as a core module sponsored by Info-communications Media 

Development Authority (“IMDA”). With the Digit-alpha Programme, we hope to streamline our operations and transform 

our business processes to improve our workforce productivity and achieve business growth.

Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (“DfMA”) technologies have been fully integrated into our manufacturing 

process. The Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (“PPVC”), PBU and Mechanical Electrical Plumbing 

(“MEP”) module, which improve productivity at construction sites, as the manufacturing of these building components 

can be completed off-site in a safe and controlled environment.





DfMA – Pre-connection between Mechanical, electrical and plumbing service modules

Our in-house PPVC and PBU which we have received in-principle approval (“IPA”) for are developed by K&amp;H Innovative 

Systems Pte Ltd, a joint venture company between Keong Hong Construction Pte Ltd and Ho Lee Construction Pte Ltd. 

We have started supplying PBUs to ongoing projects – The Antares, Sky Everton and Wilshire Residences.

QUALITY AND INNOVATION

Our factory at Chin Bee Road is equipped with a 45T double gantry crane with 14-meter clear lifting height and a 5-ton 

Jib Crane. It has enough capacity to produce PPVC for 10 dwelling units in 14 days or 130 PBUs in 10 days, which works 

out to be 257 dwelling units of PPVC or 4,680 PBUs in a year. The adoption of PPVC and PBU will help to significantly 

reduce our reliance on labour, speed up construction and minimize dust and noise pollution in our construction projects 

as more activities are done off-site.

The Group recognises that our sustainable practices can be a competitive advantage for the Group. We have entered 

into a power purchase agreement to install solar panels on our rooftop at Chin Bee factory. The installed solar panels 

will provide significant energy savings each year that it operates. This will lead to a significant overall reduction in the 

Group’s carbon footprint and will reduce the emissions impact of operational activities carried out at the Chin Bee 

Factory.

PBU units at the Chin Bee Factory



Solar panels will be installed on the roof of Chin Bee 

PBU/PPVC factory. Solar panel installation works expected 

to be completed in year 2022.

On-site Quality Control and Defect Management

In addition, high productivity software based on mobile and cloud technology are used to enhance productivity on-site. 

For example, Novade Quality software was used in the Seaside Residence project to manage the defect rectification 

process during quality inspections, handover and defect liability period for building projects. More of such high 

productivity software shall be utilised for our ongoing and future projects.

BIM 360 is another cloud-based software adopted by the Group to connect project teams and data in real-time, flowing 

from design to construction. This technology supports informed decision-making, leading to more efficient and effective 

work processes.

Remote Off-site Supervision and Progress Monitoring

Keong Hong is an early adopter of cloud-based 360 degrees cameras for monitoring site progress. Paired with Airgo 

Airsquire software, the platform helped to reduce site congregation for site visits and monitoring. With progress photos 

taken like a Google street view, the project team can obtain a 360-degree view of the site remotely. First used in National 

Skin Centre project, the 360-degree camera will continue to be used in the Grand Hyatt Hotel Singapore A&amp;A project.

Electronic Document Management System

With BCA’s drive on Integrated Digital Delivery (“IDD”) for the Built Environment (“BE”) Sector, Keong Hong has joined 

in and embarked on this roadmap by partnering with an IDD Solutions provider to integrate work process and connect 

stakeholders working on the same project throughout the construction and building life-cycle.

The current conventional practice in the BE industry involves manual compilation of physical documents or drawings, 

this paper-based documentation can be tedious. These manual processes can potentially create gaps and loopholes in 

the workflow, which may prolong the submission and approval cycle.

Keong Hong has partnered with Aptiv8 with their solution platform A8 Project Management Information System (“PMIS”) 

Scenario – Electronic Document Management System. A cloud-based platform that centralizes and streamlines processes 

that will be an integrated digitized information exchange. The software is also interfaced with mobile technology, 

collaboration, submission, and change in one platform. Submissions are digitally tracked, monitored, managed, audited 

and archived properly with the aid of the platform. The technology greatly reduces the use of paper-based tasks.

The technology leads to productivity improvement, process cycle time reduction, program transparency and real-time 

visibility. The platform has been adopted for use in the Grand Hyatt Hotel Singapore A&amp;A project.

Keong Hong will continue to innovate and implement new technologies in our operations to benefit our business, our 

industry and the community.

public facilities to improve ventilation and reduce energy use for heating and cooling. Motion sensors are featured in 

our public toilets, fitness centres and other areas of the resort and hotel to conserve energy.

We have installed and started operating the solar energy system at Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman 

Maldives Maamutaa Resort. Solar panels are installed on the roof of Back of House buildings. The estimated capacity 

of the solar system installed is 900 kWp, of which 240 kWp is designated for Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and 

660 kWp for Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort. With this system in place, the amount of diesel required to power 

the Resort has greatly reduced.

The Group is undergoing ongoing discussion to further expand the solar capacity in our operations and investments 

in the Maldives. Our current solar capacity produces 10% and 15% of the power mix at Pullman Maldives Maamutaa 

Resort and Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel respectively. An expanded solar capacity could potentially increase the 

solar share of energy in both properties to 40% with the addition of battery storage for excess solar energy generated

Waste Management

Building and Construction

Keong Hong endeavours to manage waste sustainably by implementing technologies and complying with the code of 

practice.

We minimise construction waste by harnessing advanced technology, including BIM, VDC and VR. These technologies 

pre-empt costly abortive works by first identifying clashes in a virtual environment before the project is actually built. 

High standard of workmanship and quality of works are also achieved through implementation of DfMA technology like 

PPVC and PBU by shifting work to a sheltered and controlled environment. Wherever feasible, construction materials 

used for our projects are certified Green Label by the Singapore Environmental Council. The Group implements 

on-site recycling policies to segregate different types of waste materials so they can be efficiently handled for disposal. 

Surface run-off water is treated before it is discharged to public drains.

Keong Hong is responsible in the disposal of its waste materials by using only approved methods to minimise any 

harm to the environment. Licensed disposal contractors collect excess debris and general waste from construction in 

designated bins for proper disposal. All left over scrap metal from reinforcement bar are segregated and disposed by 

licensed waste collectors. A licensed contractor engaged by our appointed Environment Control Officer periodically 

disposes of timbers that are not reusable.

and bottle crushers. We ensure that proper transportation and waste disposal methods are used in accordance with 

the type of waste.

Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort

At Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel, sewage disposal occurs via a computerised chemical digestive system whereby 

sewage is pumped via a 150,000 litre capacity sewage treatment plant to process it into sludge. On the other hand, 

sewage at Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort is disposed via Membrane Bioreactor system whereby sewage is pumped 

via a 300,000 litre capacity sewage treatment plant to process it into sludge. Once the sludge is dried, it is sent to a 

nearby waste management centre and used for landfill. This system is established for both Mercure Maldives Kooddoo 

Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort, and complies with local standards and accepted code of practices.

We take care in wastewater disposal to ensure that we do not harm the environment during operations. At our 

properties, rejected brine from our RO plants are instantly mixed with the water column to reduce its concentration 

to negligible amounts before being discharged into the lagoon, thus this discharge has no effect on the surrounding 

environment. Sewage is also recycled into portable water to be stored for irrigation usage, and only excess sewage is 

discharged into the sea.

In FY2021, the waste generated at Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort had 

increased compared to FY2020 due to the resumption of activities due to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.

Organic waste composting machine at Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort

Both Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort are equipped with its own organic 

waste composting machine that processes daily food waste ingredients into organic fertilisers. By applying only organic 

compost, it improves the overall soil structure.

We have also reached out to local residents and companies to recycle used cooking and generator oil. Our organisation 

is consistently looking for new options to help improve environmental sustainability.

Kooddoo Airport

In FY2021, the average daily waste generation at Kooddoo Airport was 250 kg, which remains at the same level 

compared to last year.

Recycled Input Materials

GRI 301-2

The Group has undertaken methods to recycle input materials in our projects to reduce wastage and ensure sustainable 

operations.

At Keong Hong, we are committed to using eco-friendly and recycled materials in our construction projects wherever 

possible. We conscientiously use green concrete to replace Ordinary Portland Cement for the construction of permanent 

structures in the Amore and Seaside Residences projects, and 10% of the green concrete is used for superstructure 

works. Together with our use of green material, this translates into reduction in carbon footprint for the construction 

projects as the materials can be recycled. Notably, our Raffles Hospital extension project received a Green Mark Platinum 

rating, which is a testament to our corporate commitment to green practices.

In addition, to minimise wastage, we implement predominantly aluminium system formwork which includes self-climbing 

formwork, vertical safety screen, table form, metal wall and slab formwork for all construction projects on-site, as 

aluminium can be reused with minimal wastage. We also use recycled construction materials like recycled timber and 

plywood for safety barricade, recycled steel hollow section for fabrication and recycled earth control measure tank and 

filtration systems to control water discharge drainage for temporary works.

The Group strives to incorporate green materials in all our projects. We engage Joe Green Panels, a provider of green 

concrete block and wall panels, extensively in all our projects. Their products have been rated as a leader for green 

building product certification issued by the Singapore Green Building Council as well as being certified by the Singapore 

Environment Council.

Noise and Vector Management

GRI 413-1

The Group strives to manage noise arising from construction activities by using a set of permissible noise limits and 

Noise Management Plans (“NMP”) compliant with National Environment Agency (“NEA”) Noise Regulation. To achieve 

minimization of noise, the Group has engaged a noise control vendor to perform real time noise monitoring to ensure 

that the noise generated does not exceed the allowable limit NEA. Noise barriers are erected around the site to reduce 

noise from the construction equipment. Generators used on site are required to be ‘silent’ generators, so that noise 

generated is reduced.

The Group implements vector control plans at our sites to combat the issue of pest and mosquito breeding. Daily 

on-site housekeeping checks are conducted to control and pre-empt mosquito breeding. To further mitigate mosquito 

breeding, the Group engages pest control companies to manage our construction sites to clamp down on mosquito 

breeding. Allocation and implementation of proper disposal systems for construction debris and organic waste are in 

place to facilitate pest control.

There have been 2 instances of non-compliance, monetary fines or warnings regarding vector breeding or noise pollution 

from NEA.

Protecting Biodiversity

GRI 304-2, 304-3

Keong Hong endeavours to protect and preserve the environment during our operations, by putting initiatives in place 

to ensure we operate sustainably.

The Group has engaged specialists to preserve the vibrant biodiversity of the environment in Maldives. Before excavation 

and construction commence, our specialists will transplant corals from all project sites to safe areas. The Group has 

plans to set up a coral conservation programme at the resort which includes a coral garden and coral nursery to preserve 

the coral reef. We endeavour to maintain the good condition of the coral colonies in the vicinity of our operations. 

Planting of corals under the rooms will only commence after all construction activities are completed to prevent any 

unnecessary coral stress and bleaching.

FOCUS 3:

OUR ENVIRONMENT

Due to the high volume of marine recreation activities at Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort, the Group has undertaken 

several initiatives to manage environmental impacts for all operations in Maldives. To circumvent any damage to the 

coral reef through the use of boats and marine equipment, the Group has imposed rules on boat operators on the 

island such as anchoring, boat operation, boat sewage and garbage disposal. For tourists engaging in recreational 

activities, strict rules on activities such as fishing, marine wildlife viewing, snorkelling and scuba diving, have been 

established and enforced.

In an effort to ensure that our environmental protection efforts are regulated and implemented properly, we went the 

extra mile to perform Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) on the Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort project, 

and we successfully attained EIA approval in 2015. The EIA addendum was submitted and approved prior to the 

commencement of coral gardening works and revision of Concept Masterplan for both Mercure Maldives Kooddoo 

Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort. As such, proper precautionary measures have been implemented to 

guarantee environmental and biodiversity sustainability during operations.

In FY2021, we transplanted corals from our coral nursery to the Ocean Water Villa and Underwater villa to showcase 

our coral nursery to the guests from the comfort of their rooms. Marine life, including lionfish, octopus and boxfish 

were added for biodiversity.

that are essential to their jobs. At Kooddoo Airport, all staff are trained to use SMS, a software that enables them to 

better manage the airport using data collected from the field. Other than training programs to make operations more 

efficient, we also conducted Aviation Security Command (“AVSECOM”) awareness training program for all staff to 

educate them on aviation security to enforce proper national security measures at the airport. Selected staff are sent 

for Fire Fighting Training Course as part of the aviation requirement. As we prioritise workplace safety, employees from 

the Safety department received basic and advanced incident investigation trainings to equip them with the knowledge 

and skills to conduct safety inspections to identify and manage hazards and potential risks.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

Supplier Management

GRI 308-1, 308-2, 408-1, 408-2, 414-1, 414-2

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, our sites experienced various supply chain disruptions. Factory closures due to 

COVID-19 infection, as well as delays in shipments due to transport restrictions particularly our suppliers in Malaysia 

and China. These have led to delays in our National Skin Centre Project. We have since increased the manpower and 

resources dedicated to the Project to mitigate the delays.

Building and Construction

At Keong Hong, we take pride in our efforts to ensure that our suppliers and subcontractors are selected based on high 

quality and environmentally friendly practices. Before awarding contracts, we evaluate our suppliers and subcontractors 

based on their track record, workmanship, ISO certifications and safety performance. We select those with satisfactory 

scores, and for some who are relatively new and failed the supplier assessment, we will monitor their site performance 

to ensure accountability and quality assurance.

During contract term, we continue to assess suppliers based on their compliance with material specification/standards, 

response to replacement of defective material/emergency and their Green and Gracious practices. As for subcontractors, 

we assess their technical capability, safe performance and Green and Gracious practices. These continuous assessments 

show our commitment to maintain quality and sustainability of our operations.

In addition, subcontractors and external service providers procure materials and services for our contracts and project 

activities, we execute purchase control to ensure that they meet the needs of our project requirements during 

procurement. We go the extra mile in supplier management to ensure quality, accountability and sustainability in our 

supply chain.

We exercise stringent control at site level via biometric system to ensure only valid work permit holders can gain 

entry to the project site. Regular checks are conducted by our HR executive to ensure that only workers with current 

worksite residential address are allowed to stay on-site. We mandate that our contractors and sub-contractors comply 

with labour regulations in Singapore.

Mercure Maldives Kooddoo Hotel and Pullman Maldives Maamutaa Resort

When selecting suppliers, we entrust the recommendations from our internationally renowned hotel operator, AccorHotel 

(“Accor”), with their abundance of experience in the Maldives region. We evaluate and select suppliers that are approved 

and recommended by our hotel operator.

The suppliers have gone through stringent checks to ensure that they comply with local regulations and sourcing of 

raw materials are done ethically and in an environmentally friendly manner. We also regularly review the supplies 

procured to ensure that sustainable products are used. For instance, at Maamutaa Resort, the procured bed sheets, 

duvet and pillow covers are eco-friendly textile products certified according to Oeko-Tex Standard 100 technology. 

The Oeko-Tex Standard 100 is a globally uniform testing and certification system for textile products which covers 

multiple human-ecological attributes, and textile products may be certified according to Oeko-Tex Standard 100 only if 

all components strictly meet the required ecological criteria without exception. This shows our commitment to ensure 

a sustainable supply chain.

We have plans to start screening suppliers ourselves instead of through our hotel operator for future jobs to ensure 

quality, accountability and social responsibility within our supply chain.

FOCUS 6:

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

In addition, Accor ensures strict compliance with the local legal framework, as well as various fundamental documents 

including International Labour Organisation’s fundamental conventions and the ten principles of the United Nations 

Global Compact. As such, Accor exercises strict due diligence when assessing their suppliers and service providers to 

ensure they are not at risk for incidents of child labour or forced or compulsory labour. In the event of non-compliance 

with local labour laws, Accor would immediately sever all ties with the supplier or service provider in question.

We entrust Accor with the hotel supplier management as they have expertise in that area. Majority of our suppliers are 

approved and recommended by our hotel operator. The suppliers have gone through stringent checks to ensure there 

is no child or prisoner labour. We have plans to start screening suppliers ourselves for future jobs to ensure quality 

and accountability.

Kooddoo Airport

To ensure compliance with Maldives labour regulations, our HQ key personnel regularly visit the Kooddoo airport site 

to conduct operational audit with the assistance of our local legal advisor.

OUR COMMUNITY

Since the Group’s beginning, we have recognised that giving back to our community is an ongoing commitment and a 

significant part of our efforts to make a difference to society. The Group achieves this aim through empowering local 

communities where we operate and finding opportunities to maximise social impact.

Market Presence

GRI 202-2, 204-1

Keong Hong strives to empower the local community through increasing employment opportunities for airport, resort 

and hotel operations in Maldives. 98% of the staff at the Kooddoo Airport are hired from the local community, including 

all senior management staff.

Keong Hong has implemented various practices to ensure that our operations bring benefits to the local economy and 

businesses. We endeavour to create more business opportunities for local suppliers. As such, we make a conscientious 

effort to procure from local suppliers directly, such as consumables, fire-fighting and medical equipment.

In addition, with our Kooddoo Airport expansion, the airport can accommodate more planes including private jets. 

Locals also access more convenient means of transport, and tourists can travel to resorts near Kooddoo via transit at 

the airport. This will help to promote the local tourism industry development and create more jobs for the locals. To 

date, 219 Maldivians have been hired for the resorts and airport operations, and we intend to continue improving 

airport facilities to meet future demand.

Corporate Social Responsibility

GRI 413-1

In the spirit of giving back to the community, the Group has funded charitable organisations that focus on caring for 

the underprivileged, community chests, societies and religious communities. In FY2021, the Group has donated to 

various charitable organisations and beneficiaries including SingHealth Fund, Singapore National Eye Centre Fund and 

Touch Community Services Ltd as well as an individual beneficiary.

We sponsor deserving staff for scholarships in tertiary education. For example, the Group sponsored a staff from National 

Skin Centre for his Masters Construction Management at Nanyang Technological University. We continue our Institute 

of Technical Education (“ITE”) scholarship by sponsoring two ITE students for the year 2021 as part of our support 

for the government initiative for the ITE Work-Learn Technical Diploma programme. We pledge to continue with our 

efforts in developing and upgrading our staff and workers.

In FY2020, we had two new BIM modellers who successfully completed a 3-month career trial under the Workforce 

Development Agency and Ministry of Social and Family Development which encourages employers to train and hire 

persons with disabilities (“PWD”).  Both have been trained and are now our permanent employees. As at 30 September 

2021, we have two PWDs that are permanently employed in the Group.

OUR COMMUNITY

We also donated to other charitable and social causes such as Singapore Association for Mental Health and The 

Singapore Scout Association. The Group places emphasis on dedicating resources towards the development of local 

communities and future leaders by investing in educational institutes and bursaries.

More recently, we have worked closely with United Nations Development Programme (“UNDP”) to contribute to global 

efforts to achieve the UN SDGs to create sustainable localised solutions to the population. We have received several 

appreciation letters commending our efforts and commitment to the UNDP. Both resorts in Maldives have achieved 

platinum status in Planet 21, Accor’s sustainable green platform. 

Keong Hong will continue with our contributions to the community and fulfil our duty as a socially responsible 

corporation.
