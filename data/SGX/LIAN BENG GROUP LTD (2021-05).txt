SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

BOARD STATEMENT

We are pleased to present Lian Beng Group Ltd (“Lian Beng” or “the “Company”, together with 

its subsidiaries, the “Group”) annual Sustainability Report for our financial year ended 31 May 2021 

(“FY2021”). 

The Board of Directors (“Board”) and the key management team are directly involved in identifying 

the Group’s Economic, Environmental, Social and Governance (“EESG”) factors, planning and 

strategising the sustainability initiatives to minimise EESG risks. 

The Sustainability Reporting Task Force, comprising senior management executives from key 

functions and business units, plan, implement and review the sustainability initiatives and assists 

the Board to:

i) 

Establish the framework for data collection, monitoring and reporting; 

ii) Identify the stakeholder concerns and expectation through consultation and cooperation 

between management, employees and stakeholders;

iii) Identify potential EESG risks and opportunities arising from the business activities.

The availability of EESG data enables sustainability reporting to gain a greater significance to 

investors. Apart from being an image-building exercise, it is widely recognised that good EESG 

practices do contribute to the overall long-term success of the Company, and play an important 

part in the competition for talent and investment. 

In defining our reporting content, we applied the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”)’s principles 

by considering the Group’s activities, impact and substantive expectations and interests of its 

stakeholders. We observed a total of four principles, namely materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, 

sustainability index and completeness. For reporting quality, we observed the principles of balance, 

comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability. 

The EESG data and information provided in this report have not been verified by an independent 

third-party and were derived from internal data monitoring and verification to ensure its accuracy. 

We may seek external assurance in the future.

FY2021 was a year of adaptation and adjustments, as we worked hard to overcome manpower 

and operational challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank all our 

stakeholders for their support and we will continue to closely monitor our operations to address 

and adapt with this challenging situation. Please find our COVID-19 related disclosures throughout 

this report.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

Our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant EESG factors. Such factors are 

then prioritised and validated through our stakeholder engagement questionnaires conducted 

every three years. The result of this process will determine the list of material EESG factors which 

are disclosed in the Sustainability Report. 

We engaged our employees, subcontractors, suppliers and customers, seeking their feedback for 

prioritisation of each EESG factors through the questionnaires distributed. In order to determine a 

material factor, we assessed its potential impact on the economy, environment and society and its 

influence on the stakeholders. 

In FY2021, we review and ascertain that the material EESG factors remain the same.

ECONOMIC TOPICS

The Group’s financial performance are discussed in detail in the FY2021 Annual Report, please refer 

to the following sections in our FY2021 Annual Report: 

• 

Chairman’s statement, page 2 to 7

• 

Financial Highlights, page 16 to 17 

• 

Operations Review, page 19 to 24

• 

Financial Statements, page 64 to 179.

The COVID-19 pandemic has generated unprecedented operational challenges to the Group. Lian 

Beng has established a Business Continuity Task Force, to plan and to take immediate actions to 

address the evolving challenges. The Task Force follow up closely with the rules and regulations 

implemented by the Singapore government, plan reactive measures to minimise the business 

disruption and support the recovery efforts. 

REMAINING RESILIENT 

Moving forward, operating conditions in the construction sector are expected to remain challenging. 

The pace of construction activities is likely to be constrained by manpower shortage and deployment 

challenges, in view of the prevailing COVID-19 situation in the region. The foreign worker labour 

crunch and the resultant higher labour cost are anticipated to pose challenges to business recovery. 

We will closely monitor the delivery of our projects on hand, and will continue to prudently manage 

the costs in the year ahead through our Group-wide cost management measures. As Singapore 

is moving towards living with COVID-19 and effect a gradual economic recovery, we will leverage 

on our track record and capabilities to return to higher levels of growth and productivity. We also 

look forward to participating in project tenders at the opportune time, to strengthen our financial 

position. 

Our longstanding strategy to build diversified income streams has strengthened our ability to 

withstand prevailing challenges. We will continue to explore business opportunities in the region, in 

a cautious and prudent manner, for sustainable growth.

ECONOMIC TOPICS

INNOVATION AND EXCELLENCE

The Group has made investments in technologies such as telescopic handler, automatic wheel 

washer and biometric systems to increase our productivity on-site and save manpower on menial 

tasks. We also incorporated the use of Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (“PPVC”) 

and Prefabricated Bathroom Units (“PBU”), as part of the Design for Manufacturing &amp; Assembly 

(“DfMA”). DfMA is a relatively new approach in the construction industry whereby more work is 

brought off-site, manpower and time needed to construct buildings are reduced while ensuring 

work sites are safe, conducive and have minimal impact on the surrounding living environment of 

the project sites. 

With the bulk of the installation activities and manpower moved off-site to factory-controlled 

environment, the use of PPVC and PBU reduce dust and noise pollution at the project sites while 

achieving productivity improvement and worksite safety. We have also automated the rebar 

fabrication processes to increase efficiency and accuracy for use in construction projects. This has 

helped to reduce the level of wastage in the rebar fabrication process.

LIAN BENG GROUP LTD

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

ENVIRONMENTAL TOPICS 

We believe in protecting the environment for the sake of our future generations. Lian Beng is a 

committed and environmentally responsible partner in the communities we operate in to ensure 

a safe, efficient and environmentally conscious operating environment. The Group believes in 

building a practical ‘green’ future by minimising the adverse impact on the environment associated 

with our construction activities.

Lian Beng’s risk and sustainability-based strategies are geared to assess, avoid, reduce and mitigate 

environmental risks and negative impacts. Our Environmental Policy and Guideline (“EPG”) 

provides the overall framework to ensure that natural resources are efficiently used throughout the 

conservation of energy and water, and minimise the waste by reducing, reusing and recycling where 

possible. The EPG applies to all the Group’s business segments. 

We are also a proponent of the Green and Gracious Builder Scheme (“GGBS”) initiated by BCA. 

The GGBS Scheme was introduced to raise the environmental consciousness of builders, promote 

environmental protection and gracious practices during the construction period. The adoption of 

the GGBS by the Group has raised the level of environmental consciousness among the project 

team and also helps to align all entities within the Group towards the discharge of our environmental 

responsibilities. 

In the construction industry, energy, water, material consumption and waste disposal are dependent 

on the volume and different stages of the construction activities. Although there were 10 on-going 

construction projects in FY2021 as compared to 9 in FY2020, the construction activities in FY2021 

were lower than FY2020 due to the ongoing pandemic. This was mainly due to the slow pace of 

work resumption amid manpower shortage arising from tighter border measures, disruptions in 

manpower deployment due to the workers’ movement control, as well as additional safe management 

measures implemented at the worksites. Hence, the energy and water consumption in FY2021 were 

lower than in FY2020. However, the waste disposal was higher in FY2021 as compared to FY2020 as 

some projects were at its peak of construction phase, or were entering into completion phase where 

project sites were cleaned up, and hence more construction waste were collected.

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS MANAGEMENT 

We are committed to working closely with our stakeholders to manage our carbon footprint. Improving 

energy efficiency by managing carbon emissions is one of the crucial elements in addressing climate 

change. Therefore, we will continue to minimise energy consumption by constructing well-designed 

projects that will aid in reducing gas emissions. Energy and emissions intensity ratios are calculated 

for the Group to better assess emissions efficiency. 

Our 2-year Performance 

We have achieved the target we set last year and noted a decrease in our consumption mainly due 

to lower business activities across all business segments compared to FY2020 due to the ongoing 

pandemic.

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

Lian Beng is certified as a Green and Gracious Builder (Excellent). Environmentally friendly initiatives 

are incorporated into building designs and implemented during the construction period. All projects 

undertaken by Lian Beng have been Green Mark Certified. Martin Modern, a project that was 

completed in FY2021 was certified “Gold Plus” and the ongoing project Defu Industrial City was 

certified “Platinum” for efforts in environmental protection. 

There were 10 ongoing projects in FY2021, where energy consumption totalled 2,879,000 kWh and 

CO2 emissions were 2,040,300 kg. With construction projects having a combined GFA of 820,954 

m2, the total energy and emission intensity ratios were 3.51 kWh/m² and 2.49 kg/m² respectively. 

There was a decrease of 5,210,200 kWh in FY2021 total energy consumption as compared to 

FY2020 of 8,089,200 kWh. The significant decrease in energy consumption was attributed to lower 

construction activities due to the ongoing pandemic.

Our Target

For all relevant business units, we are expecting an increase in the energy consumption in correlation 

with the increase in business activities in the next financial year.

LIAN BENG GROUP LTD

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

ENVIRONMENTAL TOPICS 

The Group has a rebar division that processes fabricated reinforcement bars and supports 

construction projects of the Group as well as third parties. The rebar division has consumed a total 

energy consumption of 46,000 kWh and CO2 emissions of 32,600 kg. With the energy consumption, 

the production per kWh is 0.41 Mt/kWh.  

We strive to reduce total energy use on-site by introducing energy-saving equipment, including 

solar panels to power equipment such as noise meters, and earth control measures. Energy-saving 

air conditioning units and motion sensors were also installed in less frequently used areas to further 

conserve energy. In FY2021, we have successfully conserved a total of 279,700 kWh of energy, 

which is equivalent to 198,200 kg in CO2 emissions as compared to 162,300 kWh of energy and 

114,800 kg in CO2 emissions in FY2020. 

READY-MIX CONCRETE

For the manufacturing of ready-mix plants, we are committed to reduce energy consumption through 

process improvement by using resources and equipment to optimise energy usage. Our energy 

consumption for ready-mix concrete was 2,147,800 kWh and an average of energy consumption 

per cubic meter of concrete of 4 kWh/m3 in FY2021. 

There was a 11% decrease in energy consumption as compared to FY2020 where our energy 

consumption was 2,400,100 kWh and an average of energy consumption per cubic meter of 

concrete of 4 kWh/m3. The decrease in energy consumption was mainly due to the reduction of 

construction activities as a result of the ongoing pandemic. 

INVESTMENT HOLDING

The total energy consumption for the investment holding amounted to 11,500,900 kWh and the 

corresponding CO2 emissions were 8,150,500 kg in FY2021. There was 13% decrease as compared 

to the energy consumption and CO2 emissions in FY2020 at 13,268,500 kWh and 9,381,400 kg in 

CO2 emissions. 

The decrease in energy consumption was mainly due to (i) ongoing efforts to optimise equipment 

efficiency in our repair and maintenance plans, (ii) reduced equipment usage due to work-from-

home arrangements and lower occupancy for office units, (iii) reduction in shopper footfall amid 

periods of closure or restrictions to business operations being implemented due to safe management 

measures at retail mall.  

DORMITORY BUSINESS

For our purpose-built dormitory Westlite Mandai, we have implemented several energy-saving 

initiatives to reduce energy consumption hence we have achieved some energy savings. In FY2021, 

total energy consumption for the dormitory was 3,082,300 kWh and the corresponding CO2 

emissions was 2,184,400 kg, which was 14% lower as compared to the consumption in FY2020 at 

3,563,400 kWh and CO2 emissions of 2,519,500 kg respectively. The decrease was mainly due to 

the lower average occupancy rates in FY2021.

WATER MANAGEMENT

Water is a scarce resource in Singapore and it is an important resource that we have to conserve. 

Our water conservation measures include collecting rainwater to reduce the demand for fresh water, 

as well as reusing and recycling water across our businesses. 

Our 2-year Performance 

In FY2021, we have achieved the target we set last year and noted a decrease in our consumption 

mainly due to lower business activities across all business segments compared to FY2020 due to 

the ongoing pandemic.

Our Target

The Group remains committed in continuing our water conservation efforts and make improvements 

to our water-reclaiming processes. For all relevant business units,  we are expecting an increase in 

the water consumption in correlation with the increase in business activities.

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

Earth Control Measures (“ECM”) are implemented across all of our construction sites. In FY2021, 

approximately 15% (145,054 m³) [FY2020: 15% (89,041 m³)] of ECM-collected treated water are 

reused as a secondary source by construction projects for general purposes such as vehicle washing, 

watering of access pathways as well as washing of workers’ toilets. This practice has allowed us to 

maximise the use of rainwater collected. In addition, the use of pre-cast concrete has significantly 

reduced the need of using the on-site water.

Targets for water usage are set and water meters are also installed to track water usage at all project 

sites. In FY2021, the 10 construction projects have utilised a total of 197,600 m³ of water against 

the GFA of 820,954 m2. There was a slightly decrease of 18,700 m³ in FY2021 water consumption 

as compared to FY2020 at 216,300 m³ against the GFA of 768,617 m2. The decrease in water 

consumption corresponded to the slow in resumption of construction activities subsequent to the 

Circuit Breaker.

READY-MIX CONCRETE

In FY2021, 58,400 m³ of water was consumed in the manufacturing of ready-mix concrete. There 

was a decrease in water consumption as compared to FY2020 at 136,700 m³. The decrease of water 

consumption was mainly due to lower business activities as a result of the ongoing pandemic. 

INVESTMENT HOLDING

In FY2021, water consumption for the investment holding amounted to a total of 82,600 m³. There 

was a decrease as compared to the water consumption in FY2020 at 112,100 m³. The decrease was 

mainly attributed to lower footfall from work-from-home arrangements for office units, home-based 

learning arrangements of the commercial school, and intermittent periods of closure or slower 

business operations due to implementation of various safe management measures at the retail 

malls.

DORMITORY BUSINESS

There are several ongoing initiatives in place for water conservation, such as education on water-

saving habits at the dormitories. Our purpose-built dormitory Westlite Mandai has incurred a total 

water consumption of 336,800 m³ in FY2021. The water consumption was a decrease as compared 

to FY2020 at 390,400 m³. This was mainly due to decrease in capacity as a result of the outbreak of 

COVID-19.

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

Silt and sediment control is a key element in our water resources management strategy. As a measure 

to preserve the quality of water, ECM is implemented across all of our construction sites. The ECM 

that is currently implemented at all of our construction project sites is designed by Qualified Earth 

Control Professional (“QECP”) as part of the requirements to prevent earth and silt from being 

discharged into public drains that could lead to water catchment areas. 

The ECM takes into consideration factors such as erosion control, sediment control and treatment. 

The QECP will monitor the capacity of the treatment equipment, storage tanks and implementation 

measures during the construction period.

Our 2-year Performance 

In FY2021, we have achieved the target we set last year.

WATER DISCHARGE TREATMENT 

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

One of the ECM’s functions is to filter collected rainwater within the project site. The collected water 

containing mud and silt will be treated by the equipment through chemical filtering or membrane 

system filtering before being discharged into the common public drainage outside the development. 

We have installed Total Suspended Solids (“TSS”) web-based monitoring system at the water 

discharge points to ensure the TSS reading of treated water will not exceed 50 mg/l. The discharged 

water will be monitored by the TSS web-based monitoring system and the user will be alerted if 

the reading exceeds the requirement. Following this, corrective measures will have to be taken to 

address the issue. The treated water will then flow through the public drainage system into our 

catchment areas.

Our 2-year Performance 

We have achieved our FY2021 target of TSS reading of treated water not exceeding 50 mg/l.

WASTE DISPOSAL 

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

Construction wastes from each project are collected by NEA-licensed waste collectors. Construction 

wastes collected by these operators are categorised and segregated accordingly at their respective 

yards before being transported to government landfills or incinerators. Materials such as wood and 

rubber are sent to recycling yards. In FY2021, we have observed a significant increase in construction 

waste collected for disposal totalled 23,200 tonnes (FY2020: 11,800 tonnes). This was mainly due to 

some projects were at its peak of construction phase or were entering into completion phase where 

project sites were cleaned up, and hence more construction waste were collected. 

There was an increase in the total amount of concrete waste collected of 1,700 tonnes (FY2020: 

1,200 tonnes). This was due to some projects are at its peak of construction and commencement 

of new project.   

For our rebar division, rebar wastage will be salvaged for other use. Any further wastage will be 

disposed through authorised scrap dealers.

NOISE MANAGEMENT

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

During the planning and design stage of the construction projects, Lian Beng will engage 

acoustic consultants to evaluate whether the expected noise to be generated during the 

construction site will exceed the noise limits stipulated by NEA. The acoustic consultants 

will conduct a Noise Impact Assessment (“NIA”), to calculate and forecast the noise that 

will be generated at the construction sites. 

Based on the results of the NIA, the acoustic consultants will recommend a Noise 

Management Plan (“NMP”) that will cover the entire period of the construction project. 

Our Project Manager will oversee and monitor noise control throughout the construction 

period based on the NMP. 

The NMP caters to different phases of the construction project and provides appropriate 

noise mitigation/control measures for each construction activity. It also recommends 

noise mitigation measures for the machinery and equipment that will be utilised during 

the different phases of construction activities. To effectively control the noise level of our 

construction activities, a continuous noise monitoring on-site is adopted and this can be 

accessed by both the contractor and NEA online. 

To further enhance our noise management effectiveness, Lian Beng appoints designated 

staff and establishes feedback channels for each project and to manage complaints 

from surrounding residents via flyers, notices and letters to keep them updated on our 

construction works. We have also installed project signboards for similar purposes, with 

contact numbers included for convenient access by residents nearby.

VECTOR MANAGEMENT

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

The construction industry play a part to curb dengue transmission and protect our 

workers and residents around work sites against dengue disease. Vector control plans are 

currently implemented at every project site to prevent mosquito breeding to protect the 

construction site personnel and members of the public from mosquito-borne diseases. 

We will continue to make assurance that all of our construction site workers are well-

educated and well-aware of the harmful effects of mosquito breeding. Lian Beng will also 

continue to cultivate good practices, conduct routine checks and engage pest control 

companies to carry out regular insecticide spraying to prevent any possible breeding of 

vectors.

VISION TOWARDS AN ACCIDENT-FREE WORK CULTURE 

The safety and well-being of our staff are of paramount importance and should never be compromised. 

At Lian Beng, we have implemented comprehensive Workplace Health and Safety Policy to ensure 

workplace safety as well as measures that encourage personal ownership of each employee’s workplace 

health and safety. The Workplace Health and Safety Committee, led by the Project Director, provides 

oversight of all workplace health and safety practices within the organisation. Our efforts in WSH have 

been recognised by BCA and Workplace Safety and Health Council.

The Group makes use of technologies that are readily available to ensure work safety is monitored 

on a real-time basis. Workers are also encouraged to report any deviations from best practices at 

the construction sites for such lapses to be rectified immediately.

Against COVID-19

In HQ, we monitor our employees’ health status closely. We perform regular Antigen 

Rapid Test (“ART”) and ensure our employees comply with safe management 

measures. 

For our construction workers, we conduct regular ART at the dormitories and 

work sites. We also follow BCA guidelines to reduce intermixing and avoid cross-

infection of workers. For example, workers are segregated into different site teams 

by different site zone. The living space at the dormitory have increased and the 

shared facility are segregated. Additional shower facilities are installed so that the 

workers only use the shared facilities assigned to them. Improvements are also to 

be made to the workers’ welfare and well-being, and to ensure safe distancing
