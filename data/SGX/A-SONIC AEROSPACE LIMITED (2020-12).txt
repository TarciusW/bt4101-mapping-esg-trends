1.2 

Board Statement [102-14] 

 

Dear Stakeholders 

 

The United Nations adopted its Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”), 

officially known as “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development”.  These bold moves cover four broad dimensions as part of a 

global 

vision 

for 

sustainable 

development: 

(i) 

Inclusive 

Economic 

Development; (ii) Inclusive Social Development;   (iii) Environmental 

Sustainability; and (iv) Peace and Security. 

 

We are on uncharted waters. Covid-19 is expected to continue for most of 

2021 year, and may be, well beyond.  

 

Coupled with Covid-19 and the fear of future pandemics, we encounter two 

simultaneous complications: (i) the economic turbulence on global scale; and 

(ii) that of a new future that we must adapt to. Market demand, supply chains, 

and the way work is organised, are all rapidly changing. 

 

We believe that sustainability is the foundation of good management practices, 

and serves to guide us: 

 

(i) 

to achieve long-term economic value for our business; 

 

(ii) 

how our actions and solutions help people - our employees, customers, 

suppliers, and the community; and 

 

(iii) 

to conduct our business ethically. 

 

While we operate an ongoing, pragmatic basis, we commit, albeit in our small 

way, to make the world a better place for all.   

The three pillars that motivate and inspire us in our sustainability efforts are: 

 

(i) 

Performance – Provide solutions to our customers and leverage on 

innovative technology to develop sustainable long-term economic 

value for our business; 

 

(ii) 

People – Cultivate inclusion and holistic wellness of our staff members, 

their families and the community; and 

 

(iii) 

Ethical Conduct – Integrity of our employees.

report.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH 

 

 

2.1 

Sustainability Governance [102-18] 

 

The A-Sonic Board of Directors delegates authority for day-to-day 

management of economic performance, people and environmental topics to 

the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”).  The CEO leads the Executive Directors. 

 

With guidance from the Board of Directors, the CEO, supported by the other 

Executive Directors, set the A-Sonic sustainability strategy, and drive 

progress company-wide.  These executive leaders also provide the interface 

to our business segments. 

 

The Executive Directors further delegate our relevant sustainability 

commitments relating to economic, people and ethics, to each business head 

to embed these into our activities and operations. 

 

Our Board-level Committee meets annually to review the effectiveness of our 

sustainability strategy, and seek areas for further improvement. 

 

 

2.2 

Stakeholders [102-40] [102-42] [103-1] 

 

Within this sustainability approach, A-Sonic takes broader economic, 

governance and social aspects into account.  Our focus is to deliver long-term 

value for all our stakeholders: employees, customers, suppliers, investors and 

community in which we operate on an on-going, pragmatic basis.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

 

 

 

3.1 

Management Approach to Economic Performance [103-2] 

 

 

 

Economic performance is defined as our most material aspect because, like 

most companies, our economic success enables the execution of our 

sustainability strategies. 

 

 

Our primary role in society is to build an integrated team in diverse markets 

working to provide seamless aviation and logistics solutions.  We currently 

operate in 29 cities in 16 countries, spanning four (4) continents in Asia, North 

Americas, Sub-Continent India, and Europe.  We provide employment to over 

650 staff as at 31 December 2020. [102-7] 

 

 

3.2 

Economic Performance [103-2] [103-3] 

 

3.2.1 Aviation Business 

 

 

Our aviation business recorded Loss attributable to equity holders of the 

Company of US$1.872 million in financial year (“FY”) 2020. Turnover 

decreased by US$5.095 million from US$5.164 million in FY 2019 to 

US$0.069 million in FY 2020, resulting from the sale of landing gears of an 

aircraft.  We will continue to pursue potential buyers globally for our aircraft 

and aircraft engines. 

 

 

Our aviation business deals with sale and purchase of aircraft, and aircraft 

engines.  We deal with owners of aircraft and aircraft engines around the 

world (“Suppliers”).  We engage with the Suppliers through emails and tele-

communication. [102-9] 

 

 

Our aviation business contributes to sustainability by adopting the following: 

[102-12] 

 

 

Verifying that the suppliers we deal with adopt anti-corruption and anti-

bribery practices. 

 

 

We select aircraft and aircraft engine suppliers based on the safety 

certification for each aircraft or aircraft engine, including the parts or 

components in compliance with Federal Aviation Administration 

(“FAA”) and/or European Aviation Safety Agency (“EASA”) standard. 

 

 

We repair or maintain our aircraft and aircraft engines at third-party 

maintenance 

organizations 

that 

possess 

FAA 

and/or 

EASA 

compliance certification(s). 

 

 

We ensure that our aircraft and aircraft engine are prepared for sale to  

customers.

3.2.2 Logistics Business 

 

 

Looking back to 2020, it was a defining year as we grappled our way to 

reshape and re-gear to the new dynamic realities. We stayed resolved to 

streamline our logistics business to further solidify our foundation. We 

centered our efforts on two over-arching strategies:  

 

(i) 

First, for each member entity in our logistics network to operate 

efficiently,  effectively and productively; and  

(ii) 

Second, to leverage on qualitative sources of growth with investments 

in technology and business productivity.  

 

Transformed the actions taken into results, our logistics business unit 

achieved “Profit Before Tax” of US$9.792 million (equivalent to S$13.485 

million) in FY 2020, compared to US$3.350 million in FY 2019. “Net Profit 

Attributable to Equity Holders of the Company” increased to US$8.199 million 

in FY 2020, compared to US$2.436 million in FY 2019.  

 

We know there is still a lot of work to be done and we will continue to 

challenge ourselves further.  We shall relentlessly continue to execute with 

clear strategy and consistent focus across the logistics business unit. 

 

Our logistics business contributes to sustainability by making our logistics-

related activities as resource-efficient as possible.  To do so, we: [102-11] 

 

 

Provide customers with solutions to meet their needs.  We utilize a 

wide range of transportation modes, including aircraft, ocean carriers, 

trucks and rail, to reduce our impact on the environment; 

 

 

Aim to achieve optional routing for the motor vehicles that we own to 

maximize cargo on board and minimize the fuel utilized and emission; 

 

 

Participate in government-led initiatives to adopt reduced-emission 

technology.  We upgrade our trucks to reduce our impact on the 

environment; 

 

 

Minimize material use at our work place, such as shrink wraps, pallets, 

and paper.  We educate our staff to reuse and recycle these materials 

for cost saving objectives, and to reduce our impact on the 

environment; 

 

 

We also conduct ourselves responsibly to dispose end-of-service 

pallets, and other hazardous waste such as motor-vehicle batteries; 

and 

 

 

Compliance with international and national standards promulgated in 

the countries that we operate in.  These include: [102-12] [102-13] 

 

(i) 

International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), a trade 

association for the world’s airlines, representing some 275 

airlines or 83% of total air traffic; 

 


 

A-SONIC AEROSPACE LIMITED                                                        SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

Direct Economic Value 

 

We are committed to create jobs and career path for employees, and offer 

competitive remuneration.  As at 31 December 2020, A-Sonic Group 

employed 669 (2019: 720) people.  We paid US$17.012 million (2019:

employees.  Of the US$17.012 million (2019: US$16.935 million), US$1.023 

million (2019: US$1.467 million) relate to retirement plans. [201-3]

that help fund community infrastructure and public services. 

 

We received a total of approximately US$1.825 million (2019: US$0.140 

million) of financial assistance from various government, interims largely for 

incentive and development grants. [201-4]

3.4 

Understanding Climate Change on Our Business [201-2] 

 

 

Climate change presents both opportunity and risk to the economic 

performance of our business.  From an opportunity perspective: 

 

(i) 

we conserve fuel utilization and reduce emission; 

 

(ii) 

we minimize material usage at our work place, such as shrink 

wraps, pallets and paper; and 

 

(iii) 

we act responsibly to dispose end-of-service pallets, and other 

hazardous waste such as motor-vehicle batteries. 

 

These actions achieve two targets: (i) economic cost savings; and (ii) reduce 

our impact on the environment, hence climate change. [102-11] 

 

Our main economic risk currently related to climate change is a regulatory risk. 

Countries are likely to increase regulation on emission to include new taxes, 

levies, or other costs for transportation and logistics companies.  Today, it is 

not feasible to quantify the risk because different countries adopt different 

public policies.  We aim to manage this risk by upgrading, at the appropriate 

time, the motor vehicles we utilize for our transportation business.  We also 

continue to support public policies to own more carbon-efficient motor 

vehicles. [102-11] 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

A-SONIC AEROSPACE LIMITED                                                        SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020  

10 

 

ETHICAL CONDUCT 

 

 

Fundamental to our sustainability is to conduct our business with integrity and protect 

our reputation.  We strive daily to earn our trust from our employees, customers and 

suppliers.  We adopt strong measures to prevent corruption and comply with 

applicable laws and regulations. 

 

 

4.1 

Management Approach to Ethical Conduct [102-16] [103-2] [103-3] 

 

(a) 

Governance 

 

 

Our management approach to ethical conduct is to adhere to our 

corporate governance structures, policies and processes in a 

transparent manner.  The senior management of A-Sonic executives 

set a tone of compliance and ethical conduct from the top.  A-Sonic is 

committed to comply with the applicable law and regulation wherever 

we operate. 

 

 

A-Sonic has in place an internal code of conduct applicable to all 

employees.  The code of conduct embraces principles on integrity, 

responsibility and accountability at all levels of the group in the 

conduct of the group's business activities when dealing with other 

colleagues customers and suppliers. 

 

 

 

The code provides guidance on issues such as: 

 

 Conflicts of interest and appropriate discussion to be made; 

 

 Our policies against corruption and bribery; 

 

 Our policies and procedures, including internal controls and 

accounting; 

 

 Safeguarding and proper use of our assets and confidential 

information; and 

 

 Internal code on dealings in securities by all employees and 

directors.  

 

(b) 

Reporting ethic concerns 

 

We maintain open communication and transparency.  Anyone with a 

concern is encouraged to speak up without fear of retaliation.  Our 

employees and other stakeholders such as business partners, or 

customers, may raise any query or report a concern.  These options 

include email, in-person meeting, or tele-communication.  We will 

provide prompt follow up and responses. 

 

 

 

 


 

A-SONIC AEROSPACE LIMITED                                                        SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020  

11 

 

 

(c) 

Review Concerns 

 

We take alleged violations seriously and respond quickly, with 

disciplinary or remedial actions where appropriate.  A senior 

representative from an office in a country that we operate in, and a 

senior representative from our head office, including a legal counsel 

may be engaged, to participate in the review. 

 

 

 

 

4.2 

Combating Anti-Corruption [102-11] [102-16] [205-1] 

 

A-Sonic's policy is to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations in 

countries where we operate.  Corruption is a business risk that undermines 

our values.  A-Sonic has zero tolerance for corruption behaviours, including 

bribery and kickbacks.  Our Code of Conduct includes policies and 

procedures that prohibit employees, and people acting on our behalf, from 

engaging in corruption or any unlawful activities, including violations of the 

Corruption Act in Singapore, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. 

Bribery Act, and other applicable anti-bribery laws, rules and regulations. 

 

In conducting our business in 16 countries, we work through numerous third 

parties.  In order to mitigate the risk of corruption from third parties, we 

employ a due diligence process to review their background.  We adopt the 

policy of "know our customers and suppliers".  The process starts with 

identifying and taking ownership of risks, then documenting the information, 

and verifying the information with independent third parties such as credit 

agencies, authorities, where feasible. 

 

Periodically, we analyze 100% (2019: 100%) of our business units for 

compliance risks.  One of our primary tool is to rely on internal audit to seek 

methodically for specific evidence of fraud, corruption, and other operational 

or process deficiencies.  As part of our internal audit process, we also pay 

particular attention to significant changes in an A-Sonic business entity or its 

regulatory environment that is likely to increase the risk of unethical practices 

or inadequate controls. 

 

In addition, we conduct annual surprise special external audit on A-Sonic 

entity which we have identified to be more susceptible to multiple internal and 

external factors in any given year. In FY2020, there were zero incidents of 

non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including anti-corruption. 

We target to maintain this trend for the forthcoming year.

EMPLOYEE HEALTH, SAFETY &amp; WELLNESS 

 

 

5.1 

Management Approach to Employees [103-2] [103-3] 

 

 

 

The value that continues to guide us as we grow A-Sonic enterprise is the 

corporate culture that we build together.  Our culture aspires us to make lives 

better, and at the same time, be pragmatic, to be profitable.  While we work 

hard, push ourselves, we must enjoy our work and have fun.  We look to each 

and every employee to incorporate our sustainability principles into their work. 

 

 

Our priority is to promote from within the group as a means of engaging and 

retaining our people, as well as bringing valuable external experience and 

continuity to our business.  We aim to promote from within means that we 

emphasize on developing our people within their current positions of greater 

responsibility.  However, we may have to bring in outside specialists to 

expand our skill set and meet new challenges. 

 

 

We continually evaluate how we work, how we engage our people, how we 

provide development opportunities, and how we define and deliver rewards. 

 

 

We face a few issues in reality.  These include: 

 

(i) 

The rapidly transforming industry trends relating to the logistics 

industry, particularly in the sphere relating to e-commerce and e-

fulfilment; 

 

(ii) 

Growth in new geographic and new emerging market trends in various 

industries.  The evolving and changing global market place means that 

we must develop a more diverse, global workforce that is aligned to 

the dynamic industry trends in the logistics industry; 

 

(iii) 

We strive to offer attractive and holistic experiences and opportunities 

to continually enhance our employee retention and engagement 

strategies; 

 

(iv) 

While we promote internally, we are mindful of the need to acquire 

specialized skill sets.  New technologies and innovations are emerging 

daily, and faster, and we strive to develop the skills needed for the 

next-generation logistic solutions.  Hence, we may recruit externally, to 

reinvigorate our talent pool. 

 

 

We strive to align our human capital strategy with our business 

strategy, and to continue to evolve to address the rapidly changing 

marketplace realities. 

 

 

We focus on two (2) strategic initiatives, as well as the transformation 

of the HR function and its on-going support required to run the 

business: 

 

(a) 

First initiative - build a strong global talent pool, which is vital to 

our ability to grow and create value.  Our management team is 

directly involved in this initiative; and

13 

 

 

(b) 

Second initiative - align our remuneration to incentivize and 

drive our employee engagement and business outcomes.  We 

adopt 

a 

holistic 

remuneration 

approach, 

including 

compensation, healthcare, retirement, voluntary benefits, 

insurance, and various staff benefits. 

 

Our human capital strategy also emphasizes on effective two-way 

communication with employees to: 

 

(a) 

help us define and execute our strategies; 

 

(b) 

identify and address issues as they may arise; and 

 

(c) 

measure the effectiveness of the policies and practices. 

 

We often use employee feedbacks to better understand the changing 

needs of our workforce, improve operational processes, and match the 

rewards and recognition programmes.  Our top management is directly 

involved in such meet-the-employee sessions. [102-43] 

 

5.2 

Workforce Diversity &amp; Inclusion [103-2] [103-3] [405-1] 

 

 

Cultivating a diverse workforce and inclusive work environment can help 

increase 

talent 

engagement, 

foster 

innovation, 

and 

offer 

different 

perspectives to an issue, or problem-solving approaches. 

 

 

We operate in 16 countries, and we recognize that diversity is defined 

differently in varying countries.  We believe that the process of building a 

diverse workforce begins with recruiting talented people regardless of their 

race, religion, gender identity, nationality or age.  We reward base on merits 

and performance.

We believe that diversity and inclusion supports the economic sustainability of 

our business by helping us to better understand and meet the needs of our 

customers, as well as strengthening our workplace environment.  Each 

employee is free to bring their ideas to the table, and is not constrained to 

hold back in any way. 

 

While we target diversity, in terms of talented staff, and varied skill sets, 

gender equality and balance, we must connect, integrate and align our shared 

corporate vision.  Hence, our corporate culture is inclusion to further 

strengthen the engagement of our workforce.

Our corporate culture aspire us to make lives better, and at the same time, be

employees.  Our holistic programme focuses on three critical aspects: 

 

(i) 

physical health and safety; 

 

(ii) 

work-life balance; and 

 

(iii) 

financial wellness.

We target to maintain our employee turnover rate and provide them with 

opportunities to learn and grow in the forthcoming year as follows:  

 

(i) 

Physical Health and Safety  

 

In 2020, A-Sonic Group provided health benefits for 669 (2019: 720) 

employees.  We participate in several employee benefit plans to meet 

the health and wellness needs of our employees.  In addition, we 

make contributions on behalf of employees in statutory provident 

funds.  While there are variations in each country, the following is an 

overview of A-Sonic employee benefits: 

 

- 

Medical care, including hospitalization and surgery 

 

- 

Term life insurance 

 

- 

Workmen injury compensation 


 

A-SONIC AEROSPACE LIMITED                                                        SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020  

17 

 

 

- 

Supplemental group life insurance 

 

- 

Business travel accident insurance 

 

- 

Parental leave 

 

In many countries that we operate, we contribute to the social security 

systems that generally provide health, unemployment, disability, and 

retirement benefits for employees in that country. 

 

At A-Sonic, safety begins with a healthy individual who takes safety 

precautions at home and at work.  We are mindful to focus on fitness, 

adequate rest, and stress management, when assigning work 

schedules for our employees.  In certain countries that we operate, we 

allow certain flexibility in working hours to better manage their stress 

owing to extenuating personal circumstances. 

 

An on-going focus is to enforce stringent internal policies governing 

working hours, rest hours, rest facilities, for employees who drive and 

operate vehicles.  These policies are tailored to different types of work 

we do, as well as to the law and regulations in the countries and 

states that we operate. 

 

(ii) 

Work-life balance 

 

We target for work-life balance to help our employees better manage 

daily stress.  Apart from striving to automate routine work schedules, 

we work towards more flexible and shorter work-week by increasing 

productivity. 

 

Our Human Resource Department also provides counseling to 

employees that require help to manage stress.  We empower 

managers to support troubled employees during times of personal or 

professional upheaval. 

 

(iii) 

Financial Wellness 

 

Financial issues can be a major source of stress.  To support 

employees, our Human Resource Department provides counseling.

Recruitment, Training &amp; Development [103-2] [103-3] [404-2] 

 

 

We target to recruit good people and retain them with us for the long-term.  

Our management approach includes: 

 

 

Promoting from within; 

 

 

Offering a range of on-the-job training and development 

opportunities; and 

 

 

Identifying an employee’s potential early to accelerate career 

development. 

 

We adopt an unwritten policy to promote from within before considering a new 

hire, transferring employees into equivalent positions, job-rotation to train 

them for higher positions, or new assignments.  We encourage continuous 

learning and on-the-job training by job rotation where feasible. 

 

 

We target to recruit people with the requisite skill sets and attributes 

regardless of their race, nationality, gender identity, age or religion.  We strive 

to recruit people from within the local community in the country that we 

operate. 

 

We leverage on technology to improve our recruitment process.  For example, 

a candidate from anywhere in the world may access our website to submit an 

employment application.  We also engage in advertising, social media, 

recruitment events, and other communication modes. 

 

 

Our approach to training and development is one of shared responsibility 

among the company, individual employees, and their managers.  To prepare 

our employees for their tasks and assignments, we combine training and 

development opportunities with exposure and on-the-job training. 

 

 

We are targeting to evolve towards a more self-directed development model 

in which our employees and their managers collaborate to determine 

beneficial training programmes and development opportunities.  Training and 

development include constructive feedback, coaching, and counseling from 

managers and co-workers. 

 

 

We encourage management employees to continue their career development 

and job-related education.  We also offer interns from higher learning 

institutions on-the-job programmes.
