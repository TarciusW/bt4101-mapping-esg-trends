This is the tenth edition of the GAR 

Sustainability Report. It provides 

a summary of our progress and 

challenges in managing our most 

critical sustainability topics in FY2020. 

Unless otherwise stated, this report 

does not include the Company’s 

activities outside of Indonesia, 

where the majority of our operations 

are based. We have prepared this 

report in accordance with Global 

Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards – 

Core option. We have used the GRI 

reporting framework since we began 

reporting on our ESG performance in 

the notation: [FB-AG-XXXX.X], and are 

included in the SASB disclosure index 

found on our website. 

ASSURANCE

[102-56]

We have not sought third party 

assurance for our sustainability report. 

However, the information related to 

our material topics including High 

Carbon Stock (HCS), High Conservation 

Value (HCV) and Free, Prior and 

Informed Consent (FPIC) is reviewed 

by certification bodies such as the 

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 

(RSPO). This provides verification 

and credibility to the information 

and data submitted in this report. 

We have also commissioned PT 

Lloyd’s Register Indonesia to verify

We are proud to report that 

despite COVID-19-related 

constraints, 

we achieved

90%

full traceability at the  

end of 2020.

As we wrap up our traceability 

exercise, we will start working with 

multiple partners to help these 

smallholders and other suppliers to 

adopt more responsible practices. 

GAR will now be able to focus more 

on landscape approaches towards 

sustainability.

With the pandemic disrupting 

food security and global supply 

chains, our Alternative Livelihood 

programmes involving communities 

across Indonesia, proved their 

usefulness. These programmes, 

initiated in the last few years, range 

from organic vegetable gardens 

to animal husbandry. GAR intends 

to continue supporting these 

programmes as they boost local 

community resilience, especially in 

times of global crises.

Dear Stakeholders, 

In 2020, no business was spared  

from the impact of the COVID-19 

pandemic. We started the year with 

great optimism due to rising crude palm 

oil (CPO) prices. The rapid spread of 

the COVID-19 pandemic then stopped 

the world economy in its tracks, leading 

CPO price to fall due to supply chain 

disruption. However, underlying core 

demand continued throughout the year 

because of palm oil’s use as an essential 

ingredient, including in personal hygiene 

products that were important in reducing 

the spread of the virus such as hand 

wash and sanitisers, enabling a strong 

rebound towards the end of the year 

as the supply chain adapted to the 

challenge. 

The Board is grateful for the speed of 

response and solid teamwork of our 

people in all geographies. Everyone has 

adapted quickly to the changing market 

conditions and made adjustments to 

our operations so that we can continue 

delivering our products to the world 

while keeping employees safe.

Even as the global environment presents 

a number of challenges, we can take 

pride in our integrated business 

model and our deep commitment to 

sustainability which enables us to stay 

resilient during this global pandemic.

STAYING ON TRACK WITH 

SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENTS  

Despite the challenges of 2020, GAR 

remained steadfast in delivering its 

commitments to responsible production 

and sustainability. We turned to 

technology and online tools to continue 

implementing our major initiatives. 

This included supporting our suppliers 

and working towards completing 

Traceability to the Plantation (TTP). Our 

target was to achieve full TTP by the 

end of 2020. Movement restrictions 

imposed due to the pandemic meant 

we had to make allowances for some 

suppliers trying to complete the 

process but hampered by the inability 

to conduct fieldwork. These suppliers 

will be allowed to report their TTP 

in the coming months. Meanwhile, 

suppliers who have not shown any 

interest in TTP will be excluded from 

our supply chain. We are proud to 

report that despite COVID-19-related 

constraints, we achieved 90 percent full 

traceability at the end of 2020.

As of end-2020 we had registered 

more than 87,000 smallholders in our 

Ksatria Sawit programme that was 

launched to accelerate TTP amongst 

small farmers. This initiative is ongoing 

and we continue to register thousands 

of smallholders, a move which will help 

us in our next phase of supply chain 

transformation.

We also used technology and virtual 

outreach to launch various initiatives 

such as the education programme and 

children’s book Rumbun and Jungle 

Friends. The book is designed to help 

teachers educate elementary school 

pupils on the importance of preventing 

forest and land fires. Our team in 

Indonesia managed to continue their 

outreach and training through Zoom calls 

and podcasts, reaching 400 teachers 

through dedicated virtual workshops and 

another 700 participants via podcasts.

The pandemic inevitably disrupted some 

of our annual community programmes 

especially those that require face-to-face 

and big group interaction. However, 

the investment that we have made over 

the decades in community facilities 

like clinics and medical centres have 

proven particularly critical during the 

pandemic. Visits to our 104 clinics 

increased fourfold due in large part to 

the screening and testing for COVID-19 

in the community. The clinics will also 

prove key during the vaccination rollout. 

We also helped provide masks and 

disinfection services to the community.  

As the pandemic continues to affect 

our lives, we will remain focused on 

supporting and taking care of our 

employees, ensuring that they stay 

safe and healthy at the workplace. We 

continue to implement safety measures 

practices and spreading those values 

throughout our supply chain.

LOOKING AHEAD OPTIMISTICALLY, 

BUT WITH CAUTION 

Under the “new normal” conditions, global 

economies have gradually started to open 

since mid-2020. CPO market prices have 

strongly rebounded, supported by extreme 

tightness in global vegetable oil supply 

and demand. With vaccination progressing 

globally and economies around the world 

reopening, there is optimism that future 

demand will recover further, including from 

the biodiesel sector. We remain cautious, 

anticipating continued uncertainties from 

the lingering COVID-19 pandemic.

In the longer term, the world is looking for 

healthier products and more responsible 

sources to meet growing global food 

and energy demand. Palm oil will play an 

essential role in that quest, and GAR is well 

positioned to cater to changing global 

needs. Our extensive portfolio of palm-

based products, and efficient end-to-end 

supply chain provides us with a sound 

foundation for sustainable growth.

We sincerely appreciate the commitment 

and hard work delivered by our employees 

throughout the year. We also value the 

collaboration and support provided by 

all our stakeholders, including suppliers, 

customers, creditors and shareholders. 

We have all learned from the crisis, and 

this experience will further accelerate 

our transformation, ensuring that GAR 

continues to improve and grow. Leading 

by example, I encourage our people to be 

innovative and open to new ideas be it in 

our daily operations or in our responsible 

production practices. We believe the best 

people, harnessing the best technology, 

will deliver the best performance.

Palm oil and its place in sustainable 

development

Palm oil has many detractors claiming 

it has detrimental impacts on the 

environment and rural communities. 

Yet, at the same time, palm oil which 

is responsibly produced has a crucial 

role to play in sustainable production, 

consumption and food security. 

 

This tropical crop has the highest 

yield of any oil crop and makes more 

efficient use of land in its production 

than any other vegetable oil crop. 

It is extremely versatile and can be 

processed to form a wide range of 

products with different melting points, 

consistencies and characteristics, 

serving a myriad of uses, from food to 

cosmetics to cleaning products. 

Economically, the development of oil 

palm plantations has been a boon 

to tropical developing countries. In 

Indonesia, the sector has helped to 

lift millions of rural farmers out of 

absolute poverty. A palm oil farmer can 

earn at least seven times more than 

a subsistence farmer. Palm oil estates 

provide critical infrastructure and 

facilities for rural, remote areas allowing 

access to healthcare and education, 

further improving standards of living. 

The challenge is to ensure that the 

entire industry is operating responsibly, 

while strengthening its positive role 

in contributing to socio-economic 

development. 

GAR, as a leader in responsible and 

sustainable production, recognises 

these challenges and opportunities. As 

we collectively strive to meet the UN 

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

by 2030, we are committed to working 

collaboratively with all stakeholders 

along our value chain to create a 

responsible palm oil industry. 

We believe that when done right, 

palm oil can take the lead amongst 

agribusinesses, to delink production 

from deforestation and contribute to 

a more sustainable future focused on 

conserving the environment, ending 

poverty, providing decent work and 

economic growth, reducing inequalities, 

and championing responsible 

production and consumption.

 Our Supply Chain




We have long understood that our 

longevity as a business relies on 

adopting sustainable business and 

operational practices. 

We recognise the value of protecting 

the natural environment, which houses 

rich biodiversity and provides vital 

ecosystem services. At the same time, 

the palm oil industry supports millions 

of livelihoods in Indonesia. We need to 

balance both realities.  

At the heart of our approach to 

sustainability is the GAR Social and 

Environmental Policy or the GSEP. 

The GSEP embodies our belief that 

economic growth, social progress and 

environmental protection can and need 

to go hand-in-hand. 

The GSEP establishes firm commitments 

that support these beliefs and we have 

set stretching targets to drive progress. 

Over time, in line with our commitment 

on continuous improvement, we will 

update our approach to keep up with 

emerging concerns, as well as global 

and local trends. 

GAR provides ongoing training for 

employees on the GSEP. To date, over 

74,000 employees have received GSEP 

training. We continuously share and 

remind all our suppliers of our GSEP 

principles and commitments.

Board Statement 

The Board considers sustainability  

to be an integral part of GAR’s 

long-term strategic direction 

and is committed to responsible 

and sustainable practices across 

all our operations. The Board 

has the overall responsibility 

for determining GAR’s material 

ESG topics and overseeing the 

management and monitoring of 

GAR’s material topics.

To assist the Board, we have 

established a Sustainability 

Committee that reports to 

the Board and comprises the 

senior leadership team across 

the upstream, downstream 

and corporate centre. The 

Sustainability Committee 

meets regularly to oversee 

the development and 

implementation of GAR’s 

sustainability strategy, and 

is a key part of GAR’s efforts 

to embed sustainability in 

its everyday operations. The 

Sustainability Committee is 

involved in the regular internal 

review our material ESG 

topics and periodic materiality 

assessments.

Our Approach to Sustainable Palm Oil

ACTIONS SUPPORTING THE SDGS 

GAR AND THE UN SUSTAINABLE 

DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS)

In 2015, the 193 member states of the 

United Nations adopted the Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs), a new 

agenda for sustainable development. 

The SDGs represent an interrelated and 

holistic framework of the most pressing 

challenges facing humanity and require 

urgent actions from all actors.

As a business operating in the palm oil 

industry, GAR has a role to play in

supporting many of the 17 SDGs. As 

part of our strategic approach, we have 

chosen to focus our efforts on the goals 

where we can make the most meaningful 

contributions.

Following an assessment of the goals 

and their underlying targets, we have 

identified three SDGs – SDG 2, SDG 12 

and SDG 15 – which we believe align 

best with our strengths and our areas 

of impact as a company. They also 

represent the greatest opportunities to 

partner with other stakeholders and work 

together on sustainable development in 

support of SDG 17.

With the global population expected to continue 

growing exponentially, reaching an estimated 10 

billion people by 2050, food security is becoming 

increasingly challenging. More food will have to be 

grown in the face of decreasing arable land and a 

changing climate.

As an agribusiness, GAR is committed to the 

sustainable production of palm oil as a key food 

ingredient. While palm oil is already the highest-yielding  

vegetable oil crop in the world, we continue our R&amp;D 

efforts to develop higher yielding seeds and planting 

materials that are resilient to diseases and droughts 

from climate change. This will help GAR contribute to 

the growing demand for vegetable oil, while reducing 

pressure on the need for more agricultural land. 

Another area of R&amp;D involves developing high oleic 

palm oil which has a better nutritional profile.  

For more information please see p 35.

Our focus on productivity and improving agronomic 

practices extends to our plasma and independent 

smallholders. We support them to generate decent 

incomes, while adopting practices that protect the 

environment. We also work with local communities 

on Alternative Livelihood programmes, which help to 

improve farmers’ income and food security by growing 

crops ranging such as organic vegetables and coffee. 

For more information please see p 35, 42, 57-58.

(Relates to SDG Targets: 2.3; 2.4)

Achieving responsible consumption and production 

is essential to ensure that the natural resources we 

depend on are used efficiently and within the limits 

of our planet, while minimising the impact to human 

health and the environment.

At GAR we do this through actions such as  

minimising the waste we generate, as well as 

recycling and reuse as much as we can. Since 2015, 

we have recycled 100 percent of our waste from 

the production of CPO in our upstream operations. 

We are also working towards phasing out harmful 

chemical substances in our operations. For example, 

we have stopped using the herbicide paraquat, 

while continuing to use a combination of natural 

solutions and biological controls for pests. For more 

information please see p 42-43.

Industry certification also forms part of GAR’s ongoing 

commitment to adopt best practices and standards 

in responsible production while allowing us to meet 

the growing demand for certified sustainable palm 

oil. We continue to actively participate in relevant 

certification schemes, including RSPO, ISCC and 

ISPO. For more information please see p 33-34.

These commitments which are in our GSEP also apply 

to our supply chain. We are currently helping our 

suppliers to improve their practices in these areas. For 

more information please see p 25-31.

(Relates to SDG Targets 12.2;12.4;12.5)

Forests provide critical ecosystem services, host a 

large amount of biodiversity and support the

livelihoods of indigenous peoples. As a palm 

oil company operating mainly in Indonesia, we 

recognise that we have an important role to play in 

ensuring the protection of forest areas. This is an area 

which we have been working on for many years.

GAR currently oversees and supports the 

conservation of 220,000 hectares forest, directly 

and indirectly. This includes 78,000 hectares of HCS 

and HCV areas across our operations which we have 

been identified for conservation. In addition, we 

have taken a landscape approach, working with local 

communities around and beyond our concession 

areas on conservation. This includes Participatory 

Mapping (PM) and Participatory Conservation 

Planning (PCP). To date, this has resulted in 

agreements to protect around 43,000 hectares of 

forests. We are also supporting the commitments 

to conserve over 100,000 hectares of forests by our 

suppliers. For more information please see p 27.

GAR also continues to implement our long-term 

fire prevention programme with the community. For 

more information please see p 36-46.

(Relates to SDG Targets 15.1;15.2;15.3;15.5)

with customers to help smallholders improve 

livelihoods and sustainability. 

(Relates to SDG Targets 17.16) 

To achieve sustainable 

development, partnerships 

between governments, 

the private sector and civil 

society is required.

All of our efforts are underpinned by local 

and global partnerships. These range from 

collaborations with communities and suppliers on 

conservation; working with top research facilities 

and universities on improving biodiversity; and

102-26, 103-2]

We are committed to the highest 

standards of corporate governance, and 

to complying with the principles of the 

Code of Corporate Governance, reviewed 

last in 2018.

The make-up of our board is an important 

part of our approach to corporate 

governance. Currently, the board has eight 

members, including five independent 

directors, who exercise objective judgment 

in our corporate affairs. The board is 

headed by GAR’s Chairman and CEO,  

Mr Franky O. Widjaja, and is responsible 

for overseeing all aspects of our business. 

A full list of our board of directors and their 

profiles can be found on our website and in 

the GAR Annual Report.

The board and senior management 

are fully involved in and support GAR’s 

sustainability commitments under the GSEP. 

A Sustainability Committee (SC), which is 

chaired by Ms Jesslyne Widjaja, Corporate 

Strategy and Business Development 

Director, oversees all matters related to 

responsible business. The SC comprises the 

senior leadership team from the upstream, 

downstream and corporate business 

units as well as the head and other staff 

members of the Sustainability Directorate. 

The SC reports directly to the Chairman 

and CEO and the Board, and meets 

regularly to oversee the development, 

implementation and monitoring of the 

GSEP and our performance across all our 

business operations.

 

Over the years we have continued to 

invest additional resources with the aim 

of embedding responsible palm practices 

in our day-to-day operations. We have 

a sustainability team of over 360 staff 

in Jakarta and in the field working to 

implement our sustainability measures. 

We employ specialists to oversee and 

handle key areas such as conflict resolution, 

HCS/HCV management, fire prevention, 

community consent (FPIC), grievance 

management and health and safety. The 

Sustainability Directorate also works with 

colleagues in Human Resources on labour 

issues to ensure fair labour practices are 

upheld, in line with the GSEP. 

ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE

[102-16, 102-17, 205-3, 415-1]

At GAR, we are committed to pursuing 

our business objectives with integrity and 

in compliance with the law. We comply 

with applicable laws in all the countries 

in which we do business, including all 

anti-bribery and corruption regulations. 

Additionally, GAR does not make any 

corporate political contributions. No 

significant cases of bribery or corruption 

were reported in 2020. 

We expect all our employees, 

contractors, suppliers and business

partners to adhere to the GAR Code 

of Conduct, which is communicated 

annually to our existing and new 

employees. The Code is purposefully 

designed to be practically applicable 

to our day-to-day business, with 

definite guidelines on acceptable and 

unacceptable behaviour. It applies to all 

employees as well as Board members. It 

also details avenues for raising concerns 

and whistleblowing procedures, 

encouraging employees to report any 

possible improprieties, in confidence 

and without fear of retaliation.

The Code also emphasises the Company’s  

commitment to fair employment 

practices; diversity; and its stand against 

discrimination and zero tolerance for 

harassment or abuse. No cases of 

harassment and abuse were reported  

in 2020.

We have annual mandatory refresher 

courses and online e-testing on the 

Code of Conduct for our employees. 

Executives have also signed Integrity Pacts 

committing them to ethical and lawful 

behaviour. 

We also require our suppliers to comply 

with the Supplier Code of Conduct, 

which obligates them to adhere to our 

policies including the GSEP.

RESPONSIBLE HANDLING OF 

COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES 

[103-2, 103-3]

In 2015, GAR established a Grievance 

Procedure to ensure that as a company, 

we are responsive to any grievances 

raised by external parties which may 

involve our third-party suppliers. It helps 

us to address a wide range of concerns, 

including those related to our most 

material issues. The full list and details of 

our grievances, both closed and ongoing, 

is updated regularly, and can be viewed

MONITORING, EVALUATION AND 

REPORTING

[103-3]

Under the GSEP we are committed to 

monitoring, evaluating and reporting 

our performance. We seek to provide 

regularly updates on our progress on 

several key using a variety of channels. 

For example, our website, is regularly 

updated with information on our 

supply chain mapping, fire incidents, 

conservation, community engagement 

and grievance cases. Other channels 

of reporting include public reports 

such as the GAR Annual Report and 

the GAR Sustainability Report. We 

also participate annually in several 

disclosure platforms including CDP 

(which incorporates Task Force on 

Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

(TCFD) recommendations and 

recognition of our limits as a private 

company and we seek to learn and gain 

valuable feedback from our stakeholders 

such as local communities, smallholders, 

government, Civil Society Organisations 

(CSOs), academia, suppliers, the 

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 

(RSPO), our industry peers, customers, 

and implementation partners.  

In several instances, we have worked 

with CSO stakeholders like Greenpeace 

to develop new guidelines and standards 

such as the High Carbon Stock Approach 

(HCSA) to address deforestation 

concerns. This approach is increasingly 

being adopted, not only in our industry, 

but also in other sectors such as forestry.

Our main sustainability roadmap, the 

GSEP, was developed with feedback 

and input from key stakeholders 

including CSOs such as Greenpeace, 

Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Forest 

Peoples Programme (FPP) and our 

implementation partner, Earthworm 

Foundation (formerly The Forest 

Trust). We also continue to improve 

our Standard Operational Procedures 

(SOP) for carrying out FPIC, handling 

grievances, conflict resolution and 

participatory mapping, often with input 

from external stakeholders such as CSOs. 

We also have several partnerships with 

customers and academic institutions 

designed to further our progress towards 

responsible production. Read more

Our Materiality Assessment

[102-29, 102-46, 102-47]

In 2021, we worked with a specialist 

sustainability consultancy to review 

our material sustainability topics. This 

process covered our entire value chain 

and built on from our previous in-depth 

materiality assessment last conducted 

in 2017. We followed a three-stage 

approach:

1. Topic Identification

 

Desk-based research was conducted 

to review and update our list of 

sustainability topics to take forward 

to the engagement stage. 

2. Stakeholder Engagement

 

An online survey and interviews with 

internal and external stakeholders 

were conducted to gather feedback 

on and prioritise the list of 20 

sustainability topics by level of 

importance. 

3. Analysis and Validation

 

Findings from the survey and 

interviews were consolidated, 

analysed, before being discussed 

with the senior management 

team at GAR, validated by GAR’s 

Sustainability Committee, and 

signed off by the Board. 

For more details on our materiality 

assessment, see our website. 

The results of our assessment revealed 

that topics including Fire and Haze, 

High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests and 

High Conservation Value (HCV) areas, 

and Labour relations and human 

rights continue to be a priority for GAR 

and our stakeholders. Climate change 

adaption and waste have also gone 

up in relative importance.  In addition, 

this year we have identified two new 

topics, Energy and Cybersecurity  

and Data Protection. Below is the full 

list of our material sustainability topics, 

which as explanation of both why  

and where they are material in our 

value chain.

Transforming our Supply Chain

To meet our sustainability commitments, 

we recognise we must source our raw 

materials from suppliers who agree 

to follow the same high standards of 

responsible production. We have made 

substantial investments in time and 

resources to help our supply chain 

transform and change for the better. In 

2020, despite the challenges brought 

about by the COVID-19 pandemic, we 

continued to make strides in our work 

with our supply chain.  

OUR PALM SUPPLY CHAIN

[102-9]

The bulk of our procurement comprises 

crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel 

FFB12 %











CPO and PK 

74%



(PK) for our downstream business in 

Indonesia. In 2020, these raw materials 

were sourced from 378 third-party mills 

and 471 GAR-owned mills in Indonesia. 

Fresh fruit bunches (FFB), the feedstock 

for the mills, are in turn supplied by 

our own nucleus estates, third-party 

estates, thousands of individual farmers 

(plasma and independent), as well 

as brokers and agents who buy from 

farmers. Procurement of CPO and PK, 

and procurement of FFB, accounts for 

around 74 and 12 percent respectively of 

our Indonesian subsidiaries’ procurement 

spend. We source around 60 percent of 

these materials for our refineries from 

third-party suppliers. Based on the high 

purchasing volume, a critical input of 

our products, and the environmental 

and social risks associated with the 

purchase of CPO, PK and FFB, these are 

considered GAR’s critical suppliers.

OTHER SUPPLIERS

[102-9, 204-1]

We also procure other products and 

services to run our business. Significant 

spend for our upstream operations includes 

fertilisers sourced from 41 Indonesian 

companies accounting for 22 percent of 

procurement spend. Other procurement 

includes materials, spare parts and 

services; fuel and tires; food; tools; and 

consumables. Food such as rice, noodles 

and milk is procured for our employees and 

forms part of their non-monetary benefits. 

In 2020, we spent about IDR 115 billion to 

buy over 12 kilotonnes of food.

More than half of products and services 

are purchased from local vendors close to 

our operational sites. 

TRACEABILITY TO THE PLANTATION

[103-2, 103-3] [FB-AG-430a.3]

We had intended to complete full 

Traceability to the Plantation (TTP) for our 

entire palm supply chain by end-2020. 

This timetable had to be adjusted in light 

of the global pandemic as safe distancing 

measures affected some of our suppliers’ 

ability to carry out fieldwork.  

Despite this, we are happy to report 

that we achieved 90 percent TTP as 

of end-2020 for GAR-owned mills and 

third-party suppliers. We have given an 

extension to suppliers whose TTP efforts 

were interrupted by the pandemic. They 

are expected to complete their mapping 

will tailor plans to help them adopt 

sustainable practices. 

We continued to make progress in 

extending forest conservation in our 

supply chain. We are doing this through 

sharing the importance of complying  

with our no deforestation commitments as  

well as guiding our suppliers in adopting 

best practices and helping them formalise 

their own no deforestation policies. Since  

we began our deep engagement with 

suppliers, 17 of them have carried out 

HCV and HCS assessments, which 

in the coming months. However, for the 

minority of suppliers who have not made 

any meaningful effort on TTP to date, we 

will consider them automatically excluded 

from our supply chain, as traceability is an 

essential requirement under the GSEP.  

Aside from guaranteeing the provenance 

of our raw materials, traceability gives us 

a ready-made platform for relationship-

building with our third-party suppliers. 

This enables us to work with them to 

transform our supply chain and, by 

extension, the industry. 

To help accelerate TTP amongst Tier 2 

suppliers such as smallholders and agents 

we launched the Ksatria Sawit (Palm Oil 

Warriors) programme. The initiative links 

suppliers with our supply chain mapping 

partner, Koltiva. GAR provides the 

suppliers’ profiles, and Koltiva follows up 

by conducting field surveys with the mills, 

agents and smallholder farmers. As of 

end 2020, we had exceeded our original 

targets and registered 87,000 smallholders 

covering 325,000 hectares of estates.  

Now that the farmers are registered  

in the Ksatria Sawit programme, we

SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT, 

ASSESSMENT AND TRAINING

[308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 412-2] [FB-AG-430a.2]

We engage intensively and extensively 

with our critical suppliers through multiple 

avenues, gaining their trust and confidence. 

Aside from commercial considerations, all new 

suppliers are screened using environmental and 

social criteria, in line with our commitments in 

the GSEP. For our existing suppliers, all  

GAR-owned and third-party mills are 

assessed for GSEP compliance on an 

annual basis through desk research and 

spatial analysis. We also carry out site visits 

to suppliers, especially those deemed 

high-risk, to document and understand the 

gaps and difficulties they face in adopting 

responsible practices. 

Based on our findings, we can determine 

a risk ranking for each supplier. High-risk 

suppliers are prioritised for site visits and 

deep engagement. Every year, we aim to 

visit at least 20 critical, high-risk suppliers. 

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 

we switched to remote assessments of  

our suppliers.

continued to help them with training in 

traceability; responsible labour practices; 

and implementation of FPIC and human 

rights. We are also guiding them to 

design more targeted and needs-based 

CSR programmes using Social Impact 

Assessments. We have shared and 

emphasised the importance of the GSEP 

with all (100 percent) of our suppliers. 

We are proactively helping suppliers 

review their policies, including providing 

recommendations on how to strengthen 

SOPs in various areas such as environmental 

management and labour relations. 

In 2020, we continued with our supplier 

training sessions using technology and 

online tools. An example of this includes 

an online workshop to help our suppliers 

learn about practical OHS measures during 

the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted 

14 webinars in 2020 on various topics, 

including responsible labour practices, OHS, 

participatory conservation planning (PCP) 

deforestation monitoring, fire prevention, 

CSR and sustainability reporting. These 

online webinars reached more than 1,300 

participants from 172 suppliers. 

Suppliers who participate in our engagement 

and assessment processes are generally 

receptive to proposals for improvement. 

However, suppliers deemed non-compliant 

will no longer form part of our supply 

chain. In 2020, we stopped procuring from 

about 0.5 percent of our suppliers for non-

GAR details the findings from the site visits, 

including recommendations and actions for 

improvement, in a report that is shared with 

the supplier. We then work with the mills to 

develop and implement time-bound action 

plans for us to monitor progress against. In the 

last few years, we have completed site visits 

and assessed both Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers 

at all our downstream processing locations. 

Reports can be viewed on our website.

GAR is also using the No-deforestation,  

No-peat and No-exploitation5 Implementation 

Reporting Framework (NDPE IRF) to track 

progress against our NDPE commitments 

across our supply chain. This gives us yet 

another methodology to monitor and track 

our progress on NDPE and communicate 

this progress to our stakeholders. The tables

and from over seven percent since 2015. 

Working with our industry peers and several 

CSOs including Mighty Earth, Aidenvironment 

and Earthworm Foundation we have also 

designed guidelines for re-engagement 

with suspended suppliers. Suppliers must 

be willing to undertake remedial actions 

and improve their practices in line with the 

GSEP. Minimum requirements include such 

conditions like moratoriums on land clearing; 

conducting HCS and HCV assessments prior 

to new development; and developing SOPs 

in line with NDPE policies. Suppliers will 

need to show they have achieved results and 

milestones as set out in their action plans 

before re-engagement takes place. 

We operate a transparent and accountable 

system where stakeholders can inform us 

of issues within our supply chain using our 

grievance process. As part of this process, 

we conduct ad-hoc site visits where an issue 

has been raised by an external stakeholder 

or discovered through our own monitoring. 

Our engagement is reported in our updated 

Grievance List. In 2020, 18 new grievances 

were raised involving our third-party suppliers. 

We have resolved three of the new cases and 

15 older cases. The majority of these cases 

were related to suspected clearing of forests. 

Case studies which highlight action plans for 

our suppliers are published on our website. 

The CSO, Mighty Earth, has consistently 

ranked GAR as the top palm oil company in 

resolving grievances.

usual thing that you are familiar with. We 

have been using this process for many 

years and have become so used to it. 

But the human mind is just so powerful 

that under the pressing circumstance, 

we were able to find a creative way 

to still carry out ‘site visits’. We call 

this initiative – SMART Reach (SMART 

Remote Engagement, Assessment and 

Conference (call) from Home).

Wahyu Wigati Wijayanti is the Head 

of Supplier Compliance at Sinar Mas 

Agribusiness and Food in Indonesia and has 

been working for the company since 2015. 

She has extensive experience in the forestry 

and palm oil industries.



Transforming our Supply Chain

Q: What is SMART Reach?

Basically, we are conducting remote 

assessments for our suppliers. We 

send them a set of self-assessments, a 

checklist of sorts, to go through in their 

operations beforehand. Then we meet via 

teleconference to go through each item. 

They will have to provide answers and 

evidence for each portion of the assessment.

Of course there are some limitations 

with this method – we aren’t able to see 

the implementation on the ground, but 

we are looking at ways to tackle that. 

Nevertheless, it doesn’t stop us from 

assessing our suppliers, and having an 

open discussion and consultation on 

how they can improve their sustainability 

practices. Just like when we are doing site 

visits, the most important ingredient for 

success is trust – trust that we are here to 

help our suppliers, to continue improving 

sustainable practices.

The great thing about SMART Reach 

is that instead of taking three full days 

for the site visit as before, we now only 

require three hours per day for two days, 

to complete a visit for one supplier. 

Surprisingly, since we started this new way 

of assessment, we have received more 

requests from our suppliers to participate! 

So SMART Reach is beneficial in saving 

time, saving cost – for airfare tickets, 

accommodation, transportation, and is 

even expanding our reach to even more 

suppliers.

“Being pushed to find new 

ways of doing things has been 

a silver lining to the COVID-19 

situation. These improvements 

will become our new normal, so 

that our assessments are done 

more efficiently, even when our 

operations resume 100 percent.”

During the ongoing pandemic, our 

Responsible Sourcing Team had to find 

different ways to engage suppliers. 

Wahyu Wigati Wijayanti, Head of Supplier 

Compliance describes the process. 

Q: What are you doing to overcome 

the situation?

Frankly, in the beginning it was quite 

nerve wrecking, when you cannot do the

SUPPORTING SMALLHOLDERS

[103-2, 103-3] 

Smallholders are a critical part of Indonesia’s 

palm supply chain, with about two and a 

half million farmers controlling 40 percent of 

palm oil estates. If we want to help improve 

the industry, we need to help smallholders 

improve their livelihoods and farming 

practices. 

We have been supporting all our plasma 

smallholders achieve responsible farming for 

almost three decades. In 2020, around 70,800 

plasma smallholders supplied FFB to GAR, 

about 19 percent of our total intake of FFB. 

While GAR does not own the plasma 

plantations, they are closely integrated into 

our management system and we take the  

lead in promoting their success while adhering 

to the GSEP. In 2020, our smallholders 

achieved a CPO yield of around 4.2 tonnes 

per hectare, which is higher than the current 

national average in Indonesia of around  

3.8 tonnes per hectare. 

 

Through our partnership, we provide 

plasma smallholders access to high-

yielding seeds and good quality fertilisers. 

We also ensure knowledge transfer and 

capacity building through regular training 

on Good Agricultural Practices. 

GAR also extends support to independent 

smallholders and has been a strong 

supporter of the Independent Farmers 

Replanting Scheme since its launch in 

2014. The programme was set up to 

encourage independent smallholders to 

replant with better quality, higher-yielding 

seeds which will help boost productivity 

and incomes, while potentially reducing 

the demand for new agricultural land. It 

gives farmers access to financing, helping 

them sustain their livelihoods during the 

four years it takes for the new seedlings 

to mature. As of end 2020, GAR secured 

loans of nearly IDR 123 billion from state-

owned banks for farmers in Riau.

In addition, we run a range of support 

programmes for independent smallholders. 

This includes technical assistance to 

thousands of farmers in North Sumatra, 

South Sumatra, and Riau. Farmers have 

access to high-yielding seeds, fertiliser and 

herbicides, and heavy equipment rental at 

below-market rates. As of end-2020, we 

have disbursed more than IDR 300 billion in 

interest-free loans and other aid. 

Our R&amp;D division, SMARTRI also runs regular 

training programmes for smallholders. Each 

year, they train several hundred farmers in 

agronomic practices focusing especially on 

integrated pest management and fertiliser 

management. Beneficial plants are given to 

the farmers at the end of the training session, 

to be planted in their field to contribute to the 

biological control of herbivores. In addition, 

SMARTRI staff also visit smallholder farms 

when requested, to help solve pest outbreak 

issues or nutrient deficiency cases.

Partnerships to help smallholders

GAR is partnering with customers and other 

stakeholders on projects aimed at changing 

the palm oil industry. These projects include 

support for smallholders to boost their 

sustainable practices and improve their 

livelihoods, and are part of our focus in the 

next phase of supply chain transformation. 

One such project will involve working with 

our customer, Mars, and Koltiva, to help 

4,000 smallholders in Aceh become more 

responsible producers.

A full list of our partnerships and projects 

can be found on our website. 

RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN OUR 

SUPPLY CHAIN 

[407-1, 408-1, 409-1, 412-1] 

As we continue to progress with our palm 

supply chain mapping and develop deeper 

support for our key suppliers, we are taking 

steps to address salient labour and human 

rights issues within our supply chain. 

While we have not detected actual forced 

or child labour cases, we have noted 

that there are risks amongst some of 

our suppliers whether through lack of 

formal policies or through certain actions 

which can be perceived as indications of 

irresponsible labour practices.  

We are therefore proactively helping them 

review their labour policies. This includes 

providing recommendations to strengthen 

SOPs and recruitment mechanisms. We 

are training and supporting suppliers 

to formally implement no child labour 

practices and protect children within 

their operations. We have helped 

several suppliers create action plans 

for improvement and we monitor their 

progress.  

In 2020, we organised a webinar in 

collaboration with the ILO on responsible 

labour practices. We also worked with the 

Earthworm Foundation on a series of online 

meetings focusing on no child labour, 

decent wages and responsible labour 

practices. In addition, we are carrying out 

a workload study to help design guidelines 

for suppliers on setting workload incentives 

that are achievable by individual workers.

certified, ensuring that our products 

meet the highest responsible palm oil 

standards in international markets. 

INDONESIAN SUSTAINABLE PALM 

OIL (ISPO)

GAR also supports the ISPO Scheme 

developed by the Indonesian 

Ministry of Agriculture to improve 

the competitiveness of Indonesian 

palm oil in world markets and to meet 

Indonesia’s commitment to reduce 

greenhouse gases and focus on 

environmental issues. 

To date, over 230,000 hectares of 

plantations and 35 mills have received 

ISPO certification.

DEVELOPING A BIOFUEL MARKET 

FOR PALM OIL

Our two biodiesel plants continued to 

operate at full capacity, producing 600 

thousand tonnes of biodiesel to fulfil 

the B30 biodiesel mandate in Indonesia. 

We have received a volume allocation 

of around 717,000 kilo litres from the 

Indonesian government in 2021. To meet 

this demand, we are also in the process 

of expanding our biodiesel capacity by 

1,500 tonnes per day.

We participate in the RSPO working 

groups on deforestation; peatland; 

biodiversity; human rights; jurisdictional 

working group; and outreach and 

engagement. We are also involved 

in the RSPO task forces on HCV; 

FPIC; independent smallholders; 

compensation; Supply Chain 

Certification (SCC), trademark as well 

as Indonesia National Interpretation 

and review for the Principles and 

Criteria (P&amp;C), and the Resolution Task 

Force. Our SVP for Group Corporate 

Communications has also been 

appointed chair of the RSPO’s Road to 

COP26 Taskforce in 2021, with a remit 

to design and deliver a global outreach 

and advocacy campaign in support of 

sustainably produced palm oil.

INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY 

AND CARBON CERTIFICATION (ISCC)

GAR maintains ISCC certification, a 

global certification which aims to ensure 

sustainable production and use of all 

kinds of biomass in global supply chains. 

ISCC is based on the implementation of 

the highest sustainability requirements 

in ecological sustainability, social 

sustainability, compliance with laws and 

international treaties, monitoring of 

GHG emissions and good management 

practices.

We have put considerable effort into 

removing trans-fatty acids from all our 

products. We continue to work on having 

100 percent trans fat free products by 

2023 in line with WHO targets, having 

achieved this for 98 percent of all 

margarine, shortening and specialty 

products.

 

Cooking oil fortification is another focus 

area, with the government of Indonesia 

implementing mandatory fortification of 

Vitamin A in cooking oil. We are making 

sure we provide healthy fortified cooking 

oil in line with legal requirements. In 

addition to Vitamin A, our Filma margarine 

is also fortified with vitamins B1, B2 and B3.

We are also working to replace or convert 

soy lecithin to sunflower-based alternatives 

to reduce allergens in our products.

Following interest from several global 

customers, we are developing non-GMO 

high oleic palm oil (all our palm oil raw 

materials are non-GMO). High oleic oil is 

high in monounsaturated fats and has a 

better nutritional profile. We are carrying 

out a research project on developing a 

new hybrid high oleic palm oil and are 

testing several potential hybrids.

through our Participatory Conservation 

Planning (PCP) process. Our intensive 

consultative approach takes into 

account local community concerns, 

needs and aspirations. These include 

food security requirements, the ability 

to earn a decent living and maintain a 

good quality of life. Part of this process 

involves designing suitable Alternative 

Livelihood projects for the local 

community.  

We take a landscape approach to 

conservation beyond the boundaries of 

our concessions. One way we do this 

is through our community conservation 

partnerships. These began in 2015 when 

we started Participatory Mapping (PM) – 

a process to help villages map out critical 

areas such as customary boundaries and 

land necessary for food security. This 

map is then lodged with and formally 

recognised by the authorities, serving 

to clarify land tenure rights and enable 

villages to gain access to government 

development funds for the first time.

this programme was interrupted due 

to the necessity of social distancing 

measures during the ongoing pandemic. 

The resumption of the programme 

will be dependent on the evolving

sure that no development takes 

place in those areas. Furthermore, 

since 2014, we have not started any 

new developments on our nucleus

partnership to carry out the protection 

and rehabilitation of 2,600 hectares 

of degraded peatland in our PT Agro 

Lestari Mandiri (AMNL) concession 

in West Kalimantan. This project was 

launched at the end of 2015 following a 

severe El Niño which led to widespread 

peat fires. 

In 2020, despite the global pandemic, 

we were able to continue working 

on the project. To date, we have 

revegetated 1,000 hectares of the area 

as a buffer zone and we continue to 

monitor and maintain optimum water 

levels to keep the peat wet. From the 

beginning of the project, we have 

worked on Alternative Livelihood 

projects for the local community in 

tandem with the physical rehabilitation 

of the area. This helps on two fronts: 

improving food security and livelihoods, 

and forest conservation. We are working 

with partners including the University 

of Tanjungpura (UNTAN), L’Oréal and 

the South Pole Group. In 2020, we 

developed a water management plan 

with University of Tanjungpura. This is 

a key long-term step to keep the peat 

area wet and reduce the risk of peat 

fires which contribute to haze. We also 

carried out an educational initiative

RIPARIAN ZONE REHABILITATION

Our management of HCV areas involves 

the rehabilitation of riparian zones 

that have previously been cleared or 

planted. These riparian buffer zones 

play a crucial role in providing wildlife 

habitats and maintaining water systems.  

Since 2015, GAR has been carrying out 

a riparian rehabilitation programme 

in our 18 concessions. By 2018, we 

completed the rehabilitation of over 

2,700 hectares of riparian buffer 

zone. We have also completed the 

revegetation of the areas. 

To further improve our understanding 

of riparian zone rehabilitation, we are 

participating in the Riparian Ecosystem 

Restoration in Tropical Agriculture 

(RERTA) Project with Cambridge 

University. This project will provide 

specific recommendations on the 

most appropriate options for restoring 

riparian margins in established oil 

palm plantations, and an evidence 

base to improve sustainability in 

tropical agricultural landscapes. Data 

is collected on biodiversity, ecosystem 

functions, and crop yield before, 

during, and after riparian restoration. 

Outputs will be published in peer-

reviewed academic and industry 

journals, presented at conferences, and 

delivered as policy guidance for the 

industry. For more information, see the 

RERTA Project.

rare and endangered species within our 

concessions and surrounding areas. For 

our full list of threatened species under 

Indonesia’s National Law of Protected 

Species (Indonesian Government 

Regulation No. 7 of 1999) or on the  

IUCN Red list, see our website. 

We continue to work to preserve and 

protect HCV areas and operate a strict 

Zero Tolerance Policy towards hunting, 

injuring, possessing and killing of rare and 

endangered wildlife. 

We educate our employees, local 

communities and related stakeholders 

on the importance of protecting rare and 

endangered species. GAR also continues 

to work on orangutan conservation as a 

special focus area. Under a partnership with 

Orangutan Foundation International (OFI), 

We remain committed to preventing fire

REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS

[103-2, 103-3] [FB-AG-110a.2]

We are committed to reducing the 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from 

our operations. 

We recognise that emissions resulting 

from land use change and cultivation  

is one of the most significant impacts for 

any agribusiness. Our conservation of 

HCS forests, which retain large stores of 

carbon, is one way we are contributing 

to the avoidance of emissions. Another 

significant source of GHG emissions comes 

from Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME), the 

wastewater from processing fresh fruit 

bunches (FFB), which emits methane if left 

untreated. POME treatment is one of our 

main GHG emissions reduction activities. 

We also carry out methane capture at 

some of our mills.  

Emission Reduction from Methane 

Capture and Composting 

                     Methane capture facilities  

                     reduce 40-55%

                   GHG emissions on site

To treat POME, we mix it with shredded 

empty fruit bunches to produce compost, 

which is used as organic fertiliser in some of 

our estates. This contributes to a reduction 

of chemical fertiliser consumption, which is 

the second largest GHG emissions source 

after POME. Since early 2020, we have 

also implemented the use of coated urea 

fertiliser, which further contributes to GHG 

emissions reduction. 

We continued to reduce GHG emissions 

in our operations through our methane 

capture facilities installed at seven mills in 

Central Kalimantan, Jambi and Riau. The 

facilities capture methane gas which is 

then used as an alternative energy source, 

generating electricity for our palm oil mills. 

These facilities can reduce between 40 – 55 

percent of operational emissions on site. 

We also reduced GHG emissions through 

composting.  

Please see our latest CDP disclosure on 

climate change for more information on 

our GHG emissions.

Water is a vital resource for our

we operate. We recognise that water 

availability is an increasingly important 

issue in the face of climate change, and 

we are looking at ways to minimise our 

water footprint. 

We strive to meet all our water needs 

through surface water that is processed 

to meet the quality standards required for 

production. We use ground water only in 

very limited quantities in locations where 

no surface water is available. We continue 

to improve our water efficiency by 

recycling and reusing where appropriate. 

Palm oil trees need adequate amounts 

of water in order to grow. As such we 

have not developed plantations in water-

a comprehensive mineral nutrition 

management plan. We aim to minimise 

the quantity of fertiliser applied whilst 

maximising yields. This reduces the 

pressure to open more land and 

minimises the risk of soil degradation 

from oil palm cultivation.

We have SOPs which specify that the 

use of fertilisers should be tailored to 

the texture of the soil and its capacity 

for retaining nutrients; that fertilisers 

should not be applied during periods of 

heavy rain; and that there should always 

be an appropriate interval between 

applications. We also recycle palm 

fronds and other organic products to 

increase the fixing capacity of soils.

   ha/year of CPO 

We focus on improving the yield of 

oil palms as part of our long-term 

strategy for responsible and sustainable 

agriculture. The ability to obtain higher 

yields from existing agricultural land 

through better seed stock means higher 

stressed areas. Our plantations are rain-fed 

and not irrigated. 

We follow strict land management practices 

that are designed to reduce the risk of 

surface and ground water pollution. 

These include not applying herbicides or 

chemicals near and around riparian areas; 

restricting the application of treated liquid 

waste (POME) which is used as fertiliser to 

50 metres from riparian areas; and planting 

vetiver grass to minimise soil erosion at 

riparian areas. We submit water sample 

analyses to the environmental agencies at 

least twice yearly. 

We have noted the increasing occurrence 

of extreme weather phenomena like El 

Niño which can lead to severe draught. We 

are now exploring ways to optimise water 

use in our plantations through the use of 

advanced technology including AI. 

For more information on our water footprint 

please see our latest CDP disclosure on water. 

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT

[103-2, 103-3]

 

Integrated 

 

Pest Management 

We have adopted an Integrated Pest 

Management (IPM) approach which 

combines cultural, mechanical, biological 

and chemical means to control pests while 

minimising economic, public health and 

environmental risks.

Natural solutions and biological controls 

are our preferred methods for controlling 

pests across all our plantations, including 

beneficial plants that attract parasitoids 

to control pests, pathogens or bacteria, 

and natural predators. We supplement 

this approach using handpicking and 

mechanical traps. 

Examples of this include breeding barn 

owls to control the rat population; 

encouraging leopard cats which also prey 

on rodents to stay within our plantations; 

controlling leaf-eating caterpillars through 

diversity of flora; and encouraging the 

growth of beneficial plants and using 

pheromones to control rhinoceros beetles. 

Monitoring and minimising the use of 

pesticides

 

 

 NO

 

 

  paraquat

IPM and selective weed control are the 

basis of the utilisation of pesticides in GAR 

plantations:

• Insecticides and rodenticides are 

used only as a final resort, when the 

population of herbivores and rats are 

above an acceptable level and are no 

longer controllable through natural or 

biological solutions.

• The utilisation of herbicides is mainly 

to maintain an appropriate access to 

the palms, for their maintenance and 

for harvesting. A selective strategy 

is implemented in order to minimise 

the use of herbicides.

• In addition, SMARTRI is continuously 

looking for alternative solutions in 

order to reduce the utilisation of 

herbicides, through the use of more 

efficient and less environmental 

damaging new molecules, or 

through innovative products.

Overall, the quantity of chemical 

pesticides used in GAR plantations 

have declined in the last few years. In 

2016, GAR stopped using paraquat. In 

addition, pesticides that are categorised 

as World Health Organization Class 

1A or 1B, or that are listed by the 

Stockholm or Rotterdam Conventions 

are not used, except in specific 

situations identified in national best 

practice guidelines, such as during an 

extreme pest infestation.

In parallel to minimising the use of 

chemical pesticides, GAR is promoting 

the use of biopesticides to enhance the 

health condition of the soils and the 

palm trees.

revenue while potentially reducing the 

need for more agricultural land. 

Following years of R&amp;D, GAR launched 

super high-yielding seeds Eka 1 and 

Eka 2, capable of producing over 10 

tonnes/hectare/year of CPO in 2017. 

This is almost three times higher than the 

current national average in the Indonesian 

palm oil industry. SMARTRI and SMART 

Biotechnology Centre are now working on 

creating a sufficient clonal seed stock to 

be planted in the estates in the next few 

years. To date, around 3.3 million clones 

have been produced for replanting. 

Our biotech division has also succeeded 

in finding and developing genes related 

to resistance to the Ganoderma disease.1 

These can be used as molecular markers 

to select seeds and clones that are 

resistant to the disease.

 

In light of climate change, SMARTRI is also 

continuing to work on developing more 

climate-resilient varieties which are more 

drought-resistant as well as looking at 

strains which can better adapt to high CO2 

content in the atmosphere. The biotech 

division is looking into developing genetic 

molecular markers for selecting seeds and 

clones that are drought-resistant. 

 

Spotlight on GAR and new technologies

GAR is pursuing intensification of oil 

palm cultivation through a progressive 

implementation of precision 

agriculture. Precision agriculture aims 

to maximise yield through more precise 

application of inputs such as fertiliser 

and chemicals – doing  more with 

less. This approach includes finding 

new ways to increase the efficiency 

of field practices; using new research 

tools such as biotechnology and high 

throughput phenotyping; and combining new 

technologies for remote observation of palm 

trees with AI and digitalisation.

GAR is already using some techniques in 

the field while readying others for rollout. 

These techniques can help increase palm 

productivity as well as reduce negative impacts 

on the environment and our workers in the

field. For example, we have been testing 

new methods of fertiliser application, using a 

new generation of spreaders that are able to 

modulate the application rate based on site 

requirement. We are developing a similar 

approach in our use of pesticides, with the aim 

of continuously reducing the use of chemicals. 

We are also carrying out remote observation

PROPER ACHIEVEMENT 

Since 2007, GAR has participated in the 

Indonesian Ministry of Environment’s 

national public environmental reporting 

initiative known as the Programme for 

Pollution Control, Evaluation and Rating 

(PROPER). The programme uses a colour-

coded rating to assess water and air pollution 

control, hazardous waste management 

and environmental impact. PROPER also 

considers other indicators, including 

the impact of a company’s community 

PROPER RATING SYSTEM

Gold

For businesses/activities that have successfully displayed 

environmental management effort and achieved excellent results.

Green

For businesses/activities that have displayed environmental 

management effort and achieved results better than those required 

by regulation.

Blue

For businesses/activities that have displayed environmental 

management effort, and have achieved the minimum standard 

required by regulation.

Red

For businesses/activities that have displayed environmental 

management effort, but have achieved only part of the minimum 

standard required by regulation.

Black

For businesses/activities that do not display significant 

environmental management effort.

Our Environmental Management

development programmes; progress of 

biodiversity conservation efforts; efficiency 

of water management; and innovations in 

emissions reduction, waste management 

and energy efficiency. 

In 2020, 31 GAR mills passed the PROPER 

assessment with Blue rating. Four of our 

downstream facilities have also achieved Blue 

rating. To ensure that we are aligned with 

PROPER requirements, internal audits and 

training are carried out in the company’s mills.

MONITORING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

[103-3, 307-1]

We manage and regularly monitor 

every aspect of our operations in order 

to minimise adverse impact on the 

natural environment.  The monitoring 

is in accordance with the Environment 

Management Plan (Rencana Pengelolaan   

Lingkungan) and the Environment 

Monitoring Plan (Rencana Pemantauan 

Lingkungan), as set out in the Environmental 

Impact Assessment (Analisa Mengenai 

Dampak Lingkungan) documents submitted 

to the Government of Indonesia. 

Assessment of the environmental 

parameters is conducted by SMARTRI, our 

ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 17025 accredited 

internal laboratory, as well as external 

laboratories referred by the Indonesian 

authorities.

Our regular internal monitoring and 

assessments are guided by the ISO 

14001:2004 Environment Management 

Systems and ISO 9001:2008 Quality 

Management Systems. 

GAR did not incur any fines or penalties for 

violations of environmental regulations.

At the same time, we recognise that 

the establishment of plantations creates 

changes for local communities and 

indigenous people. As stated in the GSEP, 

we are committed to respecting human 

rights and fulfilling Free, Prior and Informed 

Consent (FPIC) requirements before any 

operations begin.1 GAR is also committed 

to improving processes and procedures 

with regards to respecting the customary 

rights of local and indigenous communities. 

RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND 

FREE, PRIOR AND INFORMED 

CONSENT (FPIC) 

[103-2, 103-3, 411-1] 

FPIC is a core tenet of the GSEP and part 

of our commitment to upholding human 

and community rights. We implement 

FPIC in all our plantations. Respecting 

FPIC means we ensure that decision-

making by indigenous peoples and local 

communities regarding the presence of 

our operations is done:

• 

Without pressure and intimidation (free);

• 

Performed before an activity that has 

impact on the surrounding communities 

is carried out (prior); 

The palm oil sector plays an important 

role in the rural development of 

communities in countries like Indonesia. 

In addition to providing employment 

opportunities, we focus our community 

efforts by respecting the rights of 

indigenous and local communities; 

building important infrastructure such as 

roads, schools and healthcare; as well as 

improving the livelihoods of communities 

and farmers through better income 

opportunities. 

To make sure that we do not have an 

adverse impact on local communities, 

we carry out Environmental and Social 

Impact Assessments (EIA and SIA) at the 

site of our operations prior to any new 

Participatory Mapping:

158 villages 

since 2015

Since 2014, GAR has stopped opening new nucleus estates, choosing instead to focus on yield improvement. 

During this unprecedented global 

pandemic, we continued to focus on 

supporting the local communities 

in and around our plantations. We 

are helping to provide masks and 

other personal protective equipment 

(PPE) for employees, communities 

and medical personnel working in 

the villages. Our long-term initiatives 

such as Alternative Livelihoods have 

also proved useful in helping rural 

communities maintain food security in 

a period when global and local supply 

chains were disrupted. 

Other critical facilities which we 

maintain in rural areas are also 

providing key services during the 

pandemic. Visits to our 104 clinics 

increased due to more patients having 

to be tested or seeking treatment. 

The clinics will also prove critical in the 

COVID-19 vaccination programme.

Our FPIC SOP summary can be found

Our rollout of Participatory Mapping (PM), 

including land tenure studies, seeks to

programme was interrupted in 2020 due 

to the COVID-19 related safe distancing 

measures. Nevertheless, we have carried 

out PM at 158 villages. See the section

In 2020, as part of the Global

RESPONSIBLE CONFLICT 

RESOLUTION

Our policies and practices are designed 

to minimise the likelihood of any 

conflicts arising from our operations. 

However, when these conflicts do arise 

we are committed to working towards a 

responsible resolution.

Our conflict management system maps 

all conflicts related to our operations 

Engaging and Empowering the Community

and develops action plans to address 

them. It incorporates: transparent 

monitoring and reporting; the option for 

local community and customary groups to 

access independent legal and technical 

advice; the ability for complainants to 

choose individuals or groups to support 

them or act as observers; as well as the 

option of a third-party mediator. We 

categorically reject the use of violence in 

any dispute. 

Our SOP for conflict resolution can be 

viewed here. 

INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES 

[103-2, 103-3]

GAR aims to help multiply the positive 

impacts of the palm oil business through a 

range of education, healthcare, social and 

economic programmes for communities. 

In 2020, many of our annual community 

programmes which required close social 

interaction had to be curtailed or disrupted 

due to the necessity of social distancing. 

Nevertheless, our long-term investment 

and implementation of CSR programmes 

was recognised and we won two 

Indonesian CSR awards including the 

TOP CSR Awards 2020 #Star 5 and TOP 

Leader on CSR Commitment 2020. 

We also won the Tempo CSR Country 

Contributor Award 2020. The awards 

recognised our long-term fire prevention 

programme with the community - DMPA, 

our Alternative Livelihood programmes 

and our focus on education and health in 

local communities. 

We work with a wide range of partners 

including government agencies, 

local communities, as well as the Eka 

Tjipta Foundation (a non-profit social 

organisation founded by the family of the 

late Eka Tjipta Widjaja in 2006) and the 

Tzu Chi Foundation in Indonesia (affiliated 

with the non-denominational global Tzu 

Chi organisation established in Taiwan). 

Indonesia is a country with a young 

population. In this context, education 

is key, as it helps young people escape 

the cycle of rural poverty and increases 

their social mobility. Being able to earn 

a decent living from palm oil, coupled 

with the provision of schools in rural 

areas by plantation companies, has 

allowed many farmers’ families to keep 

their children in school and even send 

them on to further education and urban 

white-collar jobs.

than 330 medical personnel at 104 

clinics. During a crisis like the pandemic, 

these facilities have proven to be key in 

serving the community. In 2020, these 

clinics received on average over 1,600 

patients daily, due to Covid-related 

procedures such as COVID-19 screening 

and tests.

Our presence plays an important role 

as an economic driver and multiplier, 

and has helped in the development of 

various businesses in the remote areas 

of Indonesia. 

In the last few years, Alternative 

Livelihood projects have been launched 

in nearly 60 communities. These have 

allowed communities to grow extra food 

for their own use and improve their  

food security. For example, communities 

in several villages are taught how to 

grow vegetables, such as water spinach, 

spinach, chilli, mung bean, breed 

livestock and fish. Communities can 

save up to IDR 300,000 a month  

in expenses per household. Surplus 

crops can also be sold to earn a monthly 

additional income of up to IDR 500,000 

per household.

Spotlight on Alternative Livelihood Programmes during the global pandemic

For a few years now, GAR has been 

helping communities better plan, fund 

and grow food and other crops as part of 

our Alternative Livelihood and Integrated 

Ecological Farming Programmes. Against 

the backdrop of the current pandemic, the 

importance of enabling communities to 

improve their own food security through 

producing food locally is more evident 

than ever. Food secure communities are 

more resilient against supply disruptions.

The availability of whole foods, such as 

grains, fruits and vegetables plays a critical 

role in improving nutrition. In addition, 

growing cash crops generates additional 

incomes and potentially spurs further 

economic development and prosperity in 

the communities.

To date, this programme has helped 

more than nearly 60 communities across 

Indonesia improve their agricultural 

practices and grow crops ranging from 

organic vegetables to coffee.

opportunities, empower women and 

promote a culture of diversity.  

PAYING FAIR WAGES AND 

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

[103-2, 103-3, 401-2, 403-6]

We are committed to ensuring that all 

employees of GAR receive a wage that is 

equal to or above the minimum wage set 

for their respective province, in addition 

to a range of additional benefits.

 

Minimum wages in Indonesia are set by 

provincial and district authorities, and 

take into account the local prices of 

goods and services, and therefore the 

amount required for living.

In terms of benefits, full-time workers 

receive free healthcare for themselves 

and their family, company housing, water, 

electricity and free education for their 

children from kindergarten to junior 

high. GAR also provides its full-time 

workers with basic necessities such as 

rice. 

Our part-time workers receive free 

medical services at our polyclinics and 

their children have access to education 

at our estate schools.

RECOGNISING, RESPECTING AND 

STRENGTHENING WORKERS’ RIGHTS

[103-2, 103-3, 409-1]

We believe in the fair, equal and 

respectful treatment for all our 

employees and workers. Through 

the GSEP, we have reinforced our 

commitment to ensuring that the rights 

of all people working in our operations 

are respected. The company also 

fully complies with local, national and 

ratified international laws. We adhere 

to all Indonesian labour laws covering 

areas such as freedom of association 

for our employees, decent pay and 

working hours, non-discrimination and 

the complete elimination of child and 

forced labour. Where legal frameworks 

are not yet in place, we defer to the 

International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) 

Declaration on Fundamental Principles 

and Rights at Work. 

Our commitment to fair labour is also 

emphasised in our company Code of 

Conduct and employment practices. 

Our People

We have an equal opportunities policy 

on employment, banning discrimination 

based on race, national origin, religion, 

disability, gender, sexual orientation, 

union membership and political affiliation. 

Employees enter into employment freely 

and are not required to deposit identity 

papers or money. 

We are also engaging our supply chain on 

our labour standards, including prohibiting 

child labour, as part of our efforts to 

help them comply with the GSEP and 

adopt responsible practices. For more 

information on how we work on human 

rights in our supply chain, see the section 

on Transforming our Supply Chain.

PROHIBITING CHILD LABOUR

[408-1]

As per regulations, the minimum age for 

employment in GAR in any capacity is 

18 years. We aim to prevent all forms of 

child labour, and we rigorously enforce 

these principles at all our plantations, 

mills and other workplaces. Our 

recruitment officers check identification 

cards against the candidate’s schooling 

records, such as their school diploma, 

to ensure that we only employ people 

aged 18 and above. We also provide 

schools and day care centres for our 

workers’ children which allows parents 

to send their children somewhere 

safe while they are at work. GAR is 

currently categorised as an Achiever 

by the Global Child Forum Southeast 

Asia Benchmark, which assesses major 

companies on how well they uphold 

and promote children’s rights. 

DIVERSITY AND GENDER EQUALITY 

[103-2, 103-3, 406-1]

We believe in promoting gender 

equality in the workplace. The manual 

and physically demanding nature of 

agricultural work means that certain 

jobs continue to be more suited to 

male rather than female employees. 

Male workers perform  physical tasks 

such as harvesting FFB which can 

weigh between 23-27 kg, and carrying 

them to trucks for transport to the 

mills. Women generally work on 

weeding and collecting loose fruits 

that have fallen on the ground. 

Many women in rural areas also prefer 

to take on part-time jobs, as it gives 

them the flexibility and time for other 

responsibilities such as tending to the 

household; childcare; family gardens 

and other small businesses.  

We have zero tolerance for sexual 

harassment. We conduct extensive 

training and socialisation for all estate 

and mill workers to ensure this is 

understood. Gender committees with 

representatives from labour unions 

and management have been set 

up to promote female participation 

and advancement in the workplace. 

These committees also handle sexual 

harassment complaints. When a case 

of harassment is reported either 

formally or informally, the relevant 

committee investigates the situation 

to determine whether further 

sanctions or law enforcement actions 

are needed. During the investigation, 

the committee also provides 

assistance and support to the victim. 

In 2020, no cases of harassment or 

abuse were reported. 

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND 

TRADE UNION MEMBERSHIP 

[102-41, 407-1]

122 labour 

unions representing 

62,000 

employees 

Freedom of association is mandated by 

Indonesian Law and Regulation No. 21/ 

2000 on Trade/ Labour Unions and is in line 

with the International Labour Organization 

Convention No. 98 on the freedom of 

organisation and collective bargaining. 

Each of our units has union representatives, 

elected by members. They meet with local 

management representatives regularly in 

bipartite forums, to discuss and resolve 

issues. In 2020, 62,000 employees (69 

percent) were represented by 122 labour 

unions across our operations. 

TRAINING AND DEVELOPING OUR 

PEOPLE’S SKILLS

[103-2, 103-3, 404-2, 404-3]

We see training and development as 

an investment that delivers benefits to 

both employees and the employer. GAR 

spent more than USD 2.9 million in 2020 

on training and development in our 

Indonesian operations.  

We have introduced the Objective &amp; 

Key Results (OKR) approach to achieve 

business results. Through OKR, every 

individual will work towards concrete, 

action-oriented and results-driven 

targets. Regular performance feedback 

is one of the important aspects to 

ensure the effectiveness of OKR. 

This can now be carried out through 

Workday, a HR digital platform. Using 

Workday, all GAR employees will 

undergo a career development and Key 

Performance Indicator (KPI) review at 

least once a year.  

In 2020, we switched to using virtual 

tools such as webinars and online 

workshops to carry out employee 

training programmes due to the 

necessity of safe distancing during the 

pandemic.  

GSEP training has also been carried out 

for over 74,000 employees to date.   

For more details on employee training 

see the GAR Annual Report 2020.

CREATING A SAFE AND HEALTHY 

WORKPLACE

[103-2, 103-3, 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 

403-7, 403-9] [FB-AG-320a.1]

OHS

With over a hundred thousand employees 

across our operations, we take our 

responsibility in providing a safe and 

healthy workplace very seriously.  Our 

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 

management system aims to minimise 

workplace accidents, fatalities and other 

negative health impacts and covers 

all employees. The OHS systems that 

we implement are based on national 

and international frameworks. National 

requirements include Indonesian national 

OHS standards (regulation no. 50 (2012)). 

We also base our OHS system on various 

certifications including ISO 14001, OHSAS 

18001 and ISO 45001. Sustainable palm 

oil certification OHS requirements are also 

taken into consideration including the 

Principles and Criteria of RSPO, ISCC and 

ISPO. 

Additionally, our Indonesian operations 

under SMART are certified under the 

SMK3 (Sistem Manajemen Keselamatan 

dan Kesehatan Kerja) OHS management 

system, in recognition of good OHS 

management and implementation. 

Fifteen mills and one estate have been 

reviewed and certified under SMK3. These 

certifications are valid for three years 

and a fresh audit is carried out prior to 

renewal. 

We currently have over 200 OHS experts 

within our workforce and conduct periodic 

training for all employees in accordance 

with national regulations. The pandemic 

interrupted scheduled OHS training in 

2020. Despite this, more than 3,000  of 

our employees received OHS training and 

online OHS training was implemented in 

14 regions. 

In compliance with Law No. 1 of 1970 on 

Occupational Safety, each of our units 

has an OHS Supervisory Committee, 

which promotes co-operation between 

management and employees on OHS. 

On average, the committees for our 

plantations and mills have 40 members, 

with 60 percent worker representation. 

The committee meets monthly to 

review OHS data and performance. 

Monthly safety briefings are given to 

employees. 

We also assess work-related hazards 

through Hazard Identification and Risk 

Analysis, and by conducting OHS Cross 

Inspection to record unsafe actions 

and conditions. The Safety Committee 

will consider the hazards and risks and 

determine suitable action to address 

gaps such as additional training; 

reviewing and strengthening safety 

SOPs; and ensuring Personal Protective 

Equipment (PPE) is adequate and worn 

by employees. 

All our downstream facilities have 

Occupational Health Service Centres. 

The centres conduct Health Risk 

Assessments (HRA) annually to identify 

occupational health hazards and 

establish control measures to minimise 

such risks. 

Workplace accidents 

We regret to report two fatalities 

involving our employees and two 

involving our contractors in 2020. The 

fatal incidents included being struck 

with a palm harvesting tool and falling.

checks, frequent disinfection, cleaning

guidelines issued by authorities wherever 

we operate and remain on standby to 

implement measures such as Working

details can be found on our website.

Looking after employees during the 

pandemic

We continue to ensure that our employees 

stay safe and healthy during the ongoing 

global pandemic. We have instituted new 

management measures at the workplace 

including mask-wearing, temperature 



Body temperature check before entering the workplace by Nugroho Wahyu Widianto

We have investigated each accident 

thoroughly and implemented various 

action plans to safeguard against future 

occurrences such as improved and 

targeted safety training. We will continue 

to work on instilling a stronger OHS 

awareness and practices throughout 

our operations, as well as continuing to 

aim for a declining trend in workplace 

accidents and zero fatalities.     

 

Healthcare and Well-being  

[403-6]

We are committed to providing our entire 

workforce with access to healthcare, 

including in remote rural areas where 

there is less incentive for healthcare 

professionals to practice. We have over 

100 clinics, which cover all our estates, 

and more than 330 medical personnel 

providing medical services that is free for 

our workers.  

The medical care that our facilities provide 

includes pre-employment medical check-

ups for new recruits, and special medical 

check-ups for workers who are exposed 

to potential health and safety hazards. 

The medical check-up programme is part 

of our effort to prevent and treat work-

related illnesses through early detection.

To promote employee wellness, talks on 

various health topics are held regularly. An 

example included talks on the prevention 

of HIV and the danger of drug addiction.  

Information is also disseminated regarding 

ergonomics and work fatigue. We 

also provide healthy menus based on 

medical advice at staff canteens, in an 

effort to promote better nutrition for our 

employees. Sports and fitness facilities 

for employees such as basketball and 

badminton courts are also available. 

Security guards 

[410-1]

The safety of our workers and their 

families is of utmost importance, 

particularly in isolated rural areas. 

We employ security guards for our 

operations in Indonesia to ensure 

that our plantations and surrounding 

communities are secure. Our security 

guards are required to undergo a 21-day 

comprehensive training programme by 

the Bhakti Manunggal Karya Centre of 

Education and Training (BMK). Upon 

completion, they receive a certificate 

from the Indonesian National Police. 

The programme covers human rights 

standards as well as professional ethics.

Our security guards do not carry 

firearms but are equipped with standard 

defensive security tools such as batons 

and handcuffs.
