financing solutions




our network to 70 outlets, making our 

Group one of the largest pawnbroking 

chains with presence in both Singapore

As a customer-centric and innovative 

company, our Group is constantly

standards in the pawnbroking industry. 

Our Group was the first pawnbroking

kind in ASEAN in 2018. 

As part of our efforts to expand our 

markets and services, MoneyMax 

made its maiden foray into the People’s 

Republic of China (“PRC”) in 2016 via a 

joint venture to provide financial leasing 

services in Chongqing, PRC. In 2017, our 

Group entered into a joint venture with 

Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed Aucnet Inc. 

(“Aucnet”), to jointly develop Singapore’s 

first online ‘live’ business-to-business 

(“B2B”) auction platform, focusing on 

luxury brand merchandise, and gold 

and diamond goods. In 2018, our Group 

ventured into the automotive financial 

services industry, providing a one-stop

the coveted Singapore Prestige Brands 

Award, including Overall Winner Award

Popular Brand Award (Established 

Brands – 2015), and has been inducted 

into its prestigious Hall of Fame in 2015. 

MoneyMax is proud to be named by

SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AT 

MONEYMAX

SUSTAINABILITY is crucial to 

MoneyMax’s development of long-

term growth. In this sustainability 

report (“Report”) for the financial 

year ended 31 December (“FY”) 2020, 

we will highlight key developments 

and achievements relating to the 

economic, environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) factors that are 

material to our stakeholders.

The key expectations of respective 

stakeholders are major considerations to 

our Group when formulating our business 

strategies. This allows our Group to 

optimise our financial and human capital 

resources in a manner that ensures 

continual generation of growth and 

sustainability in the long term. Events 

that happened in FY2020 have 

also emphasised the neccessity of 

modernisation and digitalisation to 

further automate processes for our 

Group to remain competitive and being 

equipped to face future challenges.

Board Statement

I AM pleased to present our Group’s 

Sustainability Report 2020 to our 

stakeholders. Despite the current pandemic 

situation, our Group remains committed 

to support our customers, employees and 

society at large. This Report continues 

to encapsulate our Group’s overarching 

strategy to achieve sustainable growth, 

as well as providing greater insight and 

updates to the material ESG matters that 

the senior management, in tandem with 

our board of directors (the “Board”), have 

identified and overseen on our pathway to 

sustainable growth.

FY2020 was an unprecedented year as our 

Group had to cope with the impact of the 

COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our Group 

also faced significant headwinds including 

the volatility of gold prices, economic 

uncertainties, disruption of supply chains 

and changing consumer habits. As part of 

the myriad of responses to the pandemic, 

our Group had to temporarily close most 

of our retail stores and pawnbroking 

services during the Circuit Breaker period. 

Notwithstanding these events, with the 

hard work and resilience of our workforce, 

in addition to our ability to adapt to the 

challenging environment, FY2020 was in 

many aspects an exceptional stellar year 

for our Group where we achieved a higher 

turnover compared to FY2019. 

In this Report, we are excited to share 

the progress that our Group has made in 

relation to the main tenets that we have 

identified for sustainable growth. 

Sustainable Economic Growth

Coping with the impact of the COVID-19 

situation on the retail sector, our management 

quickly pivoted its operational procedures 

in compliance with the Safe Management 

Measures mandated by the Singapore 

Multi-Ministry Taskforce, placing the health 

and safety of our customers and employees 

as our main priority. Despite the challenges 

that brick and mortar industries faced with 

the strict imposition of social distancing 

regulations, our Group was able to reduce 

the impact on our businesses by stepping up 

our digital capabilities to enable customers 

to connect electronically and switching 

distribution channels during the Circuit 

Breaker period to target consumers at home. 

In particular, the investments made into 

digitalising our Group’s businesses also 

helped the continuation of our operations 

during the Circuit Breaker period. Our 

Group also implemented various cost 

cutting measures to mitigate the impact 

during these months. With prudent 

management of our Group’s resources, 

we were able to minimise the disruption to 

our backend operations. This allowed our 

Group to continue to launch and enhance 

new products and service offerings as 

well as retaining our customers through 

goodwill measures, loyalty programmes 

and marketing campaigns for the remainder 

of FY2020.

Protecting Our Diverse Workforce 

and Workplace

Our Group made a concerted effort in 

FY2020 to invest significant resources into 

our workforce across Singapore. Against a 

backdrop of economic uncertainties, our 

Group not only retained our workforce but 

also continued to invest in human resource. 

Our Group also stepped up efforts to 

protect our employees in their homes as 

well as our workplace by providing masks 

and sanitizers speedily and enabling work-

from-home arrangements. Multiple online 

training sessions on new products, audit 

measures, service skills and valuation were 

also conducted to upgrade staff as well as 

to boost staff’s morale and confidence. 

In solidarity with the efforts of the Singapore 

government to support the economy, our 

Group also participated in the SG United 

Traineeship program to hire undergraduates 

seeking employment. To accommodate 

our growing workforce, our Group also 

revamped our headquarters at Changi 

Business Park to maximise available 

office space. Our Group will continue to 

look for more opportunities in FY2021 

to acquire talent and to further enhance 

the productivity and proficiency of our 

workforce. 

Our inclusive workplace environment 

encourages employees across all levels 

and backgrounds to contribute actively, 

driving the success of our Group. We are 

committed to expanding our diversified 

working environment with a focus on cross-

cultural fluency and gender equality, and 

investment in the silver generation in our 

workforce. We also believe in empowering

Moving Forward

Our Group is pleased to receive recognition 

as one of “Singapore’s Fastest Growing 

Companies 2020” by The Straits Times 

in January 2020. This recognition is an 

affirmation of our Group’s dedication 

towards creating a brand that is trusted and 

professional, as well as our Group’s ability 

to adapt and ability to pursue opportunities 

as they arise throughout the years. 

With COVID-19 affecting the global 

economy on an unprecedented scale, 

consumer sentiments in the upcoming 

year remain uncertain. The increasing 

pace of vaccinations across the globe, 

coupled with the robust measures that 

have been implemented thus far have 

been effective in curbing the spread of 

COVID-19 in Singapore. With this in mind, 

our Group remains cautiously optimistic on 

the economic conditions in the upcoming 

year and will continue to focus on providing 

sustainable growth to our stakeholders 

by prioritising cost management, human 

resource development, work process 

optimisation, digital transformation and 

driving new product and service innovations.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 

our management team and our colleagues 

at MoneyMax for their dedication and 

collective effort in driving our businesses 

through these challenging times. In 

particular, I would like to extend my heartfelt 

appreciation to our colleagues providing 

front-line services for their commitment and 

desire to continue serving our customers 

throughout the pandemic. I would also like 

to thank our business associates, partners, 

shareholders and customers for their 

continued support throughout the year. As 

we progress into the new fiscal year, let us 

look forward to a better 2021.

I believe the COVID-19 situation has 

created opportunities for us to bring the 

sustainability agenda to the fore, motivating 

us to rethink, reset and review our role 

as a growing trusted listed company in 

Singapore. Sustainability is at its essence a 

balancing act that requires our stakeholders 

to be constantly committed. This Report 

represents an important facet of this 

commitment. Together with the Board, 

we look forward to the future progression 

of our Group. 

individuals within our Group and leaving a 

positive impact in our local communities. 

We will continue to diligently invest in staff 

training, brand enhancement and work 

process efficiencies to prepare our Group 

for the next phase of growth. 

Environmental Responsibility

We continue to strive for high standards 

of environmental responsibility in the way 

we conduct our business. We continuously 

aim to minimise our environmental impact 

through digital transformation efforts 

by promoting cashless payment, online 

valuation and e-renewal services as part 

of our efforts to go paperless during our 

daily operations. This has proved fruitful as, 

in FY2020, we continue to see a significant 

uptake in our e-renewal services as many 

customers prefer to renew their interest 

online from the safety of their homes during 

the pandemic. 

Community

Despite the pandemic environment, our 

Group remains keenly aware of our role 

as a responsible corporate citizen and to 

be responsive to the needs of the wider 

communities in which we are involved 

in. Our Group participated in a year-

long community based project to help  

underprivileged families. This corporate 

social responsibility (“CSR”) initiative is 

in conjunction with Radin Mas Citizens’

The First Step In Sustainability 

Planning

WE recognise the importance of 

meaningful two-way engagement with 

our key stakeholders to understand 

their concerns and interests. We 

identify stakeholders as groups which 

have an impact, or have the potential to 

be impacted by our business. As part 

of our materiality assessment process, 

we have identified six key stakeholder 

groups we engage with based on their 

level of influence and interest. 

Effective stakeholders’ engagement 

allows our Group to better anticipate 

and react to problems. Stakeholders’ 

engagement also forms the basis 

for our strategies to ensure future 

sustainability. Our engagement 

strategy includes formal and informal 

channels of communications, as well as 

internal review processes to integrate 

stakeholders’ feedback with our 

corporate strategies.

ECONOMIC 

Sustainable Economic Growth 

FY2020 marked a turbulent year with the 

first ever worldwide shutdown of borders 

in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, 

resulting in disruption in the global 

economy and increased unpredictability 

of market trends. Local economies faced 

new challenges with the changes in 

government policies and measures to 

curb the spread of the virus. 

Our Group maximised on our existing 

resources and capabilities to continue 

to connect with our stakeholders during 

these times. We continued to build on our 

capabilities to reach out and innovate our 

product offerings to customers. 

As part of our long term strategy to 

enhance our brand equity, our Group 

continuously built on our product 

offerings by designing and developing 

our own 916 Love Gold collection. We 

also further increased the range of our 

jewellery designs as well as expanded 

our variety of products. 

During the Circuit Breaker period, our 

retail division was fully closed whereas 

our pawnbroking division was permitted 

to open at a limited number of outlets. 

We continued to reach out to customers 

through increased participation on 

online platforms such as Shoppee, 

Lazada, Qoo10 as well as hosting our 

own Facebook Live to promote our 

products. 

From this experience, we had greatly 

understood the importance of 

digitalisation for both our Group and 

our customers. We encourage customers 

to sign up on our online platform, 

Moneymax eRenewal service, which 

will enable them to continue to renew 

their loans if they are unable to come 

MoneyMax Financial Services Ltd.  9

to our stores in person. Our Group has 

progressed into the second year of 

the motor vehicle financing industry 

with our one-stop financing solution 

through Moneymax Leasing Pte. Ltd. and 

Moneymax Assurance Agency Pte. Ltd. 

We frequently review the market trends 

to offer competitive rates which benefit 

our customers.

Our Group believes in the continual 

enhancing of our market position 

through building on our customer base 

and providing the best options to our 

customers. We continue to look for 

and collaborate with strategic business 

partners such as car dealers to reach out 

to the market. We have also expanded 

our insurance services to include home 

and commercial insurance. 

We strive to remain innovative and 

stay relevant with rapid changes in 

consumers’ preferences, market trends 

and offerings. We will continue to 

focus efforts on driving new service 

innovations and business offerings so 

as to generate new revenue streams 

and deliver sustainable growth. This is 

critical for us to maintain our competitive 

edge and continue to deliver sustainable 

growth in view of the weaker consumer 

sentiments and uncertain post COVID-19 

economic outlook.

Our Group recorded better results for 

FY2020 as compared to FY2019 with 

increased revenue of S$197.1 million 

and higher profit before tax of S$26.8 

million.

For a detailed review on the economic 

performance of MoneyMax for FY2020, 

please refer to our annual report for 

FY2020.








Group Businesses

Pawnbroking

THE provision of pawnbroking services 

remains as the core of our Group’s 

operations. To cater to the needs of 

our consumers, our Group has outlets 

located in highly accessible areas in 

Singapore and Malaysia. Our outlets 

also operate longer operating hours to 

cater to the schedules of our consumers. 

As at 31 December 2020, we have a 

network of 70 pawnbroking outlets 

in Singapore and Malaysia, making us 

one of the largest pawnbroking chains 

in the region.

The availability of pawnbroking services 

provides an alternative source of short-

term financing that is convenient and 

lawful. Our Group extends loans to 

our pawners on a pre-determined 

loan to value ratio that is based on the 

valuation of their collateral assets. These 

collateral assets are often items such as 

gold jewellery, diamonds, gemstones, 

timepieces and other luxury items. 

To ensure security of our pledges, our 

outlets are equipped with advanced 

security systems and storage facilities, 

and are kept under round-the-clock 

surveillance. Our Group also engages 

an independent external security 

firm to constantly monitor our alarm 

systems. The pledges of our pawners 

are insured in accordance with the 

regulatory requirements of the Registry 

of Pawnbrokers.

Our Group made a concerted effort 

in FY2020 to invest significant 

resources into upgrading our existing 

capabilities as part of our Group’s digital 

transformation roadmap. In 2018, our 

Group had launched an online platform 

for our pawnbroking customers to 





renew their pawn tickets without having 

to visit our stores in person. Due to 

social distancing measures and closure 

of borders, we observed a significant 

uptake in our e-renewal services. Our 

Group also placed a heavy emphasis 

on its digital marketing and customer 

relations management systems with the 

aim of providing seamless, on demand 

services to our customers. 

Our Group is governed by, and strictly 

adheres to, the prevailing laws under the 

Pawnbrokers Act 2015 and the directions 

of the Registrar of Pawnbrokers for our 

pawnbroking business in Singapore as 

well as Pawnbrokers Act 1972 for our 

pawnbroking business carried out in 

Malaysia.

Retail

Aside from the pawnbroking business, 

our Group is building on our retail and 

trading business for luxury products. 

Our operations comprise the retail 

and trading of new and pre-owned 

luxury products such as gold, jewellery, 

timepieces and handbags. Leveraging 

on our pawnbroking business, the 

retail and trading of new and pre-

owned luxury items expand on our 

Group’s core competencies of retail 

outreach, customer-centric service 

and valuation expertise to increase our 

range of products and services. We 

have digitalised our services so that 

consumers can access our 3-in-1 online 

platform to shop, sell and appraise 

valuables. We have also expanded our 

customer outreach through established 

online platforms as well as further 

improving our online store offerings.

MoneyMax is committed to managing 

and minimising the impact of our 

business operations along with our 

supply chain. The supply chain for our 

retail and trading business is primarily 

made up of manufacturers and second-

hand luxury goods dealers. We source 

our products globally across Asia, the 

Middle East and Europe.

We consistently engage our suppliers 

through strict quality control inspections, 

authentication checks by our trained 

employees and evaluations of the items 

to ensure the quality of our products. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, our 

supply source has been disrupted 

with global shutdowns. In view of this, 

our team continues to source for new 

suppliers as well as work with existing 

suppliers to find solutions in the face of 

the limitations. 

Aside from being a luxury products 

retailer, MoneyMax also creates value for 

customers by providing an avenue for 

them to sell their pre-owned items to us.

Governance

Legal Compliance And Corporate 

Governance 

WE maintain a firm and sound system of 

governance principles and accountability 

structures within the Group to ensure 

compliance to regulations and maintain 

good corporate governance.  

Our industry is regulated under the 

Pawnbrokers Act 2015, the Pawnbroking 

Rules 2015, the Anti-Money Laundering 

(“AML”) regulations and Precious 

Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention 

of Money Laundering and Terrorism 

Financing) Act 2019 in Singapore, as 

well as the Pawnbroking Act 1972 in 

Malaysia. As we deal with second-

hand products, we also need to abide 

by the Secondhand Goods Dealers 

Act (Chapter 288A) in Singapore. 

In addition, as a company listed on 

Catalist of the SGX-ST, we are governed 

by the Catalist Rules, including rules 

on transparency and disclosure 

requirements.

Our Group has designated personnel 

who will monitor and disseminate any 

updates in the rules and regulations. 

They are responsible to assess these 

updates and ensure our Group is in 

compliance with these updates. Our 

Executive Chairman and CEO, Dato 

Sri’ Dr Lim Yong Guan, also actively 

participates as a Council Member in the 

Singapore Pawnbrokers’ Association 

which often shares and updates 

members on the latest developments in 

the industry in terms of business ethics 

and regulations. Our Group is also a 

member of the Hire Purchase, Finance 

Leasing Association of Singapore 

which shares industry updates and 

information. 

We are pleased to report that there 

has not been any incidence of non-

compliance with any of the laws, rules 

and regulations governing our business 

in FY2020 (FY2019: Nil). We intend to 

maintain strict compliance with these laws, 

rules and regulations for the financial year 

ending 31 December 2021 (“FY2021”).

To ensure our processes are aligned to 

the principles and governance structure, 

we conduct periodic evaluations on 

the decision-making processes and 

operational policies and procedures. 

We also conduct regular training and 

refresher sessions for employees to 

keep them aware and updated on the 

compliance requirements as well as how 

to conduct customer due diligence and 

profiling checks. 

Our Group has set up our own internal 

risk and compliance (“R&amp;C”) team 

whose main responsibilities are not 

limited to ensuring compliance to our 

Group standard policies and procedures 

as well as adherence to prevailing 

regulations and guidelines. 

In FY2020, we conducted a total 

of 25 physical and virtual internal 

training sessions and discussions 

with all our staff to provide them, 

amongst operational and other matters, 

regulatory and anti-money laundering 

updates including regulations related 

to illegal conduct and references on 

anti-corruption laws and published 

cases. There were approximately 223 

employees, from entry to management 

level, who have attended these training 

sessions and discussions conducted 

across small group trainings as well as 

online video conferencing platforms.

Anti-Corruption And Anti-Fraud

Our Group maintains a firm policy 

against dishonest and corrupt practices. 

Our Board and management has set 

the tone at the top for our Group in 

regard to illegal acts and behaviours as 

well as ambiguous practices. This sets 

the foundation for our Group’s code of 

conduct and ethical business practices.

We ensure that all business functions are 

aware of the code of conduct and ethical 

business practices in every jurisdiction 

and industries that we operate. We 

recognise that corruption and fraud 

will bring undesirable results to our 

Group including heavy financial losses, 

reputation loss and criminal punishment. 

Our Group heavily accentuates on ethical 

business practices which prohibits 

payment of bribes and acceptance of 

inappropriate gifts, amongst others. We 

strive towards upholding professional 

values and integrity when conducting 

our business.

Our Board plays a part in overseeing and 

guiding our Group’s internal controls and 

risk management systems.  Our Audit 

Committee (“AC”), comprising our three 

independent directors, also oversees 

the whistle-blowing policy through 

which employees may, in confidence, 

communicate concerns regarding matters 

such as misconduct, illegal activities, 

suspected fraud and other dishonest 

activities to an email account which 

can be accessed by selected personnel 

only. These concerns will be raised for 

discussion and evaluated by the directors 

and when necessary, an independent 

investigation will be arranged along with 

appropriate follow-up actions carried 

out by the AC Chairman. The AC will 

subsequently report to the Board on such 

matters. Details of our whistle-blowing 

policies and arrangements are made 

readily available to all employees. 

We are pleased to report that there 

was no case of whistle blowing report 

received in FY2020.

Our Group has established corporate 

governance policies that include and are 

not limited to dealings in securities and 

interested person transactions, which are 

disclosed in the Corporate Governance 

section on Page 37 and 38 in our annual 

report for FY2020. The Board reviews 

the corporate governance practices 

annually to ensure the relevance and 

effectiveness.  

As part of ongoing efforts to strengthen 

our Group’s efforts to prevent 

opportunities for dishonest and corrupt 

practices, we target to engage our 

business partners from the start and, 

as and when necessary,  communicate 

our existing whistle blowing policies and 

arrangements to provide them an avenue 

which they may raise any concerns in 

relation to such practices.

Our employees are briefed on our code 

of conduct and behavioural standards 

which are also outlined in our Employee 

Handbook. All our employees are 

required to adhere to this code and 

standards. We take a serious view of 

unethical conduct or malpractice in 

relation to corruption or fraud and 

formal disciplinary proceedings will be 

conducted where necessary.  Training 

and refreshers on ethical business 

behaviour and conduct are regularly held 

for employees to reinforce and reiterate 

these guidelines. Employees are also 

encouraged to feedback to supervisors 

or heads of department or even using 

the Whistleblowing channel to report 

any potential violations. 

There were no reported incidents of 

corruption or fraud for FY2020.

Data Privacy

Due to the regulatory requirements 

under the regulations and rules that 

govern our operations such as the 

Pawnbrokers Act, Secondhand Goods 

Dealer Rules and Hire-Purchase Act, we 

are required to maintain personal data 

of our customers. Our Group recognises 

the importance of personal data to 

the individuals and understands the 

expectation from our customers that 

their personal data is being collected, 

handled and protected in a responsible 

manner. Protecting our customers’ data 

is our top priority and we are committed 

to uphold the privacy and security of 

their personal data under the regulations 

and guidelines by the Personal Data

Protection Council (“PDPC”) under the 

Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”). 

Our Group has implemented stringent 

data protection policies and procedures 

in compliance with the PDPA standards, 

which define the methods of handling 

personal data. Robust security 

procedures over physical and digital 

data are in place to enforce data privacy. 

In compliant with PDPA, we have 

appointed a Data Protection Officer who 

is responsible for the following: 

• warranting the inclusion of PDPA 

compliance in our Group’s policies 

and processes, especially in regard to 

receiving, managing and safekeeping 

of personal data;

• nurturing a culture among employees 

to instil the importance of personal 

data and the proper ways to handle 

these data;

• communicating personal data 

protection policies to various 

stakeholders;

• dealing with personal data protection 

related queries and complaints within 

and outside of our Group;

• overseeing and highlighting any 

potential risks which might arise 

with regard to personal data to 

management; and

• liaising with the PDPC on data 

protection matters, if necessary.

Our employees are contractually obliged 

to keep all information communicated 

to them confidential. Our Group has 

implemented data access control 

rights in respect of all data captured 

from stakeholders and these rights 

are limited based on the needs of our 

employees’s roles to enable them to 

operate effectively within their scope 

of duties and yet reduce uneccessary 

information from being disclosed. These 

include password authorisation by levels 

of responsibility for access to sensitive 

data and printing out of listings and 

other records. 

In FY2020, our Group has enhanced 

our procedures and policies through the 

following improvements:

• Increased frequency of review of 

access rights to data from an annual 

basis to a biannual basis

• Engagement of external professional 

company to dispose of sensitive 

documents that are no longer required

• Creation of restricted access areas for 

storage of confidential documents

• Increased audits in relation to PDPA 

for outlets

• Set up of notices to inform customers 

of PDPA compliance actions such 

as consented close circuit television 

recordings and use of personal 

identification documents

• Compliance with the new regulations 

and guidelines for collection, use, 

disclosure and retention of NRIC or 

other identification documents

New employees will attend training 

on proper ways to manage personal 

data as part of their initiation into the 

Company. A total of 317 employees from 

head office staff to retail outlet staff 

have completed 3 hours of training and 

refresher course on handling personal 

data received from customers in day to 

day operations.  

All data collected in operating systems 

are stored securely in the data center, 

which is maintained offsite and has limited 

access. Personal information collected 

from online platforms are encrypted to 

prevent unauthorised access to read 

or modify the data and is maintained in 

accordance with PDPA guidelines.

We are required to store our pawn 

documents for a period of 5 years. 

The physical documents are stored 

in our warehouse where there is 

restricted access. In line with the PDPA 

requirements, we have appointed a third 

party service provider who specialises in 

disposal of sensitive physical documents.

In FY2020, there were no substantiated 

complaints received concerning 

breaches of customer privacy from 

customers or regulator and no identified 

loss of customer data across the outlets.

Social

 

Consumer Experience and 

Product Responsibility 

AS a customer-centric organisation, 

we aim to fulfill customers’ needs 

seamlessly and prioritise service quality. 

To enhance customer experience and 

build relationships, we have set up several 

customer feedback platforms in place via 

our Facebook page, email address on 

our website, in-store customer feedback 

forms and our telephone service hotline, 

which are managed by our customer 

service staff to ensure customers’ queries 

are followed up as timely as possible. We 

also periodically analyse the feedback 

received to understand customers’ 

viewpoints and concerns.  

Our Group appreciates that every 

customer interaction matters and 

is valuable. Hence we highlight the 

neccessity of continual development 

of our customer experience through 

training and innovation. We have 

conducted focused customer service 

trainings for our retail employees to 

enhance customer service quality.

In FY2020, we have also made use of 

the Circuit Breaker period to expand 

the training for our retail staff from 

product knowledge to service excellence. 

A total of 189 retail employees have 

undergone these training sessions. In 

addition, approximately 3 customers 

participated and provided their feedback 

on their experience in our outlets. In 

FY2020, we have a case of a customer 

lodging a complaint with CASE, but was 

subsequently withdrawn by the customer 

as the complaint was resolved amicably.

Risk Management 

Our management regularly reviews 

our Group’s procedures in accordance 

with the Enterprise Risk Management 

framework. This framework ensures that 

our management is able to systematically 

identify risks, determine the likelihood 

and impact of each risk, assess the fit 

for the existing risk controls, as well as 

implement additional risk controls when 

deemed necessary. 

Ad-hoc meetings and discussions are 

held by management to analyse and 

evaluate the risks involved in our business 

processes and industries. To further 

manage the risks, our internal R&amp;C team 

“Our management regularly reviews our 

Group’s procedures in accordance with the 

Enterprise Risk management framework.

conducts regular and ad-hoc inspections 

on our outlets which enables them to 

identify any process weaknesses or 

potential risks areas to be acknowledged 

and assessed. They also support in the 

investigation of reports of suspected 

misconduct or other matters as directed 

by our management. The internal R&amp;C 

team reports to our management on 

a regular basis on their findings and 

any significant process deviations are 

raised immediately to management. The 

information gathered provides up-to-

date data to our management which will 

facilitate the identification and mitigation 

of any risks that may arise.

PEOPLE are the core of our Group’s 

progress and success. From the frontline 

retail staff to the back office support 

team, MoneyMax considers all employees 

as valuable assets of our Group, each 

with a noteworthy role ensuring that the 

best product and services are provided 

to the end customer. 

We will continue to invest in human capital 

through technical and softskill training. 

Our Group is continously looking to further 

enhance our existing human resource 

policies to build an environment for 

employees to develop a vibrant, inclusive 

and progressive career with MoneyMax.

In FY2020, we adopted a corporate 

healthcare plan where employees can 

visit a panel of participating clinics at a 

discounted rate. This plan also directly 

subsidises the cost of consultation 

incurred by our employees who are not 

required to pay during the visit.

In the post-Circuit Breaker period, 

we implemented Safe Management 

Measures in our workplaces with 

distanced seating and staggered 

working hours. We started work-from-

home arrangements for our employees 

and encouraged online internal and 

external meetings.  We also distributed 

disposable masks and sanitsers to our 

head office and outlet staff. 

Diversity and Equal Opportunity

We at MoneyMax embrace diversity. We 

understand the importance of creating 

a wholesome environment where our 

employees feel that they are treated with 

respect and evaluated fairly.

Our Group believes that a diversified 

working environment which includes 

employees from different backgrounds, 

ethnicity and experiences will widen 

our Group’s perspective and influence 

individuals’ mindset. This will build a 

foundation for our Group to develop an 

environment of equal opportunities. We 

have provided our workforce data in the 

subsequent sections. 

All employees are assessed annually 

based on a structured apprasial system 

to evaluate the remuneration packages 

and career progression. 

Gender Diversity 

As at 31 December 2020, our workforce 

comprised a total of 317 employees on a 

permanent, full time basis. The majority 

of the top and middle management 

positions are represented by females. 

Gender diversity, particularly in the 

management positions, is essential in 

driving our Group’s business and future 

development. 

Career progression and remuneration 

within our Group is based on 

performance and contribution efforts 

to the day to day operations and ad-hoc 

projects. The percentage of females in 

our workforce has increased from 73% 

in FY2019 to 74% in FY2020. Our Group 

is pleased to report that there were no 

reports of gender discrimination for 

FY2020. We will strive to continue to 

maintain zero confirmed cases of gender 

discrimination to all our employees in 

FY2021.

Multi-Generational

Our workforce comes from a wide 

age diversity as we engage with 

employees of all ages from the 

younger millennial generation up to 

the veteran generation. Other than the 

diversification in ethnicity and gender, 

our Group believes the value of a multi-

generational workforce is limitless as 

it will bring substantial drive and a 

broader awareness to the organisation 

that will help us manage better on 

both internal and external fronts. Multi-

generational workforce will also bring 

about better receptiveness at our store 

fronts with wider understanding and 

tolerance.

Our Group is pleased to report that 

there were no feedback/reports of age 

discrimination for FY2020.

COMMUNITY

Corporate Social Responsibility 

OUR Group has a firm belief that we 

should give back to the society. We 

are heedful of the prominence of 

leaving a positive impact on our local 

community, as well as empowering 

and engaging the community. This 

is achieved through donations to 

meaningful causes and organisation of 

numerous activities and programmes 

by our Group’s CSR team.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, most 

fundraising and charitiable activities were 

limited due to social distancing concerns. 

Our Group continued to contribute 









back to society by means of monetary 

donations to charitable organisations, 

including Seu Teck Sean Tong Yiang Sin 

Sia (a charitable organisation registered 

with the Ministry of Culture, Community 

and Youth of Singapore which offers 

traditional Chinese medicine treatment 

and provides free medical care to the 

local community) and Radin Mas Citizens’ 

Consultative Committee Community 

Development and Welfare Fund (“Radin 

Mas CCC CDWF”).

With the gradual relaxing of COVID-19 

temporary measures, we look forward 

to be able to participate in the future 

community programmes which 

would allow us to interact with the 

underprivileged. 

“We are mindful of 

the importance of 

leaving a positive 

impact on our local 

community, as well 

as empowering 

and engaging the 

community.

Environmental

Waste Management &amp; Recycling

OUR Group carries out its business 

in a sustainable manner through 

implementing energy efficient 

practices and measures. We try our 

best to adhere to the traditional three 

principles of “Reduce, Re-use and 

Recycle” (the “3Rs”). The 3Rs aim to 

effectively minimise waste produced 

and to conserve precious metals or other 

materials for future use.

In our business operations, we purchase 

pre-owned items from gold to bags 

and watches for an amount based on 

the item’s value. This offers customers 

an alternative source to dispose items 

which is no longer desirable to them. 

We will assess the quality of these 

items, arrange for them to undergo 

professional refurbishment so that they 

can be reinstated to a better condition 

and attract their next owner.

In cases of items that are beyond 

refurbishment or items that are unable 

to sell for extended periods, our 

Group seeks to dispose the items in 

an environmentally friendly way. We 

work with third party refineries who 

are able to recycle gold items into 

new gold bars which are demanded 

by manufacturers.

Our Group is supportive of the Green 

Initiative and has implemented the 

following policies which are aimed to 

reduce the production of waste, and 

which we remain committed. Our Group 

will continue to explore and assess other 

policies that will help the environment.

• By encouraging our employees to 

adopt double-sided printing instead 

of single-sided printing

• By encouraging the submission 

of e-reports to the management 

and moving towards a paperless 

environment

• By encouraging storage of documents 

and information in softcopies and the 

use of shared drive to maintain records 

in place of the traditional paper filing

• By encouraging the recycling/reuse 

of used materials
