The Manager determines material sustainability matters 

as issues with significant ESG impacts to Cache. These 

material issues influence the decision-making process of 

the stakeholders and affect the achievement of short and 

long-term goals. In FY2018, the Manager and its Board 

reaffirmed that the reported material matters continue 

to be relevant in the current year. The Manager plans 

to engage external stakeholders in the assessment of 

material issues going forward.

FY2017

FY2018

Identification of 

sustainability 

matters

A formal materiality assessment workshop was conducted by an 

independent Sustainability Consultant with key representatives from 

the Manager and the Property Manager to identify the sustainability 

matters most relevant and significant to Cache’s internal and external 

stakeholders. 

A list of potential sustainability matters, including risks and opportunities 

was identified through:

• Peer benchmarking review of material matters

• Identification of internal and external stakeholders

• Discussion with key management representatives to understand 

their concerns, and the concerns of key external stakeholders with 

whom they communicate with

In FY2018, the material 

matters were reviewed 

to ensure continued 

relevance. These 

material matters were 

reaffirmed by the 

Manager and its Board. 

These material 

sustainability matters 

were presented by 

the Sustainability 

Consultant at the 

Cache Board Meeting 

and approved by the 

Board of Directors. 

The material and 

additional matters 

selected for reporting 

are shown in Figures  

5 and 6. 

Prioritisation

These sustainability matters were then prioritised through an unbiased, 

anonymous electronic voting exercise. The following set of criteria was 

used to determine the significance of each matter:

• Relevance to Cache’s business model, strategies and outcomes

• Likelihood and impact on the continuity of the business

• Influence on decision-making processes of key internal and external 

stakeholders

Validation

The results of the materiality voting exercise were further validated 

by benchmarking against other REIT Managers in the industry. Based 

on this list of material sustainability matters, the Manager put in 

place systems to incorporate sustainability across various business 

functions. 

 

Review

A final materiality assessment was conducted to evaluate the relevance 

of the material matters to determine their impact on internal and 

external stakeholders. From the assessment, the Manager has 

distilled five most critical sustainability matters and three additional 

sustainability matters for reporting. 

These material sustainability matters were presented by the 

Sustainability Consultant at the Cache Board Meeting and approved by 

the Board of Directors.

system of risk management and internal controls. 

Cache’s Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework 

covers the management of Cache’s strategic enterprise, 

operational, financial and compliance risks, whilst taking 

into consideration the governance, socioeconomic and 

environmental aspects of the business. The Manager 

reports to the AC on updates to the risk profiles on a 

quarterly basis.

The Manager has adopted prudent investment strategies, 

effective asset management and proactive stakeholder 

engagement in managing the strategic risks. The aim is to 

achieve balancing the risks and returns across its portfolio 

and reach sustainable long-term growth. The Manager 

RISK MANAGEMENT

manages the day-to-day operational risks which include

QUALITY OF ASSETS AND SERVICES

APPROACH

The Manager believes that tenant satisfaction has a 

positive correlation with the quality of asset and property 

services. High quality assets, along with regular upkeep 

and maintenance, are critical to attracting and retaining 

quality tenants. In achieving high rental and occupancy 

rates, the Manager strives to deliver sustainable higher 

returns to Unitholders over time.

The Manager has put in place a comprehensive investment 

and asset management policy. Strategically, it focuses on 

acquiring stable income-producing properties in locations 

with good logistics network and explores opportunities 

to improve operational efficiency and enhance assets.  

Such properties should also be up-to-date and well-

designed so that maintenance and capital expenditure 

would not be as extensive as older properties.

Relevant environmental and technical assessments are 

conducted on areas such as structural safety, mechanical 

and electrical systems, and energy efficiencies. In its 

day-to-day management, the Manager works closely 

with the Property Manager to improve the sustainable 

performance of the properties on maintenance and 

upgrading (i.e. AEIs). Regular feedback from tenants is 

gathered to better understand and meet their needs. 

Notes:

JTC Quarterly Market Report. Industrial Properties. 1Q – 4Q 2018.

The Manager aims to maintain a strong portfolio occupancy above the Singapore industrial average1 through the 

delivery of high-quality assets and services.

The Manager’s proactive asset management policy has added value to its tenants’ operational effeciency, resulting in a 

high portfolio occupancy rate of between 95.0% and 97.3% throughout FY2018 (FY2017: between 96.6% and 98.3%). 

This is above the Singapore warehouse market’s occupancy rate of between 88.5% to 89.5% for FY20182. 

Pandan Logistics Hub – Asset Enhancement Initiatives (“AEIs”)

In FY2018, Cache converted 38,000 sq. ft. of ambient warehouse into air-con space with customised specification 

and upgraded the sprinkler system for the new tenant in accordance to their logistics requirements. The AEI 

project resulted in higher occupancy and higher rental as compared to ambient space.

QUALITY OF SUPPLIERS

Cache seeks to promote sustainability in its supply chain 

processes and appoint responsible and ethical suppliers. 

The Manager and Property Manager work actively with 

approximately 69 suppliers in areas such as cleaning, 

security, landscaping, fire protection, pest control, and 

waste disposal. Potential vendors undergo a thorough 

procurement process which ensures that quality 

suppliers are selected based on their price, value, business 

ethics and compliance with applicable socioeconomic and 

environmental regulations. The relevant suppliers are 

required to provide information on their risk management 

plans in accordance with the Workplace Safety and Health 

Regulations 2006, including its track record in green 

projects and initiatives. On an annual basis, the Manager 

and Property Manager evaluate the performance of these 

suppliers to provide them with feedback for improvement. 

Non-compliant suppliers are penalised or terminated 

based on the contractual terms and are barred from 

providing services in the future.

TENANT AND VISITOR HEALTH, SAFETY AND SECURITY 

APPROACH

The Manager recognises its utmost responsibilities 

in ensuring the health, safety and security of its 

stakeholders, and strives to inculcate a “safety first 

mindset” throughout its everyday operations. Careful 

planning and management of this matter is important 

to enhance business resilience and respond swiftly to 

potential disruptions and challenges. As part of providing 

a safe workplace environment for its tenants and visitors, 

the Manager has installed Security Access control 

system (with access barriers and electromagnetic locks), 

closed-circuit televisions and deployed security guards at 

the properties.

Regular safety inspections are carried out by the 

Property Manager at the properties to prevent accidents 

or related health issues. Potential dengue, flu pandemics 

and other hazards are promptly dealt with through strict 

compliance with safety and health standards. Regular 

visual checks are carried out by the Property Manager 

during inspections for any potential mosquito breeding 

grounds. Any observations of water ponding and stagnant 

water are immediately highlighted to the tenants for 

housekeeping. The Property Manager also appoints a 

licensed pest and vector control company to carry out 

weekly mosquito and monthly pest control at all its multi-

tenanted properties.

Cache’s properties comply with the Singapore Civil 

Defence Force (“SCDF”) fire safety standards, with an 

Emergency Response Plan put in place. Licensed security 

officers assigned from security firms patrol the properties. 

In addition, a designated Fire Safety Manager (“FSM”) is 

appointed for each property. Based on SCDF guidelines, 

the FSM conducts two table-top exercises and two fire 

evacuation drills annually. A Fire Evacuation Drill report, 

including details on the evacuation procedures, list of 

participants, total time taken for the evacuation process 

and recommendations for improvements, is submitted to 

the Property Manager. The FSM also ensures that the 

fire-fighting system is well maintained and secured from 

tampering, while the properties’ escape routes are clearly 

communicated to the tenants and are free of obstruction.

Based on the Company Emergency Response Team 

(“CERT”) Scheme, Cache encourages its tenants to 

nominate their employees to be part of the team alongside 

members from the Property Manager to be trained as first 

responders in preventing emergencies from escalating 

into a major disaster at the properties. In addition, tenants 

are provided regular updates via circulars and emails on 

workplace hazard risks, safety plans and procedures. 

Information regarding safety procedures and house rules 

are provided to tenants via the Tenant Handbook, which 

contains a detailed guide on instructions and rules for 

fitout works at their premises.

Regular site inspections, as well as internal and external 

safety audits, are conducted annually on a rotational 

basis to assess the effectiveness of safety standards 

and procedures. The audits identify any building integrity 

issues, maintenance and potential safety lapses. Findings 

from the audits are followed up diligently by the Property 

Manager. In addition, during the acquisition process, the 

Manager appoints qualified professional consultants to 

determine the health and safety characteristics of the 

prospective property. The consultants perform checks on 

the building’s architectural plans, mechanical and electrical 

systems, fire compliance and structural integrity tests to 

uncover any potential health and safety issues.

SECURITY OF INFORMATION

APPROACH

The ever-changing IT landscape and emerging cyber 

threats pose risks and vulnerabilities to stakeholders’ 

confidential data and information. Any breakdown in IT 

controls can cause data breaches and result in significant 

legal and reputational costs to the organisation. The 

Manager has established IT controls and processes to 

safeguard the confidential information of stakeholders, 

to comply with the Personal Data Protection Act in 

Singapore.

Various IT controls are established to prevent, detect 

and respond to threats concerning data security and 

confidentiality at Cache’s properties. These controls 

include firewalls, server encryption and restricted access 

rights. In addition, the ARA Group has established an IT 

Disaster Recovery Plan (“IT DRP”) that serves to minimise 

the Manager’s operational downtime and data loss, 

while ensuring a level of stability and orderly recovery.  

Briefings are held on a periodic basis to familiarise 

employees with the IT DRP procedures. Regular IT 

DRP exercises are carried out to simulate a disaster 

scenario where participants are relocated to an offsite  

centre with ready access to IT systems and restored 

backup database.

EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING 

APPROACH

Fair employment practice is an important aspect of 

attracting and retaining employees. The Manager firmly 

abides by all applicable employment laws and regulations, 

such as the Employment Act and the Central Provident 

Fund Act and has signed a pledge with the Tripartite 

Alliance for Fair &amp; Progressive Employment Practices 

(“TAFEP”). In addition, the Manager embraces diversity 

by hiring talent from different backgrounds and provides 

equitable opportunities to its employees. All employees 

are provided with the Employee Handbook which details 

its human resource policies, employment terms, benefits 

and entitlements.

The Manager’s employees, regardless of position, age 

and gender, are entitled to benefits such as health care, 

disability and invalidity insurance coverage, compassionate 

leave, marriage leave, retirement provision and parental 

leave. Employees are also engaged in various activities 

ranging from social events (e.g. Chinese New Year, 

Night at the Races and Family Day), sports and fitness 

programmes (e.g. health screening, yoga and Zumba) to 

other enrichment activities (e.g. corporate training and 

stress relief lunch talks).

Staff Engagement and Wellness Survey 2018

Prior to shifting to the new headquarters’ office in 2018, ARA Group conducted a Staff Engagement and Wellness 

Survey to better understand employees’ overall job satisfaction levels and gather innovative ideas to improve 

the ergonomics of the workplace. Overall, 63 responses were received and approximately 40% indicated their 

preference for a flexi-work hours arrangement and team building initiatives emerged as the most popular category. 

ARA Group has considered all feedback received and in response, introduced flexible working arrangements in 

October 2018 and organised a sports day for employees and their families to promote productivity, wellness 

and a collaborative culture. The new headquarters has also incorporated suggestions provided by employees to 

enhance the work environment for the employees.

TALENT DEVELOPMENT

APPROACH

In support of talent development and succession planning, 

the Manager has adopted ARA’s Performance and Career 

Development Policy. The policy details a well-structured 

employment category and grading system which provides 

career progression, job rotations and training. 

Adopting an Open Appraisal System, the CEO and Head 

of Departments (“HODs”) meet up with employees face-

to-face to discuss their individual performance, areas of 

responsibilities and areas for improvement. A mid-year 

review session is conducted to provide feedback and 

guidance to employees. In addition, high performers are 

identified and groomed for potential leadership positions.

The Manager believes in investing in learning and 

development initiatives to build a competent team that 

will drive the long-term success of Cache. The ARA 

Group’s HR department works closely with the CEO and 

HODs to identify the learning needs of employees based 

on the individual’s performance appraisal and the ARA 

Competency Framework of Self Mastery, People Skills, 

Strategic Alignment and Business Alignment.

The ARA Group HR department supports the Manager 

with suitable training programmes where employees are 

kept updated on their individual training needs and the 

relevant courses to attend. A bi-annual training newsletter 

is also circulated to all staff to keep them informed of the 

latest training trends and developments.

In FY2018, the Manager surpassed its target with an 

average of 45 hours per employee (2017: 46 hours). The 

average hours remained relatively consistent between

ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CARBON FOOTPRINT

The Manager is committed to identifying and responding 

to climate change risks and environmental impacts to its 

portfolio. The Manager aligns itself with the ARA Group’s 

Climate Change Adaptation Policy which establishes the 

three overarching principles of Compliance, Conservation 

and Communication. In this report, the environmental 

data on electricity is presented with narratives on the 

consumption trends and fluctuations. The Manager 

continues to adhere to ARA Group’s Climate Change 

Adaptation Policy, which outlines three principles as 

shown in Figure 20.

Figure 20: ARA Group’s Climate Adaptation Policy

APPROACH

The Manager recognises the impact that its business 

has on the environment and that it has a role to play 

in conserving the environment. The Manager seeks to 

improve the energy efficiency in the properties to reduce 

its carbon footprint and utilities costs. While the Manager 

and Property Manager do not have operational control 

over tenants’ electricity consumption, efforts have been 

directed towards raising environmental awareness and 

educating the tenants about eco-friendly practices. 

Some of these practices are detailed below in Figure 21. 

In addition, the Manager encourages its employees to 

adopt green practices on a day-to-day basis to foster the 

culture of environmental conservation. Some examples 

include providing recycling bins, reminders to staff to turn 

off all electrical devices when not in use and double-sided 

printing of documents to reduce paper usage.

In addition to its commitment to comply with all relevant environmental standards, the Manager has formulated a long-

term target for our carbon emission intensity as aforementioned. As part of its strategy to achieve this target, Cache 

signed a solar power agreement with Sembcorp Industries (“Sembcorp”) for a rooftop solar power project which was 

announced on 2 January 2019. 

GOAL

To reduce carbon emission intensity by 3% for multi-tenanted buildings in Singapore and

increase annual green energy consumption to at least 1.5 million kWh by FY20231

TARGET BY FY2023

Notes:

Average annual consumption of a four-room HDB household is based on EMA’s 2018 Singapore Energy Statistics. 

3 

CO2 emissions avoided is calculated based on EMA’s latest grid emission factor.

Cache has signed a solar power agreement with Sembcorp, a global integrated energy player and solar power 

company, for the installation and operation of rooftop solar farms at three of Cache’s logistics warehouses in 

Singapore. 

Under the arrangement, Sembcorp will install, own and operate over 20,000 rooftop solar panels with a combined 

capacity of approximately 7.9 MW peak, atop CWT Commodity Hub , Pandan Logistics Hub and Cache Changi 

Districentre 1 in FY2019. These solar panels will provide renewable energy and significantly lower the 

carbon footprint of Cache. Upon completion, CWT Commodity Hub will house Singapore’s largest rooftop solar 

facility to date, with approximately 6.2 MW in peak capacity. 

The solar panels are expected to be fully installed in mid-2019. When completed, the system is expected to 

produce over 9,400 MWh of power annually, or enough renewable energy to power more than 2,000 four-

room HDB flats in a single year2. The project is a green model which significantly reduces C02 emissions. It will 

also help avoid close to four million kilogrammes of CO2 emissions a year3. The emissions avoided is equivalent to 

almost 860 cars removed from the road or the planting of more than 47,000 trees.

CONSERVING THE ENVIRONMENT

In FY2018, the Manager has complied with the relevant 

environmental standards. While the FY2017 Sustainability 

Report only covered common area consumption, the 

environmental scope for FY2018’s Sustainability Report 

has been expanded to include the reported consumption 

of an entire building, including tenants’ leased area. 

In the reporting period from 1 January 2018 to 31 

December 2018, Cache’s total energy consumption and 

energy intensity was 47.3 GWh and 10.9 kWh/sq. ft1. 

respectively.  Other than the six properties indicated in 

the Reporting Scope section, the environmental data 

of Hi-Speed Logistics Centre was also included up to 

its divestment in May 2018.  For CWT Commodity Hub, 

only data from April 2018 was considered following the 

conversion of the building from the previous master lease 

to a multi-tenancy lease structure.

Notes:

Includes the consumption of Hi-Speed Logistics Centre (divested in May 2018) from January to May 2018 and consumption of CWT Commodity Hub (converted to 

multi-tenancy in April 2018) from April to December 2018.

2 

While the energy intensity remained constant between FY2016 and FY2017, the GHG emission intensity in FY2017 decreased due to lower grid emission factor.

Chain ARC, Cache Cold Centre, Cache Districentre 1, 

Cache Districentre 2 and Pandan Logistics Hub. The total 

energy consumption decreased by 3% from 35.8 GWh 

to 34.7 GWh, while the total energy intensity decreased 

by 5% from 17.8 kWh/sq. ft. to 17.0 kWh/sq. ft.. This was 

mainly due to higher energy consumption by tenants in 

FY2017, arising from the conversion of an ambience space 

to one that is temperature controlled at DHL Supply Chain 

ARC and Pandan Logistics Hub as well as higher operating 

activity at Cache Cold Centre.

The Manager has considered water and waste 

management as potential sustainability matters during 

the materiality assessment. However, due to the nature 

of logistics properties and the limited use of water 

by the vast majority of tenants in the portfolio, the 

Manager believes that there is currently no significant 

environmental 

impact 

from 

water 

and 

waste 

management.  Nevertheless, the Manager will continue to 

monitor these aspects and amend future reporting as/

when deemed necessary.

Cache Logistics Trust  Sustainability Report 2018

29

This section explains the key definitions and methodologies 

applied 

for 

Cache 

Logistic 

Trust’s 

sustainability 

report. These are adapted in the context of the GRI 

Standards Glossary and the Reporting Requirements, 

METHODOLOGICAL 

REVIEW

Recommendations and Guidance set out in the respective 

disclosures and various authoritative intergovernmental 

instruments.

SOCIAL

Employee

Employees are defined as individuals who are in an 

employment relationship with the Manager. 

New hires and turnover

Employee movement within each financial year is 

recorded and presented as at year-end headcount.

New hires are defined as new employees that have 

joined the Manager during the year.

Turnover is defined as all employees that have left the 

Manager voluntarily, or due to dismissal, retirement or 

death in service during the year.

Training hours

Average training hours per employee is the total 

number of training hours provided to employees, 

relative to the total number of employees, during  

the year.

Average training hours per female/(male) employee is 

the total number of training hours provided to female/

(male) employees, relative to the total number of 

female/(male) employees, during the year.

Average training hours per employee category is 

the total number of training hours provided to each 

category of employees, relative to the total number of 

employees in the category, during the year.

Absentee days and absentee rate

Absentee days are measured in terms of the number 

of business days. An absentee day occurs when 

the employee is absent from work because of any 

incapacity, not just as a result of work-related injury 

or disease. It excludes permitted leave absences such 

as holidays, study, parental and compassionate leave.

Absentee rate is the total absentee days lost, relative 

to the number of total days scheduled to be worked by 

the employees in the reporting period, expressed as a 

percentage.

ENVIRONMENT

Consolidation approach

The operational approach, as outlined in the GHG 

Protocol Corporate Standard, is used to determine 

organisational boundaries for Cache Logistic Trust’s 

environmental reporting. 

 

Energy consumption within the organisation

Purchased electricity is a significant form of energy 

that Cache Logistic Trust’s properties consumes and 

it is expressed in gigawatt hours (symbol: GWh). 

Energy intensity

The ratio of energy consumed relative to total occupied 

area (including common floor area) in square feet 

(symbol: kWh/sq. ft.).

GHG emissions

This report discloses indirect Scope 2 GHG emissions 

for Cache Logistic Trust properties.

Scope 2 GHG emissions are emissions that result 

from the generation of purchased or acquired 

electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumed by 

the organisation. In the scope of reporting, this only 

relates to purchased electricity and is expressed in 

kilotonnes of CO2. A location-based method is adopted, 

which reflects the GHG emissions of the grids on 

which energy consumption occurs. In Singapore, the 

emission factor used for GHG emissions in FY2017 and 

FY2018 is the grid emission factors for 2017 which is 

the latest estimate, obtained from “2018 Singapore 

Energy Statistics” published by the Energy Market 

Authority of Singapore in 2018, and the emission 

factor used for GHG emissions in FY2016 is the grid 

emission for 2016 in the same publication. 

GHG emissions intensity

This is the ratio of GHG emissions relative to total 

occupied area (including common floor area) in square 

feet (symbol: kgCO2/sq. ft.).
