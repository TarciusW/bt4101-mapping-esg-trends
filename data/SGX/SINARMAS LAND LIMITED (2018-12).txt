DEAR VALUED STAKEHOLDERS,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present to 

you the FY2018 Sustainability Report for Sinarmas Land Limited 

(“SML” or “the Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively 

“the Group”). Our inaugural report for FY2017 won the “Highly 

Commended” award for Asia’s Best First Time Sustainability 

Report at the Asia Sustainability Reporting Awards 2018 - 

spurring us on to build on this success, and increasing the 

scope and detail of this year’s report.

This report, which has been approved by the Board of Directors, 

presents the Group’s material sustainability issues in the three 

spheres of environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) 

concerns, our approach in managing these issues, and setting 

their performance indicators. 

MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO

COMMUNITY

APPENDIX

In 2018, we continued to see ESG concerns gaining importance 

from the perspectives of our shareholders, as well as our other 

stakeholders. Especially, investors and financial institutions who 

are increasingly demanding meaningful disclosures on non-

financial risks and how we are managed these risks to ensure 

the long-term viability of Sinarmas Land in a rapidly changing 

environment.

Recognising this need for increased transparency, stock 

exchanges across the region are also getting more involved, 

reviewing listed companies’ sustainability reports and in 

some cases, working directly with companies to improve the 

quality of reporting. We welcome continued guidance from the 

Singapore Exchange on these matters and looking forward to 

work in partnership with our stakeholders to provide them with 

the disclosures they need to make sound assessments of our 

Sustainability Reporting.

While these new reporting requirements may cause additional 

administrative overhead and the implementation of specific 

initiatives such as energy conservation measures usually 

involves upfront capital expenditures, we find that the savings 

we achieve in the long run, the increase in the value of 

our properties and the reduction of negative impact to the 

environment have more than offset the cost of these initial 

investments.

Implementing our Sustainability Vision has helped us 

unlock additional value for our shareholders, as well as the 

communities we operate in: In 2017, recognised sustainability 

leader, Unilever, chose BSD City’s Green Office Park to house 

its Indonesian head office. In 2018, we are proud to announce 

that Apple Inc., also known for its strong commitment to energy 

conservation and climate change mitigation, opened its first 

Asian developer academy in BSD City’s Green Office Park 9. 

This developer academy will train local students to develop 

applications for Apple’s iOS operating system. This is an 

important milestone for our Digital Hub project in BSD City as 

we continue to develop a digital ecosystem within our flagship 

development.

Winning these top tier corporations as tenants for our flagship 

development BSD City is a validation of our overall strategy 

that emphasises on quality and long-term sustainability. Our 

local communities shall benefit from these new and exciting, 

value-added job opportunities, supported by local academies or 

education institutions assisting them to acquire the necessary 

skills to work in growth sectors such as digital economy. 

This shall result in a virtuous cycle of greater prosperity and 

sustained economic growth for Indonesia. We are grateful to 

have the opportunity to play our part in building Indonesia’s 

future and will continue to undertake these responsibilities.

In this report, you will learn about the progress we have made 

by integrating Sustainability initiatives firmly into our corporate 

strategy and risk management. We have streamlined Sinarmas 

Land’s Sustainability Vision that was announced in 2017 as part 

of SML’s long-term Sustainable Development Program Plan 

(“SDPP”). 

In preparation for this report, we have undergone a thorough 

assessment of our initial Material Sustainability Issues 

disclosed in our inaugural Sustainability Report. We are pleased 

to share that these issues have been validated through feedback 

and engagement with our internal and external stakeholders. 

Therefore, minor adjustments to the Materiality Matrix were 

made, being three issues gaining in importance while one of 

them has been removed from the list of Material Issues. Please 

see the full matrix on page 15.

Meanwhile, we remain committed to apply high governance 

standards to our Sustainability work. In April 2018, one of our 

listed subsidiaries, PT Puradelta Lestari Tbk (“DMAS”), obtained 

the integrated management system certification ISO 9001, 

consisting of ISO 9001:2015 certification on quality management 

system, ISO 14001:2015 on environmental management system 

and OHSAS 18001: 2007 certification on health and safety 

management system.

These certifications are important milestones in the Group’s 

sustainability efforts and it is expected to increase our 

credibility and reputation among tenants and investors in 

Indonesia’s industrial sector. We are looking at expanding these 

certifications to other parts of the Group.

The same robust approach to governance and risk management 

continues to guide us in conducting our business ethically as 

we remain committed to a zero tolerance approach towards 

corruption. We are pleased to report that in FY2018 there were 

no incidents of corruption within the Group and no public legal 

cases regarding corruption were brought against the Group 

during the year. 

Sinarmas Land is a founding corporate member of the non-

profit organisation “Green Building Council Indonesia” that was 

established in 2009. The council’s principles provide important 

guidance in our ongoing development of Indonesia’s first green 

office park – the BSD Green Office Park (“GOP”) in BSD City.

In 2018, GOP continued to add awards to its existing extensive 

record, including

-

-

Winner for Conservation 

None of this would be possible without our dedicated 

employees; their occupational safety, health and well-being are 

extremely important to us. We are pleased to report that there 

were zero work-related injuries or instances of occupational 

diseases in our Asset Management, Commercial, and Retail &amp; 

Hospitality Group divisions. However, there were eight work-

related accidents involving our contractors in FY2018. All eight 

injuries were sustained while working on our development 

projects. We will continue to assess and improve our internal 

controls to reduce the occurrence of accidents, injuries and 

illnesses to our employees and contractors. 

Recognising that people are the main driver of our success, we 

treat all our employees equally, fairly, and with respect, offering 

them an equal opportunities policy on employment, banning 

discrimination based on race, national origin, religion, disability, 

gender, sexual orientation, union membership and political 

affiliation. Our efforts to provide a conducive and inclusive 

workplace for our employees’ development, well-being and 

satisfaction showed encouraging results in 2018. We recorded a 

significant reduction in our turnover rate from 18% in FY2017 to 

10% in FY2018. 

Throughout 2018, we intensified our efforts strengthening the 

third and fourth pillar, being Sustainable Communities and 

Educations Patronage, of our Sustainability Vision. Found in 

the Community section of this report, we have restructured our 

approach towards Sustainable Communities and Educations 

Patronage by focusing our Sustainability efforts on them. 

These initiatives have been categorised into five groups: 

Community Welfare Improvement, Green Initiatives for Climate 

Action, Education Leverage, Infrastructure Enhancement, and 

Community Support. 

In addition, we continue to make significant contributions to jobs 

creation and business opportunities for the local communities 

through employment and support of entrepreneurship, as well 

as infrastructure investments into public transport, schools, and 

markets. 

Last but not least, we started engaging with our stakeholders to 

assess our Sustainability initiative and the effectiveness of our 

strategy. Please see detailed results of this engagement in the 

Stakeholder Engagement Section on page 15.

We are encouraged by the trust demonstrated by all our 

stakeholders, including our customers, employees, and the 

communities we operate in. Hence, we will continue to do 

everything within our capabilities to justify their faith in us as we 

continue to implement our Sustainability Vision for the benefit of 

Indonesia, our people and our stakeholders.

APPENDIX

This report covers the period from January 1 to December 31, 

2018 (FY 2018). Going forward, we will continue to publish this 

report on an annual basis. 

Our sustainability report contains detailed information on the 

material issues that we have confronted during our business 

activities, as well as the impacts that our operation has on 

society, the environment and the communities we operate in. To 

ensure the appropriateness of our reporting processes before 

expanding the report coverage to the entire Group, we prepare 

this report by taking our flagship project BSD City as a case 

study. 

BSD City is under development pursuant to a master plan 

that we developed in consultation with Kohn Pedersen Fox 

Associates (“KPF”), a reputable architecture firm. According 

to the master plan, BSD City would comprise approximately 

80 residential estates, 7 commercial sub-town centres and 3 

central business districts.

BSD City will be developed in 3 phases. Phase 1 was already 

completed in 2008 while Phase 2 is in progress and expected 

to be completed in 2020. For Phase 3, we target to commence 

development in 2020 with an expected completion by 2035. As at 

31 December 2018, BSD City has more than 16,000 residential 

properties, 4 commercial sub-town centres which include 

commercial and industrial facilities, schools, hospitals, parks 

and utilities, with a total population size exceeding 160,000.

In addition to property development, BSDE provides facility 

services, such as water treatment and estate management 

services, and operates several investment properties in BSD 

City, including ITC BSD, Ocean Park Water Theme Park and 

Green Office Park, which is a low-density office park including 

11 low-density office buildings and a shopping mall sitting on 

a land area of 25 hectares. BSD City is well-connected to the 

central business districts in Central Jakarta through two toll 

roads. In addition, there are three train stations in BSD City, 

providing BSD commuters direct access to Central Jakarta 

through a double-track railway service.

As at 31 December 2018, the Group had approximately 2,176 

hectares of land bank remaining in BSD City and it is estimated 

that this land bank is sufficient for the planned development of 

Phase 3.

In line with our sustainability reporting roadmap, we have 

expanded the scope of this year’s report to include the following 

projects:

- 

Offices: four non-green office buildings

- 

Apartments: two apartment blocks 

- 

Other developments: one trade center, two malls, six business 

lofts, and six construction sites

Please refer to page 20 for the detailed list of newly added 

developments.

All of the newly added properties and sites are located in BSD 

City. We are planning to expand the coverage of our reporting 

beyond our flagship development project next year and with 

an aim of extending the scope to include all the Indonesia 

operations’ properties under the Group by 2021. 

We have been working with a group of professional sustainability 

experts to implement a systematic reporting procedure in 

compliance with the reporting principles, placing emphases 

on the materiality assessment, stakeholder inclusiveness, 

completeness (within the scope of BSD City), and balanced 

reporting. For further details on our materiality assessment, 

please refer to the section of Materiality on page 14.

Using established and recognised sustainability leaders among 

our peers as yardstick, we chose the GRI reporting framework 

to ensure accuracy, reliability, clarity, and comparability of the 

information presented in this report.

We are not going to seek external assurance for this report, 

but have made plans to do so in the future. For now, our main 

focus is expanding the scope of our reporting and continuing to 

integrate sustainability into the organisation.

ABOUT THE REPORT

This is our second sustainability 

report. In line with our 

commitments made last year, we 

are expanding the scope of our 

reporting - both in terms of our 

data disclosure and the breadth 

of operations covered by this

report.

IN THIS SECTION

On the following pages, we will introduce Sinarmas Land’s 

sustainability vision and explain our sustainability related 

governance structures and risk management procedures. In 

addition, we will further elaborate on the methodology used to 

identify our material issues and how we go about engaging our 

stakeholders on them.

Our activities are guided by internationally recognised 

frameworks (such as the GRI reporting standards) and 

institutions, such as the United Nations Global Compact 

(“UNGC”). We were an early adopter of the UN Sustainable 

Development Goals (“SDGs”) and are proud to report that in 

2018, we were the first major Indonesian real estate developer 

to become a signatory to the UNGC through the Indonesia 

Global Compact Network (“IGCN”).

SINARMAS LAND’S SUSTAINABILITY VISION

BSDE is one of the largest property development companies in 

Indonesia based on a market capitalisation of IDR24.2 trillion 

(S$2.3 billion) as of 31 December 2018. Our flagship project 

BSD City, the chosen focus of this sustainability report, is the 

largest privately developed township and the most ambitious 

urban planning development in Indonesia. Spanning a land area 

of 5,950 hectares or approximately 57% the size of Paris, the 

development of BSD City’s residential, business and commercial 

properties, as well as supporting amenities and infrastructure is 

expected to be carried out in three phases by 2035.

Apart from being a major contributor to our Group’s revenue, 

BSD City is also the perfect embodiment of our Sustainability

GOVERNANCE &amp; RISK MANAGEMENT

Our sustainable development strategy is based on the definition 

of the Brundtland Commission and built to comply with both 

SGX Sustainability Reporting guidelines and GRI Standards.

The implementation of this strategy is built around Sinarmas 

Land’s strong corporate culture and our core values:

- 

Positive Attitude

- 

Integrity

- 

Commitment

- 

Continuous Improvement

- 

Innovation

- 

Loyalty

We have always taken a long-term view in creating value for our 

stakeholders. Driven by our strong corporate values, we aim 

to further integrate our economic, environmental and social 

performance through the implementation of sustainability-

oriented practices across our operating units.

With a better understanding of our material sustainability issues 

and how they could potentially influence our business over time, 

we have implemented several sustainability initiatives as part 

of the Group’s overall governance and operation, guided by an 

in-depth involvement from the company’s leadership:

Our sustainability structure comprises of senior management, 

middle management and employees from various functions. Our 

Executive Risk Management Committee (“ERMC”) comprises 

of 15 senior leaders of different strategic business units and 

support functions. Each Person-in-Charge (“PIC”) is supported 

by several process owners for the selected sustainability topics 

and programs.

By integrating sustainability initiatives into our existing risk 

management structure, we can ensure that the Board is 

always kept abreast of our material sustainability issues, 

and the Group’s progress on the follow-up or mitigation 

actions taken. As part of our preparations for this report, 

we have mapped the most significant material issues to our 

Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”), with the exception of 

certain environmental topics, such as risks relating to waste 

management and the materials used in our construction 

activities. These omitted topics will be mapped out progressively 

in later years as we continue to integrate various sustainability 

initiatives into our operations.

We placed strong emphasis on complying with the regulatory 

frameworks set up on the national and regional level. These 

include regulations on land acquisition, operational permits, 

design and construction, finance and accounting, labour laws, 

customer protection, and environmental frameworks. We have 

a zero tolerance approach towards corruption throughout 

Sinarmas Land’s organisation.

We are pleased to report that there were no incidents of 

corruption in FY2018. In addition, no public legal cases 

regarding corruption were brought against the Group, or its 

subsidiaries, and no contracts with business partners had to be 

terminated due to violations related to corruption.

APPENDIX

Through the engagement of external consultants, we are 

training our employees to be more aware of fraud related risk 

management, how to address issues relating to corruption (e.g. 

conflicts of interest, bribery, illegal gratuities, extortion), asset 

misappropriation (e.g. cash, inventory and other assets), and 

accounting fraud (e.g. asset or revenue over/understatement). 

In December 2018, we conducted Fraud &amp; Anti-Corruption 

seminars for selected department heads and look to extend 

these seminars to all staff in management positions.

When we identify shortcomings in current regulations, 

such as in waste management, we proactively engage the 

relevant authorities and collaboratively develop solutions and 

frameworks to ensure the well-being of the communities we 

operate in.

Our employees have received clear guidance on the standards of 

ethical behaviour required of them through our Code of Conduct 

policy, supplemented by our whistle-blowing policy that serves 

as an effective oversight measure for the prevention of fraud, 

corruption and other types of misconduct. Also, we have policies 

in place that cover procurement activities and fair employment 

practices. In the meantime, we are working to strengthen our 

governance framework to explicitly address environment, health 

and safety issues. Going forward, we will make details of these 

policies known to the public. 

All newly hired staff is taught Sinarmas Land’s core values

and the policies listed above in mandatory orientation training

courses which include New Hires Introduction &amp; SML Shared 

Values.

In addition, we continue to build on our policy for procurement 

activities with the goal to eventually develop it into a mandatory 

Supplier Code of Conduct. We are adopting a phased approach, 

focusing our initiatives on key suppliers and vendors of our 

value chain. In 2019, we will be applying new environmental 

requirements on suppliers or vendors of key products and 

services. These requirements include:

• ISO 14001 certification for suppliers of our construction and 

building materials such as cement, steel, aluminium, glass, 

gypsum, indoor paint, tiles, and sanitary materials;

• Legal certification for our wood suppliers, as required by the 

Indonesian Ministry of Forestry; 

• A minimum percentage of recycled content in materials 

supplied by our steel and cement/concrete suppliers.

Responsible marketing is another important aspect of our 

work to ensure compliance with all relevant regulations. We 

have worked hard over the last 46 years to build a reputation 

as a reliable partner to a multitude of stakeholders, including 

the government, customers and communities we operate in. A 

critical part of preserving our standing with these stakeholders 

is to market our developments appropriately and accurately. 

We are pleased to report that in 2018, there were zero incidents 

of non-compliance concerning marketing communications and 

product information. Of equal importance is our compliance 

with all relevant laws and regulations in the social and 

economic areas. During the reporting period, no significant fines 

or non-monetary sanctions were imposed on Sinarmas Land.

In line with our stated goals in Sinarmas Land’s FY2017 

sustainability report, we are pleased to report the following:

- 

Sustainability initiatives have been fully integrated into 

our governance structure, including the Board’s active 

involvement through the Risk Committee, Audit Committee 

and other ad-hoc meetings;

- 

Other than the minor exceedances in the Biochemical 

Oxygen Demand (“BOD”) of our effluents which did not 

result in any penalisation or fines by the government, there 

were no other incidents of non-compliance with any relevant 

environmental and social regulatory frameworks;

- 

We have started to expand the scope of our sustainability 

reporting to include other Sinarmas Land projects (please 

refer to page 9 in section ‘About this Report’);

- 

Most sustainability metrics have been successfully 

integrated into our ERM system. We are planning to add the 

remaining metrics in FY2019.

MATERIALITY

With the support of all relevant internal stakeholders, we 

undertook a review of our material sustainability issues in 

FY2018 and updated the materiality assessment matrix. The 

updated matrix has been approved by the respective PICs 

and the Executive Risk Committee. The only change to the 

materiality assessment matrix, comparing to FY2017, was to 

exclude GRI 417-2: Incidents of non-compliance concerning 

product and service information and labeling. 

The review of our materiality was based on our peers’ 

reported sustainability initiatives, the GRI Standards as well as 

international best practices.

We identified the following categories of material issues which 

are addressed in this sustainability report:

- 

Economic Performance

- 

Market Presence

- 

Materials

- 

Energy

- 

Water

- 

Emissions

The process of defining and reviewing our material issues is 

largely based on GRI’s Principles for Defining Report Content, 

guided by their four-step approach, which involves identification, 

prioritisation, validation and review. 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Sinarmas Land constantly engages a broad range of 

stakeholders, including customers, national and local 

governments, local communities, non-governmental 

organisations (NGOs), interest groups and industry associations, 

shareholders, investors, and analysts through various avenues. 

Our management carefully considers the occasionally diverging 

interests of these diverse groups and integrates them into our 

business strategy.

Throughout the reporting period, we have engaged external 

stakeholders through our regular channels, such as annual 

surveys, shareholder meetings, quarterly financial analyst 

meetings, customer satisfaction surveys, engagement of local 

communities through education and healthcare initiatives, 

and our work with various government entities on joint public 

infrastructure projects (e.g. toll roads or public transport).

In 2019, we will be conducting Focus Group Discussions (“FGD”) 

on our sustainability strategy and other engagement initiatives 

with selected stakeholders.

Examples of stakeholder engagement initiatives are: 

• Survey on Sinarmas Land’s material sustainability issues;

• Annual Tenant Satisfaction Survey for our office and Mall 

buildings;

• Annual employee satisfaction survey;

• Visitor satisfaction survey for Waterparks;

• Annual survey for tracking corporate brand awareness, 

performed by Kantar TNS Indonesia;

• Annual customer satisfaction survey, performed by SQCI, to 

understand their perception of Sinarmas Land, especially 

compared to competitors for residential and commercial 

projects;

• Local community and government sponsored CSR programs.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ON OUR MATERIALITY 

AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING

In 2018, we have conducted two surveys to engage key 

external stakeholders on our material sustainability 

issues and Sinarmas Land’s inaugural Sustainability 

Report.

In the first survey, we inquired our office building and 

mall tenants to rank the importance of various key 

aspects of our material issues. (For details, please see 

chart below.) Main insights from this survey were:

 

- 

Awareness of environmental topics among our office   

 

and mall tenants is still low

 

- 

Occupational Health &amp; Safety is considered to be the   

 

most important concern for both office building and   

 

mall tenants

Higher values indicate that respondents assigned greater 

importance to the respective topic. 19 mall and 27 office 

tenants respectively participated in the survey.

Key topics raised by both our internal and external stakeholders 

during the reporting period:

The second survey inquired residential and commercial 

customers for their views on various sustainability 

related aspects of our properties. Key take-away from 

this survey included:

 

- 

Awareness of environmental topics among our  

 

 

residential and commercial customers is still low

 

- 

Main sustainability related concerns are those that  

 

have  a direct impact on them, such as air quality  

 

and circulation systems or waste management. 

Higher values indicate that respondents assigned greater 

importance to the respective topic. 50 residential and 

commercial customers participated in the survey.

We have mapped the various GRI disclosures from our identified 

material issues against our stakeholders (please see table on 

page 18 for details) and shall continue to use this map as the 

basis of our stakeholder engagement exercises.

In the meantime, we strongly encourage all readers of this 

report to send us their feedback on the results of our materiality 

assessment and any other concerns they may have with regard 

to Sinarmas Land’s sustainability efforts.

IN THIS SECTION

This section of the report looks at the various ways in which 

our operations impact the environment and lays out our 

commitment to minimise these impacts. Covered in this section 

are:

- 

Our efforts to improve energy efficiency, reduce the 

greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions associated with our 

developments and support the Indonesian government’s 

commitment to the Paris Agreement;

- 

Main materials used at our construction sites;

- 

Our water usage along with data on our effluents and 

discharges generated;

- 

Statistics on hazardous waste created and how we handled 

it.

In 2018, we have set reduction targets for three of our material 

environmental topics. The scope of these targets covers our 

Green Buildings. Our implementation of these targets begins in 

2019. Please refer to table below for more details:

While we continue to improve visibility for some of the metrics 

required to properly monitor our performance across all the 

major aspects of environmental impacts, we are pleased to 

report that significant progress has been made in 2018. Based 

on our progress to date, we have identified performance 

targets for energy intensity, emissions, and water consumption 

for the next eight years. Please see details in the respective 

subsections below.

At Sinarmas Land, we understand the significant impact 

of climate change and strive to protect the surrounding 

environment through policies and existing programs. We are 

a founding corporate member of the non-profit organisation 

“Green Building Council Indonesia” since its establishment in 

2009. Our key role in the council is to ensure that our property 

development activities are sustainable and environment friendly.

To realise our commitment in implementing developments with 

an environmental cause, BSD Green Office Park, Indonesia’s 

first green office park, was developed in BSD City with an area 

of 25 hectares. BSD Green Office Park will feature 11 five-storey 

buildings and a park-like ambience for its tenants. BSD Green 

Office Park has complied with international green standards for 

incorporating advanced green architectures to conserve energy, 

water and natural resources. All its buildings maximise sunlight 

penetration while reducing solar heat, thus boosting energy 

efficiencies and optimising air circulation. For its eco-friendly 

practices, BSD Green Office Park has received the Green Mark 

Gold Award from Singapore’s BCA.

The Breeze BSD City, a lifestyle retail mall offers a 

comprehensive array of stores, generous garden-like 

walkways and alfresco dining options to complement the 

surrounding BSD Green Office Park, schools and residences. 

Named as “The mall with no walls”, The Breeze BSD City 

reduces air-conditioning and lighting energy consumption 

through the use of natural lighting and outdoor common 

walkways.

In total, the Group currently has 7 buildings within its 

development with Green Building Certification, three of which 

are part of the Green Office Park. Going forward, we are looking 

to increase the quantity of green buildings in our developments. 

We have also embarked on a sustainability program with 

specific responsibilities assigned to staff across all parts of 

the organisation. As part of this program, we will be able to 

better calculate and eventually increase the percentage of 

recycled input materials, reduce the energy required in the 

construction and operation of our developments, lower our 

water consumption and carbon emissions, as well as improve 

our waste management. 

The establishment of 

Indonesia’s first green office 

park within our flagship 

development, BSD City, is a 

clear sign of our dedication 

to environmental protection. 

In this year’s report, we are 

expanding the scope of our 

environmental performance 

disclosures to include other 

non-green developments, laying 

the foundation for further 

performance improvements 

across all parts of our 

organisation.

included in the scope of our environment section. In this report, 

we have expanded the scope to include the following buildings 

and projects within our flagship development BSD City 

• Four office buildings, 

• Two residential apartment buildings,

• Two retail malls, 

• Six business lofts,

• One trade center (ITC BSD), and

• Six development projects.

We will continue to expand our reporting scope to include 

the other Group operations in our monitoring and reporting 

processes over the next few years.

MATERIALS

As one of Indonesia’s leading real estate developers, we 

recognised that all of our developments, which include 

buildings, supporting amenities and infrastructures have 

significant impact on the environment. In 2018, concrete, sand, 

and marble tiles are three of the most consumed materials 

used by us. These three materials are also among the largest 

contributors to our environmental footprint as they are non-

renewable.

Note: No data on granite, sand, and marble tiles is available for 

periods prior to FY2018.

Please note that the above chart represents total annual 

amounts of materials used in 2017 and 2018. At present, we do 

not have data on our usage of recycled materials (other than 

about 3% of fly ash being used in the production of concrete). 

As we gradually build our internal monitoring capacity, other 

consumable materials and their respective consumed quantities 

will be included in our internal watch-list and be subsequently 

reported, promoting transparency as well as placing greater 

emphasis on our usage of recycled materials. To facilitate 

greater transparency and accountability in our supply chain, we 

will enforce ISO 14001 certification for material vendors and a 

legality certificate for processed wood vendors in 2019.

ENERGY 

Our developments consume significant amounts of energy. In 

the region where BSD City is located, energy is predominantly 

generated from the burning of fossil fuels that contribute 

significantly to our greenhouse gas emissions. Adhering to 

internationally recognised green building standards, such as the 

Singapore BCA Green Mark standard, we are able to direct our 

effort towards achieving greater energy efficiency and reducing 

energy usage throughout a project lifecycle. 

As we expand the scope of our sustainability data and report this 

year, our reported buildings energy consumption has likewise 

increased. Our buildings energy consumption and intensities by 

Gross Floor Area (“GFA”) and GFA Occupied are depicted in the 

following graph and tables.

In line with Sinarmas Land’s Sustainability Vision, the Group is 

actively encouraging occupancy in our green office buildings 

as we seek to reduce environmental footprint, mitigate climate 

change, and improve the well-being of our occupants. 

Between 2017 and 2018, the occupancy rates in our green 

office buildings increased by 12%. Due to the increase in 

our occupancy rates, the energy consumption and energy 

consumption intensity by GFA of our green buildings increased 

by 14% from 7,355,903 kWh in 2017 to 8,369,770 kWh in 

2018, and from 93.3 kWh/m² in 2017 to 106.2 kWh/m² in 2018 

respectively. This is well below the Energy Consumption Index 

or Indeks Komsumsi Energi (“IKE”) standard stipulated by 

the Governor of the Capital Region of Jakarta for green office 

buildings1.

1 

Based on the IKE by the Governor of the Capital Region of Jakarta, the bottom energy 

consumption intensity limit for green office buildings is 210 kWh/m²/year while the upper 

limit is 285 kWh/m²/year. Please refer to Indonesian regulation ‘PERGUB DKI NO 38_2012’

APPENDIX

We are pleased to report that our commitment and 

objective towards the development of green buildings 

has actualised. Despite the 12% increase in occupancy 

rates, the energy consumption intensity by GFA occupied in our 

green office buildings increased by merely 2% from 113.9 kWh/

m² in 2017 to 116.1 kWh/m² in 2018.

Apart from the development of more internationally recognised 

green standards buildings, the Group has undertaken other 

initiatives to reduce consumption of energy across our 

developments such as implementation of control timing function 

for our air-conditioning systems and the usage of energy-

efficient LED lightbulbs.

GREEN HABIT PROGRAM

The Green Habit Program was one of our main energy 

reduction initiatives for FY2018. The competition-based 

program was initiated by the President’s Office (“PO”) and 

the Asset Management Group Division. 

The objective of the program is to encourage employees 

to reduce their energy consumption in their respective 

workplaces. Some of the steps taken by our colleagues 

include minimising the usage of unnecessary lighting 

during office hours, unplugging unused electronic devices 

from charging cables, and increasing the air-conditioning 

temperature to moderate and high levels to reduce 

energy consumption.

The competition was conducted in two of our green 

buildings, both of which house Sinarmas Land corporate 

offices. The energy savings resulting from this program 

during a 6-month period averages at 20% with the 

highest and the lowest energy savings at 34% and 7% 

respectively. These savings came from the reduction 

of electricity used from our lights and sockets. We are 

considering to expand this initiative to involve our tenants 

and other buildings within BSD City.

For our green buildings in BSD City, we target to achieve a 

further total overall energy intensity reduction of 5% for the 

next 8 years with 2017 as the base year. These reductions 

will be achieved mainly through the implementation of our 

abovementioned Green Habit Program. 

EMISSIONS

In line with our reported information on energy consumption 

and intensities, GHG emissions from the buildings included 

in this report have increased due to the expanded scope of 

reporting. Our buildings’ GHG emissions and intensities by 

GFA and GFA Occupied are depicted in the following graph and

Between 2017 and 2018, we recorded a 13% increase in GHG 

emissions from our green office buildings due to a 12% increase 

in occupancy rates. Hence, the GHG emissions intensity by 

GFA of our green buildings also increased by 13% from 0.0673 

tonnes of CO2e/m² in 2017 to 0.0758 tonnes of CO2e/m² in 2018.

In line with our energy consumption intensity data, we 

are pleased to report that our commitment towards 

the development of green buildings has succeeded 

in decoupling growth from GHG emissions. Despite the 12% 

increase in occupancy rates, the GHG emissions intensity by 

GFA occupied in our green office buildings increased by only 1% 

from 0.0821 tonnes of CO2e/m² in 2017 to 0.0829 tonnes of CO2e/

m² in 2018. 

Our emissions monitoring has yet to include indirect emissions 

from the manufacturing of concrete, production of steel, and 

transportation of raw materials. We are currently focusing 

our efforts on increasing the asset scope of our sustainability 

reporting and will not be including indirect emissions (Scope 3) 

of our GHG emissions reporting in the near future.  

The air-conditioning systems installed in all of our new 

buildings in BSD City use refrigerants that do not produce any 

Ozone Depleting Substances (“ODS”). Hence, we are pleased to 

report that none of our buildings produce any ODS.

For our green buildings in BSD City, we target to further achieve 

a total overall emission reduction of 5% over the next 8 years 

with 2017 as the base year. These reductions will be achieved 

mainly through the implementation of our Green Habit Program. 

Lastly, we are pleased to report that we completed the 

upgrading work at Cisauk Train Station in 2018. The renovated 

station can accommodate a larger number of users and 

encourage higher train ridership in and out of BSD City. Train 

transportation is a lower carbon alternative to other modes of 

transportation.

WATER

BSD City has a significant water footprint. Thus, there is a need 

for us to monitor our impact carefully in order to avoid and 

mitigate harmful effects from excessive water consumption, and 

the discharge of effluents into natural water systems.

Our buildings’ main water consumption source is the municipal 

water supply. In 2018, we started to use collected rainwater2 

in one of our green office buildings, MyRepublic Plaza. The 

collected rainwater is mixed with water collected for recycling 

and is used for gardening activities and flushing of toilets. 

Through the usage of collected rainwater, we aim to reduce our 

municipal water footprint, which is critical in water-stressed 

Jakarta.

We also have systems in place to reuse and recycle used water 

which is collected from sinks, ablution taps, showers, and air-

conditioning systems. In 2018, we recorded 23,438m³ of reused 

water or 4% of our total water usage.

Meanwhile, our consumption of surface water is subjected to 

strict environmental impact assessments, and it has been found 

there are no adverse effects on our stakeholders or on local and 

downstream biodiversity.

Due to our strict on-site water efficiency initiatives, we are 

pleased to report an improvement in our water consumption 

efficiency. Our data on municipal water consumption and 

intensities compared against our occupancy rates shows a 

decoupling of growth from resource use. Despite the 12% 

increase in occupancy rates of our green office buildings, we 

managed to reduce the municipal water consumption and 

municipal water consumption intensity by GFA of our green 

buildings by 3% from 87,391 m³ in 2017 to 84,885 m³ in 2018, 

and 1.11 m³/m² in 2017 to 1.08 m³/m² in 2018 respectively. We 

successfully reduced the municipal water consumption intensity 

by GFA occupied of our green office buildings by 13% from 1.35 

m³/m² in 2017 to 1.18 m³/m² in 2018.

Rainwater reported here is not recorded by actual volume captured. These figures are 

instead based on the GREENSHIP Rating issued by Green Building Council (GBC) Indonesia. 

The calculation uses average rainfall multiplied by wet days in one year (derived from data 

provided by the meteorological agency), divided by the total catchment area across all three 

buildings.

For our green buildings in BSD City, we target to achieve a 

further reduction of 10% in our municipal water consumption 

intensity by GFA by 2026 with 2017 as the base year. These 

reductions will be achieved by utilising rainwater and water 

recycling facilities on every green building to complement 

water consumption from public utilities. We are currently in the 

process of installing the required infrastructure to measure the 

actual use of rainwater and recycled water. 

EFFLUENTS AND WASTE

Most of BSD City’s water discharge is channelled into our 

Water Treatment Plant (“WTP”) where it is being treated 

and redistributed to our customers. A very small portion of 

our effluents are discharged into the surrounding Cisadene 

River, which was found to not be significantly affected by the 

discharge. We target to comply with all relevant government 

regulations on waste and water discharged. Please find the 

following statistics on water discharge by destination from our 

buildings in scope. As all these buildings are located within the 

same area, we are not required to maintain individual records 

for each building’s water discharge. Therefore, we have on-

site meters to measure water discharge in only three of our 

buildings in scope, namely MyRepublic Plaza, Wisma BCA and 

our retail mall Q-BIG. 

As such, the data provided in the table below is based on the 

assumption that volume of water discharge from a building is 

approximately 80% of water consumption for each building. This 

methodology is aligned with international standards and the 

Indonesian government’s Ministry of Public Work and Housing. 

We have applied this methodology to determine the water 

discharge volume for the following buildings in scope: SML 

Plaza BSD, GOP 9, Marketing Office, ITC BSD, and The Breeze. 

Two of our buildings in scope are currently using septic tanks, 

hence there are no records of water discharge from the 

buildings housing the Customer Care Office and the BSD Permit 

and Township Office.3 Data from our residential apartment and 

business loft buildings are also excluded as these buildings are 

tenanted; SML only maintains control of the common area.

3 

Septic tanks are ground tanks collecting waste water from the building without going 

through the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). The system cannot segregate between solid 

waste and effluent and it is not common to install meters on these systems. Septic tanks are 

emptied periodically by authorised vendors and not channelled to the city sewage system or 

surface water.

While there were no incidences of exceeded biochemical oxygen 

demand (“BOD”) thresholds from 2015 to 2017, we regret to 

report that the BOD of our effluents exceeded the limit as 

stipulated by the Indonesian government on 12 occasions 

in 2018. The Indonesian national standard for effluents is a 

maximum of 30mg/l BOD. Our exceedances were minor and 

did not affect any local water bodies and related habitat. While 

these minor exceedances did not result in any penalisation or 

fines by the government, we take such matters matter very 

seriously. These incidents occurred due to issues relating to 

the tank capacity in three of our buildings, namely Q-Big Mall, 

ITC BSD, and Casa De Parco Apartments. This matter was 

discussed in the Enterprise Risk Management Committee 

(ERMC) meeting and has been resolved at the time of reporting.

is sent to landfill. Despite our practice, we have yet to find a 

perfect solution for the disposal of hazardous wastes, such as 

used oil from construction machinery. 

Apart from increasing the types and amounts of material that 

can be reused and recycled across our operations, we are using 

our ongoing communications with local government authorities 

to suggest improvements to the available infrastructure for 

the processing of non-hazardous waste, which is currently 

collected, managed, and sent to landfill. 

The nine tonnes of hazardous waste materials reported in our 

2017 Sustainability Report have been collected and managed 

by a certified waste management vendor. In 2018, we stored 

300kg of hazardous waste which includes old light bulbs and 

used batteries in a safe on-site facility, while we finalise the 

engagement of a certified third-party to collect these materials. 

We have created a policy which regulates that every commercial 

and hotel building shall appoint a certified waste management 

vendor to collect and manage our hazardous waste. This policy 

will be implemented in 2019.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Given the scale of BSD City development, we are subjected to 

the most stringent environmental regulatory frameworks in 

Indonesia.

As part of our environmental compliance, based on Government 

Regulation No. 27 in 2012 on Environment Control Permits, we 

are required to submit an extensive Environment Management 

and Monitoring Effort (UKL/UPL) report every six months. Within 

the report, it clearly spells out the specific limits for every 

aspect of environmental impacts (e.g. water, waste, etc.) and we 

are to ensure that our operations must not breach these limits. 

The report is submitted directly to the regional government and 

subject to government approval.

For its ongoing operational permit, SML also has to comply 

with several health, safety and environment (“HSE”) regulations 

such as liquid waste management, fire safety certification, and 

equipment licenses. The related authorities will perform audits 

on our operational feasibility and issue permit certificates only 

upon compliance with these requirements.

Other than the minor exceedances in BOD of our effluents which 

did not result in any penalisation or fines by the government, 

we are pleased to report that there were no incidents of 

environmental non-compliance during the reporting period.

100% of our employees work full-time. Of those full-

time employees, 25% are hired on a fixed contract 

term/temporary basis, with the gender breakdown 

of permanent and fixed contract term/temporary 

employees in the charts below. Fixed contracts typically 

have a term of one year. 

Our commitment to our employees’ well-being is demonstrated 

through our human resource (“HR”) policies and initiatives 

which are driven by our Human Capital team. The team 

explores and drives initiatives which are geared towards 

building a conducive and inclusive workplace for our employees’ 

development, well-being and satisfaction. 

IN THIS SECTION

Here, we will be looking at our overall employment statistics 

for the Group’s Indonesian operations (excluding any Joint 

Ventures), our performance as an equal opportunity employer, 

benefits and welfare programs, and our investment in training 

and development as well as employee engagement.

EMPLOYMENT

Our Employees

As at 31 December 2018, SML has employed a total of 3,860 

(2017: 3,870) employees, of which 2,680 are male (69%) and 

1,180 are female (31%). The high ratio of male to female 

employees is mainly due to the nature of our business (real 

estate development and construction) and the supply of 

manpower available to us. Being an equal opportunity employer, 

we are witnessing a better balanced gender composition of our 

workforce in middle management and above.

PEOPLE 

By focusing on our employees’ 

well-being and personal growth, 

we strive to be an Indonesian 

employer of choice. We seek 

to hire the best and provide 

them with ample opportunities 

to nurture their talents and 

enhance their skills. Our 

workforce turnover figures are 

testament to our commitment 

towards our valued employees.

Diversity and Equal Opportunity

Our commitment to fair labour practices is emphasised in our 

employee handbook and employment practices. We have an 

equal opportunities policy on employment, banning any form 

of discrimination based on race, nationality, origin, religion, 

disability, gender, sexual orientation, union membership and 

political affiliation. We believe that our employees should be 

treated equally, fairly and with respect.

New Hires and Employee Retention

We recognise that welfare and career development contribute 

significantly to the satisfaction and reputation of a workplace. 

The results of our proactive engagement with employees show 

that there are no significant levels of dissatisfaction. During 

the year, we hired 359 (2017: 541) new employees, which is 

equal to a new hire rate of 9% (2017: 17%) based on our total 

staff strength of 3,860. We believe that a diversified team with 

different age groups, backgrounds, and skillsets will bring 

enriching perspectives to the workplace. Our new hires vary 

from different age groups, including the re-employment of 

employees above the age of 50.

BENEFITS AND WELFARE

Beyond competitive remuneration, we care for our employees 

through welfare and benefit schemes, including but not limited 

to insurance coverage, healthcare benefits, parental leave, and 

retirement provision to all our employees. Full-time employees 

also enjoy a house ownership program, vehicle cash substitution 

facility, and severance payments.

Family-friendly Employer

SML prioritises our employees’ welfare. We support our 

employees by providing benefits and welfare for employees with 

family, including parental leave, medical benefits, subsidy of 

marriage and grievance, etc.

In 2018, 83 eligible female employees and 133 eligible male 

employees took their maternity and paternity benefits 

respectively. As at 31 December 2018, 82 of the 83 female 

employees have returned to work after their maternity leave 

ended, while one is still on maternity leave, whereas 130 of the 

133 male employees have returned to work after their paternity 

leave, while three were still on paternity leave. Based on our 

employees that have returned from their respective maternity 

and paternity leave, we recorded a return to work rate of 100%.

The tables below outline detailed information on male and 

female employees who took parental leave in 2018 as well as

Respecting Freedom of Association and

Collective Bargaining Rights

SML respects all employees’ fundamental rights to the freedom 

of association and the right to be members of trade unions. 

We are guided by the Indonesian government regulation (as 

ratified by the ILO) which allows trade unions to represent our 

employees for collective bargaining, providing our employees 

with an avenue to seek redress for disputes. A total number 

of 303 employees (100% of our eligible workforce) from the 

Le Grandeur Hotel subsidiaries (PT. Sinar Wisata Lestari &amp; 

PT. Sinar Wisata Permai) are covered by collective bargaining 

agreements. 

Above the minimum wage level

We believe in providing decent work remuneration. As such, our 

employees are remunerated based on experience, position and 

competency. We strictly comply with the minimum wage level 

set by the Government4 and ensure that all our employees are 

rightly compensated for their work. As an equal opportunity 

employer, there is no variation in minimum wages level between 

male and female employees.

4 

The Provincial Wages Council determines any increase of Provincial Minimum Wages. The 

governor then issues a decree for each province. The current wage increase is based on 

Government Regulation No. 78 for 2015 stipulating a wage increase of 8.71%.

Retirement Plans and other Defined Benefits

Sinarmas Land complies with all relevant government 

regulations in the following ways:

1. Severance pay for retired employees in accordance with UU 

Tenaga Kerja No.13/2003

In accordance with this Act, an employee is entitled to the 

following severance payment from the employer upon reaching 

her or his retirement age, based on their length of service to the 

company.

Although this is not explicitly mentioned as an employer’s 

retirement plan, this severance payment can still be considered 

as a ‘defined contribution plan’. If the employer has their own 

defined contribution program, the severance amount payable 

is equal to the difference between these regulations and the 

employer’s defined contribution program. Only permanent 

employees are eligible for these severance payments.

For every fiscal period, an independent actuary will assess the 

provision of severance payments, whose findings are disclosed 

in our annual financial report.

2. Mandatory Defined Contribution Plan 

A mandatory Defined Contribution Plan (“Jaminan Hari Tua”) by 

BPJS Ketenagakerjaan (or Employee Social Security System) is 

provided for both permanent and non-permanent employees 

below the retirement age. Normally, an additional 3.7% of an 

employee’s base salary is contributed by the employer and 2% 

is deducted from the employee’s salary. At Sinarmas Land, 

we have decided to cover both parts of this payment. As of 31 

December 2018, all employees have been registered as BPJS 

Jaminan Hari Tua participants. 

A mandatory Defined Benefit Plan (“Jaminan Pensiun”) by BPJS 

Ketenagakerjaan is also provided for both permanent and non-

permanent employees below the retirement age. Here, 2% are 

paid by the employer and 1% is deducted from the employee’s 

maximum salary limit which is detemined by the government 

on a regular basis. As of 31 December 2018, all employees have 

been registered as BPJS Jaminan Pensiun participants.

PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT

Training and Development

People are our most important asset. It is therefore imperative 

for us to explore ways to better manage our people and to 

maintain the best talent pool. We have allocated an annual 

training budget and developed in-house programs to support 

the career growth and aspirations of our employees.

Programs such as our Supervisory Development, Managerial 

Development, and Advanced Management are opportunities 

available for our employees who are interested in advancing 

their skillset or career path. In 2018, we offered an extensive 

list of training topics for our participants ranging from technical 

skills (such as Microsoft Office, Sales and Marketing or Building 

Maintenance) to non-technical skills (such as Emotional 

Intelligence or Effective Problem Solving).

We believe in equipping our employees with the skills 

they require in ensuring the future growth of our Group. 

Furthermore, developing skills and nurturing talents allows 

employees to grow, leading to better opportunities, thereby 

helping the communities where they live and work to 

flourish. We provide on-the-job training opportunities and 

support sufficiently qualified staff by paying for their relevant 

professional bodies’ membership fees, such as chartered 

engineers.

All SML employees are required to undergo at least four 

hours of training as part of their annual skills enhancement 

that is related to their job function. As of 31 December 2018, 

each employee has benefitted from an average of 8.39 hours 

of training, with a breakdown of 6.90 hours for our male 

employees, and 11.76 hours for our female employees.

Employee Engagement

Our primary engagement with our employees is at Employee 

Events held several times throughout the year. We invite 

all employees to rate their satisfaction level in our annual 

Employee Satisfaction Survey.

The other main pillar of our employee engagement is the 

semi-annual performance and career development review. 

This KPI-based formal review is an important milestone in our 

employees’ career as their performances, strengths and areas 

of improvement are evaluated transparently and objectively, 

which will then form the basis for our employees’ promotion. 

100% of our employees received regular performance and

IN THIS SECTION

Our OHS initiatives include regular assessments in the form 

of annual property hazard risk assessments by our ERM team; 

internal audits and safety checks by our Internal Audit team to 

ensure compliance by our employees and contractors; and the 

annual OHS equipment certification for compliance with the fire 

safety standards of the Indonesian Fire Department.

OUR DISCIPLINED APPROACH IN ENSURING

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

Several layers have been implemented for important OHS 

related safety checks:

1. Increased frequency of safety inspection by the project safety 

team (i.e. daily, weekly)

2. Regular technical audits performed by our corporate 

Technical Advisor 

3. Annual assessment on OHS activities’ related risk and 

control by ERM team

4. Internal Audit to perform a specific OHS-related audit as 

part of its annual audit 

In addition, we have developed and implemented OHS 

guidelines, as well as a policy for Crisis Management. Fire 

drills and emergency situation simulations are carried out 

periodically to ensure that these procedures are understood and 

implemented, ensuring a safety culture being instilled in our 

operations. Also, we conduct regular trainings and awareness 

programs on health and safety for our workforce and tenants.

We take OHS incidents very seriously. All incidents are reported 

to the Safety Department, which will be included in the Monthly 

Operation Report that is submitted to Division Heads and the 

Group Division Head (CEO). For certain categories of incidents, 

such as breakdown of equipment or near misses due to 

negligence, a thorough investigation report with accompanying 

follow-up actions will be submitted to the Division Heads.

Resulting from our continuous initiatives, we are pleased to 

report that there were no fatalities or any work-related injuries 

in all our buildings under the Asset Management, Commercial, 

and Retail &amp; Hospitality Group Divisions. 

As part of the commitment we made in last year’s sustainability 

report, we have started tracking the lost days and total man 

hours worked for both our employees and contractors by 

gender. We have also expanded the scope of our OHS data by 

including information from development projects carried out in 

BSD City. 

There were eight work-related accidents in FY2018. All eight 

were sustained by contractors working on our development 

projects. Out of the eight accidents, seven resulted in minor and 

moderate injuries which required only first aid level medical 

treatment with no lost days, while one accident involving a 

male contractor resulted in nine lost days. As a result of these 

injuries, we recorded an Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) of 1.75 

and an Accident Severity Rate (ASR) of 1.97 for our development 

projects in FY2018.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

This is one of our key concerns 

as a leading property developer: 

we spare no effort in ensuring 

occupational health and safety 

(“OHS”) for all our employees, 

contractors, and customers. 

Through various initiatives and

between buildings and green roofs on most buildings to 

reduce heat island effect.

�	 Zero run-off technology, with rainwater harvesting tanks 

on each building, natural and modern infiltration wells, and 

a large lake used for rainwater retention and irrigation. 

Currently, we are in the process of improving our rainwater 

harvesting system with the initial design discussion and

The consistent implementation of green building standards in 

our Green Office Park in BSD City has allowed us to achieve 

significant improvements in our environmental impact. 

We are pleased to report that one of our office buildings, GOP 

1, received the ‘Gold’ predicate for Design Recognition by the 

Green Building Council Indonesia in FY2018. GOP 1 is part of 

BSD Green Office Park area, which is the first office district in 

Indonesia to be certified as a ‘Gold’ Green district by Singapore’s 

BCA.

 

Encouraged by these results, we have selected several new 

office buildings to be certified with the same green standards 

and look forward to reporting on their progress in our future 

reports. 

For our other existing buildings within BSD City, we will consider 

implementing parts of these green standards guidelines, 

wherever feasible.

ENSURING CUSTOMERS’ AND THE PUBLIC’S WELL-

BEING

We take all incidents relating to our customers’ or general 

public’s well-being very seriously. All health and safety incidents 

involving members of the public such as guests, visitors, 

occupants, tenants, and customers are reported, and included 

in our Monthly Operations Report which is submitted to Division 

Heads and the Group Division Head (CEO).

As part of our HSE awareness program for tenants, we engage 

in a number of regular activities to promote safety in our 

buildings. These include HSE socialisation, the placement of 

safety signage in public spaces, corridors and food courts, and 

fire drills with tenants and visitors.

In 2018, there were 19 injuries and 76 dangerous occurrences 

or near misses involving members of the public in our buildings 

(down from 25 injuries and 97 dangerous occurrences in 

2017). Most of the reported incidents were due to human 

error involving our guests, visitors, tenants, or customers. An 

investigation is carried out after each incident, the results of 

which are reported in an incident investigation report, including 

follow-up actions undertaken. This report will be presented 

during the respective SBU’s Monthly Operations Meeting.

IN THIS SECTION

On the following pages, we provide an overview of the 

broad range of initiatives undertaken by SML that focus on 

positive community impact. Our activities to support the local 

communities fall into the following five categories:

TYPE OF PROJECT

OBJECTIVES

Community Welfare 

Improvement

To improve community welfare 

by providing work opportunities, 

enhancing skills and knowledge for 

potential talent in the community, 

and channeling local talent to 

potential employers

Green Initiatives for 

Climate Action

To engage communities in 

responding to climate action and 

creating a green environment within 

their neighbourhoods

Education Leverage

To provide communities with access 

to better education system and 

facilities

Infrastructure 

Enhancement

To improve public infrastructure 

within the community area as 

part of SML’s responsibility to the 

community

Community Support

To support activities initiated 

by surrounding communities by 

providing donations or facilities

Sinarmas Land is committed to integrate our responsibilities 

with the surrounding communities as part of our Group’s 

business strategy. By improving the socio-cultural environment 

within our operations’ communities through various initiatives, 

we aim to create significant benefits for local communities on 

the basis of common shared value and coherent understanding.

Apart from large-scale infrastructure projects, we have 

also conducted community development programs such as 

collecting donations, making contributions to the victims of 

natural disasters, promoting healthy living, and supporting the 

development of worship facilities.

In addition, we aid in the renovation of school buildings, 

extend financial assistance towards the purchase of learning 

equipment and organise a blood donation drive once every three 

months.

Sinarmas Land, through BSDE and its flagship development 

BSD City, has developed an entire township equipped with 

complete facilities and amenities such as residential units, 

business districts, commercial office buildings, shopping 

centres, and public facilities – all of which alleviate the living 

standards of the surrounding communities. Through the 

development of BSD City, SML has created jobs and work

opportunities for surrounding communities in Tangerang, 

increasing the liveability and income per capita for the region.

As the largest privately developed satellite city located at the 

fringe of Central Jakarta, BSD City has become one of the most 

desirable locations to reside. Positioned as an urban oasis 

surrounded by lush greenery and complete amenities, our city-

dwellers are conveniently connected to Jakarta via key pieces of 

public transport infrastructure.

We are constantly engaging our communities, conducting 

social impact assessments, as well as Environmental Impact 

Assessments (AMDAL) for all our projects and development 

programs in BSD City prior to commencement of development 

activities.

Our sustained commercial 

success depends on the well-

being of our local communities 

in Indonesia and our areas of 

operation. We work hard to 

improve the prosperity of our 

local stakeholders with targeted, 

strategic investments into 

infrastructure and community 

development.

COMMUNITY

MANAGING OUR IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES

As we continue to develop and enhance the vibrancy of BSD City, 

there are development activities that might inevitably pose some 

inconvenience to communities in the immediate or surrounding 

vicinity. Nonetheless, the Group shall respect the rights of 

local communities and ensure that both our contractors and 

employees adhere to the legal requirements stipulated by the 

Indonesian government. 

Every contractor appointed or engaged by Sinarmas Land must 

be rated by the regional regulator and possess a Construction 

Service Permit Letter issued by the government. This is part 

of our internal control procedures to ensure that there is no 

compromise on the quality of our developments.

In addition, we have included the following initiatives to avoid 

negative impacts during construction activities:

- Regular communication with the communities surrounding the 

development project about our construction plans; 

- Respect the needs and well-being of surrounding communities 

(e.g. noise reduction, reasonable construction hours, keeping 

the environment clean during construction);

Apart from the examples of our work undertaken for the benefit 

of local communities cited above, we are pleased to share that 

during the reporting period, none of our operations were found 

to have any significant or potentially negative impacts on local 

communities. Based on Government Regulation No. 27 (2012) 

on Environment Control Permits, prior to commencement of 

any property development project in Indonesia, every developer 

must perform an environmental impact assessment (AMDAL) 

and provide plans to avoid/mitigate the possibility of negative 

impacts, if any. The content of this assessment is extensive 

and includes physical, chemical (land, soil, space, etc.), as well 

as biological aspects (habitats and biodiversity), social factors 

(economics, safety, culture, etc.) and community health. These 

regulatory stipulated assessments ensure that developers give 

due consideration to the potential environmental impacts before 

embarking on their development. The developer is only allowed 

to commence the development once they have obtained the 

approved environmental impact assessment, amongst many 

other mandatory required approvals, from the local government.

ENVIRONMENT

1. Buildings’ environmental performance data include data 

of the whole building (common area and tenants’ data are 

included in scope), except for the Commercial buildings 

where we maintain control of the common area only. Data 

from tenants is excluded from all Commercial buildings.

2. Buildings’ energy consumption, GHG emissions, and 

respective intensities data include our use of electricity 

from the grid and diesel fuel for emergency purposes in our 

back-up generators. Our processes do not use any heating, 

cooling, or steam consumption.

3. We do not sell any electricity, heating, cooling, or steam 

energy to other organisations.

4. Gross Floor Area (GFA) for intensity figures: GFA is identified 

based on the Built Drawing Data and Tenant Relation Data 

(based on Tenant Agreement).

5. All covered floor areas of a building, except otherwise 

exempted, and uncovered areas for commercial uses, are 

deemed to be the gross floor area of the building.

6. We also report our intensity figures on a GFA occupied basis. 

GFA occupied is calculated by multiplying occupancy rate 

(simple average of monthly occupancy rates) with the GFA.

7. Building and development site details including property 

type, approximate net leasable area, project site area, and 

expected completion date are available in SML’s Annual 

Report 2018 (Property Portfolio, page 74-87).

8. Standards and methodologies used for unit conversion of 

diesel fuel are based on the Carbon Disclosure Project.

9. Greenhouse gas conversion is based on the Greenhouse Gas 

Protocol. 

10. Emission factors for electricity consumption are sourced 

from the Standard Pedoman Teknis Perhitungan Baseline 

Gas Rumah Kaca Sektor Berbasis Energi Republik 

Indonesia, Area Jamali (Jawa-Madura Bali): 0.725 kg/CO2/

kWh. 

11. Greenhouse Gas Protocol Emission Factors from Cross 

Sector Tools, March 2017 were used for diesel conversions. 

The gases included in the conversion of diesel are CO2, CH4 

and N2O.

APPENDIX

12. Our water consumption data is based on the standards and 

methodologies defined by the Indonesian National Standard 

and Indonesian regulation for water supply.

13. Since all our buildings in BSD City are located within the 

same area, we are not required to maintain individual 

records for each building’s water discharge. Therefore, 

we have on-site meters to measure water discharge in 

only three of our buildings in scope, namely MyRepublic 

Plaza, Wisma BCA and our retail mall Q-BIG. The water 

discharge data in our report is based on the assumption 

that volume of water discharge from a building is 

approximately 80% of water consumed. This methodology 

is aligned with international standards and the Indonesian 

government’s Ministry of Public Work and Housing. Data 

from our residential apartment and business loft buildings 

are excluded from the scope of water discharge as these 

buildings are tenanted (SML only maintains control of 

the common area). Data from the buildings housing the 

Customer Care Office and the BSD Permit and Township 

Office are also excluded from this report’s scope as these 

buildings are using septic tanks, hence there are no records 

of water discharge.

14. Development projects’ environmental performance data 

includes information on materials used. We currently do 

not report on energy consumption, water consumption, and 

waste produced in our development projects. 

HEALTH AND SAFETY

1. Buildings’ health and safety performance data include 

workplace accidents of employees at building premises.

2 

Development projects’ health and safety performance data 

include workplace accidents of contractors at project sites.

3. Safety performance data for members of public include 

accidents of guests, visitors, occupants, tenants, customers, 

etc. at building premises.

4. Accident frequency rate (AFR) is defined as the number of 

workplace accidents for every one million man-hours worked.

5. Accident severity rate (ASR) is defined as the number of man-

days lost to workplace accidents for every one million man-

hours worked.

PEOPLE

1. Data on our employees include the overall employment 

statistics for our Indonesian operations (excluding any Joint 

Ventures). 

2. Scheduled workdays are calculated by 5 days x 52 weeks 

minus public holidays, annual leave and parental leave.

3. There are no significant variations in the total number of our 

employees. A significant portion of the development projects 

are performed by our contractors during construction. 

4. Average training hours 

per employee

=

total training hours for the year

Number of employees 

as at 31 Dec 2018
