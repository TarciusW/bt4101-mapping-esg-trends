Sustainability Report 2019 

 

 

Chairman’s Message 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Sunpower Group and our entire global workforce, I am pleased 

to present our updated Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2019, the third 

report since we first released our sustainability vision and plan. Over this period, our business has 

grown significantly while our dedication to sustainable practices and environmental solutions 

continues to remain strong to this day. I am proud of our track record in managing risk, maximising 

efficiency and ensuring that everyone in Sunpower’s ecosystem understands the importance of 

operating as a responsible citizen of the world.  

 

More than ever, sustainability has become the most important factor behind our motivation to create 

value. This year, Sunpower’s senior leadership called upon internal divisions to nominate key 

representatives to form Sunpower’s sustainability management committee. It brought together 

executives from across the company to share best practices, overcome challenges and implement 

projects that propel our progress. They then drummed home the message in their respective divisions, 

departments and teams that sustainability belongs to everyone, and that we are all expected to do 

our part to make our company, customers, partners and communities sustainably stronger.

Sustainability Report 2019 

We at Sunpower are more aware than anyone of the importance of sustainability improvement and 

reporting. Since our founding in 1997, our mission has been “to shape a green future” as an 

environmental protection specialist providing energy-saving and clean power solutions, well before 

climate change rose to the top of the national agenda for China. Through our GI business, we are 

actively involved in helping China fight a major source of air pollution – by eliminating the use of non-

centralised small-scale high-emission (“dirty”) boilers by factories to generate steam, power and heat 

in favour of the centralised large-scale low-emission facilities owned and operated by Sunpower that 

can achieve ultra-low emissions comparable to natural gas but at a much lower cost. GI has enormous 

potential to grow further as demand is structurally driven by anti-air pollution policies that mandate 

the closures of small dirty boilers, customers’ continuing organic growth and the relocation of new 

companies into industrial parks served by our centralised GI plants. As at the end of 2019, we have 

eight GI plants in operation, one plant in trial production and two plants under construction, up from 

just four operating plants in 2017 when GI first began to contribute to our financial results. 

 

At the same time, we are gratified that the “green” vision and direction of the company have been 

borne out through the successful economic performance of the Group. In FY2019, we reported a 31.5% 

year-on-year (“YoY”) increase in group underlying net profit attributable to equity holders 1  to 

RMB352.2 million while group underlying operating cashflow increased 8.4% YoY to RMB267.3 million, 

supported by a 4.4 percentage point improvement YoY in EBITDA margin to 19.6% as both the GI and 

M&amp;S key business segments performed well. We have invested and committed RMB1.7 billion in 

project equity to build up our GI portfolio to-date, and are progressing well towards our target to invest 

RMB2.5 billion in project equity by 2021. 

 

But even as Sunpower expands the scale, scope and reach of our business, we have stayed true to our 

vision of “bringing back blue” to China’s skies. To-date, Sunpower’s GI portfolio of GI projects has 

enabled the shutting down closure of more than 300 highly-pollutive, high -energy-consuming coal-

fired boilers, and the reduction of annual pollutive emissions by more than 50,000 tons a year. The 

expansion of the GI asset portfolio has always gone beyond investing based on financial criteria alone. 

We acquire or invest in GI plants simply because we believe we are one of the best companies to run 

them sustainably. For instance, we always upgrade the plants we acquire to be cleaner and more 

efficient, as we have done did in FY2019 with Yongxing Plant (acquired in FY2018) and as we are now 

doing the same with Suyuan Plant (acquired in FY2019). Through the Circular Economy zero-waste 

 

1 Underlying net profit attributable to equity holders is the true operating performance of the Group, after adjusting net 

profit attributable to shareholders (including effects of Convertible Bonds and Warrants) for amortised interest expenses, 

fair value adjustments and foreign exchange gains or losses associated with the Convertible Bonds and Warrants.

model, we have also kept pushing forward with innovations such as the successful implementation of 

the sludge incineration process treatment program in Changrun Project which uses the waste output 

of the adjacent waste- water treatment plant as a fuel substitute, thus preventing sludge from 

polluting the natural environment and lowering our operating costs at the same time.  

 

As you read the rest of this report, I thank you for your interest in our company and taking this 

sustainability journey with us while allowing us to share our investment journey. Sunpower is always 

working hard to safeguard the common future and welfare of ourselves, our customers, our suppliers 

and most importantly, our children.

Corporate Governance 

The Group has been listed in Singapore since 2015 and has established a very mature corporate 

governance system. We are committed to establishing and maintaining stable partnerships with all 

shareholders, employees, partners, suppliers, customers and government to create a healthy win-win 

ecosystem.  

 

We believe that good corporate governance establishes and maintains an ethical environment within 

the Group, which serves the interests of all shareholders and stakeholders. We have in place a set of 

self-regulating and monitoring mechanisms, in accordance with the Code of Corporate Governance 

2018 issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and will continue to keep pace with 

developments in corporate governance to improve our practices and operating frameworks. We are 

committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance and corporate practices to 

safeguard against fraud, with the aim of protecting shareholders’ interests as well as securing the long-

term success of the Group. We place heavy emphasis on ethical business conduct on all employees 

and they are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the expectations set out in the code 

of conduct. We will take actions such as formal disciplinary proceedings if there is any unethical 

conduct or malpractice in relation to corruption or fraud. This moral code will enhance our business 

relationships and our corporate social responsibility.  

 

We will continually do our utmost to ensure that business operations and processes are managed in 

a way that minimises their impact on the environment. In line with our determination to commit to a 

high standard of corporate governance, we have established policies for issues such as Anti-Corruption, 

Conflict of Interest, Insider Trading, Fraud and Whistleblowing. We have set a strong tone of zero 

tolerance towards dishonesty and corrupt practices. During the year, there were no legal cases 

regarding corrupt practices brought against the Group or our people. 

 

The Group has engaged an external professional service firm, Nexia TS Risk Advisory Pte Ltd (“Nexia 

TS”), to perform internal audit reviews and test of controls of critical processes, based on the internal 

audit plan approved by the Audit Committee (AC) before the commencement of work each year. 

Additionally, in 2019 a professional service firm, Jiangsu Jinling Science and Technology Group Limited 

(the "JSC") was engaged to carry out a review of cybersecurity risks for the Group. 

 

In addition, Sunpower has engaged Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP as external auditors of the Group.

Material Topics 

Identifying the consequences and effects of our actions and incorporating our stakeholders’ concerns 

into our business strategy form the basis of our sustainability management. Our materiality analysis is 

based on the four principles of sustainability, namely (1) economic, (2) environmental, (3) social and 

(4) governance. This framework helps us to gain a thorough knowledge of the topics that are of 

greatest interest to our stakeholders, so that our sustainability reporting can reveal the most relevant 

information.   

 

Based on feedback gathered from our stakeholders, this year we have fine-tuned the scope of the 

factors that are material to the organisation and stakeholders in 2019, as well as the manner in which 

we present them. Our priorities are reflected in the Materiality Matrix below and all of our material 

factors are high in priority at the minimum.

ENVIRONMENT 

 

 

Manufacturing &amp; Services (“M&amp;S”) 

The Group’s M&amp;S segment is comprised of Environmental Equipment Manufacturing (“EEM”) and 

Engineering, Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) businesses.  

 

EEM 

In 2019, Sunpower adhered to the guidance of “protecting the environment, saving energy and 

reducing consumption, and preventing and controlling pollution” by integrating research &amp; 

development, design and sales processes. In pursuing excellence in high-end environmental 

protection equipment manufacturing and services, Sunpower actively promoted the technical 

modification of pollution prevention and control facilities involved in the manufacturing of related 

products.  

 

1. 

Technical modification of pickling process 

As high-end environmental protection equipment is mostly used in petroleum, chemical, metallurgy 

and other industries where there are high-temperature, high-pressure, toxic, hazardous, flammable, 

explosive and corrosive environments, the metal surface treatment required of the equipment is 




 

 

 

25  

 

 

Sustainability Report 2019 

extremely demanding. An indispensable process in the metal surface treatment of pressure vessel 

equipment is pickling, which produces wastewater containing heavy metal pollutants such as 

chromium and nickel. However, poor management of wastewater from pickling can easily cause heavy 

metal contamination to the environment. Electrolytic pickling has zero discharge of pickling 

wastewater and the electrolyte is non-toxic, corrosion-free and odourless, which avoids heavy metal 

contamination to the environment and harmful effects to personal health caused by the traditional 

pickling process. In 2019, an advanced electrolytic pickling technology from Italy was introduced.  

 

2. 

Treatment of organic waste gas 

In 2019, in response to the government’s directive, we actively re-organized the treatment of waste 

gas from spray painting to reduce its harmful effects. Sunpower plans to construct new spray painting 

booths in Jiangning District High-Tech Park and the Nanjing Jiangbei New Area Chemical Park. In these 

booths, an advanced waste gas purification process by catalytic combustion will be applied, greatly 

reducing the emission of organic waste gas.  

 

3. 

Audit of cleaner production 

In 2019, Sunpower implemented a cleaner production audit on heat pipe manufacturing to study and 

investigate the production and service processes, analyse and diagnose the causes of environmental 

problems, and propose energy-saving and consumption-reduction programs. As a requirement for 

life-cycle of the products, no harm should be inflicted onto the environment and human lives 

throughout the product life-cycle from raw material selection to after-use disposal, and harm shall be 

minimised if it is unavoidable.   

 

4. 

Wastewater recycling 

In 2019, Sunpower installed new recycling and pressure-testing devices for domestic sewage and 

wastewater. The domestic sewage water is now purified and reused for toilet flushing, and the 

pressure-testing wastewater device enables recycling of the carbon steel pressure test wastewater 

after purification. These two wastewater purification units have cumulatively saved over 4,000 tons 

of fresh water since they were put into use.

2. 

Clean and orderly construction that protects the environment 

Sunpower has clearly-specified work and environmental protection measures in the Construction 

Organization Plan for EPC projects, aimed at protecting the environment in cooperation with the 

owner entity, by emphasizing clean and orderly construction work and allocated environmental 

protection responsibilities to achieve work site dust control and compliance with standards on 

construction wastewater recycling or discharge after treatment and noise emission.  

 

3. 

Promotion of environmental protection concepts 

Sunpower strongly promotes energy conservation and environmental protection concepts, cultivates 

employees' awareness of environmental protection, advocates low-carbon lifestyles and actively 

builds a communication platform for external stakeholders of the company for a better response to 

environmental demands from concerned parties.  

 

Sunpower provided EPC services for the following projects in 2019: 

 High salt water crystallization project of Shenhua 

Yulin 

 Flare gas recovery project of Zhejiang 

Petrochemical Co., Ltd.  

 Flare project of Jingyi Chemical in Shaanxi

Green Investment (“GI”)  

1. 

Pollution source control and ultra-clean emissions 

Sunpower’s GI projects apply desulphurisation, denitrification and dust removal technologies that 

strictly comply with national ultra-clean emission standards. The concentration in waste gas emissions 

that can be achieved is ≤5 mg/m³ of particulate matter (PM), ≤35 mg/m³ of SO2  and ≤50 mg/m³ of 

NOX.   

 

2. 

Protect the blue sky action plan 

In 2019, Sunpower continued with its efforts in contributing to the national Blue Sky Program by 

employing the “centralised heating” model as the primary mechanism for controlling pollution sources 

in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta and other economically active areas. 2019 saw 

the safe operation of centralised co-generation projects such as Changrun Project, Xinyuan Plant, 

Xintai Zhengda Project, Lianshui Project, Quanjiao Project, Yongxing Plant and Jining Project 

throughout the year. We supply steam to industrial users through long-distance steam distribution 

pipelines to support the sustainable development of the local economy and community, while 

ensuring environmental preservation.  

 

3. 

Modification of denitrification technology to achieve stable emission compliance 










 

 

 

28  

 

 

Sustainability Report 2019 

In 2019, after the denitrification modification of boiler #5 at Xinyuan Plant, unstable emission hazards 

created during the high-load and low-load operational phases have been eliminated. While ensuring 

standards for emissions and ammonia leakage are met, the concentration of denitrified ammonia has 

been reduced from 20% to 15%. Modification of the denitrification system has also greatly contributed 

towards haze reduction. This has played an important role in improving China’s air quality and 

promoting ecological civilization.  

 

4. 

Sludge combustion to benefit the country and its people 

Sludge, a by-product of wastewater treatment plants, contains bacteria, parasite eggs, heavy metals 

and other harmful substances that can cause great environmental pollution. In 2019, Yongxing Plant 

and Changrun Project achieved mixed sludge combustion through technical modification, which not 

only solved the sludge disposal problem but also converted sludge into a harmless resource. This has 

been fuel-saving while effectively protecting the environment. Upon the completion of this technical 

modification, Yongxing Plant can handle about 50,000 tons per year of sludge from Suzhou city, and 

Changrun Project can handle about 50,000 tons per year of sludge from Gaoyang Wastewater 

Treatment Plant.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 

As a green corporation that aids customers in achieving environmentally-friendly objectives, our 

positive image and reputation are already secured by the work that we do, but being a socially 

responsible one as well helps us win the heart of our employees and our communities. We put the 

health and safety of our employees as our top priority. Further, as part of our commitment to promote 

a learning culture throughout the organisation, training and education are actively carried out to 

further enhance capabilities of our employees. These efforts are made with the well-being of our 

people and the public in mind.  

 

Internal Occupational Health and Safety Management 

1. Production safety is always top priority 

In early 2019, in order to implement the HSE policy of “placing safety first and prevention as the 

priority through comprehensive governance; putting our people first through control and protection 

as well as participation by all employees; complying with regulations and conducting scientific 

management for continuous improvement”, the Group Chairman signed a letter of responsibilities on 

production safety, occupational health and environment protection objectives with the heads of 

subsidiary companies to implement a system of responsibility on production safety at various levels, 

and further improve the HSE work system of “taking responsibility at all levels by each and every one”.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. Improved occupational health and safety management system 

To provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment that prevents death, injury and 

health problems, in August 2019, Sunpower began to shift towards the ISO45001:2018 occupational 

health and safety management system in order to continuously improve the occupational health and 

safety management; fulfil laws, regulations and other requirements; and realise the HSE objectives. 

To achieve a comprehensive and well-executed shift in the occupational health and safety 

management system, Sunpower invited Mr. Li Hezhi from Jiangsu Fangyuan Certification Group Co., 










 

 

 

30  

 

 

Sustainability Report 2019 



Ltd. to conduct a two-day training for all the internal auditors of the Group’s occupational health and 

safety system.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.  Optimised HSE management organisation structure  

In May 2019, Sunpower separated the HSE function from the existing Enterprise Management 

Department, and established the HSE Management Department at the Group level. Under the 

leadership of the Board of Directors, it will undertake overall responsibility for the production safety, 

occupational health and environmental protection work of the Group. Since its establishment, the HSE 

Management Department has made 25 inspections of the production and project sites to better 

conduct HSE training, audit and inspection, as well as perform basic services and provide support in a 

manner that would effectively avoid serious injuries or higher-level accidents. In addition, each 

subsidiary has set up full-time HSE management departments, so that joint actions can be taken at 

different levels to promote HSE work as a whole, in order to ensure the long-term growth of the 

company.  

 

4. Launched people-centred “smart manufacturing” program 

In 2019, the Group launched the people-centred “smart manufacturing” program that uses advanced 

tools and standard procedures to solve occupational health and safety problems in the production 

process. To ensure the safe demoulding of the thermal insulation module, Sunpower modified the 

existing manual demoulding process into one with an automated demoulding loop. In order to prevent 

acid mist from harming employees and control the risk of suffocation, Sunpower imported the Italian 

harmless electrolytic pickling process. 

 

 




 

 

 

31  

 

 

Sustainability Report 2019 

 

5. Implemented “5S” management to improve quality and efficiency 

In February 2019, the Group arranged a trip for the heads of various subsidiaries to one of the GI 

projects, Zhangjiagang Yongxing Thermal Power Co., Ltd., to learn “5S” management and use Yongxing 

as the benchmark to vigorously promote and implement “5S” management in all production 

workshops and project sites. The improvement of safety in the production environment has led to 

better production efficiency, lower production cost, higher product quality and shorter production 

period, thus enhancing the corporate image. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6. United as a team and carried the commitment forward  

 “Better to teach a man to fish than to give him fish”. In 2019, the Group accumulated 14,000 hours in 

special HSE training time. The HSE Management Department summoned HSE management personnel 

from various project sites across the country on 11 September and 29 September respectively to the 

Group’s headquarters to share ideas, bond as a team and carry their commitment forward.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7. Organised abundant, diversified production safety activities 










 

 

 

32  

 

 

Sustainability Report 2019 

Adhering to the concept of “never at the expense of human life”, Sunpower organized abundant and 

diversified production safety activities focusing on the theme of “preventing risks, curbing accidents 

and eliminating hidden dangers” in 2019.

External Occupational Health and Safety Management 

1. Incorporated intrinsic safety into products 

The Group takes into full account the intrinsic safety of its products during the product R&amp;D and 

project design stages, and technical provisions are made so that the products or the project systems 

under construction will not cause accidents even if there are wrong operations or faults. In so doing, 

the occupational health and safety of downstream customers are guaranteed.  

 

2. Achieved full coverage in occupational health and safety management 

In 2019, the Group’s HSE management implemented full coverage in occupational health and safety 

management, covering administrative offices, cafeterias and vehicle fleets, employee commutes and 

all persons entering Sunpower’s premises. In addition, all customers entering Sunpower’s premises 

are required to sign the HSE notice and go through the appropriate HSE training and instructions. They 

are allowed to enter factory or site areas only when personal protection equipment is correctly worn.  

 

3.  Strengthened the management of business qualifications for contracting and outsourcing 

In 2019, in strict accordance with the requirements of the Production Safety Law of the People's 

Republic of China, the Group strengthened the management of qualifications of the contracting and 

outsourcing businesses. It also exercised strict control over the HSE production conditions of the 

outsourcing entities for projects such as the energy islands and qualifications of entities and 

individuals for selection of qualified suppliers and contractors.

on rapid passing of knowledge and skills within the system, and 

creating interpersonal relationships and a cultural atmosphere 

for assisting and teaching.  

 

A culture of value enhancement: Sunpower encourages 

employees to pursue new heights in their careers - we have 

established a technician engagement system and clearly shown 

the development direction for employees. To improve the 

development channel, we founded the Sunpower Management 

College to focus on enhancing the abilities of employees in 

management, profession and occupation on the basis of the 

employee competency model. We also incubated and 

established the innovation studio to organise learning, subject 

research and skill innovation. By promoting the work in all areas 

with experience gained at key points, a good working 

atmosphere in which everyone competes to join the innovation 

team to improve their skills has been formed. We constantly 

create a harmonious environment for employees to grow

together with the enterprise and achieve success, to maximize  

the value of employees and the enterprise.  

 

A culture with accountability: the highest virtue and social 

commitment. Sunpower seeks to achieve the harmonious 

development of the enterprise with society and environment in 

its actions, and for years, it has made prominent contributions 

in support of poverty alleviation, employment, education, 

earthquake relief and helping vulnerable groups to promote 

social harmony, and in serving national strategic projects such 

as the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, and the Belt and Road Initiative, it 

received commendations by the government, civil affairs 

departments and charitable organisations. 

 

Team Bonding 

Team building activities enable employees to work together 

more efficiently. It allows staff to see that everyone has 

different skills and approaches to a problem. This knowledge is 

then transferred to the work environment, as individuals 

understand how best to make use of each other’s gifts and 

abilities. Improving productivity is one of the most common 

goals of team building.  Enjoyable fun activities enable our 

employees to get to know and develop a better understanding 

of each other, and break down walls of mistrust by encouraging 

people to focus on what they have in common instead of their 

differences. We regularly organise employee activities (such as 

mountaineering, calligraphy, field trips, sports competitions, 

etc.) which further enhance our employees’ sense of belonging 

to the company. It is our commitment to pursue a pragmatic, 

innovative, efficient and harmonious corporate culture. 

Employees come to know and understand the company’s 

entrepreneurism through cultural propaganda (knowledge), 

cultural identity (trust) and cultural practice (conduct), which

gradually become universal beliefs expressed in their daily 

actions. 

 

 

Sunpower’s Cheerful Running: This event was started in 2014 with the purpose of advocating public 

environmental protection in the form of “cheerful running”, which conforms to the development 

direction of the Group and promotes the upgrading and vitality of Sunpower. It helps to enhance team 

interaction, popularise the Sunpower brand and its influence and combine its corporate culture with 

the elements of long-distance running, health, going-green and environmental protection. 

 

In 2019, “Sunpower City Cheerful Running” was further expanded, pioneering a new model of “north-

south linkage”. Concurrently launched in 7 cities (Nanjing, Jinan, Gaoyang, Xintai, Jimo, Zhangjiagang 

and Lianshui) in 3 provinces of China, with more than 400 participants, it allowed all employees in cities 

where Sunpower has a business to realise the ideal of “going beyond expectations and beyond self”.

Sunpower’s Fun Sports: In the peak season of production, the employees of Sunpower work day and 

night for seven days a week, missing a lot of opportunities to be together with their families. The first 

Fun Games of Sunpower was thus held in 2019 to allow employees to fully enjoy the happy times with 

their families and colleagues, feel the joyful atmosphere, enhance the cohesion and sense of unity in 

work, and promote the formation of the “happy home enterprise” atmosphere in Sunpower. Through 

4 hours of interaction in various forms, the sports delegations of the Group created a joyful and 

refreshing time for employees.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 

To adhere to the principles of sustainability, we also take proactive action in enhancing our supply 

chain management, quality control and the quality of our state-of-the-art technologies to further boost 

our business performance and to allow us to lead the industry for customer satisfaction. 

 

Supply Chain Management 

Clear standards for suppliers are set to build a reliable, efficient and sustainable supply chain. The 

principle of sustainable development is taken into account when selecting suppliers in order to monitor 

risks involved in key areas of the supply chain. We work with suppliers for a better society and a better 

environment by establishing long-term, stable and sustainable cooperative relationships. We 

constantly optimise supplier composition by selecting responsible suppliers that are high-performing 

in the areas of work-site safety management, environmental compliance and corporate society 

responsibility. 

 

Over the past two decades, we have kept our cooperation with various suppliers on the basis of mutual 

learning and progress. At present, our long-time suppliers number more than 500, spreading across 

countries such as China, United States, Japan, Germany, Sweden, United Kingdom, Finland and France. 

Moreover, strategic and cooperative partnerships have been formed with more than one supplier. 

Adhering to the “Code of Conduct for Purchasing Personnel”, the Purchase Department does its 

purchasing business on the basis of fairness, justness, honesty and trustworthiness. 

 

To ensure that the products and services provided by our suppliers meet the relevant environmental, 

occupational health and safety standards, we have included in our supplier evaluation the 

requirements of environmental, occupational health and safety management systems as well as other 

relevant certifications. Furthermore, our contracts with suppliers state that all national regulations 

with respect to occupational health, safety and environmental protection must be strictly observed.  

 

In 2019, we continued to promote supplier HSE management and detailed supplier HSE management 

evaluations to assist in guiding and supervising suppliers to improve their awareness of and capability 

in occupational health management, safety management and environmental protection, aimed at the 

ultimate purpose of building a low-carbon and green supply chain.

Economic Performance 

A company’s financial capital and market 

performance depends on its ability to create a 

competitive edge and generate tangible value 

for its shareholders, customers, employees 

and society. Sustaining healthy profits also 

stems 

from 

intangible 

assets 

such 

as 

professional 

management, 

extensive 

experience, leadership quality, organisational 

excellence, 

brand 

equity, 

environmental 

management and human capital.  

 

Sunpower achieved another record level of 

high-quality financial performance in 2019, in 

which sustained growth and margin expansion 

enabled another year of strong growth in 

underlying profit and cashflow generation. 

The Group achieved record growth in top and 

bottom line: revenue rose 10.5% YoY to a 

record RMB3,604.6 million, and EBITDA grew 

by 42.5% YoY to RMB706.6 million, resulting in 

underlying net profit attributable to equity 

holders increasing 31.5% YoY to RMB352.2 

million and underlying operating cash flow 

increasing 8.4% YoY to RMB267.3 million.  

 

Sunpower has met its target of ~50% of income 

from the recurring GI business for two 

consecutive years. GI revenue increased 56.8% 

YoY to RMB1,155.3 million and GI EBITDA 

increased 56.7% YoY to RMB432.9 million, 

while operating cashflow from GI projects 

increased 18.8% YoY to a robust RMB251.6 

million. As GI projects are still ramping up, the 

(1) Underlying net profit attributable to equity holders is the true 

operating performance of the Group, after adjusting net profit 

attributable to shareholders (including effects of Convertible 

Bonds and Warrants) for amortised interest expenses, fair value 

adjustments and foreign exchange gains or losses associated 

with the Convertible Bonds and Warrants.

are repeat customers. Our order book was 

maintained at a constant RMB2.5 billion for 4 

consecutive quarters in 2019, and has surged 

further to RMB2.8 billion as at April 2020. This
