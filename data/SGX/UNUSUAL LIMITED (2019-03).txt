BOARD’S MESSAGE 

[GRI 102-14]  

 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

 

It is our pleasure to present our second Sustainability Report (“Report”) for the financial year 

ended 31 March 2019. The Report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI 

Standards: Core Option, which outlines the key economic, environmental, social and 

governance (“EESG”) factors deemed material to our stakeholders and us.  

 

We engaged our stakeholders during the reporting period to re-assess the material factors 

identified last year and determined that these factors continue to be relevant. In this Report, 

we have categorised our material EESG factors into the following five key areas: 

1. 

Business excellence and ethics 

2. 

Responsibility towards our economy 

3. 

Responsibility towards our supply chain 

4. 

Responsibility towards our people 

5. 

Responsibility towards our consumers 

 

Each area listed above represents UnUsUaL’s effort to create a sustainable and positive 

impact upon the economy, its suppliers, the workplace and consumers.  

 

At UnUsUaL, we recognise the importance of sustainable growth and are dedicated to 

working towards it. We are grateful to our partners, stakeholders and staff for joining us in 

this sustainability journey. As we strive towards a sustainable future, we also remain 

committed to seek and create value for our stakeholders.   

 

We thank you for your continued support as we endeavour to reach new heights in our 

growth. 

 

 

Leslie Ong 

Director and CEO

BUSINESS EXCELLENCE AND ETHICS 

[GRI 102-11, 102-16, 205-3] 

Enterprise Risk Management 

 

During the reporting period, UnUsUaL commissioned an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) 

project to create a robust and rigorous corporate governance structure that safeguards the 

stakeholders’ interests. The risk management framework applied determines the nature and 

extent of the key risks which UnUsUaL faces in achieving its strategic goals. ERM enables us 

to effectively deal with uncertainty, the associated risk and opportunity, enhancing the capacity 

to build value.  

 

The framework used is aligned to COSO Enterprise Risk Management framework, the 

international framework on ERM with the objectives of meeting the compliance in the design, 

implementation and monitoring of the ERM and internal control systems in place. Through this 

methodology, UnUsUaL has developed and implemented the appropriate risk management 

procedures to address the key risks identified. All key risk management matters were 

highlighted to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.

BUSINESS EXCELLENCE AND ETHICS 

[GRI 102-11, 102-16, 205-3] 

Whistle Blowing Policy 

 

UnUsUaL is committed to the highest possible standard of ethical, moral and legal business 

conduct and intends to promote consistent organisational behaviour. We do not tolerate any 

malpractice, impropriety, statutory non-compliance or wrongdoing (“Irregularities”) by staff in 

the course of their work.  

 

The Whistle Blowing Policy has been implemented to provide employees of the Group with an 

independent and confidential channel to report suspected fraud and irregularities within the 

Group and offer reassurance that they are protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle 

blowing in good faith and without malice. The policy encourages the reporting of such matters 

by employees on an anonymous basis. The Group is confident of the policy’s effectiveness as 

reports by employees are confidential and can be made easily through post or e-mail, directly 

to the audit committee.  

 

Details of the Whistle Blowing Policy have been disseminated to all employees of the Group 

(including full time, part time and contract employees) and reminders are circulated on an 

annual basis.  

 

To date, there were no reports received through the whistle blowing mechanism.

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

[GRI 102-18, 42, 46] 

 

We conducted our first materiality assessment in 2018 with reference to the GRI Standards to 

identify and select stakeholders with whom to engage and determine the material EESG 

factors. This year, we conducted a Focus Group Discussion with our Sustainability Reporting 

Champion Team (“Team”) to validate the assessment and gather feedback on the sustainability 

issues that were identified as important. This exercise confirmed the continued relevance of the 

key stakeholder groups and material factors. Hence, we have not revised them. We will 

continue to assess the identified material factors on a regular basis to ensure their relevance. 

We analysed our operations and adopted a 4-step approach (shown below) to determine the 

material EESG factors.  

 

 

 

UnUsUaL addressed the issues at hand by following the 4-step process listed above. We 

studied the EESG risks identified and their potential impact to gain a comprehensive overview 

before we developed mitigation approaches. Through the above four steps, we were able to 

gain an understanding of the sustainability issues that matter most to our key stakeholders. We 

then earmarked the material factors and assessed their materiality in the context of our 

business operations, with reference to the respective GRI standards.  

 

Thereafter, we worked with the relevant departments to execute the strategies and action plans 

upon approval by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors. 

 

We stay committed to improve the identification and management of material issues annually 

to ensure their relevance to our stakeholders.

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR ECONOMY 

[GRI 102-4, 102-6, 203-2] 

Our indirect economic impact 

 

As the regional hub of Asia, Singapore continues to market its multi-faceted appeal as a premier 

business and leisure destination, and offer empowering and customised experiences to visitors. 

According to Martin Prosperity Institute’s Global Creativity Index, Singapore is ranked the 9th 

most creative country in the world.  

 

UnUsUaL aims to enhance this appeal by conceptualising and developing creative ideas for a 

wide range of audiences through our shows and events.  

 

Well received performances by Asian and International artistes under UnUsUaL’s portfolio 

include Air Supply, Backstreet Boys, Chang Hui Mei, Foo Fighters, G.E.M, Jacky Cheung, JJ 

Lin, Kim Soo Hyun, Lee Min Ho, Lionel Richie, Mariah Carey, Park Bo Gum, Pet Shop Boys, 

S.H.E., Stefanie Sun, Rain, Wakin Chau and Yanni, in Singapore as well as in the region.  

 

During the reporting period, the total audience recorded through ticketed events was 

approximately 150,000. The geographical distribution of our concerts was as follows:-

The number of live shows and events we have produced and promoted has increased year-on-

year as seen in the table above. Going forward, we aim to further increase the number of high-

quality shows and events organised in the region. We will also expand into producing and 

promoting family-themed entertainment shows and events such as Walking with Dinosaurs, 

Disney on Ice and Apollo.  

 

These live events and shows have succeeded in attracting both local and international 

audiences, creating a positive spill over effect on local businesses. This has resulted in an 

increase in consumer spending on hotel, food and beverage, transport etc, thus creating 

positive economic externalities and a multiplied value for the economy.

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR SUPPLY CHAIN 

[GRI 102-9, 204-1, 308-1, 414-1] 

 

UnUsUaL understands that as a successful and established events producer and promoter, it 

is critical for us to engage with quality suppliers who are reliable and abide by the required law 

and regulations. Only with such partners can we ensure sustainability in our working 

relationship. This is important for our success in the industry. 

 

Our procurement practice and supplier assessment 

 

UnUsUaL works closely with several trusted third party contractors/suppliers to ensure the 

quality control on events/concerts. These contractors/suppliers include suppliers of equipment 

(i.e. Sound, Light, and Video (“SLV”) etc.), building performance sets, venue areas, ticketing 

services and security companies. More than 95% of our suppliers are engaged from the local 

community where the events are held.  

 

We assess our suppliers using a set of environment and social criteria through informal 

background checks, review of past track-records as well as information gathered from market 

intelligence. The criteria include the following:-  

- 

Supplier must ensure proper treatment of all effluents and waste; 

- 

Supplier is prohibited to hire child labour, forced labour and illegal labour; 

- 

Supplier must ensure maintenance of fair and transparent corporate governance within 

their organisation; and 

- 

Supplier must ensure that workers are properly trained in safety measures to handle 

high risk tasks. 

 

Moreover, we emphasise the importance of “reduce, re-use and recycle” to our suppliers and 

encourage them to implement environmentally friendly strategies within their own 

organisations.   

 

Through the familiarity and trust built between us and our suppliers from long-standing working 

relationships, we are able to work cohesively.

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR PEOPLE 

[GRI 102-7, 8 and 41, 401-1 and 3, 404-1 and 3, 405-1, 406-1] 

 

Our employees are one of the driving forces behind the success of our business and we are 

committed to creating a positive environment for their physical and mental well-being. This 

includes their overall job satisfaction which keeps our retention rate high; an inclusive and non-

discriminatory culture which forms a safe working space and a fair and open environment for 

the continuous career development of all employees.  

 

A significant portion of our activities are performed by workers hired by various third party 

subcontractors and they are not included in our total headcount for the purpose of this Report.  

 

Our employees are not covered under any collective bargaining agreements but are given the 

right to exercise freedom of association.  

 

Our workforce retention and recruitment 

 

UnUsUaL’s strategy for maintaining our high retention rate involves raising the overall well-

being of our employees. While we consciously seek to retain our core team of experienced 

employees, we are also constantly on the lookout for new talent to complement the existing 

team members and contribute to our growth.   

 

As at 31 March 2019, the Group’s workforce comprised 39 permanent staff.  The retention and 

recruitment data is shown below:-

During the reporting period, UnUsUaL’s retention rate was 90% which was consistent with the 

previous year. There is an increase in total headcount year-on-year which is aligned with the 

Group’s operational expansion.  

 

The Group also encourages expecting working parents to take the required and necessary 

parental leave as stipulated by law. Proper handover procedures are put in place to ensure that 

there is minimum disruption to the roles and responsibilities of the employees. In the past three 

years, a total of two employees took parental leave. Both the return to work rate and the 

retention rate of these working parents are 100%.  

 

We believe that we are able to maintain the high retention rate due to the supportive human 

resource policies put in place. It is important to retain talent to ensure continuity in our business.

Our diverse workforce 

 

UnUsUaL has pledged to endorse an inclusive culture that focuses on treating all employees 

fairly. We adopt a strong stance against discrimination on any basis and are committed to 

providing equal opportunities.  

 

UnUsUaL values and promotes diversity which is evident in our workforce comprising people 

from a wide array of cultures, viewpoints and backgrounds. Our employment policies are 

based on meritocracy, regardless of age, gender, or nationality. As tabulated below, we have 

achieved a balanced employee distribution which enables us to maintain a competitive and 

progressive workforce.

Our diverse workforce (Continued) 

 

Our diversity is not just limited to our employees but also represented in our Board of Directors. 

Our directors come from different backgrounds which helps to expand the range of perspectives 

at the top and enables the Board to better advise the Group strategically. 

 

The Board comprises seven directors, six male and one female, of whom five fall under the age 

50 years old and two are above 50 years old.  

 

We are committed to providing a workplace free from adverse conduct such as discrimination, 

sexual harassment and bullying. We do not tolerate such conduct and will take action which 

may include dismissal if these cases occur. There were no incidents of adverse conduct 

reported during the reporting period.

Developing our employees 

 

UnUsUaL believes in nurturing our employees to ensure the continual professional competence 

of our workforce. To support this belief we provide on the job training whenever possible and 

also source for external training courses. The training programmes enable our employees to 

stay relevant and adapt to various changes in the artistes’ and audience’s expectations. We 

trust that the personal growth of the employees would lead to improved organisational 

performance and help in achieving long-term business growth and sustainability for the Group.

All our employees were subjected to an annual performance review to discuss their job 

performance and career goals. We continue to review our annual performance and career 

development process to assess if additional initiatives and policies need to be implemented.

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS OUR CONSUMERS 

[GRI 419-1] 

 

Socioeconomic compliance 

 

When producing or promoting events in Singapore or in other countries in the region, UnUsUaL 

always emphasises the importance of being aware of the social and cultural sensitivities of the 

local communities to its employees. We work closely with the local authorities to ensure that 

the necessary precautionary measures are taken so that the show content meets the 

communities’ expectations.  

 

We also provide clear communication to our artistes, through their managers or agents, about 

the local laws and regulations set by the local government. They are asked to consider the 

appropriateness of the event’s content in the context of the location and the social impact it 

may have on the community.  

 

We did not identify any non-compliance with socioeconomic laws and regulations during the 

reporting period.
