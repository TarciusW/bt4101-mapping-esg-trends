Board Statement     

We are pleased to present our second 

Sustainability Report for FY2018 that 

shows our approach towards sustainability 

as well as our practices and performance 

around relevant material topics. 

 

 

Our company is uniquely positioned in 

semiconductor industry in Singapore to 

provide integrated range of services 

comprising Backend Equipment Solution &amp; 

Technologies (BEST) and services. We 

believe our business goes beyond our 

integrated range of services, where we are 

committed in identifying the sustainability 

needs of individuals, businesses and 

communities while growing our business. 

 

We are committed to good sustainability 

practices and we aim to continue to do 

better to remain successful. Strategic 

considerations and actions around 

sustainability increases resilience in our 

business. By focusing on customers’ 

requirements, we gain valuable insights on 

providing quality customer service. We 

ensure to abide by our supplier due 

diligence procedures for screening and 

monitoring of our customers and 

suppliers. We are in adherence to global 

and industrial standards and guidelines 

while providing safe and positive working 

environment to our employees. 

 

We work together to determine, manage 

and communicate sustainability risks and 

opportunities relevant to our business. We 

are responsible for maintaining oversight 

of development and implementation of 

sustainability strategy. We are supported 

by the Sustainability Steering Committee 

(SSC) that supports us in these 

sustainability endeavours. We followed a 

comprehensive materiality assessment 

exercise last year and reviewed the 

identified material topics in FY2018 to 

determine high impact areas to support 

our business strategy. We concluded that 

our 9 ESG material topics in FY2018 

remained unchanged from last year. 

 

Our strong commitment to ethical 

business practices and product quality 

guide everything that we do and we 

believe these principles are of particular 

significance to our reputation, profitability 

and long-term success. Sustainability 

remains a priority in our business 

operations.  

 

We look forward to sharing our 

sustainability experience in FY2018. 

 

Materiality Assessment 

 

We conducted a materiality assessment 

workshop in FY2017 involving members of 

the senior management team from ASTI. 

The identification of material issues 

involved conducting research on global 

and local trends in our industry and 

material topics identified by our peers and 

industry best practices. In FY2018, we 

reviewed the materiality assessment 

process and concluded that the identified 

9 material topics are still reflective of our 

business direction and continue to remain 

relevant this year. We will continue to 

assess these material topics on regular 

basis to ensure their relevance and 

importance to our business. For each 

material topic, table below shows the 

corresponding topic specific GRI standards 

and relevant United Nations Sustainable 

Development Goals (UNSDGs).

Economic 

Economic Performance 

 

We carry our operations in a responsible 

manner, so as to create value for our 

stakeholders, particularly our 

shareholders. In order to deliver value to 

all our stakeholders, our focus is to 

maintain a strong financial position for 

long-term sustainable growth for our 

shareholders.  

 

Our financial performance for FY2018 can 

be found in the Financial Highlights section 

(page 8) and Appendix 2 – Audited 

Financial Statements (pages 9 to 83) of the 

Annual Report.  

 

Our Environment 

Energy and Emissions  

 

Our large portion of operations 

costs is attributed to electricity 

usage in the manufacturing 

process which results in indirect 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 

With implementation of carbon 

tax in Singapore from 2019, 

where tax will be levied on direct 

emitters mainly power plants, it 

will result in increase in energy 

costs. In such changing scenario 

and increasing climate risks, we 

are committed to reducing 

energy consumption and indirect 

GHG emissions as we improve 

our efficiencies and reduce costs.  

 

At ASTI, we conduct regular monitoring of 

our energy consumption in equipment 

manufacturing, heating, ventilation and air 

conditioning by implementing a robust 

monitoring system. With implementation 

of energy monitoring initiatives our 

operational costs have been reduced.

We consumed 269,739 KWh of electricity 

in our operations in FY2018 with a 

decrease of 6.3%, which was due to an 

increase in shared use of office space. This 

led to a decrease in electricity intensity by 

6.3% from 300 kWh/m2 in FY2017 to 281 

kWh/m2 in FY2018. We have achieved our 

target set for FY2018 to maintain our 

energy intensity within 10% of 2017 levels. 

As our major source of energy 

consumption is attributed to electricity 

which results in 113 tCO2e of indirect 

emissions. With a decrease in electricity 

consumption in our operations, there was 

a 6.3% decrease in our GHG emissions 

intensity in FY2018.  

 

Our People 

Talent Attraction and Retention  

 

We pride ourselves on our highly

We employ 52 employees based in 

Singapore as at 31st December 2018 and 

46% of them were within the 30-to-50-

year age group. Male and female 

employees accounted for 40% and 60% of 

ASTI’s workforce, respectively. In FY2018, 

our average monthly new hire rate was 

1.4%. We met our target set for FY2018 to 

achieve an employee turnover rate less 

than or equal to the industry average. 

There was no turnover of employees at 

Telford in FY2018.  

 

All our employees are dedicated to deliver 

the best customer experience, products 

and services to our stakeholders. 

 

We collect, track and monitor our human 

resources (HR) data, including overtime, 

vacation balances and the number of 

training days on a regular basis.  

 

We believe in a transparent talent 

acquisition system. We offer our 

employees a competitive compensation 

and a range of other benefits. We do not 

discriminate during our recruitment 

process and ensure to adopt fair practices 

for all the deserving candidates including 

persons with disabilities offering 

remuneration as per market standards. 

We also learn from the employees who 

leave the company through the exit 

interviews where we gather feedback and 

comments. It gives us some key insights on 

improvement in our recruitment and 

talent retention system. 

 

Our career development initiatives focus 

on providing all our employees with a clear 

line of sight of their career growth in ASTI. 

We strive to promote a culture of 

continuous performance appraisal for all 

job grades, encouraging constructive and 

open communication between managers 

and their staff. 

These initiatives provide clear insight to 

our employees to take ownership of their 

careers and progress with acquired skill 

sets. Our employee annual appraisals are 

based on the career development 

framework. We believe in more engaging 

appraisal system where a discussion with 

employee is initiated on their personal 

development and long term goals. 

 

Our full time employees are provided with 

benefits which include health care 

coverage, parental leave and retirement 

plans. There were no part-time employees 

at ASTI Holdings in FY2018.  

 

Training and Education 

 

Our success depends on the right pool of 

talent in the organisation. Our HR 

department assesses the current and 

future skills requirements for our business 

operations and design learning and 

development programmes to meet these 

requirements. These programmes are 

tailored to meet the needs of employees 

and enhance their personal and 

professional development. Our on-site 

training programmes in latest technology 

updates allow us to stay on the forefront 

of the industry.

There are special training programmes for 

the Senior Management to identify and 

groom promising individuals as part of our 

succession planning.  

 

In FY2018, our employees were provided 

with trainings with an average of 3 hours 

per employee. Approximately, 92% of total 

training hours were recorded by the 

management team, 6% and 1% were 

recorded by exempt employees and non-

exempt employees, respectively.   

 

We monitor the training needs and 

progress of our employees on regular 

basis; this helps them to take ownership of 

their career development.  

 

Occupational Health and Safety 

 

We believe that our employees deserve a 

safe workplace environment. We have a 

workplace health and safety committee to 

promote health and safety initiatives and 

programmes. The committee comprises of 

management and employee 

representatives who work together to 

identify any health and safety issues in the 

workplace, develop and implement 

corrective and preventive action plan.  

 

The committee also holds meetings on a 

regular basis and provides 

recommendations to improve health, 

safety and working conditions at ASTI. We 

also have established processes to 

measure and monitor our occupational 

health and safety performance.  

 

We maintain standard operating 

procedures for our operations to ensure 

safe work practices. We also provide 

emergency response training to our 

employees and regular health &amp; safety 

training. It helps our employees and 

contractors from accidents, injuries and 

health hazards in low risk areas. In case of 

high risk areas, they are able to identify 

the common hazards by themselves and 

implement measures to prevent the 

hazards. All our employees and 

contractors comply with standard safety 

practices and requirements that are listed 

in our safety handbook.  

 

We carry out regular maintenance and 

quality check of our machines, equipment 

and work areas within our premises for 

any health and safety risks. Our health &amp; 

safety team conducts safety drills to 

identify any potential hazards and to 

monitor the effectiveness of local risk 

control implemented.  

 

 

Fire drills are conducted twice a year in 

order to ensure that our employees are 

familiar with emergency procedures 

during a fire. During our fire drills, all 

employees and contractors are trained to 

identify and operate fire extinguishers 

placed in various locations within our 

premises. Regular inspections on fire 

extinguishers are conducted and signed 

off. We have displayed emergency 

evacuation plan in our premises which is 

visible to all our employees and occupants. 

They are instructed to follow the 

evacuation plan during an emergency 

situation.  

 

We have put in place measures to reduce 

noise and air pollution within and outside 

our manufacturing plants. For example, 

compressed air guns in our manufacturing

regular maintenance and inspections of 

the compressors are carried out in order 

to cut noise and air pollution. We have 

displayed signage to use Personal 

Protective Equipment (PPEs) to prevent

noise areas. There were zero reported 

workplace fatalities and zero major 

accidents among our employees in 

FY2018. We hereby achieved our target 

set for zero workplace fatalities/injuries in 

FY2018. 

 

Our Value chain 

Supplier Assessment 

 

Our suppliers form an important part of 

our value chain as they contribute to our 

sustainability goals and business success.  

 

We understand the importance of 

maintaining transparency in our value 

chain. We carry out due diligence of all our 

suppliers based on our strict requirements 

in terms of sustainable practices, quality 

and pricing. During our due diligence 

process, we ensure that our suppliers 

deliver top-quality raw materials and 

products. The suppliers who work with us 

have to abide by our values and standards 

and conduct their business in an ethical, 

legal and sustainable manner. Our 

suppliers are also required to meet the 

requirements of relevant laws and 

regulations.  

 

We continuously monitor and update our 

supplier selection process and ensure that 

only the best raw materials are used in the 

production process. Our current suppliers 

of raw materials for our production of 

equipment are monitored on a regular 

basis based on their performance. Any 

supplier that fails to meet the expected 

quality and delivery requirement is 

removed from the list of raw material 

suppliers.  

 

In FY2018, no new suppliers were 

engaged, and therefore evaluated in terms 

of their ability to supply materials 

according to our requirements. As per the 

target set for FY2018, we ensured that all 

our suppliers complied with the 

requirements of the Quality Management 

System ISO 9001:2015. 

 

We require our suppliers to comply with 

the Restriction of Hazardous Substances 

(RoHS) Directive, which includes a CE-

marking directive. 

 

Our Governance 

We strongly believe that our ability to 

uphold the highest ethical standards of 

compliance, transparency, and business 

conduct translates our trust in our 

stakeholders which is in line with our 

values. We have a robust governance 

structure, sound policies and monitoring 

system which ensure this trust intact in 

our stakeholders.

Comply with Laws and Regulations  

 

Compliance with the applicable laws and 

regulations forms one of the most 

important pillars for sustainable growth 

and is an essential component of 

corporate governance in any organization.  

 

Our reputation is what it is today because 

we strive to comply with relevant laws, 

including environmental laws and 

socioeconomic regulations by having 

various procedures and risk management 

standards in place. We ensure that all our 

employees adhere to company’s values so 

as to act with integrity and conduct 

business in accordance with the highest 

ethical standards. We successfully met our 

target to achieve zero incidents of non-

compliance related to ESG regulatory 

requirements. 

 

Ensuring Environmental Compliance  

 

Environmental laws in Singapore manage 

externalities caused by air, water, land and 

noise pollution. We are committed to 

complying with all applicable laws and 

regulations and maintain licence to 

operate in all our locations. Our sites in 

Singapore are subjected to environmental 

laws and regulations set by the National 

Environmental Agency (NEA), the Public 

Utilities Board (PUB) and the Singapore 

Civil Defence Force (SCDF). We keep 

ourselves updated with any new 

regulations on environmental compliance 

which is applicable to our business, so that 

we identify and manage our regulatory 

risks beforehand. 

 

In FY2018, there were no incidents of non-

compliance with environmental laws and 

regulations.  

 

Anti- Corruption  

 

At ASTI, we do not allow any all of bribery 

and corruption which leads to dishonest 

business practices such as conflict of 

interests, accepting gifts, insider 

information etc. We have robust policies 

around anti-corruption and all our 

employees are required to abide by the 

Code of Conduct and policies on 

corruption within the Group. During 

employee orientation, all employees go 

through mandatory induction programme, 

where they are briefed on Code of 

Conduct, which includes information on 

workplace ethics and the whistle-blowing 

policy.  

 

We encourage our employees to raise 

their concerns regarding suspected fraud, 

corruption, dishonest practices or other 

similar matters in a very secured and 

responsible manner. Any suspicious 

practices or inappropriate activities in the 

workplace are reported immediately by 

our workforce to the Head of Human 

Resources (“HR”) and/or any member of 

the Executive Committee in a fair, 

respectful and timely manner. We take 

disciplinary action on the employee who is 

found guilty of fraud, dishonesty or 

criminal conduct.  

 

In FY2018, there were zero incidents of 

non-compliance with anti-corruption laws 

and socioeconomic regulations.

How We Wrote This Report 

Our second Sustainability Report 

summarises sustainability practices and 

performance for the period of 1 January to 

31 December 2018 (“FY2018”). ASTI 

provides Tape &amp; Reel packaging services

and component distributors globally. 

Based in Singapore, the Group has 2 

research and development centres and 8 

factories. Our operations are located in 

Southeast Asia, Greater China, the United 

States of America and the United Kingdom.

Singapore as they are currently the most 

material to the ASTI.

Sustainability Governance 

Our sustainability strategy is in its second 

year and is headed by our Sustainability 

Steering Committee (SSC). SSC provides 

strong direction coupled with an effective 

sustainability governance framework to 

identify, assess and manage the 

environmental, social and governance 

(ESG) issues that are important to us and 

our stakeholders. 

 

Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) 

SSC is represented by senior members of 

the Administration, Finance, Human 

Resources and Information Technology 

divisions at ASTI. SSC provides advice and 

assistance to the Board in ensuring that 

policies and procedures in relation to ESG 

issues are aligned with ASTI’s business 

strategy. The SSC is supported by a 

Sustainability Task Force (STF), which is 

responsible for driving sustainability 

initiatives and programmes across ASTI.

Monitoring and Benchmarking 

We monitor and evaluate our 

sustainability performance against our 

peer companies in order to improve our 

own performance and to identify areas of 

improvement. We conduct a review of our 

approach to sustainability from the 

identified gaps as compared to our peer 

group so that we are in a better position to 

execute targeted actions to address the 

gaps.  

 

Stakeholder Engagement 

 

Our sustainability efforts are focused on 

the key areas of concern for our 

stakeholders and to us, such that we are 

able to continue as a sustainable business. 

Through regular meetings with 

stakeholders, we better understand the 

ESG issues that may be of most concern to 

them. Our approach to stakeholder 

engagement is as follows:


                                                                                                                        Sustainability Report FY2018
