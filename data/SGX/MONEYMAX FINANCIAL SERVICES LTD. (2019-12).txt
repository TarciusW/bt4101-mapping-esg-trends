HEADQUARTERED in Singapore, 

MoneyMax Financial Services Ltd. 

(“MoneyMax” or the “Company”, 

and together with its subsidiaries, the 

“Group”) is a leading pawnbroker, retailer 

and trader of pre-owned luxury items. 

Since establishing its first store in 2008, 

the Group has evolved and expanded its 

network to 71 outlets, making it one of 

the largest pawnbroking chains with a 

presence in both Singapore and Malaysia. 

In 2013, we were listed on the Catalist 

Board of the Singapore Exchange 

Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”).

As a customer-centric and innovative 

company, the Group is constantly 

exploring new opportunities to enhance 

customer experience and service 

standards in the pawnbroking industry. 

In 2015, the Group launched MoneyMax 

Online, making it Singapore’s first 

pawnbroking chain to offer customers an 

online platform to shop, sell and appraise 

their valuables. Subsequently, in 2016, 

the Group introduced a new 916 Love 

Gold jewellery collection in all its outlets 

to offer customers a wider variety of 

gold and jewellery in addition to pre-

owned offerings. The Group developed 

and rolled out the Peppa Pig jewellery 

collection, its first intellectual property 

(IP) jewellery series and the first-of-its-

kind in ASEAN in 2018.

As part of its efforts to expand its markets 

and services, MoneyMax made its maiden 

foray into the People’s Republic of China 

(“PRC”) in 2016 via a joint venture to 

provide financial leasing services in 

Chongqing, PRC. In 2017, the Group 

entered into a joint venture collaboration 

with Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed Aucnet 

Inc., to jointly develop Singapore’s 

first online LIVE business-to-business 

(“B2B”) auction platform, focusing on

luxury branded merchandise, and gold 

and diamond goods. In 2018, the Group 

ventured into the automotive financial 

services industry providing a one-stop 

solutions for automotive ownership 

services through MoneyMax Leasing and 

MoneyMax Assurance Agency. In 2019, 

MoneyMax expanded its online presence 

into Shopee and Lazada marketplaces, 

enabling its jewellery products to reach 

new target audiences.

MoneyMax has also won multiple awards 

from the coveted Singapore Prestige 

Brands Award (SPBA), including Overall 

Winner Award (Promising Brands – 

2013) and The Most Popular Brand 

Award (Established Brands – 2015), and 

has been inducted into its prestigious 

Hall of Fame in 2015. In early 2020, 

MoneyMax was named by The Straits 

Times as “Singapore’s Fastest Growing 

Companies 2020”.

Sustainable Growth At  

MoneyMax

MONEYMAX considers sustainability 

as a critical factor to our long-term 

growth. In our third sustainability 

report (“Report”), for the financial 

year from 1 January 2019 to 31 

December 2019 (“FY2019”), we 

highlight key developments and 

achievements relating to the economic, 

environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) factors that are material to our 

stakeholders.

The key expectations of our respective 

stakeholders are major considerations 

which our Group takes into account when 

formulating our business strategies. 

This ensures that our Group is 

able to optimise our financial and 

human capital resources in a manner 

that generates growth that will be 

sustainable in the long term. We have 

also placed focus on innovation and 

digitalisation to further automate 

processes.

Board Statement

As the Group moves to 

integrate sustainable  

business models into our 

existing paradigms, we 

will continue to focus on 

creating greater value  

for our stakeholders 

through innovation.”

Sustainability Report 2019

ON behalf of our board of directors of  

the Company (“the Board”), we 

are pleased to present the Group’s 

Sustainability Report 2019 to our 

stakeholders. This Report encapsulates 

the Group’s overarching strategy to 

achieving sustainable growth, as well as 

providing greater insight and updates to 

the material ESG matters that the senior 

management, in tandem with the Board, 

have identified and overseen on our 

pathway to sustainable growth.

2019 was fraught with an unpredictable 

and challenging global economic 

landscape with the US-China trade 

tensions, volatile gold prices and 

a general weakening of consumer 

sentiment creating uncertainties across 

the markets that the Group operates in. 

Amidst these headwinds, many of our 

colleagues have rose to the challenge 

that 2019 brought, showing remarkable 

resilience and aptitude.

In this Report, we are excited to share 

the progress that the Group has made 

in relation to the main tenets that we 

have identified for sustainable growth 

in our Report.

Sustainable Economic Growth

Diversification is a key strategy that 

the Group has identified in its pathway 

to sustainable economic growth. The 

Group has a hybrid business model 

that is formulated on 2 core businesses; 

a secured lending business through its 

pawnbroking entities and a high revenue, 

high churn business through its luxury 

retail arm. With the businesses serving 

different cyclical needs of consumers, 

the Group hopes to reduce the impact 

of seasonal and cyclical changes during 

these uncertain times.

Innovation and brand equity enhance-

ment remain as the crucial drivers of 

sustainable economic growth for our 

businesses. In 2019, the Group placed 

a spotlight on collaboration with global 

MoneyMax Financial Services Ltd.  3


Maintaining A Diverse And 

Progressive Workplace

As highlighted in our Report, the Group 

places a strong emphasis in building a 

work environment that is both inclusive 

and diverse. This is essential for us 

to continue attracting and retaining 

talented employees. Amongst others, 

gender diversity is a key pillar to our 

efforts to create an inclusive workforce. 

In FY2019, women formed 73% of our 

workforce, up from 69% in FY2018.

Community

The Group maintains a key awareness on 

the need to give back to the communities 

in which we operate in. As part of our 

corporate social responsibility efforts, 

the Group embarked on year-long 

community outreach program in 

conjunction with Radin Mas CCC CDWF 

for needy families in the housing estates 

of Radin Mas, Telok Blangah and Redhill. 

Beyond simply monetary contributions, 

this program provided an invaluable 

opportunity for our colleagues to form 

actual bonds with the communities at 

large.

The Group remains steadfast in our 

commitment to grow our businesses in 

a sustainable and responsible manner.

The Board recognises the significance 

of structuring the organisation and 

its businesses in a manner that allows 

for economic growth to be achieved 

sustainably, and continues to work 

closely with the management to monitor 

and oversee ESG matters that have been 

identified as being material to the Group 

and its respective stakeholders.

With the global outlook becoming 

increasingly uncertain, the Group 

will look to consistently strengthen 

its fundamentals to ensure the 

competitiveness of its businesses in 

the long run. As the Group moves to 

integrate sustainable business models 

into our existing paradigms, we will 

continue to focus on creating greater 

value for our stakeholders through 

innovation.

We would like to take this opportunity 

to thank our colleagues for the hard 

work that they have put in throughout 

2019, as well as to thank the respective 

stakeholders of the Group for their 

continued support and guidance through 

the years.









brands. Identifying the exponential 

potential of the Peppa Pig series for 

instance, our teams have worked 

tirelessly to secure an exclusive regional 

license to design, manufacture and retail 

Peppa Pig styled jewellery in our stores. 

Being A Trusted Financial 

Solutions Provider

The Group also identified a potential 

market in the motor vehicle financing 

industry. In line with our mandate to 

provide service offerings in asset backed 

financing, the Group decided to venture 

into the industry in 2019.

Through identifying and focusing on the 

existing pain points of the automotive 

industry, we were able to quickly 

establish a foothold in the industry by 

providing convenient and transparent 

consumer experiences. 

As part of the Group’s ongoing 

commitment to put in place robust 

anti-money laundering and counter 

financing of terrorism framework, we are 

also pleased to share that we have put in 

place a series of measures for our second 

hand retail business in accordance to the 

prevailing regulations.

Sustainable Economic Growth 

OUR Group continued to build on our 

capabilities and market reach as well 

as making foray into new markets. We 

expanded into auto financing market 

and introduced more new varieties for 

our jewellery and gold collection.  

In line with our long term strategy to 

enhance our brand equity, the Group 

seeks partnerships and collaborations 

with global brands on an international 

stage. Riding on the global wave of 

the popularity of the Peppa Pig series 

for instance, the Group renewed the 

exclusive license to design, manufacture 

Sustainability Report 2019

and retail Peppa Pig styled jewellery 

in our stores. Being first-of-its kind 

in the ASEAN region, the Peppa Pig 

series demonstrated how a strong 

global partnership, coupled with a keen 

awareness of prevailing consumer trends, 

allows the Group to reach and connect 

with younger customer demographics. 

In 2019, our Group expanded into the 

motor vehicle financing industry with 

MoneyMax Leasing, providing a one-stop 

financing solution for vehicle owners.  

We pride ourselves on offering fast 

financial services to customers in need of 

a helping hand. It is the one step solution 

for car owners with its smart financing 

and hassle free service for its customers. 

Aside from offering Certificate of 

Entitlement (COE) loans for numerous 

MoneyMax Financial Services Ltd.  9

car owners across the country, we also 

offer loans for new and used cars, and 

have further strengthened our leasing 

business through our dealers’ network. 

Together with MoneyMax Assurance 

Agency, we believe the Group will transit 

into a leading financial solutions provider 

providing a suite of products to cater 

to our customers in different markets. 

This new business targets customers 

who are looking for an extensive range 

of insurance coverage for motor, home 

and travel needs.

These initiatives allow us to enhance our 

services we can offer to our customers 

and expand our business reach in existing 

and new markets. We strive to remain 

innovative and stay relevant with rapid 

changes in consumers’ preferences. We 

will continue to focus efforts on driving 

new service innovations and business 

offerings so as to generate new revenue 

streams and deliver sustainable growth. 

This is critical for us to maintain our 

competitive edge and continue to deliver 

sustainable growth in view of the weaker 

consumer sentiments and uncertain 

post-Covid19 economic outlook.

Our Group recorded better results for 

FY2019 as compared to the financial year 

ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”) with 

increased revenue of S$182.2 million and 

higher profit before tax of S$12.6 million.

performance of MoneyMax for FY2019,

Group Businesses

Pawnbroking

THE provision of pawnbroking services 

remains as the core of our Group’s 

operations. To cater to the needs of our 

consumers, our Group has outlets located 

in highly accessible areas in Singapore 

and Malaysia. Our outlets also operate 

longer operating hours to cater to the 

schedules of our consumers. As at 31 

December 2019, we have a network of 

71 pawnbroking outlets in Singapore and 

Malaysia, making us one of the largest 

pawnbroking chains in the region.

The availability of pawnbroking services 

provides an alternative source of short-

term financing that is convenient and 

lawful. Our Group extends loans to our 

pawners on a pre-determined loan to 

value ratio that is based on the valuation 

of their collateral assets (“pledges”). 

These pledges are often items such as 

gold jewellery, diamonds, gemstones, 

timepieces and other luxury items. 

To ensure security of our pledges, our 

outlets are equipped with advanced 

security systems and storage facilities, 

and are kept under round-the-clock 

surveillance. Our Group also engages 

an independent external security 

firm to constantly monitor our alarm 

systems. The pledges of our pawners 

are insured in accordance with the 

regulatory requirements of the Registry 

of Pawnbrokers.

Our Group made a concerted effort in 

FY2019 to invest significant resources into 

upgrading our existing capabilities on our 

Group’s digital transformation roadmap. 

In 2018, our Group launched an online 

platform for our pawnbroking customers 

to renew their pawn tickets without 

having to visit our stores in person. As at 

end 2019, we continue to see a significant 

uptake in our e-Renewal services as our 

Group expands the payment options 

available. Our Group also placed a heavy 

emphasis on its digital marketing and 

customer relations management systems 

with the aim of providing seamless, on 

demand services to our customers. 

Our Group is governed by and strictly 

adheres to the prevailing laws under the 

Pawnbrokers Act 2015 and the directions 

of the Registrar of Pawnbrokers for our 

*Pictures shown are for illustrative purposes only, and are not a representation of the respective brands.





pawnbroking business in Singapore as 

well as Pawnbrokers Act 1972 for our 

pawnbroking business carried out in 

Malaysia.

Retail

Aside from the pawnbroking business, 

our Group is building on our retail and 

trading business for luxury products. 

Our operations comprise the retail 

and trading of new and pre-owned 

luxury products such as gold, jewellery, 

timepieces and handbags. Leveraging 

on our pawnbroking business, the 

retail and trading of new and pre-

owned luxury items expand on our 

Group’s core competencies of retail 

outreach, customer-centric service 

and valuation expertise to increase our 

range of products and services. We have 

digitalised our services so that consumers 

can access our 3-in-1 online platform 

to shop, sell and appraise valuables. 

We have also expanded our customer 

outreach through established online 

platforms such as Lazada and Shopee 

as well as further improved our online 

store offerings.

MoneyMax is committed to managing 

and minimising the impact of our 

business operations along with our 

supply chain. The supply chain for our 

retail and trading business is primarily 

made up of manufacturers and second-

hand luxury goods dealers. We source 

our products globally across Asia, the 

Middle East and Europe.

We consistently engage our suppliers 

through strict quality control inspections, 

authentication checks by our trained 

employees and evaluations of the items 

to ensure the quality of our products. 

Aside from being a luxury products 

retailer, MoneyMax also creates value 

for customers by providing an avenue 

for them to sell their pre-owned items 

to us.

Our industry is regulated under the 

Pawnbrokers Act 2015, the Pawnbroking

we are governed by the Catalist Rules,

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-FRAUD

Anti-Corruption And Anti-Fraud

Our Group upholds a strict policy against 

dishonest and corrupt practices and 

ensures that all business functions are 

aware of the code of conduct and ethical 

business practices in every jurisdiction 

and industries that we operate. We 

understand that corruption and fraud will 

bring negative effects to the company 

including financial losses, reputation loss 

and criminal punishment. Our Group 

places heavy emphasis on ethical business 

practices which prohibits payment of 

bribes and acceptance of inappropriate 

gifts, amongst others. We strive towards 

upholding professional values and 

integrity when conducting business.

Our audit committee (“AC”) formed by 

our 3 independent directors oversees 

our Group’s internal controls and risk 

management systems. We have a 

whistle-blowing policy through which 

employees may, in confidence, raise 

concerns regarding matters such 

as misconduct, unlawful activities, 

suspected fraud and other dishonest 

activities to an email account which 

can be accessed by selected personnel 

only. When necessary, an independent 

investigation will be arranged to follow 

such incidents and appropriate follow-up 

actions carried out by the AC Chairman. 

The AC will subsequently report to 

the Board on such matters. Details 

of our whistle-blowing policies and 

arrangements are made readily available 

to all employees. Our Group is pleased 

to share that no whistle-blowing reports 

were received for FY2019 (2018: Nil).

Our Group has established policies 

in relation to dealing in securities and 

interested person transactions, which are 

disclosed in the Corporate Governance 

section in our annual report for FY2019. 

As part of the principal functions of the 

Board in assuming responsibility for 

corporate governance, our corporate 

governance practices are reviewed by 

the Board annually.  

As part of the ongoing efforts to 

strengthen our Group’s efforts against 

dishonest and corrupt practices, we 

target to engage our business partners 

on initiation and, as and when necessary,  

communicate our existing whistle 

blowing policies and arrangements in 

which they may raise any concerns in 

relation to such practices.

We have a Code of Conduct and 

behavioural standards outlined in our 

Employee Handbook, which all our 

employees are required to adhere 

to. Our Group takes a serious view 

of unethical conduct or malpractice 

in relation to corruption or fraud and 

formal disciplinary proceedings will be 

conducted where necessary.  Training 

on business ethics and conduct 

is regularly held during training 

sessions and meetings to reinforce the 

procedures for reporting any potential 

violations. 

There were no reported incidents of 

corruption or fraud for FY2019.

DATA PRIVACY





Our Group has implemented stringent 

data protection policies and procedures 

in compliance with the PDPA, which 

define the methods of handling personal 

data. Robust security procedures are in 

place to enforce data privacy. We have 

appointed a Data Protection Officer who 

is responsible for the following:  

• including aspects of PDPA compliance 

when developing and implementing 

policies and processes for handling 

personal data;

• fostering a data protection culture 

among employees and communicating 

personal data protection policies to 

stakeholders;

• managing personal data protection 

related queries and complaints within 

the Company;

• alerting management to any risks that 

might arise with regard to personal 

data; and

• liaising with the PDPC on data 

protection matters, if necessary.

Our employees are contractually obliged 

to keep all information communicated 

to them confidential. Our Group has in 

place procedures limiting data access 

rights of our employees commensurating 

with their scope of work as a measure 

to manage data privacy risk. These 

include password authorisation by levels 

of responsibility for access to sensitive 

data and printing out of listings and 

other records. 

In 2019, our Group has enforced our 

procedures and policies through the 

following improvements:

• Increased frequency of review of 

access rights to data from annual to 

biannual

• Engagement of external professional 

company to dispose sensitive 

documents

• Creation of restricted access areas for 

storage of confidential documents

• Increased audits for outlets for PDPA 

considerations

• Set up of notices to inform customers 

of PDPA compliance actions such 

as consented CCTV recordings 

and use of personal identification 

documents

• Compliance with the new regulations 

and guidelines for collection, use, 

disclosure and retention of NRIC or 

other identification documents

O u r m a n ag e m e nt tea m h ave 

undergone 24 hours of detailed 

training including development and 

planning of policies and procedures 

on Privacy Data Management by an 

external professional firm. A total of 

150 employees including management, 

retail staff and backend administrative 

support have also completed 3 hours 

of basic training to handle personal 

data received from customers in daily 

operations. 

All data is stored securely in the data 

center, which is maintained offsite with 

restricted access. Information such as 

those from online transactions with 

sensitive personal data transmitting 

are encrypted to prevent unauthorised 

access to read and modify any information 

transferred. Staff in the workplace are 

trained on how to identify confidential 

information and treat this information 

according to the PDPA guidelines. 

We are required to store our pawn 

documents for a period of 5 years. 

The physical documents are stored 

in our warehouse where there is 

restricted access.  In line with the PDPA 

requirements, we are in the process of 

identifying and formalising the process of 

appointing a third party service provider 

for the proper disposal of the physical 

documents.       

In FY2019, there were no substantiated 

complaints from customers or regulatory 

bodies concerning breaches of customer 

privacy from customers or regulatory 

authorities and identified losses of 

customer data across the outlets.

CONSUMER EXPERIENCE AND PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY

Social

 

Consumer Experience and 

Product Responsibility 

As a customer-centric organisation, 

we aim to fulfill customers’ needs 

seamlessly and prioritise service quality. 

To enhance customer experience and 

build relationships, we have a few 

customer feedback platforms in place 

via our MoneyMax Jewellery facebook 

page, email, in-store customer feedback 

forms and our telephone service hotline, 

which are managed by our Customer 

Service staff to ensure customers queries 

are followed up as timely as possible. We 

also periodically analyse the feedback 

received to understand customers’ 

viewpoints and concerns.  

As every interaction counts, MoneyMax 

continued to build on development 

of our customer experience through 

focused customer service trainings 

conducted for our retail employees and 

continued analysis of results obtained 

from our customer feedback platforms. 

179 retail employees have undergone 

in-house authentication and valuation 

training sessions in relation to the 

goods and services provided at our 

outlets. In addition, approximately 10 

customers participated and provided 

their feedback on their experience in 

our outlets. In FY2019, we have a case 

of a customer lodging a complaint with 

the Small Claims Tribunal, related to 

a request to redeem a collateral with 

an expired pawn ticket. The case was 

amicably resolved. 

Risk Management 

Our management regularly reviews 

our Group’s procedures in accordance 

with the Enterprise Risk management 

framework. This framework ensures that 

our management is able to systematically 

identify risks, determine the probability 

and impact of each risk, assess the 

appropriateness of the existing risk 

controls, and implement additional risk 

controls where necessary. 

Our management holds ad-hoc meetings 

and discussions to analyse and evaluate 

the risks involved in our business 

processes and industry. To further 

manage the risks faced, our internal risk 

and compliance team conducts regular 

ad-hoc inspections on our outlets and is 

kept abreast on updates and changes in 

the aspect of regulatory requirements. 

They also assist in reviews of incidents 

of suspected misconduct or other 

matters as directed by our management.  

The internal risk and compliance team 

reports to our management on a regular 

basis on their findings. The information 

gathered provides current data to 

our management and facilitates the 

identification and mitigation of any risks 

that may arise.

organisation of numerous activities 

and programmes organised by our

(“CSR”) team.

During FY2019, the Group had

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Environmental

Waste Management &amp; 

Recycling

MONEYMAX conducts its business in 

a sustainable manner through energy 

efficient practices and adhering 

to the principles of “Reduce, Re-

use and Recycle”. The 3Rs aim to 

effectively minimise waste produced 

and to conserve precious metals or other 

materials for future use.

As part of our business processes, 

we purchase pre-owned items as an 

alternative source for disposal and 

reduce wastage. We have these items 

undergo professional refurbishment to 

offer them a second lease on live. We 

also find ways to recycle items beyond 

refurbishment and aged inventory . One 

way is by selling these gold items to third 

party refineries which are recycled for 

production of new gold bars. In FY2019, 

we purchased a total of 1,142 kg of pre-

owned gold, of which 685 kg was sold 

to refineries for recycling.  

In FY2018, our Group implemented the 

following policies which aim to reduce 

the amount of waste produced, and 

which we remained committed to in 

FY2019. Our Group will work to remain 

to be committed to in FY2020:

• By encouraging our employees to print 

double-sided instead of single-sided in 

our workplaces

• By encouraging the submission 

of e-reports to the management 

and moving towards a paperless 

environment

• By encouraging the recycling/reuse 

of used materials wherever possible  

Environmental Compliance

MoneyMax recognises the need for 

growth to be environmentally sustainable. 

Our Group ensures our policies and 

practices will optimise the management of 

resources such as energy, water and other 

areas of concern like waste management 

within our Group. MoneyMax stays 

committed to improving our carbon 

footprint from our operations and work 

towards building a cleaner environment 

in future. Our Group is pleased to report 

that there were no reports/incidences of 

non-compliance with environmental laws 

and regulations for FY2019.
