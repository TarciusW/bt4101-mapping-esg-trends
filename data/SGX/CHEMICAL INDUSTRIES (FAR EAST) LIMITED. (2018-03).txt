Our Mission

Our Vision

This Report

Chemical industries Far East ltd “CIL“ hopes 

to give our customers the best value. With 

a combination of our core competencies 

of 

manufacturing, 

logistical 

efficiency, 

safe procedures and reliability. With these 

advantages, we aim to be the local supplier. 

In our first ever Sustainability report, we are 

hoping to achieve compliance with the GRI 

G4 guidelines within  5 years. 

This report has not recieved External 

assurance.  

 

To be able to supply basic and industrial 

chemicals to the region in a manner that is 

safe, sustainable and efficient. 

Since 1964, CIL has grown from supplying Chlorine to local waterworks with chlorine to being 

the local supplier of choice for all the chemicals we produce. As the Singapore Exchange 

releases the “comply or explain“ sustainability framework, we are confident that the current 

systems to that have been in place since our incorporation will ensure our future. 

The Board is committed to oversee the company’s initiatives where Environmental, Social 

and Governance “ESG” factors are concerned.  The Board evaluated the internal and external 

engagement with stakeholder to identify key factors to be revealed in our first report. We 

are also confident that with our oversight, the Report will be in full compliance in with GRI 

G4 guidlines within 5 years.

About CIL

CIL continues to be the sole manufacturer of chlorine, caustic soda and other chlor-

alkaline products in Singapore, as we have been since 1963. CIL was established as 

a pioneer industry to underpin the industrialization, and to-date remains the prime 

supplier of basic chemicals to the petro-chemical, pharmaceutical, electronics and 

water-treatment industries. In 1999, we erected a new chlor-alkali plant employing 

membrane technology on Singapore’s Jurong Island. 

Our HQ is located at No.3 Jalan Samulun Road, Singapore 629127. This location also 

acts as a back up storage and continuity site for the business. 





1

Chlorine is produced as the main product of our 

Chlor alkali facilities. This is used mainly in basic 

chemical processes as well as in the semi 

conductor, industrial and Water treatment 

industries.

3

Hydrochloric Acid is one of two 

derivatives of chlorine that is use for 

fertilizers, waste water treatment and other 

industrial processes.

We have, our main subsidiary, Chem Trans-

port pte ltd to handle all logistics locally. 

Our main feedstock come from multiple 

sources with redundancies to ensure 

supply.

We have an in house lab to run tests on a 

daily basis to ensure quality and consistency.

We provide piping systems to big off takers 

on Jurong island for OSH &amp; environment 

reasons.

We use dedicated ISO tankers to bring our 

product to our customers.

Our principle of in house management 

ensure that our supply chain is unbroken.

2

Sodium Hydroxide commonly refered to as Caustic 

Soda is the main by product of Chlorine and is an 

openly sold commodity on the market. It is 

used by almost every plant on Jurong island 

in differing quantities but its use for PH 

balancing is almost universal.

4

Sodium Hypochlorite or more commonly 

refered to as Bleach. This product is 

used by many as a water treatment solution 

without the hazardous effects of chlorine      

 

  gas.

E1 Corporate Social Responsibility

We have collaborated with Nanyang 

Technological University on the use of  

Hydrogen to test fuel Cell technologies 

in hopes of creating a Energy from Waste 

like project. Field tests were successful 

and the project was a basis for additional 

funding from the government to allow the 

research teams to contnue their work.

•    With regards to reputational risk. One can never know when public opinion is 

turned onto hazardous chemicals being produced in country. As such, we 

constantly strive to look for newer ways to resuse energy and cooperate 

with Educational institutes and institues of public characters. We have 

supported public institutions like the Zoo and Bird Park for over 40 years. 



Our Targets

•  To have at least one CSR or public engagement project a year.



•  We take part in Local Bodies like the Singapore Chemical Industry Council, 

and recieve awards for out dedication to our National service contributions.

•  We are a signatory to the Responsbile Care commitment to Sustainability.

E2 Long Term Contracts

We implement self regulating formulas 

with a Cost structure of our production 

factors plus a fixed margin for profitability. 

This functions on a monthly, quarterly and 

annual basis for adjustment depending on 

customers. This allows Chemical Industries 

and its customers to share in cost reductions 

and price hikes together. Most of the indices 

we refer to are publicly available. 

CIL has numerous contracts with other manufacturers and mulitnational corporations. 

Our conservative and long term appproach to bussiness tends to favour long term 

contracts with customers that go over 5 years. Of course pricing structures and cost 

structures tend to change over periods of time and we implement the following 

measures to mitigate the risk these contractual obligations bring with them.

Self regulating formulas

•  Such formulas promote transparency between customer and client. Verifi cation

of such information is generally done through the use of Public Indices 

available to both parties or provided by one for verifcation. In certain situations,

Customers have agreed to alter the structure of the formula with valid

basis  given. These adjustments and  are also available at pre determined

intervals in a contract.                                                 .

Transparency

While these formulas off er very competitive rates for product, they generally ensure 

a fi xed quantity of demands with a take or pay clause. This ensure a “base“ load for 

our production facilities. They also often include an exclusivity clause which ensures 

us being the sole supplier of the products we do supply.

S1 Occupational Safety and Health

•  CIL takes a very strong view to ensure workplace and saefty standards are 

complied with. We also have a zero tolerance policy on safety lapses. We wants 

our employees to work in a safe environment and be secure in the knowledge that 

we take their health and safety seriously.

S2 Customer Satisfaction Survey

•   The loyalty of customers in Singapore should not be taken for granted. The 

ease with which foreign competitors can enter the market with Singapore’s  

free trade status should not be under estimated. We thus hold ourselves to the 

high standards where customer feedback is concerned.

Our Feedback targets

•  Our targets for Feedback and complaints are as follows.

•  Number of complaints and feedback given must be less than 24 per year.

•  Complaints must be replied and resolved within 1 month of recieving them.

•  We aim for a number of compliments at least two times of the complaints re-

cieved in the same period.

Env1 Energy Consumption

•    With the core process of chlorine manufacturing called Electrolysis, we use 

a lot of energy in production. This used to be much higher when Plastic 

producers were still situated in Singapore. With our dedication to lowering 

our Energy consumption, CIL is proud to use advanced technology that uses 

less electricity than most other producers of Chlorine. For competitve  reasons 

we are unable to share the information of our electricity  consumption or costs.

Our Targets

•   To have no accidents that result in casualties with MCs lasting 

more than 3 days. (already accounted for in OSH)

•   To conduct 1 joint exercise with the SCDF every year to simulate 

leaks and response doctrines. 

• With a product as hazardous as chlorine. Spills are a serious concern of ours.

• We are the only manufacturer of the chemicals we produce in Singapore and thus 

are also the subject matter experts. 

• We have transported our chemicals all over the Region without any incidents of note 

for more than 40 years.

Env2 Significant Spill

To mitigate risks associated with spills, the OSH as refered to above ensures that 

safety standards are maintained. We also work closely with local authorities to 

ensure that they know how to respond and mitigate a leak of our products anywhere 

in Singapore. 

As the subject matter expert, we also have our own drills that are conducted with 

our own staff. These are to ensure all Emergency Response Team members are well 

trained and up to date in how to mitigate a leak in a timely manner.
