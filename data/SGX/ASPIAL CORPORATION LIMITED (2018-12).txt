Report FY2018

CORPORATION LIMITED


CEO’S MESSAGE

I am pleased to present our FY2018 Sustainability Report, which provides the 

progress and achievements of our organisation over the previous 12 months, 

focusing on our commitment to working alongside with our valued stakeholders to 

build a sustainable business. 

We believe that building a sustainable business is vital to our continued success and 

that we must be fully accountable for our impact on the environment, our 

customers, our people and our community as well as our company’s financial 

performance. 

The delivery of sustainable results is, however, a critical aspect of our ability to 

remain a strong and financially stable company. Acknowledging this helps to put 

into focus our commitment to the principles laid out in our Corporate Sustainability 

Policy. Our responsibility to the society is to ensure that sustainable practices are 

incorporated into every aspect of our value chain. We must meet the needs not only 

of our customers, employees and the community we operate in, but also those of 

our environment and our future generations.

The Board having considered sustainability issues as part of the Company’s 

strategic formulation, determined the material ESG factors and ensured that the 

management closely monitor them.

This report provides details about how we have fulfilled our responsibilities with 

our key stakeholders during the FY2018 and beyond.

We believe corporate social responsibility is a key driver towards long-term sustainability.

Sustainability Management 

Framework

In July 2017, we took the initiative to establish 

our sustainability reporting framework. We 

performed an analysis on our business and 

operation models as the basis for our 

stakeholder mapping and materiality 

assessment. Through our analysis, we 

identified four key stakeholder groups within 

our sustainability context and their respective 

material issues are to be shown in this report.

Protecting Our Environment for the Future Generations

Reduction of Carbon Footprint

We recognise that the effective management and monitoring 

of its carbon footprint can reduce operating costs and 

pollution. Our carbon footprint is measured in terms of 

Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emission. However, GHG emission 

is an absolute measure of how much carbon dioxide 

equivalent (CO2e) is emitted. Our GHG emission is 

predominantly indirect (Scope 2) emission. We have 

insignificant direct (Scope 1) emission, and we do not 

include the GHG emissions generated by our suppliers 

(Scope 3).

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and 

operations, we have established our GHG emission efficiency 

index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. 

To this end, we have set a target for GHG emission efficiency 

improvement of 23% from our 2017 level by 2030. Our 

target for GHG emission improvement is 2% per year. 

Although various business units account for different 

percentages of GHG emissions across the organisation, they 

all support this target and have aligned accordingly. 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

In FY2018, our GHG emission efficiency index stands at 6.90. In comparison 

to our base year FY2017, it is a 2% improvement, and we are on track 

towards our target by 2030.

Reduction of Paper Consumption

All our employees are urged to minimise paper usage at work by 

adhering to our paperless initiative. 

We encourage all employees to adopt digital documents instead of 

paper documents with an aim to further reduce paper consumption.

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, 

we established our paper consumption index for consistent tracking 

of paper consumption over time. To this end, we have set a target 

for a paper consumption improvement of 23% from our 2017 level 

by 2030. Our target for paper consumption improvement is about 

2% per year. Although various business units account for different 

percentages of paper consumption across the organisation, they all 

support this target and have aligned accordingly. 

In FY2018, we consumed total of 3,425 kg of paper, 100% of which 

are either Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certified, Programme 

for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (“PEFC”) certified or 

ecological responsibility. 

Our Paper consumption index stands at 34.61. In comparison to our 

base year FY2017, it is a 25% improvement, and we are on track 

towards our target by 2030.

Caring for Our Employees

Our Approach

Our people are our most valuable resource and investing 

in their professional development is vital to our business 

sustainability. Our goal is to establish work ethics among 

our employees, which are in line with our core values and 

code of conduct. They are the foundation upon which we 

build all our business initiatives and conduct our day-to-

day activities.  

Our Human Resource (“HR”) management principles and 

policies have been developed and established based on 

fair employment practices with the goal of attracting, 

developing and retaining a motivated workforce. 

Employment Practices

Our employment practices focus on maximising the 

strength of our employees by providing equal 

opportunities based on merits, and helping our employees 

to develop strength through our comprehensive training 

and development programme. 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Aspial Corporation Limited | Sustainability Report FY2018




Communications

As our Company grows, effective communications 

across the organisation are crucial to ensure 

continuous alignment of objectives of the 

employees and the organisational objectives. We 

achieve this through our various communication 

sessions customised based on the target 

employees. Communication sessions for our 

managers are held on a regular basis. 

Agendas covered at these sessions are customised 

appropriate to the target functional scope of the 

managers. 

The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair 

Employment Practices 

We adopt best practices in HR management. Our 

HR practices are guided by the Singapore Tripartite 

Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment 

Practices. The Singapore Tripartite Alliance 

comprises the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore 

National Employers Federation and National 

Trades Union Congress.

Aspial Corporation Limited | Sustainability Report FY2018




Employee Feedback

We value our employees’ expertise in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their 

feedbacks are important in the improvement of overall management and operation of 

the organisation. Through various established processes of employee engagement, 

such as employee objective setting, performance review as well as exit interview in 

cases of resignations, we gather such valuable feedbacks for the continuous 

improvement of our organisation.

In addition, there are other feedback channels for areas specific to business and 

function, such as whistle-blowing policy on control and compliance issues.

Career Development and Training

We recognise that consistent and ongoing 

education is critical to maintaining a 

competitive, skilled, productive and motivated 

workforce. 

In FY2018, each employee received an average 

of 11.1 hours of training. We recognised that 

the training requirements vary depending on 

the levels of management responsibilities. 

Each senior management registered an 

average of 25.0 hours of training, while 

managerial and non-managerial staff received 

an average of 8.2 hours and 13.3 hours of 

training respectively. In light of changing 

business requirements and opportunities in 

variety of training methodologies, we 

continue to revise our training curriculum and 

programme to align with the organisation 

objectives and to strive for effectiveness and 

efficiency in our training approach.

Employee Benefits

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are 

covered by the Employment Act, which provides 

basic employment terms and working conditions 

including contract requirements, remuneration, 

hours of work, overtime, rest days and annual leave 

entitlement. 

Workforce Diversity

In FY2018, 211 of our employees were females, 

comprising 61% of our workforce, while 133 (39%) 

employees were males. In terms of management 

function, 24 females (77%) held managerial positions 

compared to 7 males (23%), while 181 females 

(60%) and 119 males (40%) held non-managerial 

positions. The male to female ratio of managerial and 

non-managerial positions were 7:24 and 119:181 

respectively.

Safety and Health in the Workplace

We are committed to workplace safety and health, and we take 

precautions to prevent occupational injuries among our 

employees. We believe that safe work place conditions boost 

work morale.

Retirement and Healthcare

Our company has presence in various geographic locations 

where there are various local laws and regulations on pension 

and healthcare for employees. Our HR management practices 

comply with applicable laws and regulations in those countries 

we operate. We provide medical coverage for employees. 

Individual Rights

Respecting and protecting basic human rights is fundamental to 

all our operations. 

In FY2018, none of our workforce was covered by a collective 

bargaining agreement; no incidents of forced labour, child labour 

or young workers were identified across the organisation, and 

no human rights-related grievances have been reported.

Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs

Our Approach

Safety in our premises is always our 

priority.

Product Quality and Safety

Reliability and quality of our products are important to us. We have in place a set of key 

quality assurance processes to ensure compliance with international standards. For 

example, the quality of diamond used in our products is subject to stringent external 

assurance processes such as diamond grading by American GEM Society Laboratories 

(AGS), Forevermark (FM), as well as Gemological Institute of America (GIA) on diamond 

grading which represents a technologically advanced diamond and gemstone 

evaluation and provides a blueprint of the gemstone’s attributes and a tangible record 

of its quality.

Data Safety and Privacy

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of great priority to us. We have well established 

Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) Policy to protect the privacy of such sensitive data.

Partnering Our Suppliers

Our Approach

We strive to encourage our suppliers to adopt 

sustainable business practice.

Supplier Selection

We select our key suppliers based on criteria such as quality of products and services, 

competitiveness of pricing and financial health. 

From 2019, we will require our suppliers to disclose their sustainable business practice. 

Although sustainable business practice is not the only criteria, it is one of the key criteria 

in our supplier selection.

Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions 

Direct and indirect CO2 emissions as measured in 

GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2) and 

kilowatt Hours (kWh), from electricity and fuel 

consumed. The electricity and fuel we purchase 

are both from non-renewable sources.

Our business and function grow over time; the 

GHG emissions and electricity consumption vary. 

To ensure consistency and comparability of the 

GHG emission and electricity consumption 

measures over time, we create a GHG emission 

index and electricity consumption index for our 

performance monitoring. The index adjusts the 

GHG emissions and electricity consumption for the 

size of our activities. We normalise the amount of 

GHG emissions and electricity consumption by the 

amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy of 

the size of our activities. The GHG emission index 

is measured in t-CO2 per SGD million and the 

electricity consumption index is measured in kWh 

per SGD million.

Paper Consumption

We capture the data for paper 

consumption by number of reams of 

paper used where one ream is 

equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To 

ensure consistency and comparability 

across various paper sizes, such as A3 

and A4 papers, we measure the paper 

consumption by the weight of paper 

used which is adjusted for the various 

sizes and quality of papers.

Our business and function grow over 

time and the paper consumption 

patterns vary. We devise a paper 

consumption index for our performance 

monitoring. The index adjusts the paper 

consumption for the size of our 

activities. We normalize the amount of 

weights of paper consumed by the 

amount of our revenues which we use 

as a proxy of the size of our activities. 

The paper consumption index is 

measured in kilograms per SGD million.
