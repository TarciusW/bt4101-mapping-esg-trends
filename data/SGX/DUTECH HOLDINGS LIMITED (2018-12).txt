HISTORY AND ORIGIN

Dutech was originally the first Heat Ex-changer Manufacturer in China, established in 1958 and

supplied parts to Shanghai Diesel Engine Corp. Over the years, our business extended to auto parts,

precision instruments and fire-proof commercial safes. The Group was listed on the Main board of the

Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (‘SGX-ST’) on 2 August, 2007.

SAFE BUSINESS EXPANSION

The Group grew into a global leading manufacturer of high security UL- and CEN-certified products

through the international acquisitions of Format Tresorbau Beteiligungs GmbH in 2011 and Deutsche

Mechatronics GmbH in 2014.

BUSINESS TRANSITION

Afterwards, we continued to acquire Krauth Technology GmbH in 2015 and Metric Group Limited in

2016. Additionally, we established Almex GmbH and started to design and manufacture intelligent

terminals including Ticketing and Vending Machines (“TVM”) and parking machines.

Through global acquisition, we transitioned from an original equipment manufacturer into an original

design manufacturer. We invested a large amount into Research and Development (R&amp;D) manpower

and material resources, and grouped our own R&amp;D Team at our Shanghai headquarters in 2017.

NEW MOVE

After 2015, in view of production costs and other factors in global trade, we started to set up overseas

factories in Philippines and Vietnam, which are MMT and Matrix Technologies Co., Ltd. (“MTC”)

respectively. Up to 2018, MMT has started production with annual revenue over RMB11.0 million. MTC

is scheduled to begin operation in 2019.

certification.

We designated a full-time environmental specialist to be responsible for the

Periodic testing and audits are conducted by the environmental specialist to identify

any deficiency in our environmental management system.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

We required all our suppliers to ensure that their

materials comply with the European Parliament

Directive

2011/65/EU,

the

Restriction

of

Hazardous Substances (RoHS), and clearly state

this warranty clause when renewing supplier

contracts.

In order to retain reliable and qualified suppliers,

we make regular performance evaluations of our

suppliers with respect to quality, availability, and

On-Time performance.

According to the performance evaluation, the

number

of

the

qualified

suppliers

in

2018

increased to 1,541, among which 85.7% have

stayed with us for long-term cooperation.

We are always committed to manufacturing products

that deliver a green impact and are compliant with all

the environmental requirements. Since the new

ROHS Directive 2011/65/EU was published in the

Official Journal of the European Union on July 1st ,

2011, we responded rapidly. We worked closely with

our suppliers to collect materials information to

assure the quality of supply.

Internally,

we

also

strictly

controlled

production

processes

by

properly

managing

chemical

substances, reducing hazardous substances in our

products, regularly inspecting finished products. All

inspections have showed that our products are

qualified under the new RoHS.




As a manufacturer, we inevitably create noise, produce waste water, and

emit

polluted

air

with

dust

in

the

production

process.

In

product

development and commercial activities, we take environmental protection

requirements into full consideration.

We strictly observe environmental regulations globally, and aim to create

optimal social, economic, and environmental conditions through innovative

solutions. We continuously seek to provide quality products that minimally

influence the environment, while reducing our environmental footprint in

the production. To minimize the environmental footprint:

NOISE CONTROL

From 2015, we passed all the tests for air and noise emission. Noise is

isolated by moving voice source away from the circumjacent residential

areas, thickening shock pads, and building sound-proof premises.

ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT

WASTE GAS TREATMENT

Each workshop at our plants is equipped with dust removal systems. VOCs was

reduced to 0.06 t/a in 2018 in the emission of waste gas.

SEWAGE TREATMENT

The new sewage treatment station started running before the end of 2018. It

operated well to dispose the sewage with 17 processes, successfully reducing

the concentration of COD, SS and NH3-N in sewage.

As a result of this new system, we are allowed to treat and discharge sewage

automatically instead of outsourcing. The discharge ceiling of sewage was

significantly raised from this year. 100% of the sewage discharged met the

effluent standards from the local authority. The quantity of sewage that met the

effluent standard in 2018 rocketed to 21,051 tons, nearly ten times the quantity of

discharged sewage in 2017. The pollutants contained in sewage were diluted.

We consume a large amount of water, electricity

and natural gas in various forms during daily

production, which will leave some adverse impacts

on environment.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION

In 2018, Electricity Consumption per 10,000 RMB

Output dropped from 41.1KG in 2017 to 35.7KG,

largely due to the replacement of air compressors

in 2018, which results in greater efficiency. It

reduced energy consumption by 5.5% in 2018.

WATER CONSUMPTION

Water

Consumption

per

10,000

RMB

Output

increased to 1,103.3KG in 2018, with an increase

of 16.8% versus that in 2017.

The increase is due to the commissioning of a new

production line for painting at the end of 2018,

which consumed a large amount of water. The

situation for water consumption is expected to

improve in 2019.

China. The others with Bachelor degree and college diploma are the second largest

group, account for thirty percent of total. Most of them are our product engineers and
