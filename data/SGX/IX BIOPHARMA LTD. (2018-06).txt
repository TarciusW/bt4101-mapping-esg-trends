Materiality Assessment 

GRI 102-46 | 102-47 | 103-1 

 

 

 

 

Informed by GRI Standards, iX Biopharma have undertaken 

a detailed process to identify, prioritise and validate the 

environmental, social, governance and economic issues that 

matter most to our organisation. This process had also 

considered our 2017 Sustainability Board Statement as well 

as peer research.  

 

We conducted a materiality assessment workshop with our 

internal stakeholders. They were given a list of material 

sustainability topics identified by peers in their sustainability 

reports as well as working definitions to aid in the 

identification process. This was subsequently assessed for 

relevancy to both our stakeholders and the environment, 

social and governance impact of our business operations.

GRI 103-1| 103-2 | 103-3 | 201-4 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

The Company’s core business is focussed on the 

development and commercialisation of innovative therapies 

for improving the quality of life. This is very much aligned 

with the objectives of the government to develop innovative 

products. We have received recognition and support from 

the government in various ways as mentioned below.  

 

We also believe that because we are provided with 

government support, our activities are creating value for the 

community.  

Our approach to managing  

We have proper practices in place to administer the grants 

and funds received. We consistently provide updates on the 

outcome of the programmes and how the funds were 

utilised to the necessary parties.

Energy 

GRI 103-1| 103-2 | 103-3 | 302-1 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

We are aware of our responsibility towards the 

environment. Our choice of efficient and clean sources of 

energy has the potential to the minimise the impact of our 

operations to the environment. As climate change continues 

to be one of the most pressing global issues, it is our duty 

as responsible corporate citizens to do what we can towards 

the global agenda of protecting our planet.  

 

As we transition from a R&amp;D centric organisation to a 

business that includes manufacturing and supply, we expect 

our environmental foot print to increase accordingly.  

 

 

Our approach to managing  

In our daily operations, electricity, which is used to power our 

office buildings, manufacturing plant and laboratory, contributes 

to the majority of our energy consumption. We use fuel for our 

backup generators, however the consumption is negligible.  

 

We look forward to sourcing for more energy efficiency 

improvements that will help to cultivate good practices across 

our organisation to save energy. We will also seek to invest in 

practical solutions to mitigate and prevent adverse 

environmental impacts.

GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 416-1|416-2 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Our aim at iX Biopharma, is to develop products of highest 

safety and quality standards. 

 

One of our top priorities is the safety and wellbeing of our 

customers. To ensure the quality and safety of our products, 

we have integrated quality standards, procedures and 

monitoring systems across our operations. All of our 

products are continuously assessed for health and safety 

impacts across our value chain. 

 

Our approach to managing  

As a pharmaceutical company, we comply with all relevant and 

material regulations and applicable industrial standards. We 

have incorporated procedures throughout the manufacturing 

process from raw materials sourcing to vigorous product testing. 

 

We have a dedicated Quality Assurance team to ensure that all 

materials used meet the necessary specification for all products. 

Some products undergo clinical trials, where the safety aspects 

are assessed. We have also invested in the implementation of a 

pharmacovigilance monitoring system to handle feedbacks and 

recall events. We have in place an adverse effect management 

programme. 

 

We adhere strictly to government regulations such as 

Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 of Australia, PIC/S Guide to 

Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products, Australian 

Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Veterinary Medicines, 

and Therapeutics Advertising Code. This is made possible by 

having a robust Quality System that is focused on on-going 

monitoring.  Our Quality Assurance team constantly reviews our 

procedures, processes and quality of our products to ensure 

quality and compliance. 

 

We also review our compliance with Therapeutic Goods 

Administration (“TGA”) requirements from manufacturing to 

product and labelling standards for our pharmaceutical and 

nutraceutical products. As at the end of FY2018, we have 

successfully obtained 1 registration and marketing approvals for 

pharmaceutical products and 12 listings of nutraceutical 

products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods 

(“ARTG”), with 5 listings for domestic sales and 7 listings for 

export sales.   

 

As part of our commitment to our customer health and safety, 

we strive to achieve:  

 

zero cases of non-compliance with regulations and/or 

voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of 

products 

 

full assessment of health and safety impacts of all our 

products for improvement

Social 

Training and Workplace Diversity 

GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 404-1 | 405-1 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

We value our employees as the key pillar for our long-term 

success. As an equal opportunity employer, we aspire to be 

the workplace of choice for our staff. We strongly believe in 

being inclusive with regard to hiring policies.  

 

We recognise that our employees are instrumental in the 

success and growth of our Group, and we are dependent 

on the quality and skill of our employees to resolve issues 

raised by our customers. 

 

Our products are very innovative and we view ourselves as 

experts in the field of laboratory testing of pharmaceuticals 

products. This require high-levels of competency and 

qualification in our workforce. Therefore, to provide the 

highest quality service and products, we invest in constant 

training and up-skilling of our employees.

Our approach to managing  

We employ the best talent, without discrimination on the basis 

of race, gender or age. We have policies and practices in place 

to ensure fair hiring and equal opportunity.  

 

Diversity is an integral part of engaging with the communities 

we work in.  While it is important, merit and competency of 

employees is also a key factor for the success of our business. 

We have in place multiple training manuals and systems for all 

our employees. 

 

The training systems ensure that all personnel are trained and 

deemed competent as required by their position description, 

assigned roles and responsibilities, and where a training gap 

exists, a plan is in place to close the gap. 

 

We hope to provide more training opportunities for all our 

employees in the upcoming year.

Social 

Safety, Health and Environment  

GRI 103-1 |103-2 | 103-3 | 403-2 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Our employees are our most valuable asset. Therefore, our 

success depends upon ensuring a safe and conducive work 

environment for them. Our goal is to improve the work 

environment for our people by reducing risks, preventing 

diseases and fostering their physical and psychological well-

being. 

 

We work in an environment where we use delicate 

instruments, which can potentially cause injury if not handled 

properly. At our manufacturing units, we work with active 

ingredients some of which may be highly toxic. In case of lack 

of understanding and awareness, improper management of 

these substances in large volumes can be dangerous for the 

workers and their surroundings. 

 

Our approach to managing  

To ensure the safety of our employees we have put in place 

standard operating procedures.  

 

The Group operates a site-based approach to Safety, Health 

and Environment (“SHE”) to ensure that facilities operate to 

national recognised standards. These include complying with 

government regulations and commitments to continuous 

improvements to health &amp; safety of our workforce at a 

minimum impact to the environment.  

 

A site SHE committee, comprising senior members of 

businesses operating at Croydon site, oversees the 

implementation of policies and work practices, and reviews all 

reportable incidents and actions being taken. It is led by the 

heads of manufacturing and laboratory testing. They are 

responsible for reviewing all reported incidents, access the 

root cause, address safety gaps and ensure corrective as well 

as preventive measures are taken. 

 

The results of the incidents are reviewed monthly during the 

management meeting of respective businesses and quarterly 

at the site with the SHE Committee. 

 

We hope to continuously improve our health and safety 

standards of our workforce to further improve our SHE 

performance.

Innovation 

 

 

 

 

Why is this a material issue? 

Innovation is the cornerstone of the Group and continues to 

be an important driver of future growth. Waferix is a unique 

and versatile drug delivery platform that allows 

pharmacologically active compounds to disintegrate quickly 

under the tongue, reducing the effect of first-pass 

metabolism, and resulting in higher bioavailability, as 

compared to conventional methods of administration.  

 

We have strong R&amp;D capability and collective experience in 

pharmaceutical technology, medicine formulation, clinical 

pharmacology and drug delivery &amp; safety. Our R&amp;D activities 

are vital to our efforts to maintain our competitiveness in the 

industry as well as to further develop better and improved 

products.   

Our approach to managing  

We seek to identify areas of unmet or under-served 

therapeutic need, and focus our research and development 

efforts on formulations of pharmaceuticals aimed at 

addressing such needs.  

 

We continued to advance the clinical trial programme of 

Wafermine, our sublingual ketamine drug for the treatment of 

moderate to severe pain during the year, against a backdrop 

of urgent and growing unmet global need for treatment of 

pain. Researchers have raced to identify viable effective 

analgesics to replace opioid use for the treatment of pain or 

as an adjuvant to opioids to lower the dose of opioids 

administered to patients. Ketamine has now emerged as a 

promising alternative or adjunct to opioids for pain 

management. Not only is ketamine being used more in 

inpatient and outpatient settings to manage pain, ketamine 

has also captured headlines as a possible treatment for severe 

depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome. 

 

Wafesil, a sublingual sildenafil wafer, received marketing 

approval by the TGA in June 2018 and is now registered for 

the treatment of male erectile dysfunction in Australia.  

 

BnoX, our latest product developed for pain management, is 

a sublingual buprenorphine wafer formulated for the 

treatment of moderate to severe pain. With the spotlight 

currently on the global opioid epidemic, there is now an 

increasing recognition that buprenorphine can be a critical 

and emerging compound for pain management. The results 

of BUP001, a Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic study, were published 

in the prestigious American medical journal, Pain Medicine, in 

January 2018. 

 

We believe that our WaferiX drug delivery platform is suitable 

for the development of other products that incorporate active 

pharmacological compounds (other than ketamine, 

buprenorphine, fentanyl and sildenafil) or different dosages.    

 

We strive to combine innovative formulations and delivery 

systems to  produce next-generation nutraceuticals  which 

bring visible and perceptible change to improve our 

customers' health on a cellular level.
