DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

On behalf of the board of directors of Dutech

Holdings Limited (“Dutech” or the “Group”), I am

pleased to present our fourth annual CSR report for

the 2020 financial year from 1st January 2020 to

31st December 2020.

Last year was an unexpected and challenging year for

global citizens and businesses. With our partners,

customers and suppliers being impacted by Covid-19,

Dutech executed a strategy of mobilization and adapted

according to the changing circumstances. We ensured

that our daily operations are kept going, while seeking to

pave a new path in a pandemic-impacted economy.

As a manufacturer, we are aware that our operations

are consuming the social resources that have actual

and potential negative impacts on the environment and

community. But we are confident that we can make the

world a better place by providing more intelligent

solutions to improve everyone’s lives.

SUSTAINABLE INITIATIVES

Sustainability is always being embedded in our long-

term business plan. We strive to achieve a positive

impact on the environment and society as a whole,

while remaining a successful business and increasing

shareholder value.

We subscribe to the notion of Sustainability in all our

business

processes

and

systems

and

believe

sustainability is fundamental to our long term business

development.

Starting in 2019, Dutech continued to optimize collection

channels and computing methods in disclosure, and

presented our sustainability strategies, initiatives and

performance

related

to

environmental,

social

and

governance to our stakeholders in more details within

the whole group. We will continue in our approach to

sustainability

with

four

material

pillars,

including

Environment, People, Economics and Community to

ensure the implementation of the Group’s sustainability

strategy.

COMMITMENT &amp; ASSURANCE

When preparing the report, the Board delegated the

authority

for

daily

management

of

economic

performance, people and environmental topics to the

Sustainability Working Group in Shanghai headquarters

to oversee the sustainability process within the Group

and to ensure the proper and consistent implementation

of the Group’s strategy.

Our Sustainability Working Group continued to work

hard on the assessment of material environmental,

social, and governance (“ESG”) factors, after gathering

all the information from different functions. They have

also

gathered

and

organized

selected

data

and

information from our foreign subsidiaries.

THE BOARD TOOK THE RESPONSIBILITY TO

REVIEW THE REPORT, AS A RESULT, WE CAN

ENSURE HEREIN:

MATERIAL ESG FACTORS - ECONOMICS

Indirect Economic Impacts by Covid-19

&lt;203-2&gt;

The Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented in its global reach and impact,

posing formidable challenges to citizens worldwide and leading to direct

and indirect effects within the interconnected global economy and society.

Economic Impacts

The pandemic brought about, on a global scale, lockdowns, temporary

production suspension, surging shipping costs, complications in trade, and

many more direct and indirect consequences. Against this backdrop,

Dutech achieved a creditable sales of RMB 1762.9 million in 2020, a

decrease of 6.3% or RMB 119.2 million compared to the last corresponding

period.

Social Impacts

Lockdowns in China and many other parts of the world negatively impacted

manufacturing and service sectors and contributed to Dutech’s decrease of

16.5% or RMB 159.0 million in sales in its Business Solutions segment.

However, there was a slight increase of 4.3% or RMB 39.7 million in sales

in the High Security segment in FY2020.

Restriction of Hazardous Substances 

(ROHS) Requirement 

Since the new ROHS Directive 2011/65/EU was published in the Official

Journal of the European Union on July 1st , 2011, we responded rapidly.

To ensure this environmental issues are addressed, we enforce the

following measures:

We control production processes by managing chemical substances and

reducing hazardous substances in our products. We also inspect our

finished products regularly. Inspections have showed that all our products

are qualified under the new RoHS.

We work closely with our suppliers to collect materials information to

ensure the quality of supply. To manage the environmental compliance,

the Group set this requirement as an environmental criteria in the process

of new supplier screening in 2019. We require all our suppliers to ensure

that their materials comply with the European Parliament Directive

2011/65/EU, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), and

clearly state this warranty clause when renewing supplier contracts.



MATERIAL ESG FACTORS -ENVIRONMENTAL

Environmental Compliance

&lt;307-1, 308-1&gt;

Dutech is always committed to manufacturing products that deliver a

green impact and are compliant with all the environmental requirements.

We have put in place specific guidelines for every step in the

production process to ensure adherence to the requirements of the

ISO14001 environmental management system certification &amp; EN

ISO9001 quality management system certification.

We have designated a full-time environmental specialist to be

responsible

for

the

environmental

management

of

the

daily

operations of all plants in China. He submits monthly report directly

to the Managing Director in charge of Asia operation,

Periodic testing and audits are conducted by the environmental

specialist, senior management and external audit to identify any

deficiency in our environmental management system. The total of

115

testing

and

audits

were

conducted

periodically

and

aperiodically in 2020.

From the reviews of our environmental specialist, we continually

make improvements to our environmental management system.

We had full compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations

in 2020.

MATERIAL ESG FACTORS - ENVIRONMENTAL

Supplier Environment Assessment

&lt;308-1&amp;2&gt;

Starting in 2019, Dutech‘s procurement focus gradually shifted from

international to local sourcing. This change in procurement strategy brought

about

many

positive

outcomes,

including

minimizing

negative

environmental

impacts,

lowering

costs

of

business,

reducing

fuel

consumption and exhaust emissions in the process of delivery.

In 2020, we updated our Supplier Environment Assessment with new

guidelines. We took the environmental impacts, together with the legal,

quality and price impacts into consideration when assessing new local

suppliers.

2.6% of overseas suppliers identified as having significant actual and

potential

negative

environmental

impacts

were

requested

to

make

improvements going forward. 6% of overseas suppliers identified as having

significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts were

removed from our approved vendor list. The Group makes more direct

purchases from local companies, including the Chinese subsidiaries or

associated companies of our foreign suppliers to reduce our carbon

footprint.

Environmental Footprint

We consume a large amount of water, electricity and fuel in various forms during daily production, which

will have some adverse impacts on environment. Understanding the importance of reducing the negative

environmental impact of our operations, Dutech strives to make more sustainable choices at every step,

from energy sources to materials management and recycling.

Energy Consumption &lt;302-1&amp;4&gt;

We consume fuel when running the machines and using inter-plant transportation. To manage the fuel

consumption, we regularly update machines parts or tooling and continuously optimize the horizontal

transport in factories. In 2020, we actively responded to China’s policy on promoting the use of electrical

vehicles and installed charging stations at our Nantong plants to encourage the use of electrical vehicles.

Despite our energy saving measures, Electricity Consumption in KG standard coal per RMB 10,000

output rose 15.8%, from 30.2KG in 2019 to 35.9KG in 2020, largely due to an increase in sales of high

security products which consumes a greater amount of energy to produce.

Water Consumption &lt;303-5&gt;

Water Consumption in KG per RMB 10,000 output increased 14.5%, from 1,037.8KG in 2019 to

1214.0KG in 2020. The rise in water usage is also contributed by the increase in sales of gun safes,

which is directly linked to an overall increase in energy and water consumption at our plants.

Materials Management &lt;301-1&gt;

At Dutech, we aim to maximize the use of our raw materials (in particular, steel plates) and reduce any

material wastage by investing in new equipment and upgrading our technology. Dutech is pleased to

maintain a raw material utilization ratio of more than 90% from 2017 to 2020, achieving our set target.

Environmental Footprint

As a manufacturer, we inevitably create noise, produce waste water, and emit

polluted air with dust in the production process. In product development and

commercial activities, we take environmental protection requirements into full

consideration.

We strictly observe environmental regulations globally, and aim to create

optimal social, economic, and environmental conditions through innovative

solutions. We continuously seek to provide quality products that minimally

influence the environment, while reducing our environmental footprint in the

production.

Sewage Treatment

&lt;306-1&amp;2&gt;

The new sewage treatment station started running at the end of 2018 and

worked well since the start of its operation. It has 17 processes, successfully

diluting the contaminants, like COD, SS and NH3-N, in sewage.

As a result of this new system, we are allowed by the local environment

authority to treat and discharge sewage automatically, instead of outsourcing.

The discharge ceiling of sewage was significantly raised from this year. 100% of

the sewage discharged met the effluent standards from the local authority.

Between 2019 and 2020, the quantity of sewage that met the effluent standard

has risen to 24,024 tons, with an increase of 14.9% compared to the quantity

discharged in 2019.

Security Practices - Occupational Health and Safety

&lt;403-1&amp;5, 8-10&gt;

Dutech cares for our people and their health and safety are of paramount

importance. In 2020, we took many measures and included collection and

disclosure of all injuries during staff commute. We are committed to providing a

high safety standard in our workplace. We believe a safe and secure workplace

contribute positively to production efficiency.

To ensure Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) in our workplace, Dutech has

put in place the following:

• All new staff are required to attend a mandatory Occupational Health and

Safety (OHS) training and all employees are required to attend training on

Safety and Workplace Environment periodically;

• Administration department conducts fire and typhoon safety drills periodically,

and sets up response plans;

• All offices are equipped with first-aid kits, and employees are encouraged to

learn first-aid skills; All factories also have in-house nurse stations to serve as

first port of call in case of an emergency;

• The headquarter conducts inspections to ensure compliance with OHS policies.

Government agencies also conduct inspections from time to time.

necessary precautions to ensure our OHS standards within the

organization are of sterling standards.

In 2020, there were no work-related fatality but a total of 22 cases

of work-related injuries were registered within the China operations.

12 of the work-related injury incidents occurred on our premises

(including production plant and office), while 10 occurred during the

staff’s commute. The Group disbursed approximately RMB 266,000

in compensation for these work-related injuries to cover medical

treatment and other related expenses.

The Group also recorded 31 cases of occupational disease. The

Group provides regular medical checks and personal protective

equipment when deemed necessary when undertaking specific

jobs or tasks.

Notes: In 2019, we only collected and disclosed severe work-related injuries. In 2020, we

revised our policy to include collection and disclosure of all cases of injuries (those occurred on

Dutech’s premises in China and during staff commute) and occupational diseases.




Training and Development

&lt; 404-1&amp;2&amp;3 &gt;

At Dutech, we value our people and invest in them for the long-term. We

have put in place an integrated approach to developing talent with equal

opportunities for all. Our HR teams appraise all employee performance

semi-annually. On top of these performance reviews, they draw up

separate training plans for our workers, administrative staff, and young

professionals every year.

Additionally, we focused on mobilizing our talent pool through multiple

interactions with subsidiaries all over the world. Due to the limitations

imposed by the pandemic, we shifted from in-person visits and study to

weekly online meetings. Regular meetings online facilitate full involvement

of our different subsidiaries and allow our employees to deepen the

understanding of our Group and exchange professional ideas and

experience.

Training Focus for 2020:

I.

Online training courses: 52 courses, 1,260 lessons.

II.

Safety and security training: Provide routine training

to reduce risks of occupational injuries and emphasize

sanitary measures against Covid-19.

III.

E-commerce skill training: Organize training for our

employees

to

receive

latest

news

on

online

marketplaces and trends in e-commerce.

In 2020, 84 training sessions, totaling to 340 hours, were scheduled for our 

workers and employees in the areas of safety, logistics, leadership, accounting, 

management tools, administration, production management, marketing, 

professional literacy, safety, supply chain, and quality control. Most trainings 

were carried out online and the Group achieved a high employee participation of 

over 90% in China.. 

In addition to skill trainings, our HR teams have planned security and disaster 

preparedness training in response to the incidence of flooding, fire and extreme 

weather that occurred at our Nantong plants in 2020.

Market Presence

&lt;202-2&gt;

Our subsidiaries operate in different cities all over the world. Our hiring

policy is to hire from the local community, specifically for our workers

and majority of middle management. It helps to bring great job

opportunities to the local community and contributes to the local tax

and social security. We are pleased to report that 99% of the

employees at our Vietnam and Philippines plants are locally hired.

We have five plants in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, China. In 2020, we

employed approximately 1,642 workers and 90 administrative staff and

middle management. All of them were hired locally.

For senior management, 99% of them are hired from the local

community.

Procument Practice

&lt;204-1&gt;

Covid-19 pandemic’s initial and continuing impacts have greatly

influenced Dutech’s procurement process and strategy. Amidst the

lockdowns and work-from-home measures implemented in response

to the pandemic in many parts of the world, local sourcing became a

key procurement focus for Dutech to meet our procurement needs.

Dutech continued its China regional procurement strategy of 2019, further

increasing the proportion of local suppliers and sourcing. 65.5% of our

overall local procurement was from the Yangtze River Delta region, where

our main manufacturing bases and Shanghai headquarters are located. In

addition, the Pearl River Delta region has become our new procurement

region for electronic components, accounting for 3% of annual purchase

amount. To cope with Covid-19’s continuing impacts, Dutech improved its

existing procurement structure by adding back-up suppliers in our reserve

and shifting towards localization.

Localization has helped Dutech to maintain normal operations during the

pandemic. Local sourcing is a strategy to help ensure supply, support a

stable local economy, and maintain community relations.

Community Engagement

&lt;413-1&gt;

Being a stakeholder in the community we operate in, Dutech seeks to devote

efforts in better engaging the communities to achieve long-term sustainable

relationships and discourse. We are well aware of the importance of

educational opportunities for children, hence, we have partnered with a non-

profit organization in Shanghai to construct a school in Yunnan, China. In

2020, Dutech also donated 10,000 face masks to our cooperative partners

and customers overseas to support them in managing the spread of Covid-

19.
