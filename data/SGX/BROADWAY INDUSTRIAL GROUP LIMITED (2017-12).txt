Board Statement  

Established in 1969, Broadway Industrial Group Limited (“Broadway”) is a leading 

manufacturer of precision components with 4 manufacturing facilities in China and Thailand, 

employing more than 4,000 people. With such a wide manufacturing footprint, we believe it is 

our corporate and social responsibility to apply our experience, expertise and resources to 

address the environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues that arise wherever we do 

business.  

The Board integrates sustainability considerations into our business strategy where applicable 

to mitigate potential risks and seize new opportunities. We believe that sustainable business 

practices can enhance value creation for our stakeholders and ensure the long-term viability 

of our business.  

The Board of Directors (“the Board”) is pleased to present the inaugural Sustainability Report 

of Broadway, guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) standards. In the development 

of this report, Broadway has established a sustainability governance team within the group, 

identified eight material ESG factors and developed a sustainability framework with 

performance indicators and targets in order to manage and monitor our performance in this 

area. The Board oversees the management and monitoring of the selected material ESG factors 

and approves the annual sustainability report.

Sustainability at Broadway 

In the past two decades, the electronics industry has witnessed the awakening of consumer 

consciousness about the environmental and social impacts of the products they purchase. 

Consumers are increasingly demanding greater environmental and social responsibility, not 

only from the final manufacturer, but throughout the value chain.  

Against this backdrop of shifting customer expectations, the founding members of the 

Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), originally under the name “Electronics Industry 

Citizenship Coalition” (EICC), saw an opportunity to drive positive change across the industry 

by creating a unified approach and ensuring that suppliers were held to common standards. At 

present, RBA members have grown to cover almost all leading electronics companies around 

the world, including the major clients of Broadway1.  

To fulfil our corporate social responsibility and the expectations of our clients, Broadway 

adopts the RBA Code of Conduct as the overarching managing strategy of our ESG issues. We 

integrate the focus areas of the RBA Code of Conduct into Broadway’s business. Broadway has 

identified five pillars of sustainability, covering issues on economic performance, 

environmental responsibilities, employee wellbeing, health and safety as well as ESG 

governance. Through holistically managing these five pillars in our sustainability approach, we 

can bring about positive environmental and social impacts for our employees, local 

communities and clients alike.

Economic Performance  

The emergence of new information technology is reshaping the future of the electronics 

manufacturing industry. In this era of change, Broadway strives to stay relevant and 

competitive by adapting to changes and capitalising on opportunities, so as to continue to 

deliver healthy economic performance to its stakeholders.  

In 2017, Broadway continued to restructure and consolidate its remaining Hard Disk Drive 

(HDD) business after the disposal of the Foam Plastics Solutions (“FPS”) and Flow Control 

Devices (“FCD”) businesses in 2016. In line with the Group’s process streamlining strategy, 

Broadway has relocated part of its machining operations from China to Thailand and integrated 

the coil bonding process in Chongqing into the Wuxi operations. Meanwhile, Broadway 

continued to focus on cost optimization in HDD production. We adopted a multi-pronged 

approach to cut cost, through strengthening our operation control, leaning our manufacturing 

systems and actively managing our supply chain.  

Details of the financial performance in 2017 can be found in Broadway’s Annual Report, which 

is available at https://sginvestors.io/sgx/stock/b69-broadway-ind/company-announcement .  

We believe that long-term value creation depends on the sustainable development of our 

business. We aim to deliver sustainable economic performance coupled with good ESG 

performance.

Environmental Responsibilities  

Broadway is committed to conserving natural resources and reducing our environmental 

impact. We recognise the importance of conserving natural resources, such as non-renewable 

energy sources and water. Natural resources are limited and as a responsible corporate citizen, 

we seek to improve our resource efficiency. Resource efficiency can also bring tangible benefits 

to Broadway. Reducing the consumption of energy, water and materials may lead to significant 

cost savings.  

Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape regarding environmental issues have been strengthened 

across countries where we operate in. Local communities are also paying more attention to 

the environmental performance of businesses, especially on emissions and sewage discharge, 

as these environmental impacts could affect their living environment and health.  

With the objective of achieving a higher level of environmental responsibility, Broadway has 

established an ISO14001:2015 certified Environmental Management System (EMS), which 

governs our environmental performance, such as energy consumption, water consumption, 

waste and effluents, and materials.

Globally, energy use and its associated greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions are emerging 

concerns. In 2016, the Paris Agreement, for the first time, brings all nations together under a 

common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change. The central aim is to 

strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping global temperature 

increase this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue 

efforts to further limit the temperature increase by just 1.5 degrees Celsius. Broadway is 

committed to supporting this international agenda by adopting green practices to improve its 

energy efficiency and thus reducing GHG emissions.  



What is ISO14001:2015?  



In a nutshell, ISO41001:2015 is the international standard that specifies requirements for 

an effective environmental management system (EMS).  It is a voluntary standard set by 

the globally recognised International Organisation of Standardisation (ISO). ISO defines an 

EMS as “part of the management system used to manage environmental aspects, fulfil 

compliance obligations, and address risks and opportunities.”

Broadway has developed an Energy Policy to systematically manage our energy performance. 

At the beginning of the year, we established an energy masterplan, detailing targeted KPIs and 

initiatives we hoped to achieve for the year. During the year, we tracked the completion status 

of our scheduled initiatives and supervised our energy efficiency through daily checks and 

monthly analytical reports. Broadway has put into place various practices and initiatives to 

improve energy efficiency, including:  

• 

Ensuring regular maintenance of plant machinery and air conditioning units 

• 

Reducing standby consumption by plant machinery and air conditioning units during 

production breaks and non-production time by either running them on lower power or a 

temporary shut down 

• 

Installing sub-area light-switches to increase controllability and maximise utilisation of 

natural light 

• 

Replacing existing T8 light fittings with T5 fluorescent lamps, which are more energy-

efficient 

Electricity usage accounted for more than 99% of total energy consumption, among other 

types of energy such as diesel, petrol and natural gas. Our energy performance managed to 

display a commendable improvement in 2017, as indicated by a 22.0% reduction in energy 

intensity from 0.93 mega-joules2 (“MJ”) of energy consumption per unit of production in 2016 

to 0.73 MJ of energy consumption per unit of production in 2017.

Waste is an inevitable part of any manufacturing process. The generation, treatment and 

disposal of waste and effluents warrant careful management as they can potentially pose harm 

to environmental and human health.  

Broadway has established systems to track, manage and report waste at our manufacturing 

facilities. Broadway actively identifies and implements waste minimisation initiatives through 

the“3R” approach, which promotes “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle”.  

At Broadway, waste is categorised into three broad categories, as follows:  

• 

Recyclables including paper, carton boxes, metal scraps, plastics, electronics, pallets and 

shipping trays 

• 

Non-recyclables including general waste and process waste 

• 

Hazardous waste including chemicals and heavy metals  

Our waste management policy details the definition of each waste category and specifies the 

corresponding storage and disposal method. The handling of each waste type is colour-coded 

and clearly delegated to respective departments. We also take extra precautions in handling 

hazardous waste. Weekly audits are conducted on our hazardous waste and a licensed waste 

collector has been engaged for its disposal. We have also improved packaging design and 

implemented a system for packaging reuse. Moreover, Broadway’s effluent discharge is also 

closely supervised. We engaged a third party specialist to monitor our effluent and ensure that 

our waste water quality has met the statutory environmental requirements.  

In 2017, we reused, recycled or composted 81.6% of total waste generated, showing an 

improvement from the previous year’s rate of 77.6%. The total weight of disposed waste, 

which is the sum of hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste, decreased slightly from 117.6 

tonnes in 2016 to 116.3 tonnes in 2017, despite the 41% increase in the units of production. 

This represented a positive result in our waste reduction efforts.

Water Recycling at Broadway 

Precision manufacturing requires high-purity water for cleaning. Ions need to be removed in 

raw water through the de-ionising process. At Broadway, we have a sophisicated water 

recycling system, which allows us to recycle 72% of our water.

Labour Practices  

At Broadway, we nurture a loyal staff base through our equal opportunity and fair labour 

practices as well as the various training and development programmes.  

Our human resource policies are grounded in equal opportunities and fair employment 

practices. In our recruitment process, all qualified candidates will be considered without 

discrimination of gender, age, ethnicity, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, trade union 

association and national origin. Broadway seeks to maintain a diverse workforce, which in turn 

promotes creativity and brings different perspectives on handling unique challenges. The 

charts below provide a quantitative measure of employee diversity. As of 31 December 2017, 

we have in total 2,960 full-time employees in BTH and BWX. Among them, 43% are permanent

We provide a range of learning and development programmes to cater to the learning needs 

of our employees, covering topics such as management and leadership, professional skills 

training, software and languages. To emphasise on the importance of corporate citizenship, 

we incorporate ESG education in our orientation training for employees, where we raised 

awareness on environmental responsibilities, business ethics, as well as occupational health 

and safety.  

 

To further support the professional growth of our employees, annual performance reviews are 

conducted to communicate employees’ performance and career goals. In 2017, 100% of 

employees have received feedback on their performance as well as suggestions for 

improvement from their supervisors.  

 



Understanding Operation Training 



As a manufacturer, ensuring that front-line staff are equipped with relevant skills and 

knowledge are critical in safeguarding the quality of our products. There are four types of 

operation training available, as illustrated in the table below. All front-line staff have to 

undergo extensive training and pass the final tests before they are permitted to work.  



 

We also carry out spontaneous skill tests among our employees to encourage continuous 

learning and improvement, as illustrated by the example below.

Broadway has established an Occupation Health and Safety Manual, following ISO14001:2015, 

OHSAS 18001 as well as national safety standards according to the location of operation. The 

flow chart below outlines our 

management 

process 

regarding 

occupational health and safety.  

While occupational health and safety 

(“OHS”) responsibilities are shared 

among all departments, the manual 

specifies the responsibilities of each 

department as either taking the lead 

or supporting role in specific OHS issues, thus improving accountability. Moreover, Broadway 

targets to inculcate a culture of ownership for health and safety among employees through 

safety education and training. OHS are integrated as one essential part in employee on-

boarding programmes.

One particular step worth highlighting is the identification of risks. Based on experience and 

site visits, we have categorised occupational hazards into five different risk levels based on a 

matrix of:  

i) 

Possibility of occurrence; 

ii) 

Frequency of exposure for employees and;  

iii) 

Severity of consequences 

All risks graded “Highly Dangerous” and above will need to be registered and approved by the 

management. Targeted actions plans are also tailored to mitigate those risks, as illustrated in 

the Hierarchy of Controls below.   

 

For key risk areas, Broadway strengthens its preparedness by conducting regular checks and 

arranging contingency plans. For example, for all chemicals, Broadway obtains Material Safety 

Data Sheet from suppliers, which documents the potential hazards (health, fire, reactivity and 

environmental) of the chemical product and how to work safely with it. Broadway ensures that 

all chemicals are clearly labelled and its dangers are adequately signposted. All employees 

handling the chemicals are trained about the standard safety procedures in chemical storage, 

transportation and utilisation. In BTH, we also perform monthly safety patrols in the factories. 

All practices that raise concerns will be recorded, and follow-up remediation are monitored 

and tracked.

Sustainability Governance  

Broadway has established a formal sustainability governance structure to manage 

sustainability related issues effectively. 

 

At the top of the structure is the Board, who oversees the management of sustainability issues. 

The Sustainability Steering Committee, formed by senior management, develops sustainability 

strategy, manages overall sustainability performance and reports periodically to the Board. At 

the working group level, there is the Sustainability Working Committee (“SWC”), which consists 

of representatives from the various business units. SWC supports the SSC to implement 

sustainability practices in the daily operations of our business.  

Regulatory Compliance  

2017 Highlights 

 

Broadway is committed to upholding a high level of business ethics and integrity. We take a 

firm stance against corruption. We also ensure environmental and socio-economic compliance 

by operating through a framework of prudent controls.

We believe that the prevention of corruption is vital to safeguard the interests of our 

stakeholders and our reputation. We set up anti-corruption policies, covering topics such as 

the employment of relatives, receiving of gifts and entertainment, as well as conflict of interest.  

These policies were introduced during employee orientation and included as part of the 

Employee Handbook. In addition, Broadway has in place a Whistleblowing Policy for our 

employees to report any improprieties in good faith. In 2017, there was zero incidence of 

confirmed corruption and we aim to maintain the same level of performance for 2018.  

Regulatory compliance is the baseline to meet stakeholders’ expectations and maintain the 

license to operate. At Broadway, we actively identify and manage our regulatory risks. We 

adhere to relevant environmental and socio-economic laws, which governs a range of issues 

like effluent discharge, labour practices, health and safety, as well as intellectual property and 

privacy. Having a robust ESG management system, as demonstrated by the effective 

governance of the key sustainability pillars in the sections above, helps Broadway to reinforce 

ESG policies and monitor compliance. In 2017, there was no incidence of non-compliance with 

environmental and socio-economic laws and regulations which resulted in significant fines or 

sanctions. For more information, please refer to Corporate Governance Report in Broadway’s 

Annual Report 2017.  

Supplier Environmental and Social Assessment  

2017 Highlights 

 

Broadway considers its sustainability practices and impacts in a broader socio-economic 

context. We recognise that our environmental and social impacts extend beyond the 

boundaries of our company to the value chain. With higher expectations placed on corporate 

responsibility by consumers, almost all our key clients have joined the RBA’s network to push 

the sustainability agenda within the electronics industry. As a Tier 1 supplier of electronic parts, 

Broadway is expected to be held accountable to the common code of conduct of RBA. In turn, 

Broadway has exercised similar due diligence processes on our suppliers.  

 

Supplier assessment is integral to our risk management. Broadway has established procedures 

to support all suppliers to implement the RBA Code of Conduct. We provide training 

programmes for suppliers to communicate the code requirements. They key topics are 

illustrated in the table below.

Prior to formal engagements, we will socialise RBA-related expectations with suppliers. A RBA Code of 

Conduct Checklist will have to be completed, or a Letter of Commitment will have to be signed. For 

assurance purposes, Broadway also conducts random onsite visits and audits for the shortlisted 

suppliers for RBA compliance. Moreover, we strengthen monitoring on key suppliers by mandating RBA 

Validated Assessment Process (VAP)6, which is completed by third-party independent auditors.  In 2017, 

we have screened 100% of new suppliers using environmental and social criteria.

We use conflict-free minerals  



Due to the nature of our electronics business, we inevitably use various minerals, including 

tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (commonly referred to as “3TG”), which originate in mines 

around the world. The 3TG metals have become known as “conflict minerals” because much of 

it is sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries where a 

decades-long civil war is being waged. This conflict has been exacerbated by various groups 

fighting to control mines and transit routes used in the trade of these minerals.  

Broadway has exercised extra prudence on the due diligence of the source and chain of custody 

of these minerals. We avoid directly or indirectly financing or benefitting those armed groups 

by using conflict-free minerals.

Corporate Social Responsibility  

Broadway aspires to bring about positive social and environmental impacts to the local 

community. In 2017, Broadway has launched several Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 

activities to give back to the society. 

Cleaning a local temple  

Broadway is committed to building a harmonious relationship with 

the local community. In September 2017, 50 Broadway employees 

volunteered to clean a local temple in WatSheprakaw SingBuri 

Province. In the short span of one day, Broadway employees 

helped to clean a big area and created a more enjoyable 

environment for all users of the temple. Their service was well 

appreciated by the monks and the local community.   

 

Helping students in need  

Broadway recognises the importance of education to the long-

term development of a community. In 2017, BTH has provided 

scholarships to 20 students from Pompeth School and 

Watsukantharam School in Ayutthaya Province, valuing over 

20,000 THB in total. The scholarships were given to students from 

humble family backgrounds, who have demonstrated good 

academic performance and exemplary conduct. In this way, 

Broadway sought to promote equal opportunities for education 

and increase social mobility in the local community.  

Conserving the mangroves 

Mangroves are important ecosystems as they act as nursing grounds for many marine species 

while protecting the coastal community against floods and tsunamis. However, big areas of 

mangroves are now cleared for commercial shrimp and salt farms at an unsustainable rate. In 

2017, 50 Broadway employees participated in the Mangrove Forest Planting Project to 

champion the conservation of mangroves. Through this project, Broadway aspired to raise 

awareness on the value of mangroves among the local community, so to prevent further 

mangrove deforestation. Furthermore, this project also helped to demonstrate approaches to 

successful mangrove restoration and develop alternative livelihoods for local people.
