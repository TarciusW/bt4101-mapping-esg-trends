Dear Stakeholders, 

 

Hyphens Pharma International Limited (“Hyphens” and 

together with our subsidiaries, our “Group”) is pleased 

to present our inaugural annual Sustainability Report 

for the financial year ended 31 Dec 2019 (“FY2019”).  

 

In this Sustainability Report, we report on the progress 

of our sustainability efforts over the financial year, with 

particular focus on our commitment to working 

alongside with our valued stakeholders to build a 

sustainable business. 

 

At Hyphens, we firmly believe that building a 

sustainable business is vital to our continued success 

and that we must be fully accountable for our impact 

on the environment, our customers, our people and 

our community as well as its financial performance.  

 

The Board of Directors (“Board”) also considers 

sustainability in the formulation of our long-term 

strategies. The key material economic, environmental, 

social and governance (“EESG”) factors for Hyphens 

have been approved and will be under the guidance 

and oversight of the Board. These issues will be 

monitored by senior management.  

 

As our Group continues to broaden our portfolio and 

lay the groundwork for long-term growth, we are 

cognisant that sustainability means more than just 

financial accountability; it’s also the story of our 

progress towards tracking and achieving our EESG 

goals and ensuring long-term value creation for our 

stakeholders.  

 

As such, we remain committed to work alongside our 

stakeholders to build a sustainable business model 

through our responsible business practices. 

 

Sincerely, 

 

Board of Directors 

Hyphens Pharma International Limited

OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE 

*The Company is in the midst of looking for an additional Independent Director who is expected     

  to fill the vacancy in the Remuneration Committee. 




Our Group’s senior management periodically assesses focus areas 

where our Group can have the greatest economic, environmental, social 

and governance impact, as well as areas that are most important to our 

stakeholders. 

Senior management is responsible for on-going 

communication of such assessments to the Board 

of Directors, whose duties are to review and 

approve Hyphens' sustainability matters. 

 

Our sustainability approach mirrors our business 

approach to balancing business growth and 

ensuring stability.  

 

In building sustainable value for our stakeholders, 

we consider their expectations through our regular 

engagements with them. 

Sustainability has been the key word in our 

discussions when navigating in new markets and it 

is crucial if we intend to see our efforts bear fruit. 

 

By referencing to sustainability for guidance, we 

take care in ensuring that our business operations 

and processes are managed in a way that the 

impact on our environment is kept to a minimum.  

 

In pursuit of economic developments, we also 

understand the need to keep a fine balance with 

our social influence.

MATERIALITY 

ASSESSMENT 

DEFINING OUR MATERIAL MATTERS 

Our materiality assessment was carried out in 

accordance with the GRI guidelines. This assessment 

helped us identify key concerns that are significant to 

our stakeholders, as well as the social and economic 

impact of our business operations. 

Hyphens considered the principles of 

materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, 

sustainability context and inclusiveness 

while defining the report content and 

aspect boundaries.  

 

We engaged key stakeholder groups 

through formal surveys and benchmarked 

ourselves against our peers as defined in 

the previous section. The material issues 

identified through the assessment shaped 

our FY2019 sustainability report.  

 

The material topics identified for FY2019 

are Anti-corruption, Socioeconomic 

Compliance and Employment.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 


We believe that good 

corporate governance 

establishes and maintains an 

ethical environment within our 

Group, which serves the 

interests of all shareholders 

and stakeholders. 

We adhere to the principles and guidelines set 

out in the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 

(the “Code”), and will continue to update 

ourselves on developments in corporate 

governance by improving our practices and 

operating frameworks. 

 

We are committed to maintain a high standard 

of corporate governance and have effective 

corporate practices to safeguard against fraud, 

with the aim of protecting shareholders’ 

interests as well as securing the long-term 

success of our Group.  

 

We place heavy emphasis on ethical business 

conduct on all employees and they are 

expected to conduct themselves in accordance 

with the expectations set out in the code of 

conduct. Unethical conducts or malpractices in 

relation to corruption and fraud will be met with 

formal disciplinary proceedings.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 


We strive towards upholding professional 

values and integrity when conducting business. 

Our Group maintains a strict policy against 

dishonest and corrupt practices and ensures 

that all business functions are cognisant of the 

established code of conduct and ethical 

business practices in every jurisdiction that we 

operate, therefore acts of corruption and 

bribery are stringently debarred in our Group. 

 

In our call to advocate good governance within 

our Group, we continue to review our 

whistleblowing policy to ensure it is up-to-date. 

Employees may, in confidence, raise concerns 

regarding matters such as misconducts, 

unlawful activities, suspected fraud and other 

dishonest activities.  

 

There are also arrangements for independent 

investigations into any such incidents with 

appropriate follow-up actions where necessary 

by the Audit Committee (“AC”) Chairman. The 

AC will subsequently report to the Board on 

such matters. 

 

In FY2019, there were no reported cases in 

relation to breaches of code of corporate 

governance, corruption and bribery.  

 

Moving forward, our Group intends to maintain 

our good track record of having zero reported 

cases. 

ANTI-CORRUPTION 

AND ANTI-BRIBERY  

Our Group adheres to the law and regulations 

on social and economic aspects that are put in 

place by the local authorities. Our Group is 

committed to working closely with government 

agencies and regulators to comply with 

statutory and regulatory requirements in the 

respective regions which our Group operates in. 

Management periodically attends and conducts 

trainings for relevant employees to keep them 

updated on relevant laws and regulations. Our 

business practices are also periodically 

reviewed and updated to reflect changes in 

compliance requirements. 

 

We have zero tolerance for any financial crime 

including corruption and bribery. We seek to 

conduct our business in a responsible manner 

by ensuring that our policies and code of 

conduct are implemented and communicated 

to all our employees, business partners and 

board members consistently throughout our 

entire global operations. 

 

We are proud to announce that in FY2019, our 

Group had no reported instances of non-

compliance with laws and regulation. 

 

Moving forward, we will continue to closely 

monitor existing as well as new laws and 

regulations, in order to ensure complete 

compliance.

OUR SUPPLY  

CHAIN 

SOURCING RESPONSIBLY 



At Hyphens, we believe in the 

philosophy of green procurement 

through a sustainable supply chain. 

We have stringent requirements for quality and 

therefore engage reputable suppliers who 

abide by global environmental, social and 

governance standards. We place emphasis in 

sourcing for sustainable materials and actively 

engage in strategic partnerships and 

collaborations to roll out sustainable green 

products and solutions.  

 

For example, we use recyclable High Density 

Poly Ethylene (“HDPE”) Material for our Ocean 

Health Products, and Flip Top Lid Cap to be user 

friendly for people with osteoarthritis. HDPE is 

not only recyclable, it is more lasting and light 

weight and therefore reduces transport carbon 

footprint. 

 

In addition, our Group has in place a 

procurement policy which sets out a fair and 

transparent process for supplier selection 

including criteria and basis for selection such as 

cost effectiveness and operational efficiency.  

 

Where possible, our Group will purchase locally 

and domestically made products. We also 

recognise the importance of evaluating our 

suppliers to ensure supply chain risks are 

minimised.  

 

Due diligence is also conducted on our 

suppliers for the assessment of their track 

record, quality of services and reputation (i.e. 

GMP/ISO/HACCP Document Verification).

INITIATIVES 

PROVIDING A BETTER 

QUALITY OF LIFE  

As part of our vision to 

provide a better quality of 

life to all, we voluntarily 

commit to contribute to 

the social development of 

the community. 

Together with Nanyang Polytechnic and KK 

Women’s and Children’s Hospital, we 

developed a patient-friendly mobile 

application called “iControl Eczema” to help 

patients monitor their condition daily. Patients 

can rate, attach photographs and take notes in 

between clinic visits. During consultations, 

they can share the progress with their doctors, 

allowing for better management of the 

treatment that they are currently receiving. 

Available for free in Google Play Store and 

Apple’s App Store for download. 





iCONTROL ECZEMA APP 

Every year, we invite the pharmacy 

undergraduates from National University of 

Singapore to join us for a half day office 

visit and tour to learn about the 

pharmaceutical business, as well as engage 

in rewarding conversations over lunch with 

some of our pharmacist colleagues.

EXTERNAL INITIATIVES 










Every year, our office in Vietnam embarks 

on a medical mission trip to various 

provinces of Vietnam, where we offer free 

health check-ups and dispense medicine to 

the ethnic communities.  

 

In 2019, we visited Dak Duc Commune of 

Kon Tum Province. Kon Tum is a border 

province in the Central Highlands region of 

Vietnam.  

 

With a population of 520,000, the province 

is home to 30 ethnic groups and most of 

the community work on fields in the 

mountains.  

 

We sponsored the medicine and gifts, as 

well as provided logistics support. Together 

with Hoan My Da Nang Hospital, our efforts 

benefited about 500 villagers, including 

children, who required basic medical care 

and treatment.
