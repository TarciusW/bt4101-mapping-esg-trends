CHIP ENG SENG CORPORATION LTD


I am pleased to present Chip Eng 

Seng’s second sustainability report.

We remain committed to sustainably 

growing our business. We recognise 

the growing importance of good 

performance on environmental, 

social and governance (ESG) issues 

for a range of stakeholders. Our 

sustainability approach takes into 

account the ESG impacts, risks and 

opportunities associated with our 

business activities. 

The Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs), adopted by all United 

Nations Member States in 2015, 

provide a roadmap to ensure peace 

and prosperity for people and the 

planet. We have aligned our material 

sustainability issues with the relevant 

SDGs to track our contribution to 

sustainable development.

We are fully supportive of Singapore’s 

action to fight climate change. 

We continue to adopt green building 

designs that help reduce greenhouse 

gas emissions from buildings 

we construct.

Our business focus is on creating 

short, medium and long-term value 

for a host of stakeholders including 

customers, employees, suppliers 

and sub-contractors, government 

agencies and investors. As such,  

an integral part of our business 

practice is ongoing engagement with 

our stakeholders to understand  

their expectations.

In line with our broader approach  

to sustainability, we have 

implemented policies and practices 

that aim to continuously improve 

energy efficiency, water conservation,  

waste management, workplace safety 

and the health and well-being of  

our employees.

Workplace safety and health, a critical 

issue for the construction sector, 

is a top priority for us. We closely 

monitor the safety performance at 

our construction sites. In 2018, we 

continued to win multiple awards 

that recognised our commitment to 

workplace safety and health.

Our commitment to customers 

focuses on maintaining high standards 

of quality and workmanship in 

construction and completing projects 

on time or ahead of schedule.

As sustainability reporting is a new 

initiative for us, we are strengthening 

our internal management systems to 

improve methods for collecting  

and reporting sustainability  

performance data. 

Through this sustainability 

report, we wish to share Chip Eng 

Seng’s performance on material 

sustainability topics with our 

stakeholders. 

Thank you.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018


SUSTAINABILITY 

APPROACH



 Woodlands N1C26 &amp; C27

Our approach is to integrate 

sustainability at all stages of our 

building projects. We focus on the 

material impact of our business 

activities on the economy, the 

environment and society to maximise 

value for our stakeholders.

The building industry has significant 

positive and negative impacts on 

the economy, environment and 

communities. It is estimated that 

buildings account for 30% of global 

energy use and produce 40% of the 

total global greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions. The sector also consumes 

significant resources and materials 

including sand, cement, water, wood, 

stones and steel.

Our approach is to 

manage our economic, 

environmental and 

social impacts, risks and 

opportunities to support 

sustainable growth  

of business

On the positive side, the sector plays 

an important role in the development 

of housing, industrial and business 

infrastructure needed for economic 

growth and to meet societal needs. 

The industry also creates a large 

number of skilled, semi-skilled and 

unskilled jobs.

CES plays an important role in the 

development of public housing 

in Singapore. Constructing the 

Housing Development Board’s 

(HDB) affordable public housing in 

Singapore constitutes the bulk of our 

construction business. We adhere 

to the standards set by HDB as well 

as the Building and Construction 

Authority (BCA) which include 

12

CHIP ENG SENG CORPORATION LTD


environmental, safety and community 

parameters.

We partner with BCA to adopt 

and implement green design and 

construction technologies so as to 

minimise emissions and promote 

sustainable living environments. We 

also work closely with HDB to develop 

sustainable homes.

SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE 

DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

We support the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals 

(SDGs) which set the 2030 Agenda for 

Sustainable Development and have 

mapped our operations with the 17 

SDGs and identified the goals where 

we can make a contribution. We have 

also aligned our material ESG factors 

SUSTAINABILITY 

APPROACH

with relevant SDGs, and are working 

toward tracking our progress and ESG 

performance in relation to 

these SDGs. 

MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE 

We are supportive of Singapore’s 

pledge to reduce the nation’s 

emissions intensity by 36% from 

2005 levels by 2030 and stabilise the 

country’s greenhouse gas emissions 

with the aim of peaking around 2030. 

Singapore has also introduced the 

Climate Action Plan and Sustainable 

Singapore Blueprint to transition to a 

low carbon economy.

Our approach is to maximise energy 

efficiency to minimise the emissions 

footprint from the buildings we 

construct, develop or manage.

OUR APPROACH TO 

MATERIALITY

We conducted our first materiality 

assessment in 2017 to identify Chip 

Eng Seng’s significant impacts on 

the economy, the environment 

and society while developing our 

inaugural sustainability report. 

Senior management representatives 

from all business units and 

functions attended a materiality 

workshop conducted by an external 

sustainability expert to review and 

assess stakeholder concerns and the 

critical sustainability issues relating 

to our business activities. These 

material factors were included in our 

2017 Sustainability Report.

ENVIRONMENT 

Buildings impact the environment 

throughout their lifecycle. 

Environmental impacts associated 

with our building construction 

work include energy use, water 

use, construction materials, waste 

generated from construction and 

demolition and the impact on the 

quality of air. However, these impacts 

can be minimised by adopting proper 

environmental policies, practices and 

technologies. 

As awareness about environmental 

challenges grows, green building and 

sustainable living become important 

issues for our customers, tenants, 

employees, communities and the 

regulators.

Our Green and Gracious policy 

promotes activities and initiatives 

to prevent and minimise the 

environmental impacts associated 

with our building construction work.

Our approach is 

to mitigate our 

environmental 

impact by adopting 

sustainable building 

designs, materials and 

technologies.

MANAGEMENT OF 

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 

Our policy is to minimise our 

environmental footprint by 

adopting sustainable building and 

construction practices. We focus on 

assessing and proactively managing 

the environmental impacts, risks 

and opportunities of our business 

activities. Our approaches include 

energy efficiency and resource 

conservation throughout our value 

chain by incorporating sustainable 

features. Our policies and practices are 

directed at embracing environmentally 

efficient methods and technologies.

We engage our employees, building 

authorities, and relevant stakeholders 

to seek feedback and suggestions 

relating to environmental issues. We 

also conduct periodic reviews of our 

environmental policies, projects 

and initiatives.

18

CHIP ENG SENG CORPORATION LTD


Our environmental efforts focus on energy, GHG 

emissions, materials selection, waste management, water 

conservation, wastewater recycling, and noise and dust 

containment.

We strive to constantly improve our environmental 

management system. We measure and track our 

environmental performance to identify opportunities 

for improvement. We collect and review data for energy, 

water and waste on a weekly basis. We have established 

goals and targets for these environmental metrics and 

review our progress regularly.

QUALITY, ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY 

(QEHS) SYSTEM

Environmental management is a critical part of our 

Quality, Environment, Health and Safety (QEHS) system 

that focuses on continuous improvement.  We have 

obtained ISO 14000 for our environmental management 

system that reflects our commitment to improving 

performance. Our Environmental Control Officers 

regularly assess the site work to ensure compliance 

with the applicable environmental and public health 

regulations.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Buildings consume a significant amount of energy and 

contribute to GHG emissions. Extreme weather patterns 

believed to be caused by global warming pose physical 

risks to buildings. We support the revised global goal 

of limiting the temperature rise well below 1.5˚ Celsius. 

We actively adopt green design, energy efficiency and 

resource conservation in our projects. Reducing carbon 

emissions is an essential element of our environmental 

management programme.

ENERGY

We mainly use grid electricity and diesel for running 

power generators at our construction sites. Our energy 

initiatives focus on minimising the consumption of 

electricity and diesel at construction sites. Reducing the 

energy intensity minimises our carbon footprint and also 

saves costs.

Electricity consumption at our construction sites was 

1,504,841 kWh in 2018 as against 1,155,279 kWh in the 

prior year. Diesel consumption was 1,341,037 litres in 2018 

compared with 1,353,843 litres in the preceding year. In 

2018, energy intensity was 0.280 GJ/m2 of Gross Floor 

Area built against 0.271 GJ/m2 in the 

previous year.

We monitor electricity consumption in our head office 

building, including the common area but excluding the 

tenants’ use. We also measure and report the associated 

carbon emissions.

  Our Energy Efficiency Programmes

Energy saving initiatives adopted at our construction 

sites include:

• Energy-efficient LED Lights;

• 2-tick energy-saving air-conditioning units;

• Maintain air-conditioning temperatures at 25°C;

• Reduce the number of power generators to reduce 

diesel consumption;

• Energy-saving office printers;

• Energy-saving awareness campaigns;

• Use of window blinds to minimise the heat from 

outside;

• Motion-detection sensors in toilets to switch on or 

off lights automatically; and

• Noise meter powered by solar panel.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018


GHG EMISSIONS

We track GHG emissions from our energy use and 

regularly review our performance. 

Our total carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from construction 

activities in 2018 was 4,191 tonnes compared with 4,084 

tonnes in 2017. Emissions intensity for the same period 

was 20.7 kgCO2/m2 and 19.6 kgCO2/ m2 respectively.

BUILDING MATERIALS 

Efficient use of construction materials is crucial for us to 

minimise waste and improve the quality of buildings. We 

regularly review our use of materials to select materials 

which have a lower impact on the environment. For 

example, we use pre-cast concrete walls which are more 

efficient and reduce pollution at the construction site.

We also use a variety of sustainable materials with the 

Singapore Green Label that meets the Green Mark criteria 

established by BCA.

Our materials use in the stated period is summarised 

below:

WASTE MANAGEMENT

Non-hazardous waste is primarily generated from our 

construction activities. Our approach is to reduce, reuse 

and recycle waste where practical. We dispose of waste 

through licensed contractors in accordance with the 

applicable regulations. 

General waste from our construction activities in 2018 

was 5,499 tonnes as against 5,830 tonnes in the preceding 

year.

GREEN MARK FEATURES

We incorporate a number of Green Mark features in our 

projects and use products with Singapore Green Label to 

minimise the impact on the environment. 

Some of the green features and products used in our 

projects include recycling bins at the void deck area of 

residential blocks, covered bicycle parking lots, internal 

waterproofing, interlocking concrete pavers and paving 

material, earth retention &amp; slope protection material, sub 

surface drainage cells, calcium silicate board for false 

ceiling / protection gas pipe, tile grout, concrete kerb, 

internal skin coat, aluminium composite panels, roof and 

gutter waterproofing, green-certified tile adhesive and 

polyurethane enamel paint system to steel works.

WATER CONSERVATION

We use water for construction as well as in the properties 

that we develop or manage. Our policy is to use water 

responsibly and implement conservation initiatives. Our 

measures include collecting rainwater to reduce the 

demand for fresh water, as well as reusing and recycling 

water. We install a silty water treatment system at sites to 

prevent water contamination. We use pre-cast concrete 

which has significantly reduced the need for the on-site 

use of water.  We use water-efficient taps and fittings that 

have a 3-tick rating by the Public Utilities Board to save 

water. We install dual flush closets to reduce water use.

We monitor our water use, including the usage in our 

head office and CES Centre, and review our consumption 

regularly. In 2018, our water consumption at construction 

sites was 184,741m3 as against 173,964m3 in 2017. Water 

intensity for the same period was 0.91 m3/m2 and 0.83 

m3/m2 respectively.

ENVIRONMENT 

20

CHIP ENG SENG CORPORATION LTD


WASTEWATER

Wastewater is generated at our construction sites. We also 

monitor our wastewater to find ways to minimise it.

We collect, treat and dispose of wastewater according to 

environmental regulations. Our measures include prevention 

and control of water contamination from oil, chemical drums 

and bulk storage tanks.

We implement the required earth control measures 

to manage silty discharge due to rainwater. We reuse 

wastewater as well as rainwater to wash vehicles before they 

leave the construction site which also keeps the roads clean.

POLLUTION CONTROL

We take the necessary steps to minimise the noise, 

dust and vibrations resulting from construction activity, 

vehicles, heavy equipment and machinery at the 

construction sites. We ensure strict implementation 

of regulatory guidelines and industrial best practices. 

We constantly monitor our construction work to keep 

the noise under permitted levels. We ensure regular 

maintenance of the equipment and machinery to reduce 

noise. Our use of pre-cast concrete panels also helps in 

mitigating noise at our construction sites.

We closely supervise piling and demolition work to ensure 

that vibrations caused from such activities do not exceed 

permitted limits.

Construction sites cause dust from concrete, cement, 

wood, stone, and silica. We take preventive measures to 

control the spread of dust. We use fine mesh screens to 

stop dust from dispersing. We also use water sprays to 

control dust pollution.

We engage with the affected community to keep them 

informed of our impending construction schedules, 

and promptly address and resolve any pollution related 

complaints.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Conducting our business in compliance with applicable 

laws is a top priority for the Group as non-compliance 

may result in penalties and loss of reputation. We regularly 

review applicable rules, including environmental and 

public health regulations, to implement the necessary 

policies and practices to ensure compliance.

In 2018, there were no incidents of stop work orders or 

demerit points relating to or arising from environmental 

regulations. Out of the six worksites, there were no 

incidents of environmental non-compliance at four 

worksites. Regrettably, there were four incidents of 

composition fines for noise-related lapses at two 

worksites resulting in a total fine of $52,000. We 

have since taken corrective measures to prevent the 

recurrence of the problem. 

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 

Performance data for our key environmental indicators 

is presented in the following sections. It may be noted 

that the amount of energy and water used, as well as the 

amount of waste and wastewater generated, depends on 

the construction phase of a project. Usually, power and 

water consumption are higher during the middle stages 

of a project. As such, the annual consumption trends may 

not be fully comparable.

Our Water Efficiency Programmes

• Collecting rainwater to reduce the demand for fresh 

water, as well as reusing and recycling water at site;

• Rain water and recycled water treated before using to 

wash the area and discharge to public drains;

• Use of PUB certified taps with 3 tick rating;

• Closets with dual flush to increase water efficiency;

• Use of pre-cast concrete which significantly reduces 

on-site use of water;

• Use only “Singapore Green Label” cleaning products 

in canteens; and

• Eco-friendly natural products for toilet cleaning.

TRAINING

Our approach is to provide 

opportunities for ongoing training 

to ensure our people have the right 

skills to perform their job effectively. 

Continuing training is also crucial for 

retaining and developing talent to 

support our business growth. 

Our employees have access to 

regular training opportunities 

to support their personal and 

professional development.

In 2018, our employees attended 

training, workshops and conferences 

on more than 90 topics spread 

throughout the year. Training 

topics covered workplace safety, 

construction productivity, health 

and environmental management, 

sustainability reporting, quality and 

productivity, lean construction, best 

practices for green and gracious 

builders, earth control measures, 

construction regulations, service 

excellence, virtual design and 

construction, contract management, 

and project management. We 

also organised conversational 

English course for our foreign 

workers to help them improve their 

communication with supervisors.

TALENT RETENTION

Hiring and retaining competent 

and talented employees is vital 

for our business operations. Our 

human resource policies promote a 

professional working environment 

built on mutual respect and trust. 

We invest in developing our people 

through regular training. Also, we 

follow a fair performance assessment 

and reward system to motivate 

our people.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND 

WELFARE

We provide competitive compensation, 

bonuses and performance-based 

wage increments to attract and retain 

talent. Our employees are eligible for a 

variety of benefits. The leave benefits 

for our full-time permanent employees 

include annual leave, enhanced 

child care leave, marriage leave, 

medical and hospitalisation leave, and

UPGRADING WORKFORCE 

SKILLS

We continue to help Basic-Skilled 

foreign construction workers upgrade 

to the Higher-Skilled R1 category in 

accordance with the criteria set out 

by the MOM. Investing in upgrading 

skills means higher productivity and 

a lower levy that we need to pay. 

Also, Higher-Skilled workers can be 

employed for an extended period of 

up to 22 years instead of just 10 years 

for Basic-Skilled workers.

In 2018, 57 workers were successfully 

upgraded to the Higher-Skilled 

category. These workers had received 

a combined 1,310 hours of training in 

a variety of trades.

MANAGING PERFORMANCE

The Performance Appraisal serves 

as a structural platform in evaluating 

the staff performance, determining 

the training needs, closing the 

performance gaps as well as for 

career pathing. The staff will be 

evaluated on his/her key job and 

behavioral competencies.

Performance appraisal exercise is 

conducted bi-annually by immediate 

supervisors with all employees in 

June and December. The period of 

assessment is based on calendar 

year, or part thereof from employee’s 

date of commencement for all new 

confirmed hires. In the cases of 

transfer or promotion, an appraisal 

will also be conducted.

PROMOTING WORKPLACE 

SAFETY AND HEALTH

The construction sector accounts 

for 29% of all workplace fatal injuries 

in Singapore, according to the WSH 

National Statistics Report 2017. As a 

business engaged in construction, 

we take workers’ safety seriously. 

Our target is to have zero workplace 

accidents. We are focused on 

building a culture of safety across 

the Group. 

We remain committed to maintaining 

high safety standards to ensure a 

safe workplace for our workers and 

contractors. We have implemented 

a comprehensive QEHS system to 

ensure quality, environment, safety 

and health requirements are met 

at each stage of construction. Our 

aim is to reduce safety and health 

risks by encouraging continuous 

improvement through a variety of 

safety initiatives.

We conduct a comprehensive risk 

assessment for each project to 

identify and mitigate safety hazards. 

We ensure compliance with safety 

regulations and align our work 

processes with industry standards 

for safe construction.

PEOPLE 

25

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018


We provide frequent safety 

briefings and training our 

employees to help them understand 

safety risks inherent in various 

construction activities and to learn 

safe work practices.

DRIVING SAFETY THROUGH 

INNOVATION

We continuously explore new methods 

to lower the risk of injury in structural 

installations. For instance, our 

subsidiary Chip Eng Seng Contractors 

(1988) Pte Ltd developed the Z-Bracket, 

which is a lightweight steel hollow 

section with a pipe socket at one 

end. This enables the leg of a 

scaffolding frame to be seamlessly 

slotted into it. The principal advantage 

of this simple yet useful product is 

that it allows the scaffolding structure 

to be directly clamped onto the 

parapet wall, providing added stability 

and eliminating the need to set up 

extensive scaffolding at a 

building’s exterior.

SAFETY PERFORMANCE

We regularly monitor and review 

the safety performance at our 

construction sites against critical 

indicators. A summary of our safety 

performance is presented below.

internationally accepted conventions 

of the UN and the International Labour 

Organisation. Our human rights policy 

covers non-discrimination, child 

labour, forced labour and freedom of 

association in our operations as well 

as the work performed by contractors 

and sub-contractors.

 

a) Non-discrimination: we prohibit 

discrimination in employment on 

any grounds, including gender, age, 

race, ethnicity, religion, marital 

status, pregnancy and disability;

b) Child Labour: We prohibit child 

labour in our operations and expect 

our suppliers to ensure the same 

standards;

c) Forced Labour: We prohibit forced 

labour in our operations and expect 

our suppliers to ensure the same 

standards; and

d) Freedom of Association and 

Right to Collective Bargaining: 

We respect our employees’ right 

to freedom of association and 

collective bargaining in accordance 

with local laws. Currently, CES does 

not have a collective bargaining 

agreement with any union. Our 

employees, however, have the 

right and freedom to raise any 

matter of concern freely with their 

supervisors, the HR department or 

the senior management.

We hire foreign contract workers 

for our construction business from 

developing countries approved by 

MOM. It’s important for us to protect 

their human rights during the hiring 

process, their stay in Singapore and 

while they are at work on our 

project sites.

is our topmost priority. The ability 

to build high quality homes is also 

crucial for our reputation.

We take pride in completing all 

our projects ahead of schedule or

Our approach to safe design and 

construction focuses on structural 

stability, high quality materials and 

workmanship. We employ qualified 

and experienced teams of architects, 

engineers and technical staff to 

ensure that each project meets our 

stringent norms of quality and safety.

We participate in the Construction 

Quality Assessment System

average scores for completed 

projects in 2017 (90.8) and 2016 (92.2).

subcontractors through regular 

meetings, reviews, training and 

briefing sessions to help them

Our QEHS policies also cover our 

sub-contractors to ensure safety
