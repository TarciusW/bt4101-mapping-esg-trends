ORGANISATIONAL PROFILE 

Background 

Seroja Investments Limited is an established investment holding company 

which was incorporated in 1983 and is based in Singapore. Our business is 

mainly through an indirectly owned subsidiary company, PT Pulau Seroja Jaya 

which is based in Indonesia. The principal activities of PT Pulau Seroja Jaya 

are the provision of marine transportation of drybulk freight. The Group 

operates through Freight Charter and Time Charter segments. Services 

provided by the group are chartering services of tugboats and barges 

primarily to transport dry bulk freight comprising thermal coal, sand, and 

other quarry materials. As of 31 December 2018, we own and operate a fleet 

of 70 vessels consisting of tugboats and barges, which primarily navigate 

waters around the Indonesian archipelago.  

 

The Group primarily serves coal and cement producers. Our major customers 

include PT Maritim Barito Perkasa which provides logistic services to PT Adaro 

Indonesia, a leading coal producer in Indonesia and PT Indocement Tunggal 

Perkasa, one of Indonesia’s largest cement producers. We enter into freight 

or time charters which range from spot basis to contractual basis from a 

period of one to five years. Our freight charters typically involve domestic 

routes in Indonesia from Kalimantan to various ports in Java and Sulawesi 

while our time charters involve mainly domestic routes around the Sumatra 

Island. In order to deploy our vessels in an efficient manner, our tugboats are 

installed with Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable us to track and 

monitor the routes and locations of our vessels on real time basis.

ORGANISATIONAL PROFILE 

Supply Chain Management 

Our suppliers are extensively sourced and stringently evaluated to ensure that 

they meet with the established reporting requirements and guidance for 

procurement practices and due diligence. We will carefully evaluate the 

suppliers to ensure that they are ethical, cost-effective and responsible 

suppliers who meet our expectations of goods delivered. Looking forward, 

the Group will continue to seek for new and innovative ways to better 

manage the suppliers.  

External Initiatives

could benefit and improve our environment. We continue to contribute to 

the society such as gatherings during the religious holidays in our surrounding

society as a whole.

GOVERNANCE &amp; SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH 

Continual Commitment to Enhance Corporate 

Governance 

Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is committed to maintaining a high 

standard of corporate governance and transparency within the Group to 

protect the interests of its shareholders and enhance long-term shareholder 

value. The Group’s corporate governance processes and practices have 

been discussed in this report. The Group has adopted the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012 (the “Code”), with specific reference to the principles and 

guidelines stated in the Code. 

 

The Group will strongly comply with the principles and guidelines stated in the 

Code with explanation provided if there is any deviation from the guidelines.  

 

Whistle Blowing Policy 

Whistle blowing framework is in place to protect the identity of the 

employees who can be well-assured to report, without fear of reprisal, 

concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or 

other matters. The policy is to assist the Audit Committee in managing 

allegations of fraud or other misconduct; disciplinary and civil actions that 

are initiated following the completion of the investigations are appropriate 

and fair; and actions are taken to correct the weakness in the existing system 

of internal processes which allowed the perpetration of the fraud and/or 

misconduct and to prevent recurrence. 

 

Sustainability Approach 

Senior management of the Group will conduct a periodic assessment on the 

key areas that will have significant impact on the stakeholders as well as 

contributing to economic, environmental and social impact. Senior 

management will engage in on-going communications with the Board of 

Directors to keep them inform of any issues and come out with strategic 

formulation.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

Financial Highlights 

The Group’s revenue increased by 4% or US$1.5 million from US$35.7 million in 

FY2017 to US$37.2 million in FY2018 due to higher freight charter revenue.   



 

Freight charter revenue increased by US$1.6 million from US$35.2 million 

in FY2017 to US$36.8 million in FY2018 due to higher shipment volume 

delivered for some major customers which is partly offset by lower 

average freight rate for the current financial year.  



 

Time charter revenue slightly decreased by US$0.1 million from US$0.5 

million in FY2017 to US$0.4 million in FY2018. This was due to service 

provided was for a shorter period for time charter contract secured in 

current financial year as compared to a longer period in previous 

financial year.   

 

Although the Group increased its revenue in FY2018, net profit attributable to 

shareholders decreased by US$0.3 million from US$1.1 million in FY2017 to 

US$0.8 million in FY2018 mainly due to higher operating expenses.  

Please refer to pages 6 to 8 of Seroja Investments Limited’s FY2018 Annual 

Report for review and further details on the financial performance of the 

Group. Moving forward, the Group will continue to ensure sustainable 

performance and endeavor to generate better returns for our shareholders.

ENERGY 

Coal has been a cheaper alternative as compared to oil, which leads to an 

increase in demand for coal usage. As such, we are expecting high demand 

for our services in transporting the coal cargoes.  

In order to handle the high demand of coal in an effective manner as well as 

improve our operational efficiency, we are constantly coming out with 

suggestions to better manage our energy and resources on hand. It is also 

critical to control and further reduce our fuel usage for our fleet of vessels.   

The table shows the comparison between the fuel usage in FY2018 and 

FY2017.  

Key Focus Area 

FY2017 

FY2018 

Fuel usage 

21.4 million litres 

21.7 million litres 

 

The overall fuel usage was slightly higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to 

more shipments to certain major customers and 2 new tugboats were 

purchased to service such customers.  

We further extend our initiative in conserving energy by encouraging energy 

saving in the office and the participation of our employees. We have 

communicated the energy saving initiatives to all employees which include 

switching off air-conditioners after office hours and ensuring that all 

unessential switches have been switched off before leaving the workplace. It 

is our responsibility to continuously reduce the level of electricity usage and 

further conserve energy. 

 


 

 

14 

EMPLOYMENT 

Our employees are one of the most important assets to our Group. We 

believe in providing equal opportunities to each employee and training our 

employees to perform at their fullest capacity. Our Group recruits employees 

from diverse backgrounds and with relevant experience to meet our 

customers’ expectations. Our hiring policies emphasize on  transparency and 

fairness to all employees. 

 

Our people 

All the contributions and efforts of our employees are recognised and 

rewarded. We constantly review our compensation package in order to 

remain competitive and attractive in the market.

Employee turnover rate remains relatively stable over the two year period. 

With the current employment policies, we are confident that our employees 

will feel a sense of self-worth and value to the Group. We will continue to 

review our policies to achieve more conducive work environment and 

provide equal opportunities to all age groups.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY 

 

A safe and healthy workplace environment is of utmost importance to the 

Group. Policies and procedures under the QHSE Management System and 

Resources are in place to encourage employees to adopt a culture of 

individual commitment towards improving work safety practices.  

 

The system for managing health and safety is also in place to identify any 

safety hazards and mitigate risks. Such measures include: 

 

1. Providing workplace health and safety trainings  

The Group ensure that there is effective communication to support and 

monitor processes. Training Awareness Programmes are also organised for our 

employees to continuously improve their safety management skills, including 

preparation for emergencies related to safety and the environment. 

Employees are trained to be familiar with the Environmental Standard and 

evaluation techniques. 

 

2. Identifying potential hazards and risk management 

This procedure relates to health and safety aspect of work activities, the 

process of estimating the magnitude of risk and deciding on the actions to 

be taken to minimise a risk. The 5 stages of risk management include 

identifying the work activity/process, identifying the potential hazards of the 

process/activity, identifying the likely severity of each hazard and assess its 

significance, assessing effect of controls on likelihood of occurrence and 

documenting the findings. The information collected will be recorded. 

 

3. Monitoring the implementation of safety rules 

The process of monitoring the implementation of safety rules includes 

identifying important processes, enabling effective communication and 

ensuring the safety of personnel, contractors and interested parties to 

prevent human injuries, loss of life and damage to the environment. 

 

4. Establishing and analysing the reports related to accident/incidents 

that occurred 

The Group will analyse the reasons for causing a shipboard emergency. The 

accidents/incidents may include abandoning ship, collision, grounding, fire, 

structural failure, main engine failure, medical assistance, spillage and other 

unforeseen events. 

 

5. Identifying preventive and correctives actions to prevent re-

occurrence 

The Group establishes procedures for the implementation of corrective 

action and measures intended to prevent recurrence. The Group has come 

out with structured and rapid response that are within the framework of the 


 

 

16 

Group’s response plan.  All members of the Emergency Response Team are 

responsible for ensuring that the emergency response plan is available to 

them at all times. 

 

6. Compliance of all laws and regulations in place  

The Group will endeavour to ensure that all relevant Environmental and OH&amp;S 

Legislation and applicable Rules and Regulations have been identified and 

form part of the normative (technical) reference in the Library. All applicable 

legislation documented in the Environmental and OH&amp;S Legislation Reports 

are regularly reviewed to keep abreast of changes to laws which impact on 

operational activities. 

Furthermore, employees should also play their role in ensuring and protecting 

their health and safety at workplace. In order to achieve a safe work 

environment, management and employees should work hand in hand. 

 

Based on the incident/accident report, there was a decrease of 20% for 

accidents or injuries suffered by our employees. We have identified various 

preventive and corrective actions such as internal audit ISM code, vessel 

inspection, safety flash, marine incident report (result investigation), 

contingency plan, plan maintenance system (PMS), emergency drill, training 

on-board, permit to work (PTW), risk assessment (R.A) and material safety 

data Sheet (MSDS) to prevent any accident/incident from occurring. Moving 

forward, we hope to continue to provide a safe environment for our 

employees and strengthen our current QHSE system.  

 


 

 

17 

LOCAL COMMUNITIES 

Apart from maintaining good relationship with our customers, the Group is 

committed to making a difference to the well-being of the community 

through events and engaging the public. We want to build mutual 

relationship with the local community to manage the surrounding of our 

business. We work closely with our business partners and government 

authorities to establish community goals.  

Our main activities are mostly conducted during the month of Ramadhan 

and other religious holidays. There were 3 events/activities that the Group 

had organised during the period under review.  

S/N Events/Activities 

Description  

1.

our employees as they are willing to contribute to the community. The Group 

had looked into possible areas in developing events/activities that could 

constantly engage with the public.  

In FY2019, the Group is looking beyond the current events/activities to 

exploring new opportunities such as building residential houses in Banjarmasin 

– Kelanis route with established NGOs who are able to provide the necessary 

support.  

 

 

 

 


 

 

18 

PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES 

The Group believes that a good and well-managed procurement practice is 

critical to its success, in terms of operational efficiency and financial results. 

We constantly monitor our major suppliers and ensure that such suppliers 

whom we source from are able to fulfil the critical needs of our operations.  

Purchases are handled by our professional procurement team in a fair and 

objective manner. Throughout the years, we continuously build a long-lasting 

relationship with our suppliers and strengthen our mutual trust. When we 

make any purchase, we ensure that our vessels receive the correct goods 

and spare parts in good condition as per our purchase order on timely basis 

so that our operations will not be disrupted.  

A proper system has been implemented to ensure effective and efficient 

purchase of goods under our supply chain. Our procurement personnel are 

familiar with all the process requirements to enable our operation to run 

smoothly. However, we are still faced with challenges in timely delivery of 

goods due to the different routes of the vessels and close monitoring of their 

locations is needed. The procurement team will look into and determine 

whether it is an operational or procurement issue when goods are not 

received on time and take necessary measures to speed up the process of 

receiving the purchased goods.   

In FY2019, we are planning to work closely with certain suppliers to ensure 

that goods are delivered on a timely manner to support operations so that 

the Group will be able to operate its vessels more effectively and efficiently.
