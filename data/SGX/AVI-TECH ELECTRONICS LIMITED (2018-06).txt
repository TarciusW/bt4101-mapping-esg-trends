CHAIRMAN AND CEO STATEMENT 

 

Avi-Tech Electronics Limited (“Avi-Tech”) remains committed to managing its environmental, social and 

governance (“ESG”) impacts, risks and opportunities. 

 

The Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) has introduced rules that require issuers to produce an annual 

sustainability report with effect from the financial year ending 30 June 2018 (“FY2018”) in a “comply” or 

“explain” basis. Complying with the SGX rules, we have prepared our first sustainability report based 

on the international recognised Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) standards. The sustainability report 

provides information about our ESG performance in a phased approach. We will continue to integrate 

material ESG issues into our business processes to ensure long-term value creation for all 

stakeholders.

REPORTING PROCESS 

Avi-Tech’s Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for directing the management in the 

development of its sustainability strategy including determining the material ESG factors, its due 

compliance with the SGX-ST guidelines on corporate governance and sustainability reporting, and the 

Group’s response to the attendant risks and opportunities. The Board is updated at least once a year 

on Avi-Tech’s sustainability performance. 

The Board is assisted by the Sustainability Reporting Committee. The Sustainability Reporting 

Committee is headed by the Group’s Chief Financial Officer and key personnel of the various business 

divisions as well as from the Finance and Human Resources departments. The committee’s 

responsibilities include formulating and implementing sustainability strategies including identifying, 

reviewing and assessing the various ESG factors, collecting ESG performance data from the various 

business units, setting performance targets, where applicable, as well as developing, managing and 

supervising the execution of the sustainability action plans.  

 

 

 

 

REPORT CONTENT AND QUALITY 

The content of this report takes into consideration the significance of material ESG topics, risks and 

opportunities and general sustainability trends and stakeholders’ concerns and expectations. We have 

employed the GRI Standards defining report quality by applying the principles of accuracy, balance, 

clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness. 

 

Data provided in the report has been mainly derived from our official records to ensure reasonable 

accuracy and consistency. We have used internationally accepted measurement units, where 

applicable, for presenting ESG data. Financial figures are in Singapore dollars unless stated otherwise. 

As this is the first year of reporting, we do not have previous targets or benchmarks against which to 

measure ourselves and we will be adopting a phased implementation approach to our reporting, which 

will be conducted on an annual basis. In adopting a phased-approach to sustainability reporting, we will 

be introducing more quantitative and qualitative targets going forward. 

 

 

RESTATEMENTS 

As this is our first sustainability report, restatements do not apply. 

 

ASSURANCE 

We did not obtain external assurance for this sustainability report. We have relied on internal verification 

mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of information. Our ESG performance data is reported in good faith 

and to the best of our knowledge. ESG data is verified using internal mechanisms and checks. Financial 

statements included in our Annual Report, however, have been audited by independent auditors.

MATERIAL FACTORS 

Our approach to sustainability centres on the management of the ESG impacts of our business 

operations and their potential impact on our stakeholders. Our strategy is to manage our most significant 

sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities with the aim of creating long-term value for all our 

stakeholders.  

 

 

Materiality Methodology 

 

We have identified the material ESG factors using the GRI Standards for Sustainability Reporting which 

includes guidance for materiality analysis which were then prioritised with regards to their 

environmental, social and economic impact to Avi-Tech and its stakeholders.  

We undertook the following steps to arrive at the list of material factors for reporting: 

• 

Identification: We selected the ESG factors through an internal materiality analysis. We 

identified sustainability issues that reflect our business’ impact on the environment, society and 

economy and their significance to our stakeholders.  

• 

Prioritisation: We shortlisted the issues that represent the most significant environmental, social 

and economic impacts of our operations and prioritised the material topics through an in-depth 

analysis covering Avi-Tech’s activities, locations, business partners and customers, engaging 

with relevant internal key executives of the various business divisions, reviewing the existing 

Group management system components, risk assessment and internal audit results as well as 

external commentaries on the semiconductor and wider electronics industries. 

• 

Validation: We considered the significance of our material impacts to stakeholders and how 

they might influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders.  

• 

Review: We seek feedback from stakeholders on this report to review our material topics for 

the next reporting cycle. 

 

Materiality Assessment 

Our Sustainability Reporting Committee carried out our first formal materiality process to review, identify 

and assess our most material sustainability issues based on their knowledge of respective business 

areas, potential impacts of the Group’s business operations, insights from their day-to-day engagement 

with a range of stakeholders and common challenges facing the industry. The team also considered 

the Group’s long-term business goals and to align these with the sustainability strategies and examined 

sustainability reporting trends among local semiconductor and manufacturing companies and peer 

companies for benchmarking. For this report, we did not engage external stakeholders explicitly to take 

their views on the identified ESG factors. However, the internal stakeholders including the key 

management and personnel have used their experience of dealing with respective stakeholders and 

their understanding of stakeholder expectations and concerns in prioritising material factors for 

reporting. 

 

As this is the first year of sustainability reporting, pursuant to a phased implementation approach, the 

Group has set out in this report the qualitative targets and where available, the quantitative targets for 

the majority of the material ESG factors. We have collected data internally from the relevant business 

segments covering the period under review. In the coming year, we will put in place a data collection 

and management system to provide information on our sustainability metrics and to enable us to 

measure and track performance on a yearly basis. The objective is to achieve our set targets for the 

material ESG factors and meet the key sustainability performance indicators within the timeline.

OUR MATERIALITY TOPICS AND BOUNDARIES 

 

Arising from the exercise, the following are the materiality factors and their boundaries that are of priority 

to the Group’s sustainability risks and opportunities and having the most impact on our stakeholders: 

 

• 

Environment 

• 

Customers 

• 

People  

• 

Community 

• 

Economic Performance 

• 

Governance and Risk Management 

 

These are materiality factors which we have control or management of and there are other materiality 

factors that while having an effect on our stakeholders, are not within our control to manage or influence 

significantly. These include factors that occur within our value chain but are outside of Avi-Tech, for 

example, although materials used in our products may have an impact on the environment, we have 

little control over them as most are consigned to us by our customers or specified by our customers due 

to the stringent product specifications we have to adhere to.  

 

Presented below is a summary of our material factors and their boundaries.

ENVIRONMENT 

 

We are committed to our Environmental Policy of enhancing environmental performance through 

continual improvement in our environmental management system. Electricity and waste are our primary 

environmental impacts. Our office and production facility use power for lighting and air-conditioning and 

in particular, our Burn-In Services business segment utilises significant power for conducting Burn-In 

tests. We also generate waste mostly from board manufacturing and system integration activities. Our 

environmental efforts are focused on energy efficiency, reducing and recycling waste and using 

resources efficiently. 

Energy 

 

We aim to operate responsibly within our business activities and to have positive impact on the wider 

environment through the development of energy saving programmes. Avi-Tech’s energy demand for 

our operation arises mainly from indirect energy which is electricity purchased from external suppliers.  

 

We measure and monitor our energy consumption. In FY2018, our electricity consumption intensity was 

6.5 kWh/m2, with the main user of this energy being Burn-In Services, averaging 51 % of total 

consumption. This compares against 6.3 kWh/m2 with Burn-In Services, averaging 50 % of total 

consumption the year before.  

Some of the energy saving programmes we undertook/ planned to undertake include: 

 

• 

Chiller/CDA Overhaul and Replacement Programme 

– 

Installation/replacement of existing equipment to a high-efficiency chiller for efficiency 

improvement 

– 

Overhaul and regular maintenance of pumps and compressors 

– 

Replacement of R-22 (ozone-depleting substance) with R134/R407 refrigerant (ozone 

friendly) in phases 

 

• 

Air-conditioning System Optimisation 

– 

Monitoring of and maintenance of temperature at an optimum level 

– 

Regular maintenance (monthly) to preserve efficiency 

 

• 

HT/LT Transformer Optimisation 

– 

Regular maintenance to maintain efficiency 

 

Based on the energy consumption for FY2018, we aim to maintain below 0.13 kWh per unit in the new 

financial year. 

 

We have started switching to energy efficient LED lighting in our office and production facility 

progressively and to optimise our air conditioning system use through temperature control, and lift 

system through regular maintenance. We also encourage our employees through awareness 

campaigns to minimise the use of non-essential lighting in the office and production floor, switch off 

electrical appliances when not in use and to make efforts to conserve water and to recycle paper.

Waste Management 

 

Avi-Tech is mindful of the impact that our operations could have on the environment and have taken 

steps to monitor and control waste that is a by-product of our operations. This is because we are 

committed to the long-term preservation of our environment and climate. Furthermore, we are certified 

to the ISO 14001 environmental management standard. 

 

Waste management is particularly relevant for our board manufacturing and system integration 

activities. We have put in place a wastage monitoring system which tracks and places targets to attain. 

The current target set is wastage not exceeding 0.40% of total revenue. A monthly data log is submitted 

which tracks the wastage for the month. To discourage wastage and inculcate a sense of responsibility 

towards materials requisitioned, a system has been put in place for the submission and tracking of all 

wastage requests. Employees have to explain or justify the reason for the wastage which has occurred. 

The entire monitoring and reporting system is reviewed with senior management at quarterly meetings. 

Strict control is also maintained over stock levels to minimise potential for write-off which exacerbates 

wastage. 

 

We dispose of waste and by-products through authorised channels and licensed waste management 

contractors. Our chemical waste is disposed through licensed National Environment Agency (“NEA”) 

approved vendors. We have an internal recycling programme to recycle, reduce and reuse our solder 

dross that allows us to recover pure solder from the solder dross. We utilise lead-free processes as 

much as possible to reduce any environmental impact by the possibility of any heavy metal pollution. 

We also undertake recycling exercises with our customers, reusing high cost components.  

While we do not consume a significant amount of water for it to be a material issue, we are nonetheless 

mindful of its value as a resource. Any form of water discharge from our production processes are 

treated in accordance with the NEA guidelines. 

 

In addition, under our Supplier Code of Conduct, our major suppliers are required to comply with 

relevant environmental laws and regulations, obtain and maintain all required environmental permits 

(e.g. discharge monitoring), approvals and registrations, reduce pollution and minimise their use of 

resources (including water and energy) and their generation of solid waste and wastewater and identify 

and safely manage hazardous substances. This includes, inter alia, responsibly managing emissions 

to air (including volatile organic chemicals, aerosols, corrosives, particulates, ozone depleting 

chemicals and combustion by-products) and minimising their greenhouse gas emissions; adhering to 

all applicable laws, regulations and customer requirements regarding prohibition or restriction of specific 

substances in products and manufacturing, including labelling for recycling and disposal.  

 

We are committed to complying with applicable environmental regulations. There were no incidents of 

non-compliance with environmental laws in the reported period. 

 

We aim to achieve a 0.5% year-over-year reduction in waste generation.

CUSTOMERS 

 

Maintaining our customers’ trust depends on our strict adherence to their exacting technical, commercial 

and ethical requirements, protection of both our own intellectual property and that of our customers and 

business partners, which is fundamental given the technologically innovative nature of our business 

and our full compliance with laws. Any breach of trust or of our legal obligations, would have the potential 

to seriously compromise our business, whether in terms of the loss of valuable commercial relationships 

and/or the undermining of our reputation. 

 

To safeguard our business reputation and commercial relationships, we have in place our Business 

Ethics Policy which covers the protection of intellectual property, privacy, fair business and competition, 

whistleblowing and protection against retaliation, managing conflict of interest and other misconduct 

such as bribery and corruption and a range of specific policies addressing issues such as responsible 

sourcing of minerals. In addition, the Group has issued policies on disclosure of information regarding 

business activities, structure, financial situation and performance is to be disclosed in accordance with 

applicable regulations and prevailing industry practices. For example, Directors and all key personnel 

are advised not to deal in the Group’s shares on short-term considerations or when they are in 

possession of material unpublished price-sensitive information which may set out the implications of 

insider trading. 

 

Customer Standards Compliance 

 

As a supplier of total solutions for burn-in services, manufacturing and PCBA services, and engineering 

services to the semiconductor, electronics and life sciences industries, we are subject to a significant 

body of technical, legal and quality control requirements defined by our customers. In many cases, our 

compliance with these requirements is included as a condition of contract with our customers, making 

our strict adherence essential. This is particularly the case with respect to the technical specifications 

and quality of our highly sophisticated products. Any slight variation in this respect is not only likely to 

render them valueless from the perspective of our customers, but also has the potential to undermine 

our customers’ own products. 

 

As such, we put a significant amount of effort into understanding our customers’ extensive requirements 

and applying comprehensive management systems to ensure that these are fully met. This includes, 

for example:  

 

• 

an extensive set of operational quality control measures by which we employ strict adherence 

to; 

 

• 

regular business reviews with our partners to understand their current and future capabilities 

and requirements; and 

 

• 

our own ongoing auditing against the following management system standards  

– 

ISO 9001 (quality management system standard) 

– 

ISO1 4001 (environmental management system standard) 

– 

ISO 13485 (quality management system for medical devices standard) 

 

Similarly, our customers typically apply their own set of compliance measures to ensure that we are 

meeting their requirements. This includes auditing of, inter alia, our management systems, processes 

and facility specifications, testing processes and documentation and materials and product traceability.  

 

We evaluate customer satisfaction with the quality and specifications of our products on an ongoing 

basis, using a mixture of individual reviews, analysis of customer complaints and customer surveys.  

 

Legal and Socio-Economic Compliance  

 

As with all companies, it is incumbent on us to comply with the applicable laws of the countries in which 

we operate. This may require increased management if we extend our global presence into new 

jurisdictions. In this context, we seek professional assistance in the countries of our operations to ensure 

compliance with existing laws and regulations prevailing in those countries. We also regularly review 

the local legislation to keep our policies updated and our relevant employees up to date with global 


 

12 

 

compliance issues where appropriate.  

 

In the financial year under review, we were not subject to any legal sanctions or fines for non-compliance 

with applicable laws. 

 

Intellectual Property, Data Protection and Customer Privacy 

 

The protection of intellectual property is vital for any business focused on the creation of innovative and 

high-value technological solutions. Any failure in this regard could have profound consequences, for 

example, on the value of our customers’ and business partners’ inventions and products, as we 

necessarily access and work with customers’ intellectual property and/or commercial and technological 

secrets. This requires a high degree of trust on the part of our customers, whose business we would 

lose were this trust to be broken. 

 

We ensure that all intellectual property is adequately safeguarded through the application of: 

 

• 

related restrictive provisions in both our Business Ethics Policy and our contracts of 

employment; 

 

• 

robust information technology systems to prevent data leakage; and 

 

• 

access controls to specific project data for employees and third parties 

 

In the financial year under review, we receive no complaints relating to misuse of customers’ intellectual 

property, losses of customer data or breaches of customer privacy.

PEOPLE  

 

The nature of our business, which relies on the ongoing advancement of semiconductor technology, 

means we are highly reliant on our ability to recruit, retain and develop a high-quality work force, as well 

as leading management talent. Our people form the core of our organisation and our continued ability 

to recruit, retain and develop experienced personnel and managers is particularly important given the 

strong, ongoing competition for skills within the sector. 

 

We take a holistic view towards both recruitment and retention that looks beyond the provision of 

competitive financial rewards. We also aim to deliver the kind of working environment, training and 

development opportunities and inclusive culture that allow our people to develop progressive, long-term 

careers with us. 

 

Employee Profile 

 

We employ about 176 full-time staff as at end of June 2018, made up of various races, nationalities, 

age groups, and gender. Permanent employees accounted for 90.02% of our workforce. The average 

age of our employees was 40.6 years. 

 

Hiring  

 

Our goal is to attract and retain the best talent. We offer equal opportunities for employment and 

progression within the Group based on merit. Our Human Resource policies and procedures provide 

for equal opportunity and fairness in employment decisions. We do not discriminate on the basis of 

race, colour, age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, pregnancy, religion, political affiliation, 

union membership or marital status. 

 

In FY2018, we recruited 19 new employees. Of the new hires, 11 of them were women, 12 were less 

than 30 years of age and seven were in the age group of 30 to 50 years. 

 

Diversity and Equal Opportunity and Non-discrimination 

 

As a signatory of the of the Employers’ Pledge of Fair Employment Practices with the Tripartite Alliance 

for Fair Employment Practices (“TAFEP”), we abide by the principles which stand for diversity and 

inclusion and are against discrimination of any kind. TAFEP is an alliance co-chaired by representing 

employer unions, the National Trade Union Congress and the government. 

 

We are committed to employing and developing people who have the necessary skills, experience and 

values to excel in their relevant roles irrespective of their gender, ethnicity, religion, disability or any 

other non-work related or personal characteristic. Furthermore, we recognise the value a diverse 

workforce can potentially bring in terms of creativity, dynamism and new perspectives. In this context, 

we aim to nurture a working culture characterised by mutual respect and non-discrimination.  

 

Our workforce represents diverse age groups (see chart). We support the Singapore government’s 

policy of rehiring retiring employees to keep them economically active. In FY2018, we rehired seven 

retiring employees. 

The globalised nature of our sector mean that we enjoy a fairly international workforce, many of whom 

work for us in locations away from their countries of birth. We are proud of our racially diverse workforce 

which includes at least seven nationalities. 

Although it is a reality that the semiconductor sector performs relatively poorly in terms of gender 

diversity, our female workforce comprises more than 55% of the total workforce. Notwithstanding, we 

will continue to focus on removing any invisible or structural considerations that may be limiting female 

engagement with the sector. Diversity in the Board requires more consideration as currently there is no 

female representation on our Board of Directors. The Board recognises the importance and value of 

gender diversity and will take into consideration the skill sets and experience including gender diversity 

for any future Board appointments. 

 

We also respect our employees’ right to freedom of association and collective bargaining.  


 

14 

 

In the financial year under review, we did not receive any reports of any alleged or actual cases of 

discrimination. 

 

Human Rights 

 

Avi-Tech recognises the responsibility to respect and protect the rights of our employees and support 

internationally accepted human rights principles and regulations. We abide by our Labour and Human 

Rights Policy which advocates, inter alia, freely-chosen employment, child labour avoidance, 

compliance with local labour laws regarding working hours, wages and benefits, humane treatment, 

and non-discrimination. 

 

We did not receive any reports of incidents of labour and human rights violations, forced labour or child 

labour in the reporting period. 

 

Anti-Bribery and Corruption  

 

We take a zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and are committed to acting with integrity 

in all our business dealings and relationships.  

 

In this context, we are subject to national anti-corruption laws, including the Singapore Prevention of 

Corruption Act. Our commitment in this respect is set out in our Business Ethics Policy, which 

addresses, inter alia: bribery, facilitation payments and gifts, and hospitality. Our Business Ethics Policy 

which covers a Whistle-Blowing Programme, enables staff of the Group and any other persons, in 

confidence, to raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other 

matters such as suspected fraud, corruption, and dishonest practices. 

 

All new employees are trained in the Business Ethics Policy during the induction process, while all 

existing employees are provided with easy access to the policy and Whistle-Blowing Programme. We 

communicate our zero tolerance approach to corruption to all suppliers, sub-contractors and other 

service providers at the outset of our business relationship. Our Finance department oversees the 

implementation of appropriate controls and procedures to monitor and prevent inappropriate forms of 

payment across all our locations. This includes, for example, duplicate or overpayments, and payment 

requests to third parties not associated with underlying transactions.  

 

Were we to identify any suspected cases, these would be subject to internal (or, if necessary, external) 

investigation. Any confirmed cases of employees breaching our policy would result in disciplinary action 

(including potential termination) and/or referral to the relevant law enforcement authorities. Any 

confirmed cases involving our business partners would result in the review and potential termination of 

our business relations. 

 

We aim to maintain zero corruption and fraud incidents across Avi-Tech’s core operations and ensure 

that we are not subject to any material legal sanctions or fines for non-compliance with applicable laws. 

 

In the financial year under review, we have not received any report of any corruption risks or cases of 

suspected or actual corruption. There were also no whistle-blowing reports received in the financial 

year under review. 

 

Training and Development 

 

Employee training and education is a crucial part of our people management. New employees attend 

an orientation programme to understand the organisation and its corporate governance. There are also 

check-in sessions with management to help in employee engagement and culture building.  

 

We develop our people according to their abilities and job specifications. For all production staff, twice 

yearly re-certification is conducted while management staff are encouraged to upgrade skills through 

courses provided by external training providers such as Workforce Skills Qualification (“WSQ”) and 

Integrated Assessment Pathway (“IAP”). 

Our employees have access to ongoing opportunities for learning new skills. We encourage our 

employees to gain new knowledge, experience and skills even if these lie outside their immediate job 


 

15 

 

scope. As such, employees are able to request to be sent for relevant training programmes provided 

by external training providers. 

 

In FY2018, our average training hours per employee was 3.9 hours and our training expenditure per 

employee was approximately $262.00 per person (or 0.13% of revenue). 

 

We are aiming for a 4% increase in average training hours per employee for the next financial year 

under review and to achieve an average of 4.2 training hours per employee by 2020. 

 

Performance Appraisal and Career Development 

 

Through a performance management system, we enable our employees to meet their business and 

personal development goals. Our performance management system covers all permanent employees.  

As part of the process, managers hold discussions with their staff at the beginning of the year to 

establish goals and are encouraged to have ongoing discussions with their employees to review 

progress and to provide coaching and guidance. Yearly performance appraisals are conducted to 

encourage self-improvement and to reward hard work. Promotions are based on recommendations by 

supervisors based on performance and aptitude.   

 

Staff Welfare and Benefits 

 

We offer competitive wages and benefits to all our employees including full-time staff members and 

contract employees: 

• 

Sick and hospitalisation leave  

• 

Hospitalisation and surgical plans 

• 

Dental benefits  

• 

Term life insurance policy in the event of death, disability and critical illness (actual limits of 

coverage of these policies vary according to an employee’s grade) 

• 

Marriage/examination leave 

 

Taking a proactive approach to the health and well-being of our employees, we also organise health-

related talks and checkups periodically to encourage employees to adopt healthy lifestyles and to take 

care of their health.

Occupational Health and Safety 

The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for Avi-Tech. In addition to minimising the 

incidence of work-related injury and illness, a safe and healthy work environment enhances the quality 

of products and services, consistency of production and employee retention and morale.  

 

Avi-Tech is committed to achieving Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) excellence through: 

 

• 

Compliance with relevant WSH legislations and regulations and other requirements to which 

we subscribe to; 

• 

Consistently establish and maintain WSH management performance;  

• 

Operate and maintain our facilities to prevent and minimise risks to the health and safety of our 

employees, subcontractors and surrounding communities; and  

• 

Ongoing communication of our WSH policy to all parties 

 

We have in place operational procedures for risk assessment and management, and the 

implementation of workplace safety measures covering occupational safety injury and illness, 

emergency preparedness, industrial hygiene and machine safeguarding. We also recognise that 

employee input and education is essential to identifying and solving health and safety issues in the 

workplace. Our Environment Health and Safety (“EHS”) and Fire Safety Committees which comprise 

staff from all relevant departments, under the counsel of registered safety officers, were set up to 

oversee the implementation of the WSH management plan with monthly reviews.  

 

Below are the details of the WSH initiatives undertaken:

For the financial year under review, we had one case of accident resulting in a machine operator 

suffering a cut on the finger while operating a machine. Necessary actions were taken to prevent any 

future occurrences.  

 

We aim to achieve our goal of zero cases of WSH complaints and industrial accidents.

COMMUNITY 

 

We understand corporate citizenship as our voluntary social contribution to the local communities in 

which we operate. As a responsible corporate citizen, we aim to leave our footprint in a positive way on 

the environment and the community.  

 

We are committed to be a responsible corporate citizen and contribute to community development. We 

have been supporting charities and not-for-profit organisations such as Bright Vision Hospital, a 318-

bed community hospital offering intermediate and long-term holistic care for about 1,500 new patients, 

since 2015. Our employee volunteers, including our management, took part in the outreach programme 

which included organising games, arts and crafts events and Patient Birthday Celebrations to celebrate 

some of the patients’ birthdays. 

 

Over the years, we have also raised funds for disaster relief such as for the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan 

disaster in the Philippines.

GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT 

 

Our Board and Management are committed to continually enhancing shareholder value by maintaining 

high standards of corporate governance, professionalism, integrity and commitment at all levels, 

underpinned by strong internal controls and risk management systems. 

 

Our corporate governance practices are set out in the Group’s annual report section entitled, “Corporate 

Governance Report”, with specific references to the principles and guidelines of the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2012 (the “Code”). Where the Group’s practices differ from the principles and guidelines 

under the Code, the Group’s position in respect of the same is also set out in our Corporate Governance 

Report.  

 

We strive to conduct our business to high standards of openness, integrity and accountability and act 

professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships at all times. All 

business dealings should be transparently performed and accurately reflected in the Group’s books and 

records. We ensure that the Group’s zero tolerance policy towards all forms of fraud, bribery, corruption, 

extortion and embezzlement (covering promising, offering, giving or accepting any bribes) and unethical 

actions, is strictly adhered to. Monitoring and enforcement procedures are implemented to ensure 

compliance with anti-corruption laws. To achieve a high standard of corporate governance for the 

operations of the Group, we have also implemented a Whistle-Blowing Programme. For more 

information on the Whistle-Blowing Programme, please refer to the Corporate Governance Report in 

the Annual Report.  

 

Risk management is a critical component to our business success. We have constantly striven to 

advance risk management practice as an important component in all our business portfolio and 

activities. It demonstrates our commitment to a high standard of corporate governance. The Group has 

put in place a risk management and internal control system in areas such as financial, operational, 

compliance and information technology controls. The principal aim of the internal control system is the 

management of business risks with a view to safeguarding shareholders’ investments and the Group’s 

assets.  

 

The system of risk management and internal controls established is designed to manage, rather than 

eliminate, the risk of failure in achieving our goals and objectives. The Board wishes to state that the 

system of internal controls provides reasonable, but not absolute assurance, as to financial, operational, 

compliance and information technology risks. No such system can provide absolute assurance against 

the occurrence of material errors and other situations not currently within the contemplation or beyond 

the control of the Board. For more information on our system of risk management and internal controls, 

please refer to the Corporate Governance Report in the Annual Report.  

 

Board and Audit &amp; Risk Committee (“ARC”) 

 

The Board of Directors has an overall responsibility to ensure that the Group has the capability and 

necessary resources to manage risks in new and existing businesses, and that business plans and 

strategies accord with the risk appetite that the Group undertakes to achieve its corporate objectives.  

 

The responsibilities of the ARC include, inter alia, assisting the Board in carrying out its responsibility 

of overseeing and maintaining the Group’s risk management framework and policies, including 

reviewing the Group’s levels of risk tolerance and risk policies, and overseeing the management in the 

design, implementation and monitoring of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems. 

For more information on the role and responsibilities of our ARC, please refer to the Corporate 

Governance Report. 

 

Risk Governance and Internal Control (“RGIC”) Framework 

 

The Board is responsible for risk governance, establishing risk management policies and tolerance 

strategies that set the appropriate tone and direction, and also overseeing the implementation of risk 

management framework to ensure that risks are identified and managed. On an ongoing basis, the 

Board needs to continuously monitor and assess the adequacy of the risk management systems that it 

has put in place, the system of internal controls and ensure that management takes the appropriate 

steps to manage and mitigate risks. 


 

24 

 

 

The Group’s RGIC framework was developed to realise the value of risk management by providing an 

integrated enterprise-wide perspective of the risks involved in our businesses and institutionalising a 

systematic risk assessment methodology for the identification, assessment, management, reporting 

and monitoring of risks on a consistent and reliable basis. The RGIC Manual sets out, inter alia, the 

Board’s approved Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance guidance, Authority and Risk Control Matrix, Key 

Control Activities and Key Reporting and Monitoring Activities to manage and mitigate risks.  

 

Our RGIC framework is constantly refined, ensuring relevance in a dynamic operating environment. We 

keep abreast of the latest developments and best practices by participating in industry seminars and 

interacting with risk management practitioners. Continuous training to build risk awareness and 

competencies, as well as systems and tools to operationalise the risk management framework are put 

in place to support our RGIC framework. 

 

As a Group, we take a balanced approach to risk management, recognising that not all risks can be 

eliminated. To optimise returns for the Group, we will only undertake appropriate and well-considered 

risks. For more information on risk management and internal controls, please refer to the Corporate 

Governance Report of the Annual Report.
