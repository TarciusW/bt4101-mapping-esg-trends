Topic

Why is this material for us and

our stakeholders

How we are addressing the issue

Economic Aspect

Creating

Economic

Value

In recent years, the market conditions

have been challenging resulting in an

uncertain outlook for the oil and gas

industry. There are concerns over the

economic performance of the Group

during such turbulent times.

Therefore, it is important for the Group

to

demonstrate

our

resilience

and

manage

our

risks

to

give

greater

assurance to our stakeholders.

We continue to establish key partnerships

with

regional

partners

to

harness

the

synergies between our partners and us. We

believe that this strategic business model

allows us to co-bid and co-share the risks in

the process of securing a major contract.

Furthermore,

building

a

chain

of

partnerships throughout the region also

enables the Group to diversify our risks and

generate more business leads.

Environmental Aspect

Resource

and

Waste

Management

Unsustainable rate of waste output has

resulted

in

land

scarcity

for

waste

disposal

and

cost

pressures

due

to

resource scarcity.

At

Federal,

we

believe

that

the

integration

of

waste

and

resource

management efforts in our operations is

essential in ensuring sustainable business

growth. Being able to maximise resource

usage and reduce waste output will have

a significant impact on the Group’s effort

to reduce operational costs.

Our main wastes are paper used in offices

and packaging material, such as carton

boxes, plastic wraps and wooden pallets.

For goods packaging, we seek to reuse

packaging material and pallets to minimise

waste output.

For our office operations, employees are

encouraged to reduce, reuse and recycle

paper whenever possible. We have also

adopted a paperless e-statement system to

reduce paper usage.

Energy

Efficiency

In Singapore, the Government has placed

greater focus in reducing the carbon

footprint

of

industries

with

the

ratification of the Paris Agreement and

announcement

of

carbon

tax

to

be

implemented in 2019.

As a global corporate citizen, we also seek

to do our part to reduce our ecological

footprint. We recognise that investing in

energy conservation not only reduces our

carbon

footprint

but

also

reduces

business costs. Hence, we are committed

to minimising our energy consumption

and improving energy efficiency.

For our offices and warehouses, we have

installed energy efficient LED lightings and

motion-activated lightings to reduce energy

consumption.

Furthermore,

we

have

also

sought

to

consolidate our

point

of operations to

reduce unnecessary wastage of energy and

improve operational efficiency.

Environmental Aspect

Water

Stewardship

At Federal, we recognise that proper

water

stewardship

is

essential

in

managing the complexities of balancing

our water usage with the needs of our

environment and communities.

Given

that

certain

of

our

business

activities may lead to water degradation

or pollution, it is necessary for us to

properly manage our water to ensure

sustainability of our operations.

We actively track the usage of water across

our offices and warehouses. Water saving

kits

are

installed

to

reduce

water

consumption

and

employees

are

encouraged to conserve water whenever

possible.

For our industrial water plant, we perform

regular water testing and properly treat

wastewater

residue

before

they

are

discharged to ensure that water sources

near the plant are not contaminated.

Environmental

Compliance

In recent years, laws and regulations on

the

environmental

performance

of

businesses

have

become

stricter.

In

addition to more stringent regulations,

stronger enforcement of laws are also

being discussed

and

enacted

in the

emerging economies of Asia.

Being a responsible corporation, we seek

to

comply

with

all

environmental

regulations

implemented

in

the

jurisdictions that we operate in.

Various

committees,

such

as

the

ISO

Committee,

Risk

Committee

and

Sustainability Committee, are established to

monitor the Group’s operation to ensure

that we comply to various regulations and

standards.

that

We

provide

fair

for

Annually,

we

perform

employee

A Health and Safety Committee oversees the

health and safety of all our employees and

seek to create a work environment that is

Social Aspect

Product 

Responsibilities

We believe that product quality and

integrity form the foundation of the

reputation and trust that we seek to earn

in the markets that we operate in.

Product safety

and

reliability are of

paramount importance to our customers

who operate in the oil and gas industry

where occupational health and safety are

of their top priority. We seek to develop

and deliver quality products that are

compliant with the highest standards of

product certification.

We have established formal quality system

in compliance with ISO 9001 standards to

ensure

that

we

maintain

and

make

continuous improvements in our processes.

Our ISO Committee monitors and ensures

that we adhere to the ISO standards.

For products under our in-house brand, KVC

(UK), we have obtained several product

quality control accreditations.

Customer feedback channels are available

for our customers to provide feedbacks.

Community

Our Group

has benefitted

from the

support of our stakeholders and the

community to be where we are today.

Therefore, it is only fitting that as we

continue our growth, we also look at

giving back to the community.

Federal strives to be a socially conscious

business

by

giving

back

to

the

local

community on an ongoing basis and being

involved in community activities.

We seek to uphold a high standard of

comprising of independent non-executive

directors. Several board committees have

been

established

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT








Objective

We seek to create long-term economic value for our stakeholders through the building of a sustainable

business and brand.

Approach

At Federal, we focus on value creation for our stakeholders by placing their interests at the heart of what we

do to generate growth that is sustainable, profitable and responsible. To achieve our business and growth

objectives, we adopt the following strategies.

Firstly, we seek to strike strategic partnerships with regional partners. We believe that this will allow us to

leverage on the strengths of our partners and ours to secure high value contracts. Building a chain of

partnerships throughout the region also enables the Group to generate more business leads.

Secondly, we forge strong relationships with our bankers and government organisations such as Enterprise

Singapore to secure trade credit and funding for our projects.

Lastly, we remain prudent in the management of our business risks while we continue our growth. We have

established an Enterprise Risk Management Committee to monitor and evaluate business risks that the Group

faces. Our Sales and Finance team also work closely together to ensure that customer credit risk is properly

managed.

Our Performance

Our operations span across different geographical locations globally and provide employment for local

communities, contracts for local suppliers, and revenue for governments of the jurisdictions that we operate

in. FY2018 was a challenging year for us due to turbulent and uncertain market conditions. However, through

stringent management of costs and securing of high margin projects, we have continued to generate value for

stakeholders.

Target &amp; Plans

▪

Establish more strategic partnerships with regional partners

▪

Secure long-term contracts or investments to generate sustainable revenue stream

▪

Attain an average customer satisfaction rate of more than 80%

ENVIRONMENT

Objective

We are committed to managing and minimising our ecological footprint across our value chain, which includes

our business operations, suppliers and customers.

Approach

(a) Waste and Resource Management

Packaging materials, such as cartons, plastic wraps, strings, wooden pallets and paper are the key sources of

waste generated from our operations. Even though our direct ecological footprint is relatively small, we

believe in doing our part as a responsible corporate citizen and contributing to global goals of climate change

mitigation and resource conservation. We are supportive of various initiatives undertaken by our customers

and vendors to mitigate environmental impacts of our business.

We believe in engaging our employees and inspiring them to incorporate sustainability thinking into their

everyday work life. Employees are encouraged to ‘reduce, reuse, and recycle’ paper and packaging materials

whenever possible. We have recycling bins placed in the office for the recycling of paper and plastic. Used

papers are usually shredded and used as packaging material for our products. Pallets and boxes used in

packaging are also often reused.

Employees are also encouraged to opt for electronic modes of transmission when forwarding documents to

clients and suppliers. An electronic-filing system is established for mill certificates which not only reduces the

amount of paper used, but also makes documentation and information sharing more efficient.

We ensure that all wastes are properly disposed by licensed third-party waste management vendor.

(b) Water Stewardship

Where viable, we invest in water saving installations to achieve better water efficiency at our facilities. As part

of our ISO 14001 Environmental Management System objectives, we actively track our water consumption at

our facilities to provide information for management decision making. Furthermore, we constantly remind our

employees through posters and emails to adopt good practices in water conservation.

Water for our main trading operations are provided by public water utilities, while our industrial water plant in

Chengdu, China, mainly withdraw water from surface water sources. At the industrial water plant, we ensure

that by-products of the water treatment are processed in accordance to local regulatory requirements before

disposal. All mud and silts generated from the water treatment process is directed to a pool within our facility.

A natural dewatering facility will be built to treat the wastewater residue deposited in the pool. The residue

from the treatment will be applied to soil for conditioning purposes or dumping as fill.


(c) Energy Efficiency

In the conduct of our business, the main areas of energy usage are predominantly across our offices and

warehouse operations. For our offices and warehouses, we have installed energy efficient LED lightings and

motion-activated lightings to reduce energy consumption. We also have employee awareness initiatives to

encourage them to turn off lights and air-conditioning in offices when they are not in use.

Furthermore, we have also sought to consolidate our point of operations to improve energy and operational

efficiency. In 2017, we have consolidated our warehouses across Singapore to our leasehold property in Chin

Bee Drive. We also have plans to relocate all of our offices to the Chin Bee property by 2019.

(d) Environmental Compliance

Federal is committed to comply with all applicable environmental legal requirements enforced by local

authorities in all jurisdictions we operate in. The Environment, Health and Safety (“EHS”) Committee monitors

our operations and performs monthly reviews to ensure that we comply to relevant environmental

requirements and regulations. Annually, we also undergo certification audits by third-party auditors to ensure

that our processes adhere to international certification standards.

Our Performance

In FY2018, we have complied with all environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions we operate in and

there were no fines or penalties incurred for non-compliance.

Based on our annual water sampling, there is no incident of contamination or waste spillage at our industrial

water plant in Chengdu, China. In FY2018, approximately 400m3 of wastewater residue is produced and

deposited into our wastewater pool.

We have continued to monitor our electricity and water consumption. In FY2018, we managed to reduce our

energy usage by 2% as per our target in FY2017. In FY2018, we have withdrawn approximately 1.8 million m3

of water from surface water sources for treatment at our industrial water plant and 2,632 m3 of water from

public water utilities.

Target &amp; Plans

▪

Improve energy and water efficiency – reduce electricity and water intensity by 2% in the following year

▪

Zero incident of environmental regulations non-compliance

Objective

We seek to empower people and be socially responsible in the communities we operate in.

Approach

(a) Labour Practices &amp; Work Environment

(i) Talent Attraction and Retention

We are committed to providing all employees with equal opportunities for compensation, promotion and

training on a meritocratic basis. Annually, we review employee benefits to ensure that they remain

competitive and aligned with manpower regulations in the jurisdictions we operate in. As at 31 December

2018, the Group employs 176 individuals.

On a yearly basis, our performance appraisal system allows employees to receive formal feedback from their

supervisors on their job performance based on the key performance indicators (“KPI”) established, to

encourage continual improvement and development. The open performance appraisal system helps both

employees and their supervisors understand their respective expectations and align them with the needs of

the organisation.

For employees who have reached the retirement age, we have been actively extending re-employment to

them, in accordance to the Retirement and Re-employment Act. Additionally, a one-off Employee Assistance

Payment (“EAP”) are provided to employees who have reached the retirement age but are not eligible for re-

employment.

Federal celebrates employees who have been with us for every 5-year milestone with us by presenting long

service awards. Our heartfelt appreciation goes out to this group of valued and loyal employees.

(ii) Training &amp; Development

In addition to on-the-job training, we also send our

employees for training by external vendors to equip

our employees with the relevant skillsets to advance

in their expertise. The types of training encompass

those relevant to ISO standards for safety, first aid,

technical competencies and soft skills. We also

support

our

employees

in

their

personal

development by granting qualified employees who

are sitting for examinations with examination leave.









SOCIAL


(iii) Occupational Health &amp; Safety

The framework for our health and safety management is modelled after international standards. We have

attained certifications such as the ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.

As part of our orientation programme, new hires will attend safety courses to ensure that they have the

necessary training and skills relating to workplace safety. We also conduct annual emergency response drill

and fire drill to prepare our employees in handling emergency situations.

Monthly safety inspections are performed on all of our premises and to follow up on any rectification actions

required subsequently, if there are any safety hazards identified. To ensure that equipment and machinery are

operating safely, we perform periodical maintenance and repairs as well.

All our employees are offered outpatient medical and dental claims and any unused credits can be utilised by

their immediate family members.

Moreover, we provide basic employment insurance program which covers any injury or illness sustained in the

course of employment that requires medical, surgical or hospital treatment. Travel insurance will be provided

to employees who are required regularly travel overseas for business.

(iv) Benefits &amp; Welfare

We have welfare practices in-line with the Singapore legislations. Mothers and fathers of new-borns who are

Singapore Citizens, are entitled to maternity leave of 16 weeks and paternity leave of 2 weeks respectively, and

the Company will also present a small congratulatory token. For children who are not Singapore Citizens,

mothers get to enjoy 12 weeks of maternity leave. We also provide eligible employees with childcare leave and

extended childcare leave to manage their commitments in raising a young family.

To encourage a healthy work environment, we provide employees with flexi-time and part-time work

arrangement to suit their work and personal commitments. We have also established a Recreation Committee

(RC) to coordinate work-life balance initiatives and events for the Company.

(v) Diversity and Equality

We see great strength in the diversity of our workforce and the potential in each and every one of our

employees. Diversity provides different perspectives and fosters innovative thinking to solve business

challenges. Our Employee Code of Conduct guides us towards this aspiration.

We hire people from different backgrounds and have a diversified workforce across all age groups, races and

genders as we value the experiences and knowledge that different individuals bring to the Group. We adopt a

firm stance against human rights infringement and discrimination to ensure a conducive work environment for

our employees.

We respect the principles of freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, non-discrimination and

harassment, meritocratic and progressive human resource practices, and advocates the elimination of forced

or child labour. All employees under the Group are entitled to practice freedom of association, within

regulatory limits of each jurisdiction which we operate in.

(b) Product and Customer Service Quality

Providing quality products and services to our customers is our utmost priority. We understand that product

faults may often result in serious safety and operational issues for our customers. Therefore, we make it our

responsibility to ensure that all products sourced from our suppliers undergo stringent certification process

and are of the highest quality. We have established formal quality system in compliance with ISO 9001

standards to ensure that we maintain and make continuous improvements in our processes. Our ISO

Committee monitors and ensures that we adhere to the ISO standards.

For products under our in-house brand, KVC (UK), we have obtained several product quality control

accreditations, such as American Petroleum Institute (“API”) Specification Q1 and 6D monogram, Fire Test

Certification to API 607, Atmospheres Explosives (“ATEX”) marking, Safety Integrity Level II and Conformité

Européene (“CE”) marking as per Pressure Equipment Directive (“PED”), to assure customers of our product’s

reliability and safety.

We value all feedbacks provided by our customers and our Sales team work closely with our customers to

address any product quality and safety issues. Furthermore, we also perform annual customer satisfaction

survey to gather feedbacks from our customers.

(c) Community

As a socially conscious business and part of a larger community, we believe that we have a responsibility to do

our part for the betterment of the community. Apart from job creation, through donations and sponsorships,

we seek to empower the less fortunate or provide support to children or youths-at-risk.

Our Performance

(a) Labour Practices &amp; Work Environment

In the reporting period, there were no fines or penalties incurred for non-compliance to labour laws and

regulations in the various jurisdictions we have presence in. Furthermore, we have not received any reports of

labour malpractice or unfair treatment through our employee grievance channel. There were also no reported

workplace injury, fatality, occupational diseases, or cases of non-compliance in health and safety regulations.

In FY2018, we have participated in an initiative by Workforce Singapore (“WSG”), which included a workshop

training for key management skills, for Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (“PMET”), in

addition to staff training in various aspects such as safety and financial reporting. In FY2018, our employees

have completed an average of 4 training hours per employee.

Federal International (2000) Ltd | Sustainability Report

We also continually look to improve employee engagement and well-being. Hence, we have organised a staff

retreat in 2018 to motivate our staff, and extended the outreach of the weekly fruit day to our Indonesian

counterparts.

(b) Product and Customer Service Quality

Over the years, we have performed customer satisfaction surveys annually to gather customer feedback and

address any potential product quality and safety issues. In the survey, customers are asked to evaluate our

products’ reliability, timeliness in delivery, and support services. Overall, we have maintained a customer

satisfaction rate of more than 80% over the years, and there are no reported accidents caused by our products

in 2018.

In FY2018, there were no incidents of non-compliance concerning product and service information and

labelling, and marketing communication. There were also no complains concerning breaches of customer

Objective

We seek to uphold the highest standard of governance through our commitment to transparency and

accountability to our stakeholders.

Approach

(a) Corporate Governance

We ensure that the business is carried on and conducted in a proper and efficient manner adhering to the

principles and guidelines of the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 issued by the Monetary Authority of

Singapore (“MAS”) on 16 August 2018.

To serve the interests of the Group and its stakeholders, each Director capitalises on their strong operational

skills and their strategic networking relationship to govern issues that are brought before the Board of

Directors (the “Board”). We conduct orientation programmes for all newly appointed Directors. Formal letters,

which include details of the duties, are also issued to newly appointed Directors upon their appointment. All

directors are required to submit themselves for re-nomination and re-election once every three years.

An annual performance evaluation process is carried out to assess the effectiveness of the Board, by obtaining

insights from each Director on amongst others to propose changes which may be made to enhance the

performance of the Board and the Board Committees.

For more information on the Directors, Board committees and our corporate governance practices, please

refer to the Corporate Governance Statement, pages 17 to 37 of the Annual Report.

(b) Business Conduct and Ethics

We strive to inculcate a strong corporate culture within our Group and have zero tolerance towards corruption

and fraud. The employee handbook is made available to all employees, which covers penalties for misconduct

and fraud, and guides all employees in their everyday conduct. For new hires, they are made aware of our

stance against corruption and fraudulent activities during the orientation programme.

A Conflict of Interest Policy has been established to provide guidance to our employees. It consists of

guidelines to define such conflicts of interests and the necessary actions that the employee should undertake.

On an annual basis, we require all employees to declare any conflict of interests.

We have whistleblowing policy and channels to allow employees to report concerns over any unlawful

conduct, financial malpractice or other wrong-doings that poses risks to the Group, the public or the

environment. Through our independent whistleblowing channels, including the direct contacts of the Audit

Committee, employees are able to report any suspected misconducts without reprisal. Upon investigation, we

will ensure that the outcome of the investigation is communicated to the whistleblower.

In Singapore, all our operations are conducted in compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”),

which includes rules governing the collection, use and disclosure of personal data. We have appointed our

Group Human Resource Manager as the Company’s Data Protection Officer to oversee data protection

responsibilities within the Group and ensure compliance with the PDPA.

Federal International (2000) Ltd | Sustainability Report

GOVERNANCE


(c) Risk Management

We have enhanced our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework in 2018, which outlines the process of

identifying, analysing and managing strategic risks. It provides the methodology for integrating risk into the

strategic planning and resource allocations processes at the strategic level.

The Risk Management Committee, headed by our Executive Director, was appointed by the Board to fulfil its

risk management responsibilities. To generate and preserve value without compromising on potential

opportunities, the Risk Management Committee will evaluate benefits and associated risks, and seek to

optimise returns within the agreed risk appetite levels.

Besides monitoring the effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework, the Risk Management Committee is

also responsible for reviewing any incidents involving fraud or breakdown of the Group’s internal controls,

reviewing the Group’s insurance programme and reviewing public statements to be made by the Group.

Our Performance

Through our corporate governance and anti-corruption programmes, we have established a good corporate

culture within the Group. For the reporting period, there was no incident of employee dismissal or disciplinary

case for corruption and fraud. There was also no instance where contract with business partners were

terminated or not renewed due to violations related to corruption. Additionally, we have not received any

whistleblowing reports during the reporting period. For the reporting period, we have complied with all listing

requirements and legal regulations. No fines or penalties were incurred for regulatory non-compliance.

In November 2018, we have completed our Enterprise Risk Assessment based on the enhanced framework and

presented our findings to the Board.

Target &amp; Plans

▪

Zero incidents of bribery or corruptions

▪

Zero non-compliance breaches

▪

Zero complaints received relating to breaches of customer privacy

▪

Expand on the risk register for a more comprehensive assessment of risks and their treatment to manage

the Group’s risk exposure
