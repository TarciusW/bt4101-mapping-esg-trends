BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. 
and Subsidiaries 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
September 30, 2012 
Note 1. General 
The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes the terms
“us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) that included information
necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual
Report. Certain immaterial amounts in 2011 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Financial information in this report reflects any adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion
of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). 
For a number of reasons, our results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the
year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be relatively more significant to
results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Variations in the amount and timing of investment gains/losses can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. Investment gains/losses are recorded when investments are disposed
or are other-than-temporarily impaired. In addition, changes in the fair value of derivative assets/liabilities associated with derivative contracts can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings. 
Note 2. New accounting pronouncements 
As of January 1, 2012, we adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-26,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts.” ASU 2010-26 specifies that only direct incremental costs associated with successful efforts in acquiring or renewing of insurance contracts should be
capitalized and amortized over the policy term. All other costs are required to be expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs include certain advertising costs if the primary purpose of the advertising is to elicit sales to customers who could be shown
to have responded directly to the advertising and the probable future revenues generated are in excess of expected future costs to be incurred in realizing those revenues. Berkshire adopted ASU 2010-26 on a prospective basis. The impact of the
adoption of this new standard primarily relates to certain advertising costs of GEICO, which were capitalized prior to the adoption of ASU 2010-26, but are no longer eligible to be capitalized. The adoption of this new standard did not have a
material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  As of January 1, 2012, we also adopted ASU
2011-04, “Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.” As a result of adopting ASU 2011-04, we have expanded our fair value disclosures. 
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, “Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.” ASU
2011-11 enhances disclosures surrounding offsetting (netting) assets and liabilities. The standard applies to financial instruments and derivatives and requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about financial instruments and
derivatives eligible for offset in financial statements and financial instruments and derivatives subject to master netting arrangements. ASU 2011-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and is required to be
applied retrospectively. In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, “Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.” ASU 2012-02 allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether events and
circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If an entity determines that it is not more-likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not
required to perform a quantitative impairment test. ASU 2012-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. We are currently evaluating the effects these new standards will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 3. Significant business acquisitions 
Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses with consistent earning power, good returns
on equity and able and honest management at sensible prices. In the first nine months of 2012, we completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, which we consider as “bolt-on” acquisitions to several of our existing business
operations. Aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions was approximately $1.8 billion. We do not believe that these acquisitions are material, individually or in the aggregate, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 
Note 3. Significant business acquisitions (Continued) 
 
On September 16, 2011, Berkshire completed the acquisition of The
Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”) pursuant to a merger agreement, under which Berkshire acquired all of the outstanding shares of Lubrizol common stock for cash of $135 per share (approximately $8.7 billion in the aggregate). Lubrizol,
based in Cleveland, Ohio, is an innovative specialty chemical company that produces and supplies technologies to customers in the global transportation, industrial and consumer markets. These technologies include additives for engine oils, other
transportation-related fluids and industrial lubricants, as well as additives for gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition, Lubrizol makes ingredients and additives for personal care products and pharmaceuticals; specialty materials, including
plastics; and performance coatings. Lubrizol’s industry-leading technologies in additives, ingredients and compounds enhance the quality, performance and value of customers’ products, while reducing their environmental impact. We accounted
for the Lubrizol acquisition pursuant to the acquisition method. The valuation of the identified assets and liabilities and the resulting excess amount recorded as goodwill as of the acquisition date was completed as of December 31, 2011.
Lubrizol’s financial results are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning as of September 16, 2011.  We have owned a controlling interest in Marmon Holdings, Inc. (“Marmon”) since 2008. In the first quarter of 2011, we increased our ownership in Marmon to 80.2% as a result of acquiring 16.6% of
Marmon’s outstanding common stock for approximately $1.5 billion. We are contractually required to acquire substantially all of the remaining noncontrolling interests of Marmon no later than March 31, 2014, for an amount that will be based
on Marmon’s future operating results. In June 2011, we acquired all of the noncontrolling interests in Wesco Financial Corporation for aggregate consideration of $543 million, consisting of cash of approximately $298 million and 3,253,472
shares of Berkshire Class B common stock.

 Investments in foreign government securities include securities issued by national and
provincial government entities as well as instruments that are unconditionally guaranteed by such entities. As of September 30, 2012, approximately 96% of foreign government holdings were rated AA or higher by at least one of the major rating
agencies. Investments in obligations issued or guaranteed by Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands represented approximately 80% of the investments in foreign government obligations. Unrealized losses on all fixed
maturity investments in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than twelve consecutive months were $10 million as of September 30, 2012 and $20 million as of December 31, 2011.

 Included in other assets.  As of September 30, 2012, unrealized losses on equity securities in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than twelve consecutive months were $45 million. There were none as of
December 31, 2011. As of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, we concluded that the unrealized losses were temporary. Our conclusions were based on: (a) our ability and intent to hold the securities to recovery; (b) our
assessment that the underlying business and financial condition of each of these issuers was favorable; (c) our opinion that the relative price declines were not significant; and (d) our belief that it was reasonably possible that market
prices will increase to and exceed our cost in a relatively short period of time.

 In 2008, we acquired 50,000 shares of 10% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of GS
(“GS Preferred”) and warrants to purchase 43,478,260 shares of common stock of GS (“GS Warrants”) for a combined cost of $5 billion. The GS Preferred was redeemable at any time by GS at a price of $110,000 per share
($5.5 billion in aggregate). On April 18, 2011, GS fully redeemed our GS Preferred investment. We continue to hold the GS Warrants, which expire on October 1, 2013. The GS Warrants are exercisable for an aggregate cost of
$5 billion ($115/share).  In 2008, we acquired 30,000 shares of 10% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock
of GE (“GE Preferred”) and warrants to purchase 134,831,460 shares of common stock of GE (“GE Warrants”) for a combined cost of $3 billion. The GE Preferred was redeemable by GE beginning in October 2011 at a price of
$110,000 per share ($3.3 billion in aggregate). On October 17, 2011, GE fully redeemed our GE Preferred investment. We continue to hold the GE Warrants, which expire on October 16, 2013. The GE Warrants are exercisable for an
aggregate cost of $3 billion ($22.25/share).  In 2008, we acquired $4.4 billion par amount of 11.45%
Wrigley subordinated notes maturing in 2018 and $2.1 billion of 5% Wrigley preferred stock. The subordinated notes may be called prior to maturity at par plus the prepayment premium applicable at that time. In 2009, we also acquired
$1.0 billion par amount of Wrigley senior notes maturing in 2013 and 2014. We currently own $800 million of the Wrigley senior notes and an unconsolidated joint venture in which we hold a 50% economic interest owns $200 million. The Wrigley
subordinated and senior notes are classified as held-to-maturity and we carry these investments at cost, adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate changes that apply to certain of the senior notes. The Wrigley preferred stock is classified as
available-for-sale and recorded in our financial statements at fair value.  In 2009, we acquired 3,000,000
shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Dow (“Dow Preferred”) for a cost of $3 billion. Under certain conditions, we can convert each share of the Dow Preferred into 24.201 shares of Dow common stock
(equivalent to a conversion price of $41.32 per share). Beginning in April 2014, if Dow’s common stock price exceeds $53.72 per share for any 20 trading days in a consecutive 30-day window, Dow, at its option, at any time, in whole or in part,
may convert the Dow Preferred into Dow common stock at the then applicable conversion rate. The Dow Preferred is entitled to dividends at a rate of 8.5% per annum. 
On September 1, 2011, we acquired 50,000 shares of 6% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of BAC (“BAC
Preferred”) and warrants to purchase 700,000,000 shares of common stock of BAC (“BAC Warrants”) for a combined cost of $5 billion. The BAC Preferred is redeemable at any time by BAC at a price of $105,000 per share ($5.25 billion
in aggregate). The BAC Warrants expire in 2021 and are exercisable for an additional aggregate cost of $5 billion ($7.142857/share).

 During the first nine months of 2011, we realized an investment gain of $1.25 billion

 We record investments in equity and fixed maturity securities classified as
available-for-sale at fair value and record the difference between fair value and cost in other comprehensive income. OTTI losses recognized in earnings represent reductions in the cost basis of the investment, but not the fair value. Accordingly,
such losses that are included in earnings are generally offset by a corresponding credit to other comprehensive income and therefore have no net effect on shareholders’ equity as of the balance sheet date. 
In the first quarter of 2012, we recorded OTTI losses of $337 million on certain fixed maturity investments issued by
Texas Competitive Electric Holdings where we concluded that we were unlikely to receive all of the remaining contractual interest and principal amounts when due. In the first quarter of 2011, we recorded OTTI losses of $506 million related to
certain of our investments in equity securities. The OTTI losses included $337 million with respect to 103.6 million shares of our investment in Wells Fargo & Company (“Wells Fargo”) common stock. These shares had an
aggregate original cost of $3,621 million. At that time, we also held an additional 255.4 million shares of Wells Fargo which were acquired at an aggregate cost of $4,394 million and which had unrealized gains of $3,704 million as of
March 31, 2011. Due to the length of time that certain of our Wells Fargo shares were in a continuous unrealized loss position and because we account for realized gains and losses from dispositions on a specific identification basis, accounting
regulations required us to record the unrealized losses in earnings. However, the unrealized gains were not reflected in earnings but were instead recorded directly in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income.

 Allowances for uncollectible loans predominantly relate to consumer installment loans.
Provisions for consumer loan losses were $243 million in the first nine months of 2012 and $255 million for the first nine months of 2011. Loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, for the first nine months were $256 million in 2012 and $239 million
in 2011. Consumer loan amounts are net of unamortized acquisition discounts of $475 million at September 30, 2012 and $500 million at December 31, 2011. At September 30, 2012, approximately 96% of consumer installment loan balances
were evaluated collectively for impairment, whereas about 77% of commercial loan balances were evaluated individually for impairment. As a part of the evaluation process, credit quality indicators are reviewed and loans are designated as performing
or non-performing. At September 30, 2012, approximately 98% of consumer installment and commercial loan balances were determined to be performing and approximately 93% of those balances were current as to payment status.

Note 12. Derivative contracts 
As of September 30, 2012, derivative contracts are used primarily in our finance and financial
products and energy businesses. Substantially all of the derivative contracts of our finance and financial products businesses are not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. Changes in the fair values of such contracts are reported
in earnings as derivative gains/losses. We entered into these contracts with the expectation that the premiums received would exceed the amounts ultimately paid to counterparties. A summary of derivative contracts of our finance and financial
products businesses follows (in millions).

 The equity index put option contracts are European style options written on four major
equity indexes. Future payments, if any, under these contracts will be required if the underlying index value is below the strike price at the contract expiration dates. We received the premiums on these contracts in full at the contract inception
dates and therefore have no counterparty credit risk. We have written no new contracts since February 2008. 
At September 30, 2012, the aggregate intrinsic value (which is the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are
settled on their future expiration dates based on the September 30, 2012 index values and foreign currency exchange rates) was approximately $5.4 billion. At December 31, 2011, the aggregate intrinsic value of these contracts, assuming the
contracts were settled on that date, was approximately $6.2 billion. However, these contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates which occur between June 2018 and January 2026. Therefore, the ultimate
amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined for many years. The remaining weighted average life of all contracts was approximately 8.2 years at September 30, 2012. 
Our credit default contracts were written on various indexes of non-investment grade (or “high yield”)
corporate issuers, as well as investment grade corporate and state/municipal debt issuers. These contracts cover the loss in value of specified debt obligations of the issuers arising from default events, which are usually from their failure to make
payments or bankruptcy. Loss amounts are subject to aggregate contract limits. We have written no new contracts since February 2009.  State/municipality credit contract exposures as of September 30, 2012 relate to more than 500 debt issues with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2054 and having a weighted average term of 19 years.
Pursuant to the contract terms, future loss payments, if any, cannot be settled before the maturity dates of the underlying obligations. In August 2012, contracts with notional values of $8.25 billion were terminated. We have no further obligations
with respect to the terminated contracts.

Note 12. Derivative contracts (Continued) 
 
All individual investment grade and high-yield corporate contracts
in-force as of September 30, 2012 expire between December 2012 and December 2013, including $6.1 billion of notional value under contracts expiring by September 30, 2013. Future losses, if any, under substantially all of the high yield
index contracts currently in-force are subject to sizable aggregate deductibles that must be satisfied before we have any payment obligations.  Premiums under individual corporate credit default contracts are, generally, due from counterparties on a quarterly basis over the terms of the contracts. Otherwise, we have no counterparty credit risk
under our credit default contracts because all premiums were received at the inception of the contracts.  With
limited exceptions, our equity index put option and credit default contracts contain no collateral posting requirements with respect to changes in the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts and/or a downgrade of Berkshire’s credit
ratings. As of September 30, 2012, our collateral posting requirement under contracts with collateral provisions was $150 million compared to $238 million at December 31, 2011. If Berkshire’s credit ratings (currently AA+ from
Standard & Poor’s and Aa2 from Moody’s) are downgraded below either A- by Standard & Poor’s or A3 by Moody’s, additional collateral of up to $1.1 billion could be required to be posted. 
Our regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the market prices in the purchases and sales of natural
gas and electricity and in the purchases of fuel. Derivative instruments, including forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options, are used to manage a portion of these price risks. Unrealized gains and losses under the contracts of our
regulated utilities that are probable of recovery through rates are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Unrealized gains or losses on contracts accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income or in net earnings, as appropriate. Derivative contract assets are included in other assets of railroad, utilities and energy businesses and were $33 million and $71 million as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011,
respectively. Derivative contract liabilities are included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities of railroad, utilities and energy businesses and were $230 million and $336 million as of September 30, 2012 and December 31,
2011, respectively.

 MidAmerican subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing
agreements. All, or substantially all, of the assets of certain MidAmerican subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure the debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants including, but
not limited to, leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and debt service coverage ratios. In the first nine months of 2012, MidAmerican subsidiaries issued approximately $2.5 billion of new debt with interest rates from 1.43% to 5.75% and
maturities ranging from 2013 to 2042. In the fourth quarter of 2012, MidAmerican and subsidiary debt of approximately $850 million will mature. In March and August 2012, BNSF issued in the aggregate $2.5 billion in debentures, comprised of $1,225
million of 3.05% debentures due in 2022, $625 million of 4.40% debentures due in 2042 and $650 million of 4.375% debentures due in 2042. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily unsecured. As of September 30, 2012, BNSF and MidAmerican and their
subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt or other borrowings of BNSF, MidAmerican or their subsidiaries.

 BHFC is a 100% owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, which has fully and unconditionally
guaranteed BHFC’s borrowings. During the first nine months of 2012, $2.7 billion of BHFC notes matured. In May and September 2012, BHFC issued in the aggregate $2.35 billion of senior notes consisting of $1,075 million of 1.6% notes due in
2017, $550 million of 3.0% notes due in 2022 and $725 million of 4.4% notes due in 2042.  Certain of our
subsidiaries in the aggregate have approximately $5.1 billion of unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity at September 30, 2012, to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. In addition to borrowings of
BHFC, Berkshire guarantees approximately $4.5 billion of other subsidiary borrowings as of September 30, 2012. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee
for the full and prompt payment when due of all present and future payment obligations.

 The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using
market or income approaches. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be
realized in an actual current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value. 
The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3. 
Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active
markets. Substantially all of our investments in equity securities are traded on an exchange in active markets and fair values are based on the closing prices as of the balance sheet date. 
Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or
liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other
means. Fair values of investments in fixed maturity securities and notes payable and other borrowings are primarily based on price evaluations which incorporate market prices for identical instruments in inactive markets and market data available
for instruments with similar characteristics. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit rating, estimated duration and
yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector.  Level 3 –
Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and
we may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in pricing assets or liabilities. Fair
value measurements of non-exchange traded derivative contracts and certain other investments are based primarily on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to be used by market participants.
 A reconciliation of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the
use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the first nine months of 2011 follows (in millions).

 During the first nine months of 2011, we transferred our investments in GS Preferred
Stock and GE Preferred Stock from Level 3 to Level 2 given the then pending redemptions of the investments which occurred on April 18, 2011 and October 17, 2011, respectively. There were no transfers into Level 3 for the first nine months
of 2012 or 2011. On September 1, 2011, we acquired preferred stock and common stock warrants of the Bank of America Corporation at an aggregate cost of $5 billion. 
Gains and losses included in earnings are included as components of investment gains/losses, derivative gains/losses and
other revenues, as appropriate and are related to changes in valuations of derivative contracts and settlement transactions. Gains and losses included in other comprehensive income are included as components of the net change in unrealized
appreciation of investments and the reclassification of investment appreciation in earnings, as appropriate in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
Quantitative information as of September 30, 2012, with respect to assets and liabilities measured and carried at

 For certain credit default and other derivative contracts where we could not corroborate
that the fair values or the inputs were observable in the market, fair values were based on non-binding price indications obtained from third party sources. Management reviewed these values relative to the terms of the contracts, the current facts,
circumstances and market conditions, and concluded they were reasonable. We did not adjust these prices and therefore, they have been excluded from the preceding table. 
Our other investments that are carried at fair value consist of a few relatively large private placement transactions and
include perpetual preferred stocks and common stock warrants. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and/or provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted estimated
cash flow techniques in valuing the perpetual preferred stocks, we made assumptions regarding the expected durations of the investments, as the issuers may have the right to redeem or convert these investments. We also made estimates regarding the
impact of subordination, as the preferred stocks have a lower priority in liquidation than the investment grade debt instruments of the issuers, which affected the discount rates. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation
model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we are subject to the aforementioned contractual restrictions. We have applied discounts with respect to the contractual restrictions. Increases or decreases to these inputs would result
in decreases or increases to the fair values.

Note 15. Fair value measurements (Continued) 
 
Our equity index put option and credit default contracts are not
exchange traded and certain contract terms are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts and many contracts have long durations, and therefore are illiquid. For these and
other reasons, we classified these contracts as Level 3. The methods we use to value these contracts are those that we believe market participants would use in determining exchange prices with respect to our contracts. 
We value equity index put option contracts based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to this model
include current index price, contract duration, dividend and interest rate inputs (which include a Berkshire non-performance input) which are observable. However, the valuation of long-duration options is inherently subjective, given the lack of
observable transactions and prices, and acceptable values may be subject to wide ranges. Expected volatility inputs represent our expectations after considering the remaining duration of each contract and that the contracts will remain outstanding
until the expiration dates without offsetting transactions occurring in the interim. Increases or decreases in the volatility inputs will produce increases or decreases in the fair values. 
Our state and municipality credit default contract values reflect credit default spreads, contract durations, interest
rates, bond prices and other inputs believed to be used by market participants in estimating fair value. We utilize discounted cash flow valuation models, which incorporate the aforementioned inputs as well as our own estimates of credit default
spreads for states and municipalities where there is no observable input. Increases or decreases to the credit default spreads will produce increases or decreases in the fair values.

 Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock

rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder,
into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock.  On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,652,388 shares outstanding as of September 30, 2012 and 1,650,806 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2011. In addition to our
common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued and outstanding.  In
September 2011, our Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program whereby it authorized Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices no higher than a 10% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire
may repurchase shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, at management’s discretion. Berkshire’s Board of Directors’ authorization does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However,
repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely and the amount of repurchases will depend entirely upon the level
of cash available, the attractiveness of investment and business opportunities either at hand or on the horizon and the degree of discount of the market price relative to management’s estimate of intrinsic value. The repurchase program does not
obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares.

 Includes earnings of Lubrizol from the acquisition date of September 16, 2011. 
Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on
an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day
business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head
each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance efforts, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to its
employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) should
be read in conjunction with this discussion.  In 2012, insurance underwriting activities generated after-tax
earnings of $392 million for the third quarter and $1,065 million for the first nine months. In the first nine months of 2012, the aggregate impact of catastrophe losses, changes in retroactive reinsurance liabilities and foreign currency gains and
losses was relatively insignificant. Insurance underwriting earnings for the third quarter of 2011 included an after-tax gain of $855 million from the reduction in estimated liabilities related to retroactive reinsurance contracts which was
primarily attributable to lower than expected loss experience of one ceding company and from reductions in certain reinsurance contract liabilities that are settled in foreign currencies due to changes in currency exchange rates. During the first
nine months of 2011, our reinsurance operations also incurred insurance losses of approximately $1.3 billion, after tax, from several significant catastrophe events, most of which occurred in the first quarter. 
Our railroad and utilities and energy businesses continued to generate significant earnings in 2012. Earnings from our
manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2012 increased significantly over 2011 due primarily to the acquisition of The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”), which was completed on September 16, 2011. Lubrizol’s results
are fully included for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 and for the post-September 16 periods of 2011, as a component of manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in the preceding table. Excluding the impact of Lubrizol,
earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses were mixed, reflecting modest improvements in building and construction in the U.S., and deterioration in several foreign markets affecting certain of our manufacturing and service
operations.  In the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, investment and derivative gains/losses
included after-tax losses from derivative contracts of $76 million and $119 million, respectively. In 2011, derivative contracts produced after-tax losses of $1,587 million in the third quarter and $1,531 million in the first nine months. In the
third quarter of 2012, we also recognized after-tax investment gains of $597 million from sales of securities and repayments of certain loan portfolios. In the second quarter of 2011, we recognized an after-tax gain of approximately $806 million
from the redemption of our investment in Goldman Sachs 10% Preferred Stock. We believe that realized investment gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. The timing and
magnitude of investment and derivative gains and losses has caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.  Insurance—Underwriting  We engage in both
primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we
assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are: (1) GEICO, (2) General Re,
(3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) and (4) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. General Re and BHRG also reinsure life and health risks.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (Continued)   
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued) 
 
Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct
operations – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett.
Accordingly, we evaluate the performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses.  Our periodic underwriting results are affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for loss occurrences in prior years. In
the first nine months of 2012, we recorded net reductions of approximately $150 million with respect to unpaid losses on retroactive reinsurance contracts. In the third quarter of 2011, we reduced unpaid losses related to certain retroactive
reinsurance contracts by approximately $875 million. In addition, the timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. Incurred losses
from catastrophes occurring in the first nine months of 2012 were relatively insignificant. In the first nine months of 2011, we recorded aggregate pre-tax provisions for estimated catastrophe losses of approximately $2 billion arising from several
events, including the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, as well as weather related events in Australia and the U.S. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the
changes in the valuations of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In recent years, currency exchange rates have been volatile and the resulting impact on our
underwriting results has been significant.  A key marketing strategy followed by all of our insurance
businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength. Statutory surplus of our insurance businesses was approximately $95 billion at December 31, 2011. This superior capital strength creates opportunities to negotiate and enter
into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of insurance and reinsurance buyers.  Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized as follows. Amounts are in millions.

Premiums earned in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012
increased $333 million (8.5%) and $988 million (8.7%), respectively, compared to premiums earned in the corresponding 2011 periods. The growth in premiums earned for voluntary auto was 8.7% as a result of a 5.9% increase in policies-in-force
and a 2.8% increase in average premium per policy over the past twelve months. Voluntary auto new business sales in the first nine months of 2012 declined slightly compared with 2011. Voluntary auto policies-in-force at September 30, 2012 were
approximately 547,000 greater than at December 31, 2011.  Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in
the third quarter of 2012 declined $89 million (2.9%) and increased $382 million (4.4%) in the first nine months compared to the corresponding 2011 periods. The loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to
premiums earned) was 73.4% in the first nine months of 2012 and 76.4% in the first nine months of 2011. In 2012, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected no significant changes in collision and physical damage frequencies, a sharp decline in
comprehensive frequencies (due to lower catastrophe losses) and modestly higher average claims severities in most of the significant coverage categories. In the first nine months of 2012, bodily injury severities generally increased in the two to
four percent range versus 2011, while physical damage severities increased in the three to five percent range. In 2012, catastrophe losses were $15 million in the third quarter and $151 million in the first nine months. In 2011, catastrophe losses
were $116 million in the third quarter and $240 million in the first nine months.  Underwriting expenses
incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 increased $101 million (14.6%) and $502 million (24.1%), respectively, over underwriting expenses incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. The increases were
primarily the result of a change in U.S. GAAP concerning deferred policy acquisition costs (“DPAC”). DPAC represents the underwriting costs that are eligible to be capitalized and expensed as premiums are earned over the policy period.
Upon adoption of the new accounting standard as of January 1, 2012, GEICO ceased deferring a large portion of its direct advertising costs. The new accounting standard was adopted on a prospective basis and as a result, DPAC recorded as of
December 31, 2011 is being amortized to expense over the remainder of the related policy periods and policy acquisition costs related to policies written and renewed after December 31, 2011 are being deferred at lower levels than in the
past. The new accounting standard for DPAC does not impact the cash basis periodic underwriting costs or our assessment of GEICO’s underwriting performance. However, the new accounting standard accelerates the timing of when certain
underwriting costs are recognized in earnings.  We estimate that GEICO’s underwriting expenses for the
first nine months of 2012 would have been about $410 million less had we computed DPAC under the prior accounting standard and that, as a result, GEICO’s expense ratio (the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in 2012 would have
been less than in 2011. The effect of transitioning to this new accounting standard was substantially completed as of September 30, 2012.  General Re  Through General Re, we conduct a reinsurance
business offering property and casualty and life and health coverages to clients worldwide. We write property and casualty reinsurance in North America on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through
Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly-owned affiliates. Property and casualty reinsurance is also written through brokers with respect to Faraday in London. Life and health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re
Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG. General Re strives to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of its product lines. Our management does not evaluate underwriting performance based upon market share and
our underwriters are instructed to reject inadequately priced risks. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe and large individual losses has produced and is expected to continue to produce significant volatility in General Re’s periodic
underwriting results. General Re’s underwriting results are summarized in the following table. Amounts are in millions.

 Property/casualty 
Property/casualty premiums earned in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 declined $23 million (3.1%) and
$56 million (2.5%), respectively, versus the corresponding 2011 periods. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned in the first nine months of 2012 increased $34 million (1.5%). Price competition in most
property and casualty lines persists and the volume of business written in recent years has been less than our capacity. Our underwriters continue to exercise discipline by not accepting offers to write business where prices are deemed inadequate.
We remain prepared to increase premium volumes should market conditions improve.

Property/casualty operations produced net underwriting gains of $118
million and $354 million in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012, respectively. For the first nine months of 2012, underwriting results included net underwriting gains of $343 million from property business and $11 million from
casualty/workers’ compensation business. The property underwriting results during the first nine months of 2012 reflected an absence of significant catastrophe losses during the year as well as underwriting gains from the run-off of prior
years’ business, including reductions of liabilities established for prior years’ catastrophe losses. The underwriting gains from casualty/workers’ compensation business included favorable run-off of prior years’ business, offset
in part by $79 million of loss reserve discount accretion and deferred charge amortization.  The
property/casualty operations generated underwriting gains of $114 million in the third quarter of 2011 and underwriting losses of $169 million for the first nine months of 2011. In 2011, the property business produced underwriting gains of $86
million in the third quarter and net underwriting losses of $267 million for the first nine months. In 2011, property underwriting results included catastrophe losses of $126 million in the third quarter and $787 million in the first nine months
related to a number of events including the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand and various tornado and other weather related loss events in the United States, Europe and Australia. The casualty/workers’ compensation business generated
underwriting gains of $98 million for the first nine months of 2011, reflecting overall reductions in estimated prior years’ casualty loss reserves.  Life/health  Premiums earned in 2012 increased $30 million
(4.4%) in the third quarter and $79 million (3.8%) in the first nine months over the premiums earned in the corresponding 2011 periods. Adjusting for the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes, premiums earned in the first nine
months of 2012 increased $211 million (10.1%) versus 2011, which was primarily attributable to increased non-U.S. life business.  Life/health operations produced net underwriting gains of $36 million in the third quarter of 2012 and $19 million during the first nine months of 2012. Underwriting results in 2012 reflected favorable
claims experience across most regions in Europe and reductions in estimated liabilities related to the 2011 earthquakes in New Zealand and Japan. However, in 2012, underwriting results were negatively impacted by greater than expected claims
frequency and duration in the individual and group disability business in Australia and to a lesser extent, by increased losses in the U.S. health business. In 2011, life/health operations produced underwriting gains of $34 million in the third
quarter and $123 million for the first nine months. The third quarter underwriting gains were driven by lower than expected mortality in our international operations. Underwriting results in the first nine months of 2011 were negatively affected by
losses attributable to the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand and losses attributable to increased frequency and severity of life claims in the U.S.  Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) 
Through BHRG, we underwrite excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for
insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG’s business includes catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance and excess primary and facultative reinsurance for large or otherwise unusual property risks referred to as individual risk. BHRG also writes
retroactive reinsurance, which provides indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Other multi-line business refers to other property and casualty business written on both a quota-share and excess basis
and includes a quota-share contract with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd. (“Swiss Re”) covering a 20% share of substantially all of Swiss Re’s property/casualty contracts incepting between January 1, 2008 and December 31,
2012. We currently do not anticipate that the Swiss Re quota-share contract will be renewed or extended. BHRG also underwrites life reinsurance and annuity risks. BHRG’s underwriting results are summarized in the table below. Amounts are in

Premiums earned in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 from
catastrophe and individual risk contracts exceeded premiums earned in the corresponding 2011 periods by $23 million (12%) and $49 million (9%), respectively. Catastrophe reinsurance premiums written in the third quarter and first nine months of
2012 were approximately 20% greater than premiums written in the comparable 2011 periods. The level of business written in a given period will vary significantly due to changes in market conditions and management’s assessment of the adequacy of
premium rates. In recent years, we have generally constrained the volume of business written as premium rates have not been attractive enough to warrant increasing volume. However, we have the capacity and will to write substantially more business
when appropriate pricing can be obtained.  Catastrophe and individual risk underwriting results for the first
nine months of 2012 reflected no significant losses from catastrophe events. Catastrophe and individual risk underwriting results for the first nine months of 2011 included estimated losses of $454 million, which were attributable to the earthquakes
in Japan and New Zealand. The timing and magnitude of losses produces extraordinary volatility in periodic underwriting results of this business.  Premiums earned under retroactive reinsurance contracts in the first nine months of 2012 primarily derived from four new contracts. In the first nine months of 2011 premiums earned included approximately
$1.7 billion from a single reinsurance contract with Eaglestone Reinsurance Company, a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”). Under the contract, we agreed to reinsure the bulk of AIG’s U.S. asbestos liabilities.
The AIG agreement provides for a maximum limit of indemnification of $3.5 billion.  Retroactive reinsurance
policies generally provide very large, but limited, indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Such losses are recognized at the estimated ultimate amount and are usually expected to be paid over long
periods of time. At the inception of a contract, deferred charge assets are recorded as the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate losses over the premiums earned. Deferred charge balances are subsequently amortized over the estimated claims
payment period using the interest method, which reflects estimates of the timing and amount of loss payments. Deferred charge balances are also adjusted to reflect changes in the timing and amount of actual and re-estimated future loss payments. The
recurring periodic amortization of deferred charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of loss payments are included in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses.
 The underwriting results from retroactive policies in 2012 and 2011 reflected the recurring periodic
amortization of deferred charges. In 2012, amortization charges were partially offset by net reductions in estimated unpaid losses of about $150 million with respect to contracts written in prior years. During the third quarter of 2011, we
recognized a net reduction in estimated unpaid losses with respect to contracts written in prior years of approximately $875 million, which was primarily attributable to lower than expected loss experience related to one contract. At
September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, unamortized deferred charges for all of BHRG’s retroactive contracts were approximately $3.8 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. Gross unpaid losses from retroactive reinsurance
contracts were approximately $18.3 billion at September 30, 2012, compared to approximately $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2011.  Premiums earned in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 from other multi-line property and casualty business increased $329 million (33%) and $679 million (22%), respectively, over the
corresponding 2011 periods. Premiums earned in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 included $848 million and $2,408 million, respectively, from the Swiss Re quota-share contract. Premiums earned in the third quarter and first nine months
of 2011 from this contract were $686 million and $2,061 million, respectively. In 2012, premiums earned also included increased amounts earned under other quota-share contracts. There were no significant catastrophe loss events in 2012. We incurred
catastrophe losses of $724 million in the first nine months of 2011, which were primarily in connection with the Swiss Re quota-share contract and arose primarily from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand. In 2012, other multi-line property and
casualty underwriting results also included foreign currency transaction losses of $118 million in the third quarter and $81 million in the first nine months arising from the conversion of certain reinsurance liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies into U.S. Dollars. In the comparable periods of 2011, we recorded foreign currency transaction gains of $434 million and $41 million, respectively. The foreign currency transaction gains and losses reflected the volatility in exchange
rates, primarily between the U.S. Dollar and the Swiss Franc and U.K. Pound Sterling.  Life and annuity
premiums earned in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 increased $213 million (40%) and $478 million (31%), respectively, over premiums earned in the comparable 2011 periods. Substantially all of the increases were attributable to
new annuity contracts. Underwriting losses in 2012 from the life and annuity business were $55 million for the third quarter and $173 million for the first nine months. During the first nine months of 2012, the life reinsurance business produced
underwriting losses of $56 million in 2012 versus underwriting gains of $11 million in the comparable prior year period. The underwriting losses

in 2012 were attributed to higher than expected mortality. The annuity business
generated underwriting losses of $117 million in the first nine months of 2012 and $77 million in the comparable prior year period. Annuity underwriting losses reflect the periodic discount accretion of the discounted liabilities established for
such contracts as well as adjustments for mortality experience. At September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, annuity liabilities were approximately $2.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. 
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group  Our primary insurance group consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance businesses that principally write liability coverages for commercial accounts. These businesses include: Medical
Protective Corporation and Princeton Insurance Company (acquired as of December 30, 2011), providers of professional liability insurance to physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers; National Indemnity Company’s primary group,
writers of commercial motor vehicle and general liability coverages; U.S. Investment Corporation, whose subsidiaries underwrite specialty insurance coverages; a group of companies referred to internally as “Berkshire Hathaway Homestate
Companies,” providers of commercial multi-line insurance, including workers’ compensation; Central States Indemnity Company, a provider of credit and disability insurance to individuals nationwide through financial institutions; Applied
Underwriters, a provider of integrated workers’ compensation solutions; and BoatU.S., a writer of insurance for owners of boats and small watercraft.  Premiums earned in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 by our various primary insurers increased $127 million (28%) and $325 million (25%), respectively, over the corresponding prior year
amounts. The increases in premiums earned in 2012 were primarily due to increased volume of workers’ compensation insurance from the Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies and premiums from Princeton Insurance Company. Premium volume of certain
of our primary insurers continues to be constrained by market conditions. We have the capacity and desire to write substantially more volume when market conditions improve. For the first nine months, our primary insurers produced underwriting gains
of $243 million in 2012 and $168 million in 2011. Underwriting gains as percentages of premiums earned in the first nine months were approximately 15% in 2012 and 13% in 2011.  Insurance—Investment Income  A summary of net

 Investment income consists of interest and dividends earned on cash and investments of
our insurance businesses. Pre-tax investment income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 declined $62 million (6%) and $282 million (8%) from investment income earned in the comparable 2011 periods. The declines in investment
income in 2012 reflected the redemptions in 2011 of our investments in Goldman Sachs 10% Preferred Stock (insurance subsidiaries held 87% of the $5 billion aggregate investment) and in General Electric 10% Preferred Stock ($3 billion aggregate
investment). Dividends earned by our insurance subsidiaries from these investments were $75 million in the third quarter and $416 million in the first nine months of 2011. Investment income in the 2012 periods reflected dividends earned from our
investment in Bank of America 6% Preferred Stock (insurance subsidiaries hold 80% of the $5 billion aggregate investment) and increased dividend rates with respect to several of our common stock holdings. Our investment income over the remainder of
2012 will continue to be negatively affected by the aforementioned redemptions, given the comparatively lower yields currently available from new investment opportunities. We also continue to hold significant cash and cash equivalent balances
earning near zero yields. However, our management believes that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and strongly insists on safety over yield with respect to cash and cash equivalents. 
Invested assets derive from shareholder capital and reinvested earnings as well as net liabilities under insurance
contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges
assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $72.0 billion at September 30, 2012 and $70.6 billion at December 31, 2011. For the first nine months of 2012 and 2011, the cost of
float, as represented by the ratio of our underwriting gain or loss to average float, was negative as our insurance group generated a net underwriting gain in each period.

 Revenues during the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 were approximately $5.3
billion and $15.4 billion, respectively, representing increases of $382 million (8%) and $1,123 million (8%), respectively, over 2011. Overall, the increases in revenues in 2012 reflected higher average revenues per car/unit of approximately 2%
for the third quarter and 4% for the first nine months as well

as increases in cars/units handled (“volume”) of 5% for the third quarter and
3% for the first nine months. Revenues in each period include fuel surcharges to customers under programs intended to recover incremental fuel costs when fuel prices exceed threshold fuel prices. Fuel surcharges decreased by 4% for the third quarter
and increased 6% for the first nine months as compared to 2011, and are reflected in average revenue per car/unit.  The increase in overall volume during the third quarter of 2012 included increases in consumer products (4%), industrial products (14%), coal (4%) and agricultural products (3%). The increase in
overall volume during the first nine months of 2012 included increases in consumer products (5%) and industrial products (13%). Those increases were offset by declines in volume for coal (3%) and for agricultural products (3%). The
consumer products volume increase was primarily attributable to higher domestic intermodal and automotive volume. Industrial products volume increased primarily as a result of increased shipments of petroleum products, as well as increased sand
shipments. The increase in coal unit volume in the third quarter 2012 as compared to the third quarter 2011 was due to impacts of severe flooding along key coal routes during the third quarter of 2011. The overall decline in coal unit volume for the
first nine months of 2012 was attributable to decreased coal demand as a result of low natural gas prices, a mild winter and spring and high utility stockpiles. Agricultural product volume increased during the third quarter of 2012 as compared to
the third quarter of 2011 due to higher soybean shipments. Agricultural product volume decreased during the first nine months of 2012 compared to 2011 due to a decline in wheat and corn shipments for export partially offset by higher soybean and
U.S. corn shipments.  Operating expenses in 2012 for the third quarter and first nine months increased $95
million (3%) and $447 million (4%), respectively, compared to 2011. Compensation and benefits expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 increased $80 million and $128 million, respectively, compared to 2011 primarily
reflecting volume-related increases. Fuel expenses in the third quarter of 2012 were the same as fuel expenses in 2011, while fuel expenses in the first nine months of 2012 increased $162 million (5%) over 2011 due to higher fuel prices and
volume increases, partially offset by improved fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency in the second and third quarters of 2011 was negatively impacted by severe weather conditions. Purchased services costs in the third quarter and first nine months of
2012 increased $30 million (5%) and $117 million (7%), respectively, compared to 2011 due primarily to higher volume-related costs, including purchased transportation for BNSF Logistics, a wholly-owned third-party logistics company, and
increased equipment maintenance costs, partially offset by weather impacts in 2011. Interest expense in 2012 increased $15 million (11%) in the third quarter and $44 million (11%) in the first nine months versus 2011 due principally to
higher average outstanding debt balances.  Utilities and Energy (“MidAmerican”) 
We hold an 89.8% ownership interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (“MidAmerican”), which operates an
international energy business. MidAmerican’s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of two regulated utility companies, PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”). MidAmerican also owns two interstate natural gas
pipeline companies. In the United Kingdom, MidAmerican owns two electricity distribution businesses, operating as Northern Powergrid Holdings Company (“Northern Powergrid”). The rates that utility and natural gas pipeline companies charge
customers for energy and other services are generally subject to regulatory approval. Rates are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such
costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, MidAmerican also owns a diversified portfolio of independent power projects, including recently-acquired solar and wind projects, and the second-largest
residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States. Revenues and earnings from MidAmerican are summarized below. Amounts are in millions.

PacifiCorp’s revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of
2012 increased $135 million (11%) and $275 million (8%), respectively, over revenues in the same periods of 2011. The revenue increases were primarily due to higher retail revenues of $105 million for the third quarter and $229 million for the
first nine months. The increases in retail revenues were principally attributable to higher prices approved by regulators of $82 million for the third quarter and $191 million for the first nine months. In 2012 PacifiCorp also experienced
higher customer load in Utah due to the impacts of hot weather, partially offset by lower industrial customer load in Wyoming and Oregon as certain large customers elected to self-generate their own power. 
PacifiCorp’s earnings before corporate interest and taxes (“EBIT”) in 2012 increased $74 million
(32%) in the third quarter and $89 million (15%) in the first nine months compared to EBIT in the corresponding 2011 periods. The EBIT increases reflected increased operating earnings and lower interest expense. The increases in operating
earnings in 2012 resulted from higher revenues (from rates and customer loads), partially offset by higher energy costs and other operating expenses, as well as increased depreciation and amortization from higher plant in service. 
MEC’s revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 declined $37 million (4%) and $236 million
(9%), respectively, compared to 2011. In 2012, MEC’s regulated electric revenues increased 5% in the third quarter to $511 million. Regulated electric revenues were approximately $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2012, which was
relatively unchanged from 2011. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, regulated natural gas revenues declined $12 million and $121 million, respectively, versus 2011, reflecting lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold and lower
volumes. Gas volume declined 6% in the first nine months of 2012 versus 2011, attributable to unseasonably warm weather in the first half of the year. In 2012, nonregulated and other operating revenues declined $50 million for the third quarter and
$137 million for the first nine months compared to 2011, due to generally lower electricity and natural gas prices and volumes.  MEC’s EBIT declined $3 million (3%) in the third quarter and $21 million (9%) in the first nine months of 2012 compared to 2011, which reflected lower operating earnings, partially offset
by lower interest expense. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, regulated electric operating earnings were relatively unchanged from 2011. However, in the first nine months of 2012, regulated gas and nonregulated operating earnings
declined $30 million versus 2011, as a result of lower volume-related regulated natural gas margins and lower nonregulated electric margins.  Natural gas pipelines’ revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 were relatively unchanged from 2011. In 2012, natural gas revenues increased from expansion projects and from higher
transportation and storage rates in certain markets, but were substantially offset by lower volumes of gas and condensate liquids sales (which are offset in cost of sales) and lower allowances for equity funds used during construction. In the third
quarter of 2012, EBIT declined $13 million (20%) compared to 2011, which was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses and depreciation. In the first nine months of 2012, EBIT also reflected higher revenues from the aforementioned
expansion projects, partially offset by increased depreciation, and operating expenses.  Northern
Powergrid’s revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 increased $3 million (1%) and $18 million (2%), respectively, over the comparable 2011 periods, due primarily to higher distribution revenues partially offset by
currency-related declines from a stronger U.S. Dollar in 2012. Excluding currency related impacts, distribution revenues increased $36 million in the first nine months of 2012, reflecting higher tariff rates ($67 million), partially offset
by a favorable movement in regulatory provisions in 2011 ($29 million). Northern Powergrid’s EBIT in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 declined $18 million (18%) and $14 million (4%), respectively, from EBIT in the
corresponding 2011 periods. In 2012, EBIT was negatively impacted by increases in pension expense ($11 million for the third quarter and $33 million for the first nine months) and distribution operating expenses ($8 million for the third quarter and
$18 million for the first nine months), which more than offset the increases in distribution revenues.  Real
estate brokerage revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 increased $88 million (30%) and $212 million (27%), respectively, over the same periods in 2011. In 2012, revenues included $41 million in the third quarter and $82
million in the first nine months from businesses acquired in 2012. The increases in revenues also reflected a 15% year-to-date increase in closed sales transactions from existing businesses. Real estate brokerage EBIT in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2012 increased $9 million (41%) and $30 million (86%), respectively, over the comparable 2011 periods. The increases in earnings reflected the impact of business acquisitions in 2012 as well as the aforementioned increase in
closed sales transactions.

 Marmon  Through Marmon, we operate approximately 150 manufacturing and service businesses that function independently within eleven diverse business sectors. Marmon’s revenues for the third quarter and first
nine months of 2012 were approximately $1.8 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, which resulted in comparatively flat revenues versus the third quarter of 2011 and a 3.7% increase over the first nine months of 2011. In the third quarter, revenue
increases attributable to bolt-on acquisitions in the Crane Services, Highway Technologies, Engineered Wire & Cable and Distribution Services sectors were substantially offset by the impact of lower copper prices in the Building Wire and
Flow Products sectors. However, through nine months of 2012, significant organic revenue growth has occurred within the Distribution Services, Transportation Services & Engineered Products (TSEP), Highway Technologies and Water Treatment
sectors. Despite falling steel prices, Distribution Services has increased market share in their market niches, driving nine month revenues up 8% over 2011. Higher rail fleet utilization and higher rental rates provided most of the TSEP growth,
while sulfur equipment installations in the Middle East provided the balance. Commercial and heavy haul trailers have driven the revenue increases in Highway Technologies, while water treatment projects for the Canadian Tar Sands area provided
growth in Water Treatment. These increases were somewhat offset by revenue declines in the Flow Products and Building Wire sectors due to the persistent slowdown in commercial construction. Retail Fixtures continues to suffer from a reduction in
volume from a major customer, which resulted in a 21% decline in revenues in the first nine months of 2012. 
Pre-tax earnings for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 were $293 million and $869 million, respectively,
which represented increases of 14.0% and 15.6% over the comparable 2011 periods. About one-fourth of the overall increase in pre-tax earnings in the first nine months was attributable to the recent business acquisitions. Excluding the effects of
these acquisitions, seven of the eleven Marmon business sectors produced increased pre-tax earnings in the first nine months of 2012 compared to 2011. Among the sectors reporting the largest dollar increases in pre-tax earnings were Distribution
Services, TSEP, Highway Technologies and Water Treatment as a result of the aforementioned increases in revenues. In addition, Engineered Wire & Cable year-to-date earnings rose 37%, attributable to restructuring actions that took place in
2011 in the utility and commodity businesses, along with growth in their specialty wire niche markets. Flow Products, Building Wire and Retail Store Fixtures, reported lower pre-tax earnings in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012
consistent with the revenue declines previously discussed. In 2012, pre-tax earnings as a percent of revenues were 16.3% in the third quarter and 15.9% for the first nine months versus 14.3% for both comparable periods in 2011. 
The improvement in operating results in 2012 reflects the continued emphasis of Marmon’s business model, which
fosters margin growth. Consistent with this model, most of the growth in 2012 was in higher margin sectors that focus on niche markets. In addition, improvements in revenues and pre-tax earnings also generally reflect continued strength in some of
Marmon’s end markets, recent new product introductions and ongoing efforts to control overhead costs.  McLane Company
 Through McLane, we operate a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food products
to retailers, convenience stores and restaurants. McLane’s business is marked by high sales volume and very low profit margins. McLane’s significant customers include Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. A curtailment of purchasing by
Wal-Mart or another of its significant customers could have a material adverse impact on McLane’s periodic revenues and earnings. In 2010, McLane acquired Empire Distributors, based in Georgia and North Carolina, and Horizon Wine and Spirits
Inc., based in Tennessee. Empire and Horizon are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer. On August 24, 2012, McLane completed the acquisition of Meadowbrook Meat Company, Inc. (“MBM”). MBM is based in Rocky Mount,
North Carolina and is a large customized foodservice distributor for national restaurant chains with annual sales of approximately $6 billion. MBM’s revenues and results of operations are included in McLane beginning as of the acquisition date.

McLane Company (Continued) 
 
McLane’s revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of
2012 were approximately $9.5 billion and $26.6 billion, respectively, representing increases of $826 million (9.5%) and $1,692 million (6.8%), respectively, over revenues in comparable 2011 periods. Revenues in the 2012 periods included $536
million from MBM. In addition, grocery revenues increased 3.7% and foodservice revenues increased 7.5% in the first nine months of 2012. Pre-tax earnings in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 increased $6 million (4.8%) and
decreased $6 million (1.9%), respectively, compared to earnings in the prior year periods. In 2012, McLane’s grocery division produced lower earnings as result of lower gross margins and higher personnel and depreciation expense, which on a
year to date basis more than offset increased earnings attributable to MBM, foodservice and beverage operations.  Other
manufacturing  Our other manufacturing businesses include several manufacturers of building products (Acme
Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, Johns Manville, Shaw and MiTek) and apparel (led by Fruit of the Loom which includes the Russell athletic apparel and sporting goods business and the Vanity Fair Brands women’s intimate apparel business). Also
included in this group are Forest River, a leading manufacturer of recreational vehicles, IMC Metalworking Companies (“ISCAR”), an industry leader in the metal cutting tools business with operations worldwide and CTB, a manufacturer of
equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries. Other manufacturing businesses also include The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”), a specialty chemical manufacturer that we acquired on September 16, 2011.
Lubrizol’s revenues and earnings are included in other manufacturing revenues and earnings beginning as of that date.  Revenues of other manufacturing businesses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 increased approximately $1.4 billion (26%) and $5.2 billion (34%) compared with the corresponding
2011 periods. Revenues from Lubrizol were approximately $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $4.7 billion in the first nine months of 2012, compared to $246 million for the fifteen day period ending September 30, 2011. In the third quarter and
first nine months of 2012, we also experienced revenue increases of 29% and 25%, respectively, from Forest River, which were attributable to increased volume and average sales prices. For the first nine months of 2012, building products revenues
increased 3% and apparel revenues increased 4% as compared with 2011, while revenues declined at IMC, CTB and Scott Fetzer.  Pre-tax earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 were $921 million and $2,738 million, respectively, representing increases of $269 million
(41%) and $999 million (57%), respectively, over the corresponding 2011 periods. Excluding the impact of Lubrizol, earnings of our other manufacturing businesses in 2012 increased $48 million (8%) in the third quarter and $157 million
(9%) in the first nine months as compared to 2011. The increases were primarily attributable to increased earnings from building products, apparel and Forest River, partially offset by lower earnings from ISCAR, CTB and Scott Fetzer. In 2012,
our building products businesses generally benefitted from increased housing construction, which overall, helped produce increased revenues and improved operating margins, particularly over the first six months of the year. Our apparel businesses
benefitted from past pricing actions and stabilizing raw material costs. On the other hand, our other businesses that manufacture products that are primarily for commercial and industrial customers, particularly those with significant business in
overseas markets, such as CTB and ISCAR, were negatively impacted in 2012 by slowing economic conditions in certain of those markets.  Other service  Our other service businesses include
NetJets, the world’s leading provider of fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and FlightSafety, a provider of high technology training to operators of aircraft. Among the other businesses included in this group are: TTI,
a leading electronic components distributor; Business Wire, a leading distributor of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings; Pampered Chef, a direct seller of high quality kitchen tools; Dairy Queen, which licenses and services a system
of over 6,100 stores that offer prepared dairy treats and food; Buffalo News and the BH Media Group, which includes the Omaha World-Herald acquired at the end of 2011, as well as 44 other daily and weekly newspapers and numerous other publications
acquired in June and July of 2012; and businesses that provide management and other services to insurance companies.  Revenues of our other service businesses in 2012 were $2,128 million in the third quarter and $6,327 million in the first nine months, representing increases of $214 million (11%) and $364 million
(6%), respectively, over the corresponding 2011 periods. The increases in revenues in 2012 were primarily attributable to the inclusion of the BH Media Group and comparative revenue increases from TTI, principally due to bolt-on business
acquisitions in 2012. Pre-tax earnings of $256 million in the third quarter and $744 million in the first nine months of 2012 decreased by $25 million (9%) and $24 million (3%), respectively, from earnings in the comparable prior year periods.
NetJets’ earnings in the third quarter of 2012 declined $30 million versus the third quarter of 2011, which largely offset much of the improvement in comparative earnings over the first six months. NetJets’ results in the third quarter of
2012 were negatively impacted by lower gains on asset dispositions, increased depreciation expense and unfavorable foreign currency movements compared to the third quarter of 2011. TTI’s earnings in the first nine months of 2012 declined 16%
versus 2011 due primarily to weaker customer demand and intensifying price competition over the past year.

Retailing 
Our retailing operations consist of four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture
and Jordan’s), three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge) and See’s Candies. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in the third quarter of 2012 from the retailing businesses increased modestly over 2011. For the first nine
months of 2012, revenues and pre-tax earnings increased $103 million (5%) and $19 million (18%), respectively, over 2011. Operating results in 2012 reflected increased revenues and earnings from our home furnishings retailers and relatively
flat revenues and lower earnings from our jewelry retailers.  Finance and Financial Products 
Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (“Clayton Homes”),
transportation equipment leasing (“XTRA”), furniture leasing (“CORT”) as well as various miscellaneous financing activities. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows. Amounts
are in millions.

 Clayton Homes’ revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 decreased
$17 million (2%) and increased $58 million (3%), respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2011. In 2012, revenues from home sales in the third quarter were unchanged from 2011, reflecting a 5% increase in units sold offset by
lower average selling prices. For the first nine months of 2012, home sales increased $103 million (10%), due primarily to increases in units sold partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices. Financial services revenues in 2012
declined $18 million (5%) from the third quarter and $45 million (4%) from the first nine months of 2011 as a result of lower interest income. Installment loan and finance receivable balances as of September 30, 2012, were
approximately $12.4 billion, a decline of approximately $450 million from December 31, 2011. Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings in 2012 increased $18 million (49%) in the third quarter and $46 million (41%) in the first nine months
over the corresponding 2011 periods. Operating results in 2012 reflected improvements in manufacturing and home sales from increased unit sales which improved operating and manufacturing efficiencies. In the first nine months 2012, earnings also
benefited from lower insurance claims and a decline in credit losses.  While Clayton Homes’ operating
results continue to be affected by relatively soft housing markets, manufactured homes sold were higher in 2012 compared to 2011. However, manufactured housing programs continue to operate at a competitive disadvantage compared to traditional single
family housing markets, which have been receiving significant interest rate subsidies from the U.S. government through government agency insured mortgages. For the most part, these subsidies are not available to factory built homes. Nevertheless,
Clayton Homes remains the largest manufactured housing business in the United States and we believe that it will continue to operate profitably, even under the prevailing conditions. 
In the first nine months of 2012, revenues of CORT and XTRA increased $14 million (3%), while pre-tax earnings declined
$3 million (3%) versus 2011. Results for the first nine months of 2012 reflected increased earnings of CORT (attributable to increased rental income and higher operating margins) and lower earnings from XTRA (attributable to unchanged revenues,
increased depreciation expense and lower foreign currency exchange gains). Earnings from our other finance business activities include investment income from a portfolio of fixed maturity and equity investments, and from a small portfolio of
long-held commercial real estate loans, which had an aggregate carrying value of $435 million as of June 30, 2012. During the third quarter of 2012, certain of these commercial real estate loans were repaid in full. On October 1, 2012, the
remaining commercial real estate loans were repaid in full. In addition, other earnings include income from interest rate spreads charged to Clayton Homes on borrowings (approximately $11.2 billion as of September 30, 2012) by a Berkshire
financing subsidiary. The borrowings are used to fund the loans to Clayton Homes. Corresponding charges for this interest spread are reflected in Clayton Homes’ earnings. In addition, other earnings for the first nine months include guaranty
fee income of $26 million in 2012 and $31 million in 2011 from NetJets. Corresponding expenses are recorded by NetJets.

 Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale or redemption of investments. The
timing of gains or losses from sales or redemptions can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders’ equity since most of our
investments are regularly recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 
We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical
or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although our management does not consider investment gains and losses in a given period as
necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating periodic earnings, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when they are reflected in earnings. 
Investment gains/losses for the first nine months of 2011 included a pre-tax gain of $1.25 billion from the redemption of
our GS Preferred investment. Other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses in the first nine months of 2012 were attributable to our investments in Texas Competitive Electric Holdings bonds. In 2011, we recognized OTTI losses related to
our investments in common stock of Kraft Foods and Wells Fargo. These OTTI losses had no impact whatsoever on the asset values recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders’ equity when the OTTI losses were
recognized. The recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are imminent or planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the
recognition of OTTI losses does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost. 
We consider several factors in determining whether or not impairments are deemed to be other than temporary, including
the current and expected long-term business prospects and if applicable, the creditworthiness of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the price recovers and the length of time and relative magnitude of the price decline.
Security prices may remain below cost for a period of time that may be deemed excessive from the standpoint of interpreting existing accounting rules, even though other factors suggest that the prices will eventually recover. As a result, accounting
regulations may require that we recognize OTTI losses in earnings in instances where we may strongly believe that the market price of the impaired security will recover to at least our original cost and where we possess the ability and intent to
hold the security until, at least, that time.  As of September 30, 2012, unrealized losses on our
investments in equity securities (determined on an individual purchase lot basis) were $238 million. Unrealized losses averaged 7% of cost. In our judgment, the future earnings potential and underlying business economics of the issuers of these
securities are favorable and we possess the ability and intent to hold these securities until their prices recover. Changing market conditions and other facts and circumstances may change the business prospects of these issuers as well as our
ability and intent to hold these securities until their prices recover.  In 2012, our derivative contracts
generated pre-tax losses of $118 million in the third quarter and $184 million in the first nine months. In 2011, we incurred pre-tax losses of approximately $2.44 billion in the third quarter and $2.36 billion in the first nine months. In the third
quarter and first nine months of 2012, our equity index put option contracts produced losses of $534 million and $1,018 million, respectively, which were due to lower interest rate assumptions, partially offset by increased index values. There were
no new equity index put option contracts or settlements in either 2011 or 2012. In the third quarter of 2011, our equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax losses of approximately $2.1 billion. The losses reflected declines ranging from 11%
to 23% in equity indexes covered under our contracts, and to a lesser degree from lower interest rate inputs. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our remaining equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract
expiration dates, which begin in 2018.

Operations (Continued)   
Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses (Continued)
  
In the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, we recognized gains
of $316 million and $827 million on credit default contracts, respectively. Such gains were attributable to narrower spreads and the passage of time (reduced time exposure), as well as from terminations of certain contracts in the third quarter. No
new credit default contracts were written in 2011 or 2012. A significant portion of our risks related to non-investment grade corporate issuers expire in the fourth quarter of 2012, and all remaining exposures related to corporate issuers expire in
2013. The periodic changes in the fair values of these contracts can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying equity and credit markets.  In 2011, our credit default contracts generated pre-tax losses of $247 million in the third quarter and $35 million in the first nine months. The losses in the third quarter were primarily related to our
contracts involving corporate issuers, due to widening credit default spreads. There were no credit events affecting our contracts during the first nine months of 2011.  Financial Condition  Our balance sheet continues to reflect
significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2012 was $184.6 billion, an increase of $19.8 billion from December 31, 2011. Consolidated cash and investments of insurance and
other businesses approximated $174.9 billion at September 30, 2012 including cash and cash equivalents of $41.8 billion, of which about $11.5 billion was held by the parent company. Otherwise, invested assets are held predominantly in our
insurance businesses. On January 31, 2012, we issued $1.7 billion of parent company senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which were used to fund the repayment of $1.7 billion of notes that matured in February 2012. An additional $2.6 billion
of parent company debt matures in February 2013.  In September 2011, our Board of Directors authorized
Berkshire Hathaway to repurchase Class A and Class B shares of Berkshire at prices no higher than a 10% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares at management’s discretion. The repurchase program is
expected to continue indefinitely, but does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares. Repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash equivalent holdings
below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. To date, share repurchases have been insignificant. 
Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and MidAmerican) maintain very large investments in
capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In the first nine months of 2012, MidAmerican’s capital expenditures were $2.3 billion and BNSF’s capital
expenditures were $2.7 billion. For the remainder of 2012, BNSF’s and MidAmerican’s forecasted aggregate capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $2.0 billion. Future capital expenditures are expected to be funded from cash
flows from operations and debt issuances. In 2012, BNSF issued debt of $2.5 billion with maturities in 2022 and 2042, and its outstanding debt increased approximately $1.9 billion to $14.6 billion as of September 30, 2012. In 2012,
MidAmerican’s new borrowings were approximately $2.5 billion and its aggregate outstanding borrowings increased approximately $1.2 billion to $21.1 billion as of September 30, 2012. BNSF and MidAmerican have aggregate debt and capital
lease maturities over the remainder of 2012 of about $900 million. Berkshire has committed until February 28, 2014 to provide up to $2 billion of additional capital to MidAmerican to permit the repayment of its debt obligations or to fund
its regulated utility subsidiaries. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, MidAmerican or any of their subsidiaries.  Assets of the finance and financial products businesses, which consisted primarily of loans and finance receivables, fixed maturity securities, other investments and cash and cash equivalents, were
approximately $25.7 billion as of September 30, 2012 and $25.0 billion at December 31, 2011. Liabilities were approximately $24.7 billion as of September 30, 2012 and $25.4 billion as of December 31, 2011. As of
September 30, 2012, notes payable and other borrowings of $13.4 billion included approximately $11.2 billion of notes issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). In the first nine months of 2012, $2.7 billion of
BHFC notes matured. In May and September 2012, BHFC issued $2.35 billion of new notes with maturities in 2017, 2022 and 2042. In the third quarter of 2012, $750 million of BHFC notes matured and an additional $3.45 billion will mature in 2013. We
currently intend to issue additional new debt through BHFC to replace some or all of the upcoming debt maturities. The proceeds from the BHFC notes are used to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes. The full and timely payment of
principal and interest on the BHFC notes is guaranteed by Berkshire.

Financial Condition (Continued) 
 
We regularly access the credit markets, particularly through our parent
company and through our railroad, utilities and energy and finance and financial products businesses. Restricted access to credit markets at affordable rates in the future could have a significant negative impact on our operations. 
On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law financial regulatory reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”). The Reform Act reshapes financial regulations in the United States by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and market participants and providing new enforcement
powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Reform Act are subject to extensive rulemaking proceedings being conducted both jointly and independently by multiple regulatory agencies, some of which have been completed and others that are
expected to be finalized by the end of 2012 or in 2013.  We are party to several equity index put option and
credit default contracts as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With limited exception, these contracts contain no collateral posting requirements under any circumstances, including changes in either the fair value or
intrinsic value of the contracts or a downgrade in Berkshire’s credit ratings. Substantially all of these contracts were entered into prior to December 31, 2008. At September 30, 2012, the net liabilities recorded for such contracts
were approximately $10.0 billion and our collateral posting requirements were $150 million. With respect to such collateral requirements, we receive the income attributable to such collateral or, in certain instances, interest credit from the
counterparty. Although the ultimate outcome of the regulatory rulemaking proceedings described in the preceding paragraph cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the provisions of the Reform Act that concern collateral
requirements apply to derivatives contracts that were entered into prior to the enactment of the Reform Act, as ours were. As such, although the Reform Act may adversely affect some of our business activities, it is not currently expected to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition.  Contractual Obligations 
We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to
counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. The timing and/or amount of
the payment of other obligations, such as losses arising from unpaid property and casualty loss insurance contracts and credit default and equity index put option derivatives contracts, are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual
payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the liability estimates currently recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, which are not currently reflected
in the financial statements, such as minimum rentals under operating leases.  In June 2012, NetJets placed
orders with certain manufacturers to acquire up to 425 aircraft with an estimated value of $9.6 billion. The aircraft purchases would be made to replace aircraft in its existing fleet, with deliveries expected to occur over an 8 year period
beginning in 2014. The orders include cancellable commitments for 125 aircraft with an estimated cost of $2.8 billion and options to purchase an additional 300 aircraft, with respect to which, NetJets is not presently obligated to acquire.
 On June 28, 2012, Berkshire entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with
Residential Capital, LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “ResCap”), which filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on May 14, 2012. Under the Agreement, the ResCap assets to be acquired represent
various portfolios of first and second lien mortgage loans and other assets. The Agreement was subsequently approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court (the “Court”), which then ordered that an auction be conducted in October 2012. The Agreement
effectively established the minimum price for the portfolios of loans and obligated Berkshire to acquire the ResCap loans, if no competing bidder in the auction process produced a bid that was deemed superior to Berkshire’s bid. On
October 25, 2012, the auction was held and the ResCap Board of Directors approved Berkshire’s bid of $1.5 billion as the highest and best bid for the ResCap loan portfolios. A sale approval hearing before the Court is scheduled to commence
on November 19, 2012. The aggregate consideration payable for the loan portfolios is subject to adjustment, primarily based on the level of loan principal amortizations up to the closing date, which is currently expected to occur in the first
quarter of 2013.  Except as noted above, our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2012 were not
materially different from those disclosed in the “Contractual Obligations” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (Continued)   
Critical Accounting Policies 
Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments regarding transactions that have occurred and
ultimately will be settled several years in the future or concerning the recoverability of assets. Amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on assumptions about numerous factors involving varying, and
possibly significant, degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently recorded in the financial statements may prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be inaccurate. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting
Policies” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 for additional
discussion regarding these estimates.  Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2012 includes
estimated liabilities for unpaid losses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of $63.4 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing loss reserve amounts, the actual ultimate claim amounts will
likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude will result in a material effect on reported earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of losses
incurred in the period of the change.  Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2012 includes
goodwill of acquired businesses of $54.1 billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2011. Although we believe that the goodwill reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2012 is not impaired, goodwill may subsequently become impaired as a result of changes in facts and circumstances affecting the valuation of the reporting unit. A goodwill impairment charge could
have a material effect on periodic net earnings.  Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include significant amounts
of derivative contract liabilities that are measured at fair value. Our significant derivative contract exposures are concentrated in credit default and equity index put option contracts. These contracts were primarily entered into in
over-the-counter markets and certain elements in the terms and conditions of such contracts are not standardized. In particular, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. Furthermore, there is no source of independent data
available to us showing trading volume and actual prices of completed transactions. As a result, the values of these liabilities are primarily based on valuation models, discounted cash flow models or other valuation techniques that are believed to
be used by market participants. Such models or other valuation techniques may use inputs that are observable in the marketplace, while others are unobservable. Unobservable inputs require us to make certain projections and assumptions about the
information that would be used by market participants in establishing prices. Considerable judgment may be required in making assumptions, including the selection of interest rates, default and recovery rates and volatility. Changes in assumptions
may have a significant effect on values.  Information concerning new accounting pronouncements is included in
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Forward-Looking Statements 
Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press
releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the
“Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,”
“plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or
prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are
subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and we have
no specific intention to update these statements.  Actual events and results may differ materially from those
expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane or
act of terrorism that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general
economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report and in particular the
“Market Risk Disclosures” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of September 30, 2012, there are no material changes in the nature of our market risks
described in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Item 
4. Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial
Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman (Chief Executive Officer) and the Senior Vice
President (Chief Financial Officer) concluded that the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Corporation (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required
to be included in the Corporation’s periodic SEC filings. During the quarter, there have been no significant changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect
internal control over financial reporting.  Part II Other Information 
Item 1. Legal Proceedings  We are party in a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. In particular, such legal actions affect our insurance and reinsurance businesses. Such litigation generally seeks
to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine
litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  BNSF Railway Company and other Class I railroads have been subject since May 2007, to some 30 similar class action complaints alleging that they have conspired to fix fuel surcharges with respect to
unregulated freight transportation services in violation of the antitrust laws. The complaints seek injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages. These cases were consolidated in the federal district court of the District of Columbia for
coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings (In re: Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 1869). Consolidated amended class action complaints were filed against BNSF Railway Company and three other Class I
railroads in April 2008. On June 21, 2012, the court certified the class sought by the plaintiffs. As a result, with some exceptions, rail customers who paid a fuel surcharge on non-Surface Transportation Board regulated traffic between July
2003 and December 2008 are part of a class that, subject to appeal, can be tried jointly in a single case. We believe that these claims are without merit and continue to defend against the allegations vigorously. We do not currently believe that the
outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A to Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 to which reference is made herein. 
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities
 On September 26, 2011, Berkshire announced a common stock repurchase program where Berkshire’s
Board of Directors authorized Berkshire to repurchase Class A and Class B shares of the Company at prices no higher than a 10% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire’s Board of Directors’ authorization does not specify a
maximum number of shares to be purchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce Berkshire’s consolidated cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program is expected to continue indefinitely and the amount
of purchases will depend entirely upon the levels of cash available, the attractiveness of investment and business opportunities either at hand or on the horizon and the degree of discount from management’s estimate of intrinsic value. The
repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares. There were no share repurchases during the first nine months of 2012. 
Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
None 
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
Information regarding the Company’s mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with
Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-Q.
