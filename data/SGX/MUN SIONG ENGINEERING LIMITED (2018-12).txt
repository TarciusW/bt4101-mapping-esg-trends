Mun Siong Engineering Limited | Sustainability Report 2018

Dear Readers,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is my pleasure to release the second 

Sustainability Report of Mun Siong Engineering Limited in compliance with 

the GRI G4 frame work. This Sustainability Report covers the reporting period 

from January to December 2018. The non-financial declaration was reviewed 

by the Executive Committee and there was no external audit of the Report. 

Mun Siong Engineering is one of the leading local integrated service 

providers to the process industry. We help our business partners achieve 

their goals through safe and timely deliveries with quality services. 

Mun Siong Engineering was established in 1969. This year, we celebrate 50 

years of being an integral part of Singapore’s process industry. We take our 

responsibility to our stakeholders very seriously as they are key contributing 

factors to our performance. While we are focused on our performance we are 

also careful of the impact we leave on our environment. Our sustainability 

strategies and plans are among our top priorities all year round. 

On the business front, in FY2018, we have fully integrated our electrical 

and instrumentation capabilities into the Group and commenced on 

digitalisation projects for the Group to operate in an effective and integrated 

manner.  Our business strategy defines our long-term objectives and allows 

us to stay competitive in the market. 

In the reporting year, following intensive internal discussions and a 

stakeholder survey, our materiality assessment was developed further. 

While preparing the report, it gave us the opportunity to examine the ways 

we operate. In this report, we summarise the activities that our colleagues 

carry out every day to ensure Mun Siong operates as a sustainable business.

MATERIALITY

In order to identify the sustainability aspects that are of essential importance to our Group, the Sustainability 

Steering Committee together with respective stakeholders conducted an assessment in 2017. Following the 

assessment, we  compiled the  sustainability aspects that are of relevance to us based on the guidelines of 

the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and other sources, and discussed them in our sustainability steering 

committee to assess their  significance to our Group. The results were then transferred to a matrix sorted in 

order of relevance. Those aspects that had been identified as being material were validated and prioritised.

transparently and fairly with integrity in all our business dealings and 

relationships. We have implemented and enforced effective systems to 

counter bribery and corruption.

We have developed an Anti-Bribery &amp; Corruption Policy 

which will act as guiding principals for our Group and 

our Business Partners. The Policy outlines acceptable and 

non-acceptable behaviour and ensures compliance with 

not only our own rules and regulations but also those set 

out by the Singapore Prevention of Corruption Act.  This 

policy has been read and signed by the Group’s employees, 

Board of Directors and business partners. New employees 

will also be required to read and sign this policy as part 

of their onboarding process. This Policy will be reviewed 

regularly and kept updated by our Compliance Executive 

to ensure that it continues to be adequate and effective.

WHISTLEBLOWING

The Company will take appropriate action upon thorough 

review and investigation of whistleblowing reports in 

an objective manner. All reports will be managed by our 

Whistleblowling Investigation Committee (“WIC”) who 

will carry out investigations and make the necessary 

recommendations. Reports 

can 

be 

submitted in

Whistleblowing Policy outlines procedures for our 

employees to report any unethical conduct. All Employees

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP

ICCS BEACH CLEANUP @ CHANGI BEACH

We understand that good corporate citizenship can take many forms and we believe that the Company’s 

progress should be in sync with the positive impact we leave in our community. Each year, we commit to 

participating in volunteer activities as well as support charitable causes through corporate giving. We are 

always looking to support different non-profit organisations each year because we are aware that there are 

many other social areas which require assistance. This year, our focus was on the environment and assisting 

the needy.

HUMAN CAPITAL

Our human capital is a key contributing factor for the 

success and growth of our organisation over the years. 

We have a diverse workforce with representations from 

12 different countries working with local Singaporeans. 

Employees are crucial to our business goals and growth. 

We need the right combination of human resource 

with appropriate skills and competencies to  get our 

projects completed successfully.  We are facing a high 

staff turnover of 20% in 2018. Moving forward, we will 

be using HR Analytics to understand the turnover trends 

and root cause of the situation. We want to establish the 

key causes of staff turnover.  Then we will put in place 

the appropriate remedies to contain high staff turnover. 

While working on the HR Analytics, we will concurrently 

put in place Talent Management strategies to address 

high staff turnover – Recruitment Review, Career Path 

for all employees, Training Road map, and Succession 

Planning for key positions in the Company.

TALENT MANAGEMENT

We want to grow our talent internally.  We will always 

try to develop and groom from within the organisation 

as much as possible. We will review our recruitment 

process to ensure that we are attracting and hiring 

candidates with the right skill sets and competencies. 

We will also track the development of new recruits. As 

an equal employment opportunity employer, we search 

for talents based on their abilities and experience. 

Career Path will help our employees to grow their career 

with the business as such, employees will know the 

requirements to move up the career ladder.   There will be 

opportunities for job rotation and stretch assignments 

to further develop their skills and competencies. 

An enhanced Training Matrix will be implemented 

alongside to support the Talent Development and 

Management Scheme, this will allow employees to plan 

and understand the requirements of  their training and 

development at each career step. The Training Matrix will 

focus on technical skills,  functional skills, knowledge and 

soft skills training courses suitable for each employee. 

Currently, we have in place a multi-skills training path for our 

direct workers. This will increase our skills pool and improve 

on productivity.  With our Company’s growing history, our 

long service employees are also aging. Therefore, besides 

talent management, we also have succession planning in 

place. We will identify the key positions in the Company 

and will work on identifying the right successors who will 

be groomed to be ready for their next role. 

METHODS OF EVALUATION

1. Benchmarks

a. We will use the staff turnover rate from 2018 as a 

benchmark to measure staff turnover in 2019.

▷ Available trainings to help them 

develop  themselves further

c. Analytics to understand causes of 

resignation and appropriate remedies 

to address the problems identified.

To provide a good working environment and build long term relationships with our employees, staff welfare 

is one of the key areas that we put emphasis on to help our foreign workers feel at home.  Monthly dormitory 

room leaders meetings is an important channel for our workers to share their feedback and requirements. 

Besides providing communication channels to our employees such as dormitory meetings, town hall meetings 

and management lunches, we also have an employee share performance scheme in place to recognise and 

reward good performers and encourage our staff to take up greater responsibilities in preparation for 

succession to the next level.

TRAINING &amp; EDUCATION

To keep up with global demands and industry trends, it 

is essential to have a multi-skilled, certified, robust and 

diverse talent pipeline to fulfill the jobs of today and 

tomorrow as well as enable us to remain competitive 

in the market. We believe that it is essential to equip 

our valuable workforce with up to date digitization 

knowledge and relevant mechanisation skills to stay 

abreast with ever changing industry demands.

We provide opportunities for personal growth and 

development that are in line with our corporate 

objectives. The core areas of our business requires 

specific technical or skill-based training programmes 

tailored to the roles that exist in our workplace. In order 

to meet our needs, our Learning &amp; Development (L &amp; D) 

training plan incorporates training programmes with 

everyday work, including topics which cover the key  

pillars of our business such as Engineering, Maintenance, 

Specialised Services, Construction &amp; Projects, Electrical 

&amp; Instrumentation, Scaffolding, Insulation and Painting . 

In FY2018, we provided more than 22,166 hours 

of training, of which 21,042 hours were training 

programmes on Safety &amp; Technical skills. We have also

training program in 2019.  

The various training programmes have been attended 

by most of our employees across different business 

functions during this period. In FY2018, an average 

of 14 hours of training was received per employee as 

compared with 20 hours of training in FY2017 and 17

satisfaction among our employees. Our L &amp; D programmes 

aim to develop the skills of employees in operational, 

management and leadership roles to prepare and enable 

them to assume positions of higher responsibility.

PERFORMANCE &amp; DEVELOPMENT REVIEWS

Our employees are the key drivers behind the company’s 

success. All full time employees undergo an annual

where employees are able to discuss and agree on their 

performance, areas for improvement and set KPI targets 

for the following year as well as discuss about their 

personal and career development plan. We encourage 

effective and continuous conversations and feedback 

between managers and their direct reports at all times.

ENVIRONMENT

We are committed to minimising our environmental 

impact as we conduct our daily operations. We 

are always thinking of ways in which we can help 

reduce and conserve the natural resources we come 

into contact with each day. Our employees are 

constantly reminded to do their part in conserving 

our resources.   These reminders are shared through 

our enterprise social network, weekly tool box 

meetings and reminders posted around the office. 

Environmental data presented in this report covers 

our business operations in Singapore.

EFFLUENTS &amp;  WASTE 

We have a waste disposal procedure in place that 

documents a set of standard procedures to segregate 

recyclable, general and hazardous waste. All disposals 

are contracted to NEA approved contractors to ensure 

proper handling and disposal of the respective waste 

categories, ensuring all wastes are disposed in a safe 

and environmentally sound manner in accordance 

with relevant legislations. 

Training programs and targeted interventions to 

highlight the importance and  methods of recycling 

were  also organised in 2018. These programs aim 

to help our staff understand the importance and 

appropriate methods of recycling. Our janitors also 

play an active role in reminding and educating our staff 

to place their recyclables in the correct recycle bins. 

We have also extended our recyclable waste collection 

initiatives to one of our job sites in 2018 as a pilot 

program. The pilot site has recorded a collection of 

30kg of recycled paper. To maintain efficient use of 

our resources, recycled paper collected from job sites 

will only be delivered to our Head Quarters when 

our vehicles return to our Head Quarters. For hygiene 

reasons, aluminium drink cans have been excluded. 

Through these recycling programs, we have seen a 

steady increase in the collection of recyclable waste.

In 2019, we plan to engage more job sites to send 

recyclable waste to our HQ for recycling. We will also be 

looking into reducing the use of paper by making the 

switch to electronic copies and providing reports such 

as our Sustainability Report via our website. Increasing 

awareness on minimising the use of paper will also be 

looked into.

CONSERVING WATER

Data collected on our consumption of water is limited 

to our consumption of water at our Head Quarters. We 

rely heavily on water to carry out hydrojetting work. In an 

effort to save water, we are exploring ways in which we 

can recycle water used in our hydrojetting operations. The 

other key area where water is consumed is in our office. 

We have installed water saver caps at most of our taps 

to help reduce the flow of water. We have also initiated a 

Save Water Program in the office to raise awareness and 

develop a culture where water conservation is observed.

Posters and communications have been placed in the 

restrooms, pantries and washing points to remind our 

staff to conserve water and use water responsibly. Water 

conservation has also been the topic of some weekly 

toolbox meetings throughout the year.

ENERGY CONSERVATION

We have replaced all lights in our premises with energy 

saving lights to help reduce electricity consumption. We 

have also implemented a common practice to ensure all 

lights and air conditioning units are switched off when 

the office is not in use especially during our lunch hour 

and non working hours. All laptops and computers are 

switched off when not in use as well. 

We are aware that energy saving in the office is a culture 

that must be built over time. In order to achieve our goals, 

the management team has appointed a team to study 

and collect data to come up with methods and ideas to 

reduce electricity consumption in the office.

OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY &amp; HEALTH

Our safety core value  is “To put the safety of 

everyone above all” - this remains our top priority. 

We have always been committed to providing a safe 

working environment to all our employees. Our 

Group of companies are OSHAS 18001,14001 and 

BizSafe Star level certified. This year, we have also 

received the WSH Performance Silver Award from 

the Workplace Safety and Health Council. 

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

We have been successful in achieving zero non-

compliances with environmental laws and regulations. 

We will continue to remain compliant by taking 

necessary precautions to ensure zero spillage from 

our diesel tanks and also ensure that we discharge 

contaminated industrial water through our sump 

pits which are regulated and in compliance with 

environmental regulations. There were no cases of 

occupational diseases as regular medical checks, 

provision of Personal Protective Equipment and 

trainings were conducted as and when deemed 

necessary by specific jobs or tasks.

MANAGING RISKS

We manage risks through the development and 

implementation of new safe work procedures, risk 

assessments, regular safety trainings and campaigns. 

Regular safety meetings are conducted to raise and 

address key areas of concerns and are attended by 

employees of all levels within the organisation. Key 

performance indicators are consolidated while we 

observe leading and lagging indicators to determine the 

implementation of safety initiatives.

BUILDING AN INTERVENTION CULTURE

Regardless of non-occurrences of major incidents, we 

have had several cases of near misses and minor incidents 

over the years. In most cases, we have observed that they 

could have been prevented if there were interventions 

by co-workers. Leading indicators led us to believe 

that as an organisation,  we need to build an effective 

intervention culture. 

To achieve this, we have established a Care, Intervene, 

and Thank (CIT) Program that aims to provide us with 

a framework on how we must care and intervene in at 

risk situations with  respect. The CIT Program is a “No 

Blame Culture” and a “Safe Zone” program. A series of 

activities were rolled out throughout the year to guide 

and encourage our workforce to actively participate in 

this campaign. 

As of December 2018, 1 Silver and 8 Bronze Badges have 

been awarded to employees who displayed the qualities 

of the CIT Program. Moving forward, we will continue 

to implement new safety campaigns and programs to 

ensure that every employee goes home safe each day.



 



Care - for each other

 



Intervene - with courage and respect

 



Thank - with grace
