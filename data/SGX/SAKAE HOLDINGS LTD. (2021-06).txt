The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has added

unprecedented

complexity

to

the

Group's

businesses and operations. The evolving Covid-

19 situation has resulted in the implementation

of

various

stringent

Covid-19

preventive

measures over the last two years, causing great

disruptions to many businesses, including the

Food and Beverage industry. The Group has

recalibrated

our

business

strategy

by

digitalising

its

online

sales

channels

and

enhancing efforts for optimising delivery and

takeaway

revenue,

all

while

ensuring

continuous

sustainability

of

the

Group’s

business

and

safeguarding

the

health

and

safety of our customers and employees.

As Covid-19 enters into an endemic phase,

there is optimism that consumer demand and

market sentiment will improve. However, given

the uncertain nature of the evolution of the

Covid-19

virus,

the

Group

will

continue

to

remain cautious in seeking new and innovative

ways to reduce the environmental impact of

our business operations while continuing to

deliver high quality products and services.

We will endeavour to overcome the challenges

for the year ahead and work towards achieving

our sustainability goals.

We would like to thank our frontline team for

their

relentless

contributions,

commitment

and

hard

work

to

continue

to

serve

our

customers amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. We

would also like to express our gratitude to all

our

shareholders,

business

associates

and

valued customers for their continuous support

and understanding.

BOARD'S

STATEMENT

The

Board

of

Directors

(the

"Board")

is

pleased

to

present

the

Sustainability

Report ("Report") for Sakae Holdings Ltd.

and its subsidiaries ("Sakae", or "the Group")

for the financial year ended 3O June 2O21.

Sakae

believes

that

sustainable

growth

strategies and practices are important for

our business.

The Board has overseen the development

of this Report with the support of the

management

team.

This

involved

a

materiality

assessment

on

the

key

Environmental,

Social

and

Governance

factors ("ESG factors") that are important to

Sakae's business, developing performance

indicators and targets, and ensuring that

they are managed and monitored for their

risks

and

opportunities

on

our

future

growth.

This

Report

provides

Sakae's

various

stakeholders

with

insights

into

our

business operations and our sustainability

efforts

and

initiatives.

Guided

by

our

sustainability reporting policy ("SR policy"),

the management team has conducted a

review of our material ESG factors for the

year.

We

believe

the

following

factors-

improving customer satisfaction, ensuring

food safety, hygiene and quality, training

and development of our people, safe and

inclusive

workplace,

recruitment

and

retention, occupational health and safety,

local communities engagement / corporate

social

responsibility,

energy

and

water

conservation and anti-corruption, remain

relevant

and

critical

to

the

long-term

sustainability

of

our

business.

We

will

continue

to

monitor

and

review

our

sustainability

efforts

periodically.

As

we

progress along our sustainability journey,

we

aim

to

incorporate

sustainability

initiatives

in

our

business

processes

to

enhance our reporting capabilities.

Under our Sustainability Reporting Policy, we have identified our

material ESG factors through stakeholder engagement. These

factors are prioritised and ranked according to the importance of

their Environmental, Social and Governance impact. Management

validates the material ESG factors through internal discussion and

feedback. 

The

MATERIAL 

FACTORS

09

Customer satisfaction is crucial to customer retention. We seek to provide

customer service that goes beyond taking and serving orders. We view

customer service as part of a holistic customer experience that is capable of

providing us with a distinguishing advantage in today’s increasingly

cluttered and competitive market.

 

In alignment with our mission – To provide safe quality food with excellent

service at great value, we are committed to retain and build a loyal customer

base for our long term sustainability by enhancing our customers’

experiences through:

9 . 1  C U S T O M E R  S A T I S F A C T I O N

(A) PROVIDING EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE

Customer service is the experience we deliver to our customers. It’s the

promise we keep to the customer. It’s how we follow through for the

customer. It’s how we make them feel when they do business with us.

 

Our frontline service employees are always the first customer “touchpoint”.

We conduct refresher training for them to ensure that high service standards

are maintained. Our customers can be assured that our employees are

trained to resolve customer issues promptly and amicably. Also, we have

implemented a service recovery programme with close follow-up with our

customers to provide them with better customer service outcomes.

(B)   PROACTIVELY ENCOURAGING CUSTOMERS TO GIVE FEEDBACK

We value our customers’ feedback as they provide us with insight into which

aspects of our operations are working well and which aspects can be improved.

We have multiple channels to gather customer feedback, including our sales

teams, delivery teams, online social media, our websites, and our customer

relationship management system that allows for analytical understanding of our

customers’ preferences. From such channels, we can then work towards product

and service improvements and enhance our operational effectiveness and

efficiencies. Based on the 2020 Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore (CSISG),

our customer satisfaction score was 73.5, as compared to the national average

score of 73.6 for the Food and Beverage sector. Over the years, we have made

constant improvements and will continue to strive towards meeting our

customers' needs.

(C)  BUILDING CUSTOMER LOYALTY THROUGH REGULAR PROMOTIONS 

       AND MEMBERSHIP PROGRAMME

We strive to improve customer retention and are constantly exploring ways to

reward customer loyalty. With the launch of the CandyBar membership system,

we have managed to grow our customer base through offering attractive deals to

our customers. We will support this by increasing our social media and online

presence to reach out and engage the online community further. In addition to

our revamped membership programme, regular promotions ensure that we are

constantly offering something new and special to our customers to meet market

demands.

(D)   ENSURING A SAFE DINING ENVIRONMENT

We have followed the prevailing safe management measures throughout the

Covid-19 pandemic to ensure that our customers can dine safely. These measures

include proper table and seating arrangements, queue management, customer

check-ins with SafeEntry and TraceTogether, and health checks at entrances. All

persons are required to put on their masks properly at all times, except while

eating and drinking. 

 

We have heightened our cleanliness and hygiene protocols at our restaurants.

Common spaces and items, frequent-touch surfaces as well as the interactive iPad

menus are frequently disinfected. We also provide hand sanitisers for customers at

each restaurant entrance.

(E)   MEETING CUSTOMERS’ EVOLVING NEEDS

Innovation has been one of our core values and we are constantly exploring new

brands and offerings to meet ever-changing F&amp;B consumer needs and

preferences. To meet the growing demand for fresh Japanese cuisines,

Japanmartsg was created to provide our customers with the convenience of

shopping online for affordable premium raw Japanese ingredients from the

comfort of their homes. Offering a wide variety of products at competitive prices

and with plans to expand product categories, Japanmartsg is poised to become

our customer’s top choice when shopping for premium Japanese products.

Being an established Food &amp; Beverage Japanese cuisine brand in Singapore,

we prioritise and value food safety and hygiene by delivering the best to our

customers. Serving great, safe and high-quality food has always been an

important emphasis of our business.

Through the adoption of industry certified standards, we are able to better

gauge and monitor the safety and quality of our food. We place much

emphasis on consistency and constantly work towards improving food

quality standards of our products.

We have implemented a food safety management system (FSMS) for our

central kitchen which supports our food catering and restaurant operations,

Our central kitchen's FSMS has attained certification based on the Hazard

Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) standard, With our stringent

monitoring process, we are able to reduce and prevent risks in food safety.

All our restaurant outlets have achieved ‘A’ Grade certification from the

Singapore Food Agency (SFA). Additionally, our Hei Sushi restaurants are

Halal-certified by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS). We have attained

the SG Clean quality mark for some of our outlets and are working towards

getting certified for the other outlets.

At Sakae, people are our number one asset.

Every year, we send our people for training and

skills development and seek to guide them to

be more enterprising and innovative. We

started inter-department projects to exchange

ideas and experience so as to create a think-

tank that allows Sakae to scale to greater

heights.

We believe in empowering our employees to

perform in their jobs through training and

education. Equipping them with the necessary

skills and competencies for their jobs will add

to 

productivity, 

confidence 

and 

work

satisfaction.

All 

our 

restaurant 

outlet 

employees 

will

undergo a training programme which consists

of two parts: the WSQ Food Safety Course Level

1 and on-the-job training covering key line

functions conducted by our trainers in their

respective outlets. We also conduct refresher

training for our employees as and when

required.

Depending on organisational requirements, we

also 

conduct 

in-house 

seminars 

at 

our

corporate 

headquarters 

for 

employees 

to

impart knowledge and build up their skills in

areas such as customer service, up-selling,

supervising 

at 

work 

and 

effective

communications. We also advocate personal

development 

and 

lifelong 

learning 

by

encouraging and sponsoring our employees to

attend approved external courses.

Some of the other courses that our employees

have attended include: training in SAP system,

Halal Foundation Programme and Supervisory

Training in Antigen Rapid Test Self-Swab.

Sakae aims to provide a work environment that

fosters fairness, equality, and respect for social

and cultural diversity, regardless of their gender

and age. We recognise that people from

different backgrounds have different talents,

skills, and experience. We find ways for them to

complement one another at work. We are

strong proponents of equal opportunity and do

not allow for discrimination on any grounds at

the workplace.

We value the experience of our senior staff as

well as the passion and flexibility of the younger

staff. Sakae rewards employees based on a

series of attributes that include performance,

competence, commitment and experience,

along with Company performance. We conduct

annual appraisals for all employees using a

holistic set of criteria including interpersonal

skills and innovation, besides their individual

performance indicators based on their roles

and responsibilities.

In line with fair employment practices, age,

race, gender, nationality, or religion do not

factor into the evaluation of job applications

that we receive.

For FY2021, female employees made up 44% of

our workforce while male employees made up

56%. 

In 

terms 

of 

age 

diversity 

among

employees, 53 were aged 30 and below, 74

were aged between 31 and 49, 43 were aged

between 50 and 69, and 7 were aged 70 and

above. We will continue to offer employment

based on fair hiring practices and ensure that

our workplace provides opportunities for all our

employees to contribute and grow.

9.5 RECRUITMENT

AND RETENTION

We value everyone’s contributions and we are dedicated to our

employee’s well-being. All employees are entitled to a range of

benefits that promote staff well-being and productivity, including

medical insurance and parental leave. Sakae ensures that its staff

is engaged and rewarded with competitive benefits that are in line

with industry standards. Staff members are also entitled to

exclusive privileges when they dine at our restaurants. For

employee engagement, 

Although remuneration and other staff benefits are key factors to

retain employees, we also recognise that job satisfaction is an

important factor. Our staff development programme seeks to

provide all employees with clear career pathways that lead to

better job prospects, greater responsibilities, and learning

opportunities as well.

We have implemented flexible work arrangements such as

working from home and staggered work hours for employees

whose roles allow for these arrangements. These arrangements

allow our employees to have a greater work-life balance. We will

continue to study the outcomes and review our flexible work

arrangement policy as part of our efforts to bolster recruitment

and retention.

We strive to increase employees’ job satisfaction by providing a

conducive, open and honest work environment and empowering

them to make decisions, as well as setting organisational goals. We

value our employees' ideas and opinions and have in place

appropriate channels to receive their feedback. Our Employee

Suggestion Scheme lets employees provide constructive input in

all areas including the Company’s business and work environment.

We address these feedback through consultations with employees

and Management with a view to implement ideas that will benefit

the Company’s business and employees. We hope that this will

cultivate a sense of belonging and pride at work for our

employees.

Sakae hopes to forge closer ties with its employees and will

continue to review our employee retention strategies. In FY2021,

our average employee monthly turnover rate is lower than the

national industry average monthly turnover rate. We will continue

to maintain the employee turnover rate.

(a) COVID-19: TAKING CARE OF OUR WORKERS

In light of Covid-19, the government introduced a slew of safe

management measures for the workplace. We continue to do

our part and have in place these measures to take care of our

employees, our workplaces, and those that may become

unwell at the workplaces.

(b) ACHIEVING ZERO WORKPLACE SAFETY INCIDENTS

Sakae adheres closely with the guidelines provided by the

Ministry of Manpower to ensure the health and safety of our

employees. 

All 

employees 

are 

briefed 

regarding 

basic

workplace health and safety.

In Sakae, we practice risk management in our daily activities.

Risk management is a process by which the Management

assesses the risks, determines the control measures, and takes

appropriate actions to reduce such risks. Risk assessment is a

key instrument to reduce risk at our workplace. We will

conduct risk assessments regularly so as to keep them relevant

to our work processes.

We also send our employees for safety courses such as

occupational first aid course and work-at-height course to

enhance their safety awareness. Employees are encouraged to

highlight safety and health hazards to the management as we

believe everyone has a part to play in ensuring workplace

safety and health.

9 . 6  O C C U P A T I O N A L  H E A L T H  A N D  S A F E T Y

Due to the nature of F&amp;B operations, most of our employees

are required to work on-site to perform essential tasks. We

provide 

sufficient 

masks 

and 

other 

personal 

protective

equipment for the safety of our employees. To prevent any

incipient Covid-19 outbreaks at our workplaces, we advise our

employees to minimise socialising at the workplace, observe

good personal hygiene and monitor their own health regularly.

We have also stepped up cleaning and sanitation of our

workplace premises and we maintain adequate cleaning and

disinfecting agents and ensure they are available where

necessary.

(b) SAKAE FOUNDATION

Sakae Foundation contributes and supports several charitable

beneficiaries. 

We 

have 

supported 

the 

community 

through

sponsorships and visits to various organisations including Radin

Mas Senior Citizens’ Home and schools. Our Foundation will

continue to pursue philanthropic and volunteer efforts, leaving

happy frog prints through our involvement with the community.

We launched our Facebook page - “Project Happy Frog Prints”, with

the hope of fortifying our relationship with global communities

and continue bringing joy, one frog print at a time.

(c) SUPPORTING NATIONAL DEFENCE

At Sakae, we strongly believe in contributing towards Singapore’s national security.

National Service (NS) is a vital component of national defence, and we support our

employees’ NS commitments by implementing NS-friendly policies. With our close

supportive team culture, many employees are willing to step up to cover duties of their

colleagues who needed to be away. Sakae also regularly takes part in Singapore Armed

Forces Day, by encouraging their NSmen colleagues to take part in the SAF Day

Rededication Ceremonies. Going beyond that, Sakae also offers attractive SAF Day

promotions at our dining establishments to servicemen representing our nation.

(d) FOOD WASTE MANAGEMENT

Food waste accounts for a significant portion of the total waste generated in Singapore. To

do our part to save the environment, Sakae adopts multiple approaches to sustainable

waste and resource management. Efficient food purchases and processes, Central Kitchen

preparation and centralised cold chain storage have helped to improve efficiency and

reduce food wastage. In support of the Zero Waste initiatives, Sakae has installed a food

waste digester machine at our group headquarters to treat and recycle food waste

sustainably. The compost produced will be used in turn as fertilisers for our greenery

landscape around our headquarters. We will continue our best efforts as we sustain and

support these Zero Waste initiatives.

We are committed to protect our environment and are exploring new ways to reduce our

environmental footprint through energy and water conservation. We leverage on

environmentally-friendly technologies and practices to ensure that we lessen our

operations’ impact on the environment. Our Go Green efforts include:





Suitable lightings in our building have been

fitted 

with 

motion 

sensors 

to 

reduce

electricity usage. We have also adopted the

use of energy-efficient LED lights in our stores

as a means to save electricity.

A 270 kilowatt-peak photovoltaic system was

installed on the roof of our building. It has

1,400 solar panels and is able to generate up

to one-third of the building’s energy needs.

With this, it helps to lower our carbon

emissions and also reducing our energy costs.

The prominent water fountain located at the

front of our building is fitted to a rainwater

irrigation 

system. 

The 

feature 

is 

thus

aesthetically pleasing and environmentally

friendly.

(b)     SOLAR POWER SYSTEM

(c)    RAINWATER IRRIGATION SYSTEM

In addition to the ornamental plants that

make up the green landscaping surrounding

our building, we have incorporated a spice

garden in the landscaping plan as well. Spices

like aloe vera plants, yellow ginger, pandan

leaves, mint leaves and many other spices

that are grown in the garden can be used as

seasonings in the food preparation. We will

constantly study more ways to include the

farm-to-fork approach in our restaurant outlet

operations as well.

(a)    CODE OF CONDUCT

Our Employee Code of Conduct sets out the standards of integrity and

accountability for our employees. All employees are expected to adhere to

the Code of Conduct while performing their duties and to always act in the

best interest of Sakae. For example, employees are not allowed to solicit or

accept any gifts or gratitude from our business partners. Any gift with

commercial value that is not refused due to practicality or courtesy must be

declared to the Human Resources Department for a decision on the

treatment of the gifts. Under no circumstances are employees allowed to

accept cash gifts.

Employees who are found to have breached the Code of Conduct after

investigations will be subjected to disciplinary action and/or report to

necessary authority if warranted.

9 . 9     A N T I - C O R R U P T I O N

(b)    INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS

Sakae has established procedures to ensure that all transactions with

interested persons are reported in a timely manner to the Audit Committee

and that any such transactions are on an arm’s length basis. We did not carry

out interested person transactions for the reporting period. The Management

and key executives are also required to submit a conflict of interest

declaration annually for independent assessment to demonstrate their

willingness to adhere to the conflicts of interest policy. Employees who are

found to have breached the Code of Conduct after investigations will be

subjected to disciplinary action.

(c)   WHISTLE BLOWING POLICY

Sakae’s Audit Committee has established a whistle blowing policy and

formed a Whistle Blowing Committee. Our Whistle Blowing Committee

comprises of our Independent Non-Executive Directors to ensure an

appropriate level of management over whistle blowing matters. The Whistle

Blowing Committee provides a channel for our employees to report in

confidence any possible corporate improprieties including corruption. The

Whistle Blowing Committee and the Board’s Audit Committee are vested

with the power and authority to receive, investigate and enforce appropriate

action when any such improprieties are brought to their attention.

 

There were no incidents related to corruption in FY2021. We will continue to

monitor and ensure our compliance with anti-corruption laws.
