8. POLICIES, PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCE REPORTING

Reporting Structure

The Group has a Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”) led by our President/Chief Executive Officer 

and includes senior management executives. In consultation with our Board of Directors, the SSC 

oversees the development of the sustainability strategy, sustainability performance and monitoring, as 

well as the production of this Sustainability Report. 

Sustainability Reporting Process (Identify, Prioritise, Validate and Review)

Under the Group’s Sustainability Reporting policy, the Group will first identify the material issues relevant 

to the Group’s activities. The material issues will be prioritised and validated with data, in order to finalise 

the content of this Sustainability Report. The material issues are reviewed and updated from the previous 

reporting period.

9. MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

The SSC conducts a review of the materiality assessment annually. 

The SSC has identified the following eight (8) factors that are material to the Group, 

which have been prioritised and validated by the Board of Directors:

There are no changes to the material ESG factors compared to the previous 

reporting period. 

In prioritising the material ESG factors, the SSC considered the impact and 

likelihood of the following:

- Global and emerging sustainability trends;

- Main topics and future challenges for the food and beverage industry; and

- Insights gained from regular interactions with key stakeholders.

10. ENVIRONMENT

Energy Consumption (Gas and Electricity)

Energy use and the resulting carbon emissions cause heat to be trapped in the atmosphere, leading to 

climate change. It is through the reduction of carbon emissions that we can limit the repercussions on 

the environment. 

In a recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) 

report which is the first intergovernmental report of its kind, it noted that since 1980, greenhouse gas 

emissions have doubled, raising average temperatures by at least 0.7 degrees Celsius. 

The Group recognises the role it has to play in energy conservation but also acknowledges that there are 

practical limitations. 

In view of the high consumption of gas and electricity by the Group’s operations, the Group has 

an energy conservation strategy which involves changing employees’ behaviour and investing in 

maintenance and energy-efficient machines. We will progressively phase out traditional operating 

equipment and replace them with energy-efficient ones while regularly maintaining existing equipment 

to ensure they consume energy efficiently. Additionally, we track and review energy consumption 

regularly to control usage. We use a combination of liquefied petroleum gas and liquefied natural gas 

sourced from the government and private vendors.

The following are the key statistics of our energy consumption during FY19 and our target for the 

financial year ending 31 March 2020 (“FY20”):

Water Consumption

Water is a precious resource and prudent usage is key. Water is vital to our business operations since it 

is used for washing and preparing food products, cleaning and dishwashing, amongst others. The water 

we consume is sourced from public utilities. Our Group practises active management of water usage, 

such as periodic inspections of pipes and faucets and encourage staff to save water, which will contribute 

to an improved economic performance of the Group. 

The following are the key statistics of our water consumption during FY19 and our target for FY20:

11. SOCIAL

Food Health and Safety 

The Group strives to deliver the highest-quality and healthy fare and service so that customers can have 

the best dining experience.

Certificates relating to Food Safety Standards 

The Group has attained the following certifications relating to food safety standards: 

- Both our central kitchens have attained the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (“HACCP”) standard, 

which is a systematic approach to identifying specific hazards and measures for control to ensure food 

safety.

- All our restaurants have achieved Grade “A” certification from the National Environment Agency 

(“NEA”) (1) for good personal and food hygiene, and housekeeping standards. 

- Both our central kitchens have obtained Grade “A” licence from the Agri-Food and Veterinary 

Authority of Singapore (“AVA”) (1) for good manufacturing practices and proper food safety systems.

Annual HACCP audits ensures that the Group consistently maintains the highest standards for food 

safety and hygiene. 

Note:

1 

All food-related services previously under NEA and AVA are provided by Singapore Food Agency (“SFA”) with effect from 

1 April 2019.

5S Programme

Our 5S Programme, short for Sort, Systematise, Shine, Standardise and Self-Discipline, is a systematic 

programme that we follow to achieve cleanliness and standardisation in the workplace. It aims to drive 

productivity through operational efficiency and effective space utilisation. The Restaurant Association of 

Singapore (“RAS”) is the main training provider for 5S in the Food and Beverage (“F&amp;B”) industry.

There are currently six (6) 5S auditors in the Group. Each of our restaurant is managed by a 5S-certified 

senior general manager and staffed with 5S-trained personnel, making every Tung Lok outlet 

5S-compliant (2) with 14 outlets being 5S certified (2).

Note:

2 

5S compliant workplace refers to the adherence to the 5S principles in practice but no external accreditation has been 

obtained, whereas 5S certified workplace refers to being accredited externally by RAS.

9




Food Safety Management System (“FSMS”)

The HACCP-based FSMS is a preventative approach towards identifying, preventing, and reducing 

food-borne hazards. This ensures that food prepared is hygienic and safe for consumption. A well-

designed FSMS with appropriate control measures can help food establishments with catering licences 

to comply with food hygiene regulations. 

In relation to the FSMS, the Singapore Standard SS583:2013 for Guidelines on Food Safety 

Management for Food Service Establishments (the “SS583:2013 Guidelines”) has been developed by 

Enterprise Singapore and key industry players. Caterers are required to draw up and implement a FSMS 

plan with reference to the SS583:2013 Guidelines before obtaining or renewing their licence.

To further improve food hygiene standards in the food industry, the FSMS requirement has been 

extended to all licences with permission to provide catering as an ancillary service, with effect from 1 

April 2019.

Our catering and permitted-to-cater licensees have implemented FSMS.

Other food safety measures

- All chefs and food handlers are required to attend food safety training as part of their mandatory training.

- Food warmers with capacity exceeding 7,500 units are used during delivery so that food safety standards 

are not compromised.

- Items with new ingredients used are sent for laboratory testing before launch to determine their shelf life.

Customer Satisfaction

The provision of exemplary customer service remains one of the key cornerstones for Tung Lok’s long-

standing success. Service excellence values are entrenched in the Group’s processes and practices. 

The Group is dedicated in providing the most pleasurable dining experience for all, consistently and 

creatively. We seek to continuously improve customers’ experiences with our Tung Lok Service 

(同乐服务), where we continuously delight customers with innovative and unique dining experiences. 

Achievements for our Exemplary Customer Services

• Excellent Service Award

The Excellent Service Award (“EXSA”) which was launched in 1994, recognises individuals who have 

provided exceptional and memorable customer service. This is organised by the Association of 

Singapore Attractions (“ASA”) and Enterprise Singapore. The award categories presented include the 

Silver, Gold and Star. All awardees attend a 4-hour EXSA workshop to inculcate the importance of quality 

service. In 2018, a total of 85 employees from our Group received the EXSA. This included 36 Silver 

awardees, 43 Gold awardees and 6 Star awardees.

• Franchising and Licensing Association Awards

Dancing Crab and Slappy Cakes received the Customer Service Excellence Award at the annual 

Franchising &amp; Licensing Association (FLA) Awards 2018.

• Loyalty &amp; Engagement Awards

The TungLok First loyalty programme scored a Silver in the “Best Loyalty Programme – F&amp;B/Dining” 

category at the Loyalty &amp; Engagement Awards 2018 organised by Marketing Magazine, demonstrating 

our commitment to our loyal customer base.

• Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore

The Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore (“CSISG”) is a quantitative measure of customer 

satisfaction cutting across sectors and sub-sectors in the services industry of Singapore that is 

jointly developed by the Institute of Service Excellence (ISE) at SMU and the Singapore Workforce 

Development Agency (WDA). The CSISG acts as a performance yardstick against our competitors. 

TungLok Signatures achieved a satisfaction score of 76.9, which was the highest score achieved 

compared to all other restaurants in 2018.

Employment

Our employees, being at the forefront of our business, are key in enriching our guests’ overall dining 

experience. As our employees are our most valuable assets, attracting and retaining top talents is of 

great significance to Tung Lok. In order to consistently provide excellent customer service, the Group 

places emphasis on employing individuals with the necessary competencies, experience, qualifications 

and mind-set. We employ qualified candidates without any discrimination against age, gender, race, 

marital status, nationality or religion. We are committed to maintaining a talented, dedicated and diverse 

workforce and to providing equal opportunities in employment. Gender diversity is also present in our 

Board where 2 out of 8 directors are females. 

The Group creates a healthy work culture which values and respects our employees’ contributions, 

independent of age, gender, race, marital status, nationality or religion. Open communication is actively 

promoted to effectively gather constructive feedback to better achieve our corporate goals. 

Employee handbook

We employ human resource strategies and policies which emphasise fair employment practices. The 

employee handbook outlines the Company’s basic operational and human resource policies concerning 

employee conduct, fringe benefits and terms and conditions of employment.

Customers’ Feedback Report

All customer feedback is important and integral to our continued success. Our formal service recovery 

process provides a systematic decision-making framework to appropriately manage all customer 

feedback in a prompt manner. Each concern, if possible, must be addressed and a response given within 

24 hours. The Group identifies areas for improvement based on insights gathered through the monthly 

customers’ feedback report which contains information about compliments and concerns as well as areas 

for improvements. 

Service Handbook

A service handbook has been specially designed for all Tung Lok employees. The handbook is presented 

to each employee upon hiring and the contents will be explained during the orientation. The message in 

the handbook is reinforced in the restaurants through role plays, daily roll call and displayed on the staff 

notice boards.

In FY19, we received a total of 268 compliments (about 91%) and 27 concerns (about 9%).

Employee incentives

The Group believes in rewarding employees where credits are due. Such incentives includes the policy 

of service incentives which reward service staff for their contributions and help to align their interests 

to those of the Group’s. Long Service Awards are awarded on an annual basis to reward long-serving 

employees for their dedication. Annual reviews of remuneration packages are performed to ensure that 

the compensation and benefits are in line with market rates to facilitate recruitment and retention of 

talents.

Social collaborations

In FY19, we have also started several collaborations to help the less fortunate in the society, including 

with Highpoint Community Services Association (“HCSA”) Academy. HCSA provides support for the 

less fortunate, including ex-offenders, abused teenage girls and single parents with limited support. 

The HCSA Academy offers a robust 6-week Culinary Training Programme which aims to empower and 

enable HSCA’s beneficiaries and other vulnerable individuals with the professional skills required to 

secure stable employment in the F&amp;B sector, giving them a new lease in life and a level playing field to 

support themselves and their families. The Group has also been working with the Yellow Ribbon Project 

to support the reintegration journey for ex-offenders.

Our Group is involved in grooming the next generation of F&amp;B talents in Singapore. We have been the 

sponsor of the Gold and Silver Course Medal Awards for graduating students of Temasek Polytechnic’s 

Diploma in Baking and Culinary Science programme.

Training and Education

Our staff are the ambassadors of Tung Lok’s brand of service. The Group strongly believes that the 

provision of appropriate training opportunities and programmes for our employees is key in equipping 

them with relevant skill sets to help them realise their full potential in their careers.

Since 2009, we have been an accredited in-house WSQ Approved Training Organisation (“ATO”). Some 

of the WSQ certified programmes that we run include ‘F&amp;B Safety and Hygiene’ and ‘Provide Specialty 

Coffee Service’. The employees who have undergone this training are empowered to provide better 

quality services.

Other training programmes which our employees have undergone include computer literacy courses, 

language courses and specialist F&amp;B courses such as Coffee and Wine Appreciation courses. 

Subsidies for specific approved courses have been provided as we believe that employee learning 

and professional growth from these courses is necessary for the long-term Group’s efficiency and 

productivity.

Moral education programmes (弟子规) are conducted periodically to inculcate positive social values in 

our employees so that they demonstrate goodwill and diligence to stakeholders when carrying out their 

duties.

All confirmed and permanent employees will undergo an annual performance appraisal where career 

development is discussed and training needs are identified.

training for their professional growth.

Procurement

With consumers becoming ever more health conscious, Tung Lok has stepped up efforts to better meet 

their dietary preferences while ensuring they still get top-quality fare. The Group procures a wide range 

of goods and services to support our operations from more than 600 suppliers. We aim to source goods 

and services from socially responsible vendors to reduce any negative impact on the environment while 

ensuring our customers are served the freshest and healthiest ingredients from sustainable sources.

The Group ensures that all of the Group’s suppliers have obtained necessary approvals from AVA/SFA. 

Suppliers

Currently, close to 100% of the suppliers we liaise directly with, are based in Singapore. These suppliers 

source ingredients from the neighbouring region including Malaysia, Vietnam and China. We endeavour 

to create a positive impact in the community we operate in by supporting these local businesses. 

Our team makes frequent farm visits to source for wholesome and reliable food supplies. We have 

performed eight (8) site visits to suppliers, such as Indoguna Singapore and Angliss Singapore, to audit 

the supplier’s environment and obtain assurance about the quality of its source.

The Group has a selection policy that evaluates new and existing vendors based on criteria which 

include, but are not limited to:

- quality of services and/or products;

- responsiveness and support;

- delivery performance; and

- price competitiveness.

New vendors are also carefully screened and closely monitored.

Collaboration with Silver Hill Farm

We have sold more than 200,000 ducks till date from one of our esteemed suppliers, Silver Hill Farm. 

Silver Hill Farm purchases renewable energy for its operations and belongs to the Origin Green 

programme. This is a voluntary sustainability programme in Ireland where member companies have 

independently verified and annually monitored sustainability plans.

Collaboration with local farms 

The term “food miles” describes the distance in which food has travelled from the place of production 

to the place of consumption. Purchasing more local produce will lead to the reduction of food miles. The 

reduction of food miles helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change. 

In line with our goals to reduce food miles and supporting more local farms in Singapore, we have also 

collaborated with local farms such as Edible Garden City, Kin Yan Agrotech and Hydro Urban to source 

for their fresh local produce.

Eco-friendly restaurant essentials

The Group demonstrated its commitment to protecting the environment with its use of biodegradable 

packaging for all take-away packaging, recyclable aprons and eco-friendly unbleached bamboo cocktail 

napkins. 

The take-away plastic bags that we currently use contain the d2w certified plastic additive. The d2w 

additive is included at the manufacturing stage and allows everyday plastic products to degrade in the 

presence of oxygen into biodegradable materials which can be recycled back into nature more quickly 

than ordinary plastic.

15




Some of our restaurants and our Halal catering division, Bellygood, use disposable plastic cutlery and 

plateware containing 70% organic content, which is made of corn. These plastic cups, plates, and cutlery 

can completely degrade in 90 days under landfill conditions.

Recyclable aprons are also used in our Tung Lok Seafood and Dancing Crab outlets islandwide. 

We have started using eco-friendly bamboo cocktail napkins in some of our restaurants. Bamboo is a 

great alternative to conventional tissues from wood pulp as it is a resilient grass which grows faster than 

any other woody plant, and does not require the use of pesticides or insecticides. Its qualities make it a 

readily available and accessible sustainable resource.

Sustainable Business Practices

Palm oil is the world’s most flexible oil and is widely used in the F&amp;B industry. Southeast Asia Alliance for 

Sustainable Palm Oil (“SASPO”) is an initiative led by World Wide Fund for Nature (“WWF”) Singapore 

which champions the use of sustainable palm oil in business supply chains. As part of our commitment 

as a member of SASPO, we have achieved our target of 100% Group-wide use of Roundtable on 

Sustainable Palm Oil (“RSPO”) (4) certified palm oil for direct cooking. This represents our commitment 

towards sustainable palm oil practices and doing our part to stop the slash-and-burn method of 

deforestation to clear forests in order to make way for palm oil plantations.

Note:

4 

Sustainable palm oil is from plantations that follow the strict standards set out by the RSPO, which is a global certification 

body of sustainable palm oil.

Our brand Lingzhi Vegetarian was the official F&amp;B sponsor for the fourth instalment of Earthfest, which 

took place on 20 January 2019 at Marina Barrage. A fully volunteer-driven and non-profit community 

festival, Earthfest showcases and supports local organisations that are committed to sustainable business 

practices. The one-day festival, which aims to create greater awareness of environmental conservation 

and sustainable living, drew strong crowds of families, foodies and environmental enthusiasts.

The Group introduced a new range of mooncakes in FY19 which contained less sugar and more dietary 

fibre while not compromising on taste, and has been certified by the Health Promotion Board (HPB) as 

a healthier choice. The mooncakes had been well-received by the general public. Going forward, the 

Group will continue to explore and introduce more healthy products.

In line with industry practices of removing straws completely from restaurant practices or providing 

them only on request, which is part of WWF’s Plastic ACTion (“PACT”) business coalition and supported 

by the National Environment Agency and Zero Waste SG, the Group has adopted similar practices to 

contribute to reducing the excessive use of plastics. However, if our customers do request for straws, we 

offer them plant straws made from polylactic acid (PLA) which is a new material made from sustainable 

and renewable resources such as corn and tapioca, and is 100% biodegradable and compostable.

16




Sustainable Seafood Practices

Increasing seafood consumption worldwide has exerted growing pressures on existing seafood supplies, 

threatening the sustainable yield of the seas. The Group has purchased seafood such as salmon, 

barramundi, prawns, lobsters, oysters, clams and scallops from suppliers with sustainable business 

practices when practicable. These seafood have been sourced from suppliers accredited with sustainable 

seafood practices such as the Friend of the Sea (5), Global Aquaculture Alliance (“GAA”) (6) and Marine 

Stewardship Council (“MSC”) (7).

Friend of the Sea is the only sustainable fisheries certification program which is recognised by the European Union 

national accreditation body, Accredia. It has become the leading certification standard for products and services which 

respect and protect the marine environment. Its mission is in line with the United Nations 2020 Sustainable Development 

Goals, which is to protect the ocean by means of promoting sustainable fisheries, aquaculture and shipping.

GAA is an international independent and non-profit organisation founded by a wide range of international aquaculture 

companies, American chain seafood restaurants and wholesalers, and agribusiness companies such as Monsanto 

and Cargill in 1997. GAA has become the leading standards-setting organisation for aquaculture seafood with the 

development of its Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) certification standards through its dedication to the advocacy, 

education, and leadership in promoting responsible aquaculture practices.

MSC is an international independent and non-profit organisation founded by WWF and Unilever in 1997 to recognise 

and reward sustainable fishing efforts to protect oceans and safeguard seafood supplies for the future.

12. GOVERNANCE

Anti-corruption

Our Employee Handbook sets out expectations of employees in relation to issues such as fraud, 

conflicts of interest and anti-competitive conduct. We conduct our business by inculcating a clean 

and transparent working culture within the organisation. We understand the detrimental effect that 

corruption has on organisations and the society and are determined to ensure that our business 

decisions and actions are ethical and in full compliance with local legal requirements. We do not 

condone any malpractice, impropriety, non-compliance of statutory law and rules and regulations or 

wrongdoing by employees in the course of performing their duties. 

The Group’s whistleblowing policy is displayed on staff notice boards at all our outlets. The policy 

encourages and protects employees to report their concerns regarding accounting or financial matters, 

internal controls, disclosure of information, conflict of interest, insider trading, or any other areas 

involving fraud, corruption and misconduct of employees. The public, customers and other stakeholders 

can also report any improprieties, or provide other feedback through the Company’s website at

Management and key executives are required to submit annual conflict of interest declarations for 

independent assessment to demonstrate their willingness to adhere to the conflicts of interest policy.
