DEAR STAkEhOLDERS,

on behalf of the Board of directors (“the Board”) of 

Sunningdale tech Ltd (“Sunningdale” or “the group”), 

i am pleased to present our inaugural Sustainability 

report. 

as a leading one-stop precision plastic engineering 

company that supplies to the global market, our emphasis 

has always been on the long-term sustainability of our 

operations. our global presence spans across nine 

countries with 20 manufacturing locations serving a 

diverse customer base and wide product offering. at 

present, the group employs approximately 9,000 staff 

around the world. 

as an integral player across worldwide supply chains, we 

strive to instil core values and a culture that reflects our 

commitment to social and environmental responsibility. 

While we have always placed sustainability at the core of 

our business, we undertook our first formal materiality 

assessment under the guidance of independent 

consultants in July 2017. Stemming from this initiative, 

we set up a Sustainability Steering Committee as our 

official management body responsible for overseeing 

our sustainability efforts. 

Led by the group’s Chief executive officer, these 

efforts have translated to the identification of five key 

environmental, Social and governance (“eSg”) matters. 

our list of eSg matters for reporting include occupational 

health &amp; Safety, ethics, Bribery &amp; Corruption, Waste 

Management, Customer health and Safety, and Material 

use in our processes. Within each of these sections, we 

have outlined our policies, case studies and success rates 

over the period at our Singapore manufacturing site. 

gradually, we aim to expand the scope of reporting to 

include our overseas operations in future sustainability 

reports. 

SAfEgUARDINg ThE ENvIRONmENT

at Sunningdale, we adopt best practices in ensuring 

our supply chain processes are environmentally friendly 

while continuously seeking and investing into new 

technologies geared towards energy conservation, 

minimising resource consumption and reducing waste. 

during the financial year, our perpetual goal of zero 

chemical spill and cases of improper disposal of waste 

was achieved. additionally, our proactive approach to 

reducing and reusing raw materials has translated to 

lower operating costs while allowing us to partake in 

conserving the earth’s finite resources. our four-pronged 

strategy which includes the monitoring and review of 

processes, control measures, generating awareness 

amongst staff and process optimisation continues to 

yield positive results in safeguarding the environment. 

OUR mOST vALUABLE ASSET

over the course of our thirty-year history, it has been our 

belief that human capital is an essential component to 

our continued growth. We take pride in our people, who 

remain our most valuable asset. Creating a healthy and 

safe workplace for our employees is thus at the top of 

our agenda. our Quality, environmental, occupational 

health &amp; Safety (“QehS”) policy continues to set the 

standards required to ensure our staff work in optimal 

conditions. 

accordingly, our employees attend regular training 

sessions on environmental, health and Safety (“ehS”) 

issues as well as training on the appropriate use of 

machinery used in our operations. in accordance with 

the international Society of automation (“iSa”), we 

also ensure that our employees are equipped with the 

relevant protective equipment such as safety shoes, 

goggles and gloves along with the periodic maintenance 

of equipment to ensure safety.

SuSTainaBiliTy rePorT 2017

While there have been cases of injury and occupational disease reported over 

the period, we remain relentless in our pursuit of preventing a reoccurrence 

of these incidents. following thorough investigations into each incident, the 

root causes are analysed and corrective actions are systematically implemented 

across the organisation. Looking ahead, we will continue to remain vigilant as 

we work towards our goal of zero accidents in subsequent financial years. 

ADhERINg TO ThE hIghEST STANDARDS Of CORPORATE gOvERNANCE 

Strong business ethics underpin our organisation. our adherence to the 

highest standards of corporate governance continues to translate to productive 

collaborations and has set us apart from our peers in terms of improving our 

competitiveness in the global market. 

We maintain a Code of Business ethics and Conduct which outlines clear 

expectations for every employee, guiding our decision making in all aspects 

of the business. We have also officially instituted a whistle-blowing policy, 

a formalised channel for all stakeholders to report wrongdoing within the 

organisation. all matters raised through this channel are looked into and 

addressed by an official Whistle-blowing Committee. furthermore, the internal 

controls we have in place are reviewed regularly, despite the fact that zero cases 

of corruption or whistle-blowing incidents were reported over the period under 

review. 

Sustainability will continue to be central to who we are and how we operate. We 

strive to put safety first in all we do. as a worldwide leader in precision plastic 

engineering, Sunningdale is committed to protecting our customers who we 

remain fortunate to serve. We will look to build upon our success in 2017, while 

investing in doing what is right for our employees, customers, shareholders and 

the environment.

about

The Report

Sunningdale tech Ltd (“Sunningdale”) is pleased to present its inaugural sustainability 

report which has been prepared in accordance to Singapore exchange Securities trading 

Limited’s (“SgX-St”) Mainboard listing rule 711(B) and the global reporting initiative 

(“gri”) Standards – ‘Core’ reporting requirements. 

the reporting scope covers only Sunningdale’s Singapore operations for the financial year 

2017 (“fy2017”) from 1st January 2017 to 31st december 2017, with the financial year 2016 

(“fy2016”) from 1st January 2016 to 31st december 2016 being the year of comparison.

in line with the phased approach encouraged by SgX, Sunningdale aims to take gradual 

steps to expand the reporting scope from Singapore to include the other significant overseas 

operations in future reports. 

Sunningdale has not sought external assurance for this report but will consider doing so as 

reporting matures over time.

for any queries in relation to this report or other feedback on our sustainability practices, 

please feel free to write in to csrs@sdaletech.com.

Stakeholder group

Activities

an exhaustive list of potential 

environmental, Social, and governance 

(“eSg”) matters was identified 

by independent sustainability 

consultants through desktop research, 

benchmarking reviews and discussions 

with Sunningdale’s management. 

the matters identified in Step 1 were 

rated and prioritised in terms of 

importance by representatives from 

the various departments, taking into 

consideration both an internal and 

external stakeholders’ perspective. 

Material matters that were identified 

from Step 2 were presented to the 

Board for their validation and approval.

in the subsequent financial years, 

these identified material matters will 

be reviewed and reassessed for their 

continued relevance and importance to 

Sunningdale.

in July 2017, Sunningdale conducted its first formal materiality assessment under 

the guidance of independent sustainability consultants. Key personnel from various 

departments were involved in the process. While external stakeholders were not 

involved in this round of assessment, representatives from Sunningdale took 

into consideration both internal and external stakeholders’ perspectives during 

the prioritisation step. the materiality assessment process adopted a four-step 

approach as outlined in figure 5 below. the results of the materiality assessment 

are presented in figure 6.

governance 

EThICS, BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION

Strong business ethics are vital to the success of 

Sunningdale as an organisation. upholding ethical 

conduct in the course of business and ensuring 

high standards of corporate governance increases 

our stakeholders’ confidence in us. this translates 

to 

productive 

collaborations, 

improving 

our 

competitiveness in the global market and amongst our 

peers. 

Sunningdale maintains a Code of Business ethics 

and Conduct that outlines clear expectations of all 

employees and guides them in decision-making, such as 

evaluation of conflict of interests. Sunningdale has also 

instituted a whistle-blowing policy, a formalised channel 

for both internal and external parties to express their 

concerns about suspected wrongful activities within 

the organisation. the Whistle-blowing committee of 

Sunningdale comprises of the Chief executive officer 

(“Ceo”), the Chief financial officer (“Cfo”), the human 

resource (“hr”) director, and the internal audit (“ia”) 

manager; this committee is tasked to look into all matters 

raised from the whistle-blowing channel pertaining to 

Sunningdale group. 

non-compliance to any laws and regulations, be it 

financial or non-financial, is treated very seriously at 

Sunningdale as it may bring about severe repercussions 

to the organisation, such as impairing our stakeholders’ 

confidence in our organisation, monetary penalties and 

affecting our brand as an organisation. to avoid any non-

compliance, Sunningdale’s ia team conducts regular 

compliance audit internally and ensures respective 

processes are maintained to upkeep the compliance. 

all new employees are required to undergo an 

orientation programme. during this session, they are 

briefed and trained on the policies and practices of 

the organisation, including the organisation’s anti-

corruption policies and practices, and informed about 

the channels of communications they have access to 

such as the whistle-blowing channel. 

all vendors must acknowledge and sign our standard 

Code of Business ethics and Conduct form as part 

of our vendor Survey form, which is uploaded to our 

online data vault. the form includes our anti-corruption 

policies and practices. We seek to ensure that all our 

suppliers comply with laws and regulations and adhere 

to Sunningdale’s Code of Business ethics and Conduct.

While our Board of directors do not receive training on 

anti-corruption as they are experienced on the subject, 

Sunningdale’s anti-corruption policies and practices are 

communicated to and approved by the Board. 

there were no cases of corruption in both 2016 and 2017. 

the whistle-blowing committee also did not receive any 

cases in both financial years. 

an enterprise risk Management (“erM”) Policy is in 

place to formalise the reporting, assessment, treating 

and monitoring of each significant risk that the group 

faces in achieving its business objectives. Such risks, 

including mitigating actions, are reported to the Board 

through the audit and risk Committee on an annual 

basis and are followed-up by the in-house internal audit 

team as part of its annual audit plan. further, in support 

of the erM Policy, a Control Self-assessment (“CSa”) 

framework is also in place to self-assess internal controls 

(covering compliance among others) in accordance with 

the group’s requirements and specifically address any 

significant weaknesses and/or risks identified.

Sunningdale will continue to review and improve 

internal controls to maintain such track record in future, 

an objective indicator of robust governance processes 

in Sunningdale.

at Sunningdale, we believe that our employees are our 

most valuable assets, thus creating a healthy and safe 

workplace for employees is of utmost importance to 

us. We ensure that health and safety of our employees 

are not compromised on. though Sunningdale takes 

proactive efforts to reduce any risk of occupational 

health and safety, we have also established various 

channels of feedback for employees and stakeholders. 

Should employees or any stakeholders have any 

feedback or concerns with regards to our occupational 

health and safety practices, they can write in to csrs@

sdaletech.com, raise a case through the whistle-blowing 

mechanism, or approach the environment, health and 

Safety (“ehS”) Committee directly. Cases raised through 

the sustainability email address and whistle-blowing 

mechanism that pertain to occupational health and 

safety are directed to the ehS Committee. Please refer 

to figure 8 and 9 for the ehS Committees at 51 Joo Koon 

Circle (“51JKC”) and 18 Joo Koon Crescent (“18JKC”) 

respectively. 100% of our employees are represented in 

either ehS Committees.  in 2016 and 2017, zero cases 

were raised through both feedback mechanisms.

owing to the accidents that have occurred, Sunningdale 

has not managed to meet its perpetual target of 

zero accident rate. With our regular internal audits 

conducted by the ehS department and annual external 

audits conducted by independent organisations, areas 

of improvement to our safety practices are identified, 

helping Sunningdale to continually improve our 

processes and implement best practices. 

in addition to these measures, Sunningdale also intends 

to revise our control measures and create greater 

awareness during our annual ehS promotion event. 

We will continue to make consistent improvements to 

work towards having zero cases of accident rates in the 

subsequent financial years.

Sunningdale seeks to build fulfilling and long-lasting 

partnerships with all customers. the key aspect of 

achieving this goal is to satisfy them by providing 

products of the finest quality. to deliver this, 

Sunningdale has in place a value chain that begins from 

its supply chain to its operations and finally through 

communications and awareness with customers and 

suppliers, such as through our standard Code of 

Business ethics and Conduct form. More details on our 

supply chain can be found in the write-up below. for 

our operations, Sunningdale maintains a robust quality 

management system that is in line with international 

standards such as iSo14001, iSo9001, iatf16949, 

iSo13485, aS9100 certifications.  

as Sunningdale manufactures products based on our 

customers’ specification, we are restricted in our ability 

to modify the product designs. however, Sunningdale 

takes necessary precautions to ensure that our 

operations are in compliance with requirements from 

the relevant authorities and takes steps to safeguard the 

quality of our products whenever possible.

SUPPLY ChAIN

Sunningdale understands that the quality of our 

suppliers’ products and services provided is vital to our 

ability to deliver to its customers. hence, Sunningdale 

follows a four-step supplier management process, 

which is detailed in figure 12.

one of the products manufactured by Sunningdale are 

scoops for infant milk powder. one key problem that 

was identified during an assessment of the production 

process was the presence of pests in the manufacturing 

area. a lizard was found inside a carton box, although it 

was not in direct contact with the scoops. the presence 

of the pests poses a potential threat to the health of the 

infants who are consuming the milk powder. to prevent 

such incidents, Sunningdale has a well-defined program 

in place since 2006 and was further enhanced in 2015 to 

ensure that the manufacturing process is operating in a 

pest-free environment. 

the pest control programme that Sunningdale 

implemented includes:

•	 Zonal strategy to ensure pests have multiple layers to 

penetrate before reaching the product.

•	 elimination of pest harbourage through inspections, 

packaging material, and process selection

•	 traps to allow close monitoring of infestations trends 

which will trigger extra actions before such pests 

become a problem

•	 Chemical control in selected areas deemed necessary

•	 Source elimination 

•	 Preventive treatment to ensure no re-infestation 

occurs 

Subsequently, the manufacturing area is subject to 

weekly employee checks and monthly checks by pest 

control service provider. 

the effectiveness of these pest controls measures was 

evaluated by pest trending analysis. the effectiveness 

of these measures can be verified as there was no 

recorded rodent activity throughout the entire financial 

year in 2016.  

the swift rectification of the pest issue is a testament 

to Sunningdale’s commitment towards the health and 

safety of its customers.

Waste is an area of concern for Singapore due to its 

increasing waste output coupled with its limited space 

available as a nation. at Sunningdale, we believe that 

effective waste management is essential not only for 

the benefit of the environment but also to protect 

the health of the community at large. Sunningdale’s 

sustainability policy states that we will continuously 

seek new technologies and methods to minimise 

resource consumption and reduce waste generation. to 

achieve this, we have adopted a four-pronged strategy: 

periodic review including monitoring and audits, control 

measures, employee awareness programme and process 

optimisation. We have indicated our key initiatives in 

figure 13. 

all of our waste is collected and disposed of by licensed 

third-party waste contractors who are approved by nea. 

figure 14 shows the waste produced by Sunningdale in 

2016 and 2017. Considering the nature of our business, 

we do not have full control over the process and raw 

materials to be used, limiting our ability to directly 

influence the amount of waste produced from the 

production process; however, the four-pronged waste 

management approach ensures control and identifies 

opportunities to reduce Sunningdale’s waste generation.

Sunningdale recognises the importance of using raw materials in 

a responsible manner, which translates to lower operating costs 

for us and allows us to play a role in conserving the earth’s finite 

resources. though Sunningdale does not have full autonomy on 

our material consumption as our customers determine the type 

and amount of materials to be used, we always take a proactive 

approach in reducing and reusing our raw materials. one of the 

ways Sunningdale does so is to reuse plastic pallets and totes 

(Shown in image 1) to transport products. 

during the production of plastic parts, either a hot runner 

system or cold runner system has to be used to mould the parts 

to a specified shape. using the hot runner system is more costly 

than the cold runner system; however, the hot runner system 

produces less wastage and results in significant material cost 

savings if production quantities are significant. though we offer 

both options to our clients, we would recommend our clients 

to opt for the hot runner system when cost savings outweigh 

the premium paid for the adoption of this system, reducing the 

amount of waste generated from the moulding process.
