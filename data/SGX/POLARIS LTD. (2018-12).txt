LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS 

 

Dear Valued Shareholders,  

 

DEVELOPMENTS IN FY2018  

 

It has been an eventful year. In 2018, the Company 

undertook several strategic initiatives in order to 

strengthen our financial position and transform our 

business. The Group welcomed experienced industry 

leaders to our board and executive management team 

and realigned our operations with the disposal of two 

business units. We believe that these changes will 

provide the platform to drive sustainable growth in 

both our existing and new business segments.  

 

The global economy continues to be fraught with 

uncertainties, 

with 

trade 

conflicts 

dampening 

economic sentiment amid signs of slowing growth. 

These factors exert further pressure on the retail 

industry, where profitability is already strained by 

fierce online competition and elevated rental costs. 

The 

Singapore 

telecommunications 

sector 

saw 

increased competition from mobile virtual network 

operators (“MVNOs”). The anticipated entry of the 

fourth telecommunications operator into the saturated 

industry has also spurred the incumbents to innovate 

and launch new mobile plans and data packages in 

order to fend off the increased competition.  

 

We also observe that leading brands such as Apple 

and Dyson are augmenting their premium products 

with best in class customer service experiences. In 

addition, we recognise that Singapore has been at the 

forefront of embracing technology and implementing 

the disciplines of science, technology, engineering 

and 

mathematics 

(“STEM”) 

through 

continuous 

education to equip the workforce, teachers and 

students for the Industry 4.0 revolution. The education 

and entertainment sectors are also harnessing the 

growing capabilities of robotics to innovate on the 

delivery of products and services.  

 

In light of the evolving business landscape, Polaris 

has proactively rebalanced our portfolio. We have 

reduced our exposure to the retail telecommunications 

business in Singapore with the disposal of Polaris 

Telecom Pte Ltd. Following our strategic review, the 

Group is reallocating its resources to focus on 

developing 

our 

corporate 

business-to-business 

(“B2B”) sales, distribution, customer service, as well 

as to expand our presence in the growing educational 

robotics sectors.  

 

The Company is pleased to have been enlisted in the 

Apple Device Enrollment Program (“DEP”), which is 

slated for launch to our customers in 2019. This will 

enable us to enhance our service to our growing list of 

corporate clients. We have also more than doubled 

our service capacity for Dyson and are pleased to 

commence the year with a newly renovated and 

expanded service centre. Our Tech Lifestyle division 

has also witnessed substantial growth with a more 

comprehensive 

suite 

of 

products. 

We 

have 

collaborated actively with the regulatory bodies and 

institutions such as the Infocommunications Media 

Development 

Authority, 

National 

Library 

Board, 

schools and retail partners to create awareness and 

generate interest among students for STEM-based 

activities. Furthermore, as the sole distributor of 

Makeblock in Singapore, Polaris was proud to 

organise the highly successful 2018 MakeX SG 

Robotics Competition.  

 

On the regional front, Polaristitans delivered another 

solid year through sound account management 

through a targeted approach on key dealers and 

corporate accounts as well as reliable product 

forecasting. As part of our strategic review, we 

decided to exit the Myanmar business. This allows the 

Company to strengthen its financial position and 

utilise its resources to focus on the promising 

businesses. 

 

FINANCIAL REVIEW  

 

The Group posted revenue of S$23.1 million for the 

financial year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”) 

compared to S$34.7 million in the previous year. The 

challenging operating environment had significantly 

affected our top line. The turnover comparison 

excludes contributions from Polaris Telecom Pte Ltd 

as we had divested our retail telecommunications 

business in Singapore in FY2018. The Group 

recorded profit attributable to shareholders of S$0.2 

million for FY2018 compared to S$1.0 million in the 

financial year ended 31 December 2017 (“FY2017”), 

partly due to gain on disposal of Polaris Telecom Pte 

Ltd, offset by lower gross profit and write-off of loan 

receivable 

from 

our 

Myanmar 

franchisee. 

Nevertheless, we have strengthened our financial 

position with the cash proceeds received from the 

disposal of two business units. Net assets increased 

significantly from S$14.4 million in FY2017 to S$60.5 

million in FY2018. This was mainly due to the 

recognition of S$46.2 million attributed to the fair 

value of the Group’s 8.22% investment in PT 

Trikomsel Oke Tbk, whose shares had resumed 

trading on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in FY2018. 

 

CORPORATE 

SOCIAL 

RESPONSIBILITY 

AND 

SUSTAINABILITY 

 

As part of Polaris’ commitment to actively support the 

communities in which we live and work, our 

employees and their families volunteered at the 

Willing Hearts soup kitchen in September 2018.  

 

Willing Hearts is wholly run by volunteers, apart from 

a handful of staff. It operates a soup kitchen that 

prepares, cooks and distributes about 5,000 daily 

meals to over 40 locations islandwide throughout the 

year. Beneficiaries include the elderly, the disabled, 

low income families, children from single parent 

families or otherwise poverty stricken families, and 

migrant workers in Singapore.  

 

We are grateful to do our part to serve and contribute 

to our society so as to improve the lives of others.  

 

Polaris believes that incorporating sustainability 

metrics into our business operations is integral to 

creating value for our stakeholders. For more 

information on our sustainability efforts, performance 

and strategies in FY2018, please refer to the 

Sustainability Report on pages 10 to 20.

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS 

 

THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT  

 

We would like to extend a warm welcome to our new 

Non Executive Independent Director, Mr Masahiko 

Yabuki and Executive Director and Chief Operating 

Officer Mr Ong Soon Hwee, Gary, who joined our 

Board in 2018.  

 

Mr Masahiko Yabuki brings with him more than 35 

years of experience in business development, having 

forged a deep network of relationships in the Asia 

Pacific telecommunications and technology sectors. 

We look forward to his continued contribution as the 

Chairman of the Audit Committee as well as a 

member of the Remuneration and Nominating 

Committees.  

 

Mr Ong Soon Hwee, Gary, has significant experience 

in senior strategic leadership roles with extensive B2B 

and 

business-to-consumer 

(“B2C”) 

commercial 

pedigree across Asia, spanning media, entertainment, 

fast-moving 

consumer 

goods 

(“FMCG”) 

and 

consumer durable goods sectors. With his proven 

record, we are confident that he will be able to 

contribute positively to the growth of the Company.  

 

LOOKING AHEAD 

 

The Company continues to invest in our core 

businesses to sharpen the quality of our customer 

service and sales operations and to increase 

capacity. We are confident that Dyson will continue to 

be a leading household brand with innovative 

products. 

We 

will 

strive 

to 

exceed 

customer 

expectations with our enhanced service operations to 

further strengthen Dyson in Singapore. We also look 

forward to work closer with Apple to serve our 

corporate clients and to promote their expanding 

product offering in the market.  

 

While Tech Lifestyle is a developing business unit, we 

believe there are exciting growth opportunities as the 

educational robotics sector continues to evolve within 

Singapore and the region. We are working diligently 

to expand the product portfolio and increase its 

market reach. 

 

We will continue to monitor the market and remain 

disciplined, selective and strategic in our evaluation 

and execution to ensure that the Group is well 

positioned 

to 

capitalise 

on 

existing 

and 

new 

opportunities 

to 

drive 

sustainable 

growth 

and 

enhance shareholder value. 

 

WORDS OF APPRECIATION  

 

We would like to thank our shareholders, customers 

and business partners for your continued support to 

the Group. At the same time, we would like to thank 

our fellow directors, management team and all 

employees for their dedication and extensive efforts 

to strengthen Polaris during this year of significant 

changes.  

 

The strategic initiatives which we have undertaken in 

2018 have positioned Polaris to execute sustainable 

growth in our businesses. We look forward to work 

closely 

with 

our 

fellow 

Board 

members 

and 

management team to make 2019 a successful year 

together.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 

 

 

INTRODUCTION 

 

Polaris is pleased to present its second annual Sustainability Report. The report captures Polaris’s sustainability

consideration formal and informal feedback received throughout the year from a range of internal and external 

stakeholders to determine the most relevant material topics to be covered in the report.

OUR MATERIALITY TOPICS 

 

We have identified material topics for reporting based on the significance of our ESG and economic impacts and 

the degree of influence where we see the most potential for creating maximum value for our shareholders and 

stakeholders. In order to ensure an accurate determination of material issues, we undertook a process of 

identification, prioritisation and validation with our management team.  

 

Each sustainability factor is assigned a reporting priority that determines the actions required, as illustrated 

below:

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS 

 

Carbon Emissions 

 

We believe in progressively reducing our organisation’s carbon footprint by improving energy efficiency and 

minimising energy consumption. Polaris’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission is attributed to the use of electricity, 

diesel and petrol.  

 

In FY2018, our emission intensity was calculated at 0.0023 tonnes CO2e per onsite repair jobs, a decrease of 

18% from the preceding year. This was mainly attributed to the disposal of Polaris Telecom Pte. Ltd. in June 

2018 along with its two Singtel outlets. Emission from electricity represented 85% of our total carbon emissions.  

 

Energy 

 

Our management approach is to conserve energy consumption in our daily operations. Electricity that is used to 

power our office buildings and retail outlets has contributed to the majority of our energy consumption. Other 

notable consumption components include petroleum or diesel that is used for transportation and logistics.  

 

Compared to FY2017, our total energy consumption in FY2018 has dropped by 19%. This is largely owing to the 

disposal of the two Singtel outlets in June 2018 as abovementioned.  

 

A comparison chart in respect of our energy consumption for FY2017 and FY2018 is depicted in Figure 1 as 

shown below:  

 

 

 

Waste Minimisation 

 

Our management approach is to reduce, reuse and recycle waste wherever possible throughout our daily 

operations. Waste from our operations includes paper and packaging waste. Over the years, Polaris has 

implemented several other initiatives to reduce printed marketing materials. For instance, we have switched to 

sending e-cards during festive seasons from the conventional printed greeting cards. Empty ink cartridges are 

consolidated and returned to suppliers on a bimonthly basis. Packaging waste is also consolidated and recycled 

on a weekly basis.  

 

In FY2018, we have implemented a recycling initiative for Dyson parts. The faulty parts, which consist of Printer 

Circuit Boards (PCBs), motors and electrical cables extracted from fans and vacuums, are consolidated on a 

monthly basis and disposed of by a credible disposal company. All disposals will be completed with a certificate 

of destruction.

OUR WORKPLACE 

 

Polaris practices fair employment and is aligned with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment guidelines. Our 

human resource policies are aimed at providing a fair performance-based work culture that is diverse, inclusive 

and collaborative. We also encourage our people to reach their fullest potential and provide them with a fulfilling 

and meaningful career.  

 

As at 31 December 2018, our workforce consists of 37 employees. Permanent employees represented 84% of 

the total headcount. Employees with managerial or supervisory roles accounted for 24% of our workforce.  

 

Talent Attraction and Retention 

 

We believe investing in our people is crucial to the success of a business. We manage our human capital 

investment by attracting and nurturing the right talent, as well as caring for their professional growth and personal 

well-being during their employment with us. This can be attested by Polaris’s low staff attrition rate.  

 

In addition, we continue to leverage our partnership with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) to support 

work-study programmes, providing traineeship opportunities to students as part of their course modules. This 

programme is designed to prepare students for the future workforce by equipping them with employable, real-

world skills and experiences, whilst allowing them to complete their studies. 

 

Polaris conducts annual performance appraisals and quarterly career development reviews for our employees as 

part of the performance management system. Managers are equipped with relevant skills to conduct effective 

performance appraisals with their teams.  

 

Training and Education 

 

With the rapid changes in our industry, it is important for our people to keep updated on the latest industry 

developments. At Polaris, we encourage and aim to provide all employees with equal opportunities for training 

and upgrading. We believe that learning and training is an important, continuous and life-long process so that 

employees are equipped with the competencies needed to meet current and future business needs. This includes 

workshops, seminars, conferences, in-house company training and on-the-job training.  

 

We strongly believe that it is important to continuously provide our employees with the correct training. This, in 

return, allows the business to be cost-effective, increasing credibility and expertise as well as improving job 

satisfaction, and creates a competitive edge in the market.  

 

Diversity and Equal Opportunity 

 

We believe that creating a diverse workplace environment is essential to building and sustaining our competitive 

advantage. Such diversity fosters innovative thinking and helps tackle business challenges through different 

perspectives.  

 

Moreover, we strive to offer equal opportunities in hiring, career advancements, promotions and remuneration 

based on merit and experience irrespective of gender, age, racial, ethnic or cultural background. Female 

employees account for 40% of our total workforce.  

 

Marketing and Labelling 

 

Polaris recognises that fair marketing practices and being transparent in the way we communicate can build trust 

and loyalty among our customers, partners and suppliers. We adhere to strict marketing codes to ensure that all 

marketing activities comply with the various laws and guidelines such as the Singapore Code of Advertising 

Practice, the Info-communications Media Development Authority’s Codes of Practice and Guidelines, and the 

PDPA.  

 

In FY2018, we have not identified any non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes concerning 

information and labelling, or marketing communications including advertising, promotion and sponsorships in 

relation to products and services that we offer.  

 

Moving forward, we strive to maintain the quality of our products and services as well as retail and distribution 

channels by choosing the right type of products and services to fit our business model. Quality checks will also be 

continuously deployed by our staff to ensure compliance with applicable regulations relating to marketing and 

labelling in the markets we operate.

OUR COMMUNITY 

 

We encourage our employees to participate in community and environmental initiatives through volunteering, and 

supported several community initiatives throughout the year. We are grateful to do our part to serve and 

contribute to our society so as to improve the lives of others. Our key community investment programmes in 2018 

are described below. 

 

Willing Hearts 

 

We were given an opportunity to volunteer at Willing Hearts for a day, where we prepared and delivered meals to 

the beneficiaries.  Willing Hearts is a non-profit organization ran almost entirely by volunteers, apart from a 

handful of staff. It operates a soup kitchen that prepares, cooks and distributes about 5,000 daily meals to over 

40 locations island wide, 365 days a year. Beneficiaries include the elderly, disabled, low income families, 

children from single parent families or otherwise poverty stricken families, and migrant workers in Singapore.  

 

Qhubeka 

 

Qhubeka is a non-profit charity established in 2005 in South Africa incorporated for public benefit and donates 

bicycles as part of World Bicycle Relief’s charity programme in South Africa. Through Polaris’ donation of more 

than 80,000 bicycles, we have in many ways helped people to be connected to schools, clinics and jobs. 

 

Bicycles serve as tools of change in people’s lives, especially for communities with limited options for means of 

transport. The availability of bicycles could, for some, mean that going to school is no longer a 2 hours to and fro 

daily walking journey. Moreover, going to work or visiting a clinic or shop would be more convenient, time efficient 

and cost-effective. Last but not least, in times of natural disasters where major transport options could be 

compromised, bicycles serve as the primary means of travel for first responders. 

 

Through our contributions, we aspire to be socially responsible in enhancing the quality of life of those in need 

and to assist them to progress and move forward. 

 

 

OUR ECONOMY 

 

Our management approach is to create value for our shareholders and stakeholders by ensuring sustainable 

growth for our business. We are focused on adopting strategies that maximise shareholder returns while creating 

environmental, social and economic value for our stakeholders.  

 

We regularly review our management approach in view of the business goals, stakeholder expectations and the 

actual performance to evaluate effectiveness.  

 

Anti-Corruption  

 

Polaris adheres to a zero-tolerance policy on fraud and unethical conduct including corruption and bribery. A 

whistle-blowing process is in place and supported. There was no reported incident of corruption in the reporting 

period.  

 

Procurement Governance 

 

Polaris adopts a fair business trading framework and procures from suppliers who conduct business ethically.  

 

With the extensive varieties and range of products to procure from different sectors of suppliers, we have 

stringent procurement processes in place to ensure good corporate governance and compliance with anti-bribery 

and corruption rules and regulations. 

 

Our procured products and supplies are from two groups: principle brands which the business units are 

representing, namely Apple, Dyson, Makeblock and Singtel; and other suppliers for products such as computer 

accessories, lifestyle and audio devices. 

 

We encourage and support local businesses. In FY2018, our total purchase spending was approximately $21 

million, a decrease of 65% from the preceding year. Out of our 58 regular vendors, only one was from overseas 

import as we represent the brand as its distributor in Singapore. This overseas vendor comprises 0.9% of our 

total purchases. 

 

We work actively to combat corruption in all of its forms, which includes bribery, unfair competition, conflicts of 

interest, fraud, embezzlement and unlawful kickbacks. 

 

 


18

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 

 

All procurement is processed through our Enterprise Resource Planning system with its multi-tiered approval 

process, whereby up to three levels of approving officers are required to approve and sign off on the issuing of 

Purchase Orders in the system. This is to address conflicts of interest and ensure the correct latest purchase 

price, as illustrated in the diagram below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As an integral part of supply chain management, we also diligently sort out the delivered goods packaging and 

ensure that they are disposed of in an environmentally and responsible manner. 

 

Going forward, we are looking at improving our warehousing and storage spaces to ensure better workplace 

safety and health.

by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the “SGX-ST”) in January 2015 (the “Guide”) and has 

incorporated answers to the questions set out in the Guide in this report. The Company is generally in 

compliance with the principles and guidelines as set out in the Code and in areas where there are deviations from 

the Code, appropriate explanations are provided within this report. The Board considers that the alternative 

corporate governance practices are sufficient to meet the underlying objective of the Code. 

 

 

BOARD MATTERS 

 

The Board’s Conduct of Affairs 

 

Principle 1: Every company should be headed by an effective Board to lead and control the company. The 

Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the company. The Board works with 

Management to achieve this objective and Management remains accountable to the Board. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

1.1 

The Board’s role is to: 

a. 

establish the overall business direction of the Group, with specific emphasis on 

business expansion and synergies; 

b. 

oversee the processes of evaluating the adequacy of internal controls, risk 

management, financial reporting and compliance, including safeguarding of 

shareholders’ interests and the company’s assets; 

c. 

approve major investment and divestment proposals, material acquisitions and 

disposal of assets, major corporate policies on key operations, annual budget, the 

release of the Group’s quarterly and full year results and interested person 

transactions of a material nature; 

d. 

identify the key stakeholder groups and recognise that their perceptions affect the 

company’s reputation; 

e. 

assume corporate governance practices directly or through the respective 

Committees; and 

f. 

consider sustainability issues e.g. environmental and social factors, as part of its 

strategic formulation. 

1.2 

All directors exercise due diligence and independent judgment, and are obliged to act in good 

faith as fiduciaries and consider at all times the best interests of the Company. 

1.3 

To assist the Board in executing its responsibilities, the Board has delegated specific 

functions to the Audit Committee (“AC”), Nominating Committee (“NC”) and Remuneration 

Committee (“RC”) (together “Board Committees” and each a “Board Committee”). Each of 

these Board Committees has its own written terms of reference and its actions are reported 

to and monitored by the Board. Minutes of the Board Committee meetings are available to all 

Board members. 

1.4 

The Board meets regularly, and has held meetings for particular and specific matters as and 

when required. The Company’s Constitution allows a board meeting to be conducted by 

means of conference telephones or similar communications equipment. 

 

A record of the directors’ attendance at meetings of Board and Board Committees for the 

financial year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”), as well as number of such meetings, is 

set out in Table 1. 

1.5 

The Company has adopted a set of Approving Authority &amp; Limit Guidelines (“Guidelines”), 

setting out the level of authorisation required for specified transactions, including those that 

require Board approval. Under the Guidelines, new investments or divestments and all 

commitments to banking facilities granted by financial institutions to the Company require the 

approval of the Board. 

1.6 

On directors’ training, the Group has instituted an orientation program for new directors to 

familiarise them with the Group’s core business and governance practices. Directors are also 

given an opportunity to visit the Group’s operational facilities and meet with management 

staff (the “Management”) to obtain a better understanding of the Group’s history, business 

operations, policies, strategic plans and objectives. Directors and senior executives are 


22

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 

encouraged to attend relevant training to enhance their skills and knowledge, particularly on 

new laws and regulations affecting the Group’s operations. 

 

All directors are provided with regular updates on changes in the relevant laws and 

regulations to enable them to make well-informed decisions and to ensure that the directors 

are competent in carrying out their expected roles and responsibilities. The directors are 

aware of the requirements in respect of disclosure of interests in securities, disclosure of 

conflicts of interest in transactions involving the Company, prohibition on dealings in the 

Company’s securities and restrictions on the disclosure of price-sensitive information. 

 

During the year, the Company Secretary has also updated the Directors on recent 

amendments to: 

• 

the Code of Corporate Governance and the SGX Listing Rules relating to 

corporate governance practices, which will come into effect from 1 January 2019 

onwards, and 

• 

the Companies Act (Cap 50) in relation to the financial year end, holding of 

annual general meetings, and filing of annual returns, which came into effect on 31 

August 2018. 

 

The Company has an on-going budget for all directors to attend appropriate courses, 

seminars and conferences for them to stay abreast of the relevant business developments. 

These include programmes run by the Singapore Institute of Directors or other training 

institutions. 

 

In FY2018, Mr Masahiko Yabuki and Mr Ong Soon Hwee, Gary (“Mr. Gary Ong”) completed 

The Listed Entity Director Programme conducted by Singapore Institute of Directors. Mr. 

Gary Ong also attended the SID-ISCA Directors’ Financial Reporting Fundamentals 

conducted by Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants. 

1.7 

A formal letter is sent to newly-appointed directors upon their appointment explaining their 

duties and obligations as directors. New directors, upon appointment, will also be briefed on 

their duties and obligations as directors. The directors are also informed of regulatory 

changes initiated by or affecting the Company.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 

Board Composition and Guidance 

 

Principle 2: There should be a strong and independent element on the Board, which is able to exercise 

objective judgement on corporate affairs independently, in particular, from Management and 10% 

shareholders. No individual or small group of individuals should be allowed to dominate the Board's decision 

making. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

2.1 

The Board comprises four directors of whom two are independent non-executive directors 

(INEDs) and two are executive directors (EDs). A summary of the current composition of the 

Board and its committee is set out in Table 2.1. 

2.2 

The Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) are not the same 

person. The Chairman of the Board is an independent director who is not part of the 

management team nor is he an immediate family member of the CEO. 

2.3 

The NC, which reviews the independence of each director on an annual basis, adopts the 

Code’s definition of what constitutes an independent director as well as the respective 

director’s self-declaration in the statement of director’s independence. The NC conducted its 

annual review of the directors’ independence and was satisfied that the Company complies 

with the guidelines of the Code including the guideline that at least one-third of the Board is 

made up of independent directors. The Board has reviewed and confirmed the independence 

of the independent directors. There are no directors who are deemed independent by the 

Board, notwithstanding the existence of a relationship as stated in the Code that would 

otherwise deem him not to be independent. 

2.4 

The Company has no independent non-executive director who has served on the Board  

beyond nine years  

2.5 

The Board is in the process of identifying an additional suitable independent non-executive 

director. 

2.6 

The Board recognises the importance of an appropriate balance and diversity of skills, 

experience, gender, knowledge and professional qualifications in building an effective Board. 

For this purpose, the NC reviews the Board’s collective skills matrix regularly. 

The directors bring with them an appropriate balance and diversity of gender and a broad 

range of expertise and experience in areas such as accounting, finance, business and 

management experience, industry knowledge, strategic planning and customer-based 

experience and knowledge. The diversity of the directors’ experience allows for the useful 

exchange of ideas and views. The profile of all Board members is set out in the section 

entitled ‘Board of Directors’. 

 

The current Board composition provides a diversity of skills, experience and knowledge 

to the Company as set out in Table 2.2. 

 

2.7 

The presence of non-executive directors is to assist in the development of proposals on 

strategy by constructively challenging Management. The non-executive directors also review 

the performance of Management in meetings. 

2.8 &amp; 3.4 

Non-executive directors and independent directors are scheduled to meet regularly, and as 

warranted, in the absence of key management personnel to discuss concerns or matters 

such as the effectiveness of Management. 

 

The Independent Non-executive Directors have met at least once without the presence of 

Management in FY2018.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

 

Principle 3: There should be a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the 

executives responsible for managing the company's business. No one individual should represent a 

considerable concentration of power. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

3.1 

The Board has adopted the recommendation of the Code to have separate persons appointed 

as Chairman and the CEO. This is to ensure an appropriate balance of power, increased 

accountability and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision-making. The division 

of responsibilities between the Chairman and the CEO is clearly established, set out in writing 

and agreed by the Board. Additionally, the Board has disclosed that there is no relationship 

between the Chairman and the CEO as immediate family members.  

 

The Board is of the view that there are sufficient safeguards and checks to ensure that the 

process of decision making by the Board is independent and based on collective decisions 

without any individual exercising any considerable power or influence. Further, the AC, RC 

and NC are chaired by independent directors. 

3.2 

Mr. Ong Kok Wah (“Mr. Ong”) was appointed as an independent non-executive director on 20 

May 2010 and as Chairman of the Board (the “Chairman”) on 1 March 2018. Mr. Ong is not 

related to the CEO and is not part of the management team. Mr. Soennerstedt Carl Johan 

Pontus (“Mr. Soennerstedt”) fulfils the role of the CEO of the Company.  

 

As Chairman, Mr. Ong is responsible for, amongst other things, exercising control over the 

quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information between the Management and the 

Board, and ensuring compliance with the Company’s guidelines on corporate governance 

along with promoting high standards of corporate governance. 

 

The Chairman is also responsible for, amongst other things, effectively representing the Board 

to the shareholders, ensuring that Board meetings are held when necessary, setting the Board 

meeting agenda in consultation with the Company Secretary, acting as facilitator at Board 

meetings and maintaining regular dialogue with the Management on all operational matters. At 

annual general meetings and other shareholders’ meetings, the Chairman ensures 

constructive dialogue between shareholders, the Board and the Management. 

 

The Chairman also promotes a culture of openness and debate at the Board, ensuring that the 

directors receive complete, adequate and timely information, and facilitates the effective 

contribution of non-executive directors in particular. 

 

3.3 

The Company did not appoint a lead independent director because: 

a. 

the Chairman and the CEO are not the same person; 

 

b. 

the Chairman and the CEO are not immediate family members; 

 

c. 

the Chairman is not part of the management team; and 

 

d. 

the Chairman is an independent director.

Board Membership 

 

Principle 4: There should be a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of 

directors to the Board. 

 

 

Guidelines 

of the 

Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

4.1 

The NC, regulated by a set of written terms of reference, comprises three members, a 

majority of whom, including the Chairman, are independent non-executive directors. The 

NC meets at least once a year. The members of the NC are as follows: 

1. 

Mr. Ong Kok Wah (Chairman, INED) 

 

2. 

Mr. Masahiko Yabuki (INED) 

 

3. 

Mr. Soennerstedt Carl Johan Pontus (ED) 

4.2  

The principal functions of the NC are to establish a formal and transparent process for: 

a. 

reviewing nominations of new director appointments based on selection 

criteria such as the nominee’s credentials and his/her skills and 

contributions required by the Company; 

 

b. 

reviewing and recommending to the Board the re-election of directors in 

accordance with the Company’s Constitution; 

 

c. 

deciding whether a director is able to and has adequately carried out 

his/her duties as a director of the Company, in particular whether the 

directors concerned have multiple board representations or if they are in 

conflict with the interest of the Company; and 

 

d. 

deciding how the performance of the Board, its board committees and 

directors may be evaluated and propose objective performance criteria. 

 

4.3 

The NC is also in charge of determining annually whether a director is “independent”, 

guided by the guidelines contained in the Code. 

 

The NC reviews annually the independence declarations made by the Company’s 

independent non-executive directors based on the criterion of independence under the 

guidelines provided in the Code. The NC has reviewed the independence of each director 

for FY2018 in accordance with the Code’s definition of independence and is satisfied that 

Mr. Ong and Mr. Masahiko Yabuki remain as independent directors of the Company. 

4.4 

The NC monitors and determines annually whether directors who have multiple board 

representations and other principal commitments, give sufficient time and attention to the 

affairs of the Company and adequately carry out his/her duties as a director of the 

Company. The NC takes into account the results of the assessment of the effectiveness of 

the individual director and his/her actual conduct on the Board, in making this 

determination. The NC and with the concurrence of the Board were satisfied that in 

FY2018, where a director had other listed company board representations and/or other 

principal commitments, the director was able to carry out and had been adequately 

carrying out his/her duties as a director of the Company. 

 

Notwithstanding that some of the directors have multiple board representations, the NC is 

satisfied that sufficient time and attention are being given by the directors to the affairs of 

the Company and each director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his/her 

duties as a director of the Company. 

 

The NC and the Board are of the standpoint that setting a maximum number of listed 

company board representations would not be meaningful as the contributions of the 

directors would depend on many other factors such as whether they are in full time 

employment and their other responsibilities or principal commitments. In addition, the 

board representations presently held by its directors do not impede the performance of 

their duties to the Company. 

4.5 

No alternate director has been appointed to the Board. 

 

 


26

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 

4.6 

In accordance with the Company’s Constitution, one third, or if their number is not a 

multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third of the directors are required to retire 

from office by rotation at each Annual General Meeting (“AGM”), (provided that no director 

holding office as managing director, shall be subject to retirement by rotation or be taken 

into account in determining the number of directors to retire). Newly appointed directors 

will hold office only until the next AGM following their appointments and they shall be 

eligible for re-election. Such directors are not taken into account in determining the number 

of directors who are to retire by rotation at that meeting. 

 

In making recommendations for the selection, appointment and re-appointment of 

directors, the NC evaluates composition and progressive renewal of the Board and the 

director’s contribution and performance, such as his/her attendance at meetings of the 

Board or Board Committees, where applicable, participation, candour and any special 

contributions.  

 

Each member of the NC has abstained from reviewing and approving his own re-election. 

 

The NC is responsible for identifying and recommending new board members to the 

Board, after considering the necessary and desirable competencies of the candidates 

which include; 

a. 

academic and professional qualifications; 

b. 

industry experience; 

c. 

number of other directorships; 

d. 

relevant experience as a director; and 

e. 

ability and adequacy in carrying out required tasks. 

 

The NC leads the process for board appointments and makes recommendations to the 

Board. The integrated process of appointment includes: 

a. 

developing a framework on desired competencies and diversity on board; 

b. 

assessing current competencies and diversity on board; 

c. 

developing desired profiles of new directors; 

d. 

initiating search for new directors including external search, if necessary; 

e. 

shortlist and interview potential director candidates; 

f. 

recommending appointments and retirements to the Board; and 

g. 

election at general meeting. 

4.7 

The NC has recommended to the Board that Mr. Soennerstedt be nominated for re-

election at the forthcoming AGM in accordance with Article 86 of the Company’s 

Constitution. Mr. Gary Ong will also be nominated for re-election at the forthcoming AGM 

in accordance with Article 93 of the Company’s Constitution.  

 

In making the recommendations, the NC has considered Mr.  Soennerstedt’s and Mr. Gary 

Ong’s (collectively, the “Retiring Directors” and each, the “Retiring Director”) overall 

contribution and performance. Mr Soennerstedt will, upon re-election as a Director, remain 

as Executive Director and CEO of the Company, and a member of the AC, NC and RC. Mr 

Gary Ong will, upon re-election as a Director, remain as Executive Director and Chief 

Operating Officer of the Company. 

 

There are no relationships (including immediate family relationships) between Mr. 

Soennerstedt and Mr. Gary Ong and the other Directors, the Company or 5% 

shareholder(s) of the Company. 

 

Key information in respect of the Directors, including their appointment dates and 

directorships held in the past three years, is set out in Table 3.1. 

 

Pursuant to Rule 720(5) of the Section B of the SGX-ST Listing Manual (Rules of Catalist) 

(the “Catalist Rules”), the information as set out in Appendix 7F to the Catalist Rules 

relating to the Retiring Directors is set out in Table 3.2.  

 

Other key information of the directors who held office during the year up to the date of this 

report is disclosed in the “Board of Directors” section of the Annual Report.

Board Performance 

 

Principle 5: There should be a formal annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and its 

board committees and the contribution by each director to the effectiveness of the Board. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

5.1 

The Board has, through the NC, implemented an annual evaluation process to assess the 

effectiveness of the Board as a whole and the contribution of each individual director. The NC 

is also responsible for deciding how the Board’s performance may be evaluated and proposes 

objective performance criteria for the Board’s approval and implementing corporate 

governance measures to achieve good stewardship of the Company. The Board is in the 

process of internalising the Code of Governance 2018, and the Board is of the view that 

implementing appropriate corporate governance practice will improve the effectiveness of the 

Board. 

5.2 

The NC adopts a formal system of evaluating the Board as a whole every year. A Board 

performance evaluation is carried out and the assessment parameters include evaluation of 

the Board’s composition, size and expertise, timeliness of Board information, guidance 

provided to Management, standard of conduct as well as Board accountability and quality of 

Board processes. Through a formal written Board performance evaluation, the Board has 

reached the conclusion on its performance for FY2018 that the Board has met its performance 

objectives.  

 

The annual evaluation exercise provides an opportunity to obtain constructive feedback from 

each director on whether the Board’s procedures and processes have allowed him/her to 

discharge his/her duties effectively and to propose changes which may be made to enhance 

the Board's effectiveness as a whole. The collated findings are reported and recommendations 

are made to the Board for consideration and for further improvements to help the Board to 

discharge its duties more effectively. 

 

The NC is of the view that the Board has met its performance objectives for FY2018.  No 

external facilitator was used in the evaluation process.  

5.3 

The NC conducts evaluation of the performance of individual directors annually and for re-

election or re-appointment of any director. The assessment of each director’s performance is 

undertaken by the NC Chairman. The criteria for assessment includes but is not limited to 

attendance record at meetings of the Board and board committees, commitment of time, 

intensity of participation at meetings, quality of discussions, knowledge and abilities, 

engagement with Management, maintenance of independence and any special contributions. 

For FY2018, the NC, in concurrence with the NC Chairman, is satisfied that each director is 

contributing to the overall effectiveness of the Board.

Access to Information 

 

Principle 6: In order to fulfil their responsibilities, directors should be provided with complete, adequate and 

timely information prior to board meetings and on an on-going basis so as to enable them to make informed 

decisions to discharge their duties and responsibilities. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

6.1 

The Board is informed of all material events and transactions as and when they occur. All 

analysts’ and media reports on the Group are forwarded to the directors on an on-going basis. 

 

The Board has separate, independent and unrestricted access to the senior management of 

the Group at all times. Requests for information from the Board are dealt with promptly by the 

senior management. 

6.2 

The Board is provided with complete, adequate and timely information prior to board meetings. 

The information provided includes board papers and related materials, background and 

explanatory information relating to matters to be brought before the Board. The Board receives 

monthly management financial statements, annual budgets and explanation on forecast 

variances to enable them to oversee the Group’s operational and financial performance. 

Directors are also informed of any significant developments or events relating to the Group. 

6.3 

The Board has separate and independent access to the Company Secretary at all times. The 

Company Secretary or his/her nominee attends all Board meetings and is responsible for 

ensuring that established procedures and all relevant statutes and regulations that are 

applicable to the Company are complied with. The Company Secretary assists the Chairman 

by preparing meeting agendas, attending Board and Board Committee meetings and 

preparing minutes of board proceedings. Under the direction of the Chairman, the Company 

Secretary, with the support of the management staff, ensures good information flows within 

the Board and the Board Committees and between senior management and non-executive 

directors, advising the Board on all governance matters, as well as facilitating orientation and 

assisting with professional development as required. 

6.4 

The appointment and the removal of the Company Secretary are subject to the Board’s 

approval. 

6.5 

The Board seeks independent professional advice as and when necessary to enable it to 

discharge its responsibilities effectively. The directors, whether as a Group or individually, may 

seek and obtain legal and other independent professional advice, at the Company’s expense, 

concerning any aspect of the Group’s operations or undertakings in order to fulfil their roles 

and responsibilities as directors.

REMUNERATION MATTERS 

 

Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies 

 

Principle 7: There should be a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive 

remuneration and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors. No director should be involved 

in deciding his own remuneration. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

7.1 

The RC, regulated by a set of written terms of reference, comprises three members, a majority 

of whom, including the Chairman, are independent non-executive directors. There is one 

executive director in the RC as the Board consists of four directors, out of which two are non-

executive. The Board is currently on the lookout for an additional non-executive director to join 

the RC. The members of the RC are as follows: 

1. 

Mr. Ong Kok Wah (Chairman, INED) 

2. 

Mr. Masahiko Yabuki (INED) 

3. 

Mr. Soennerstedt Carl Johan Pontus (ED) 

 

The principal function of the RC is to ensure that a formal and transparent procedure is in 

place for fixing the remuneration packages of directors and key management personnel of the 

Group. 

 

Mr. Soennerstedt Carl Johan Pontus will step down from the RC going forward. 

7.2 

Under its terms of reference, the RC is responsible for reviewing and recommending a 

remuneration framework for the Board and the Company’s key management personnel. The 

RC also reviews and recommends to the Board the specific remuneration packages for each 

director as well as the Company’s key management personnel. The aim is to build capable 

and 

committed 

management 

teams, 

through 

competitive 

compensation, 

focused 

management, and progressive policies which will attract, motivate and retain a pool of talented 

executives to meet the current and future growth of the Company. In discharging their duties, 

the members have access to advice from human resources department and external advisors 

as and when they deem necessary.  

 

To ensure that the remuneration package is competitive and sufficient to attract, retain and 

motivate the key management personnel, the RC also takes into consideration industry 

practices and norms in the compensation review. The RC as part of its review ensures that all 

aspects of remuneration, including and not limited to director’s fees, salaries, allowances, 

bonuses, options and benefits-in-kinds are covered for each director and key management 

personnel. 

7.3 

No independent consultant is engaged for advising on the remuneration of all directors. The 

RC will seek external expert advice should such a need arise. 

 

The Company did not engage any remuneration consultant in FY2018. 

7.4 

The RC reviews the service contracts of the Company’s executive directors and key 

executives. Services contracts for executive directors are for a fixed appointment period. 

There are no onerous compensation commitments on the part of the Company in the event of 

an early termination of the service of the executive directors and key executives.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

 

Level and Mix of Remuneration 

 

Principle 8: The level and structure of remuneration should be aligned with the long-term interest and risk 

policies of the company, and should be appropriate to attract, retain and motivate (a) the directors to provide 

good stewardship of the company, and (b) key management personnel to successfully manage the company. 

However, companies should avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

8.1 

The remuneration policy for executive directors is structured to link rewards to corporate and 

individual performance. 

 

Our executive directors’ remuneration consists of salary, bonuses and other benefits. A 

proportion of the remuneration for the executive directors is linked to performance in the form 

of performance bonus. Executive directors are paid incentives based on achievement of 

targeted performance of their respective business units set at the beginning of the financial 

year. In setting the targets, due regards are given to the financial and commercial health and 

business needs of the Group. Executive directors do not receive directors’ fees. 

 

The Group has also entered into letters of employment with all of the executive officers. Their 

compensation consists of salary, bonus and performance awards that are dependent on the 

performance of the Group. 

8.2 

The Company does not have any long-term incentive scheme or schemes involving the offer 

of shares or grant of options. In evaluating long-term incentives, the RC takes into 

consideration the costs and benefits of such schemes. 

8.3 

Non-executive directors (“NEDs”) are remunerated under a framework of fixed fees for serving 

on the Board and Board Committees. Fees for NEDs are subject to the approval of 

shareholders at the AGM. The remuneration of the NEDs is tailored such that the NEDs are 

not overly compensated to the extent that their independence may be compromised. 

 

In setting remuneration packages, the Company takes into consideration the remuneration 

and employment conditions within the same industry and in comparable companies, as well as 

the Group’s relative performance and the performance of the individuals. 

8.4 

The Company does not implement the use of contractual provisions as it is of the view that 

such provisions would not enhance the performance of its executive directors and key 

management personnel.  However, the letters of employment with all executive officers allow 

the Company the right to pursue appropriate action against executive officers and key 

management personnel for violation of company policies (including misconduct resulting in 

financial loss to the Company) and other fraudulent acts. 

 

Disclosure on Remuneration 

 

Principle 9: Every company should provide clear disclosure of its remuneration policies, level and mix of 

remuneration, and the procedure for setting remuneration, in the company's Annual Report. It should provide 

disclosure in relation to its remuneration policies to enable investors to understand the link between 

remuneration paid to directors and key management personnel, and performance. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

9.1 

Given the highly competitive environment it is operating in and the confidentiality attached to 

remuneration matters, the Company believes that fully disclosing the remuneration of each 

director and the CEO would be prejudicial to its business interests. The Company has 

instead disclosed the remuneration of each director and the CEO in bands of $200,000. The 

aggregate value of remuneration to directors has been disclosed on page 36 of this annual 

report. 

 

Similarly, the Company has disclosed the remuneration of each key management personnel 

(who are not directors or the CEO) in bands of $200,000. The aggregate value of 

remuneration to key management personnel (who are not directors or the CEO) has been 

disclosed on page 37 of this annual report. 

9.2 

Table 4 sets out the breakdown of the remuneration of each director and the CEO for 

FY2018. 

9.3 

Table 4A sets out the breakdown of the remuneration of the key management personnel 

(who are not directors or the CEO) for FY2018. 

9.4 

There is no immediate family member (defined in the Catalist Rules as the spouse, child, 

adopted child, step-child, brother, sister and parent) of a director or the CEO in the 

employment of the Company whose annual remuneration exceeded $50,000 during FY2018.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

9.5 

There is presently no share scheme or option scheme on unissued shares of the Company 

or its subsidiaries.  

9.6 

The Company is of the view that disclosing specific details on the performance conditions 

used to determine the directors’ remuneration would be unfavourable to its business 

interests. The RC is satisfied that all of the performance conditions used to determine the 

directors’ remuneration have been met.

Risk Management and Internal Controls 

 

Principle 11: The Board is responsible for the governance of risk. The Board should ensure that Management 

maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard shareholders' interests and 

the company's assets, and should determine the nature and extent of the significant risks which the Board is 

willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

11.1 

The Board is responsible for the overall internal control framework and is fully aware of the 

need to put in place a system of internal controls within the Group to safeguard shareholders’ 

interests and the Group’s assets, and to manage risks. The Board also acknowledges that no 

cost-effective internal control system will preclude all errors and irregularities. The system is 

designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, 

and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 

or loss. 

 

The Board is satisfied that the system of internal procedures, controls and reviews that the 

Group has in place provide reasonable assurance against material financial misstatements or 

loss, safeguarding of assets, the maintenance of proper accounting records, reliability of 

financial information, compliance with legislation, regulations and best practices and the 

identification and management of business risks. 

 

11.2 &amp; 11.3 

Based on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by 

the internal and external auditors, annual reviews of the adequacy and effectiveness of the 

company’s risk management and internal control systems performed by Management, the 

AC and the Board, save as disclosed on page 44 of this annual report. The Board with the 

concurrence of the AC is of the opinion that the Group’s system of internal controls, including 

financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, as well as risk 

management policies and systems, were adequate and effective as at 31 December 2018. 

 

The AC and the Board has received assurance from the CEO and Senior Finance Manager 

that the financial records of the Company have been properly maintained and the financial 

statements give a true and fair view of the Company’s operations and finances; and 

regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems. 

 

11.4 

The Company has not put in place a risk management committee. However, Management 

has in place a financial risk management policy and regularly reviews the Company’s 

business and operational activities to identify areas of significant business risks as well as 

appropriate measures to control and mitigate these risks. Management reviews all significant 

control policies and procedures and highlights all significant matters to the directors and AC. 

The AC provides independent oversight to the effectiveness of the risk management process. 

It is, and has been throughout the current and previous financial years, the Group’s policy 

that no derivatives shall be undertaken except for the use as hedging instruments where 

appropriate and cost-efficient. The Group and the Company do not apply hedge accounting. 

 

Details of the Group’s risk management policy are set out in Note 32 “Financial Risk 

Management” of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

12.5 

The AC meets with the internal auditor and the external auditor separately, at least once a 

year, without the presence of Management to review any matter that might be raised. 

 

In FY2018, the AC met with the External Auditors once in the absence of key management 

personnel. 

12.6 

The AC shall continue to monitor the scope and results of the external audit, its cost 

effectiveness, as well as the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and give its 

recommendations to the Board and the Company regarding the appointment, re-appointment 

or removal of the external auditors. 

 

Moore Stephens LLP, the Company’s external auditor, carried out, as part of their statutory 

audit, a review of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal accounting controls on an 

annual basis. Any material internal accounting control weaknesses noted in the course of the 

statutory audit were reported by the external auditors to the AC. 

 

The AC undertook the review of the independence and objectivity of the external auditor 

through discussions with the external auditor as well as confirmed that no non-audit services 

were provided. The aggregate amount of audit fees payable to the external auditor in FY2018 

was $94,500. There were no non-audit fees paid to the external auditor in FY2018. The AC is 

satisfied with their independence; hence has recommended the re-appointment of the external 

auditor at the forthcoming AGM of the Company. 

12.7 

The Company with the assistance of the AC has put in place a “whistle blowing” process and 

has formulated the guidelines for a Whistle-Blowing Policy for the Group. Such a policy serves 

to encourage and provide a channel for staff to report in good faith and without fear of 

reprisals, concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting or other matters to the 

Non-Executive Chairman. It has a well-defined process which ensures independent 

investigation of issues/concerns raised and appropriate follow up action to be taken. All 

reports will be promptly submitted to the AC which is responsible for investigating and 

coordinating corrective action. Details of the whistle-blowing policies and arrangements have 

been made available to all employees. 

12.8 

For FY2018, the AC met with and reviewed with the external auditors: 

a. 

the quarterly and full year financial statements of the Group and the Company, including 

announcements relating thereto to shareholders; 

 

b. 

the audit plan (including, among others, the nature and scope of the audit before the 

audit commenced and the risk management issues of the Group);

e.

changes of equity of the Company. 

 

The external auditors provide regular updates and briefings to the AC on changes or 

amendments to accounting standards to enable the members of the AC to keep abreast of 

such changes and its corresponding impact on the financial statements, if any. 

 

Please refer to page 50 for key audit matters reported by external auditors for FY2018. 

 

In appointing the audit firms for the Group, the AC and the Board are satisfied that the Group 

has complied with Rule 712 and Rule 715 of Catalist Rules. 

12.9 

There is no former partner or director of the Company’s existing auditing firm or auditing 

corporation that is acting as a member of the Company’s AC.  

 

Internal Audit 

 

Principle 13: The company should establish an effective internal audit function that is adequately resourced 

and independent of the activities it audits. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

13.1 

The Board recognises that it is responsible for maintaining a system of internal control to 

safeguard shareholders’ investments and the Group’s businesses and assets, while 

Management is responsible for establishing and implementing the internal control procedures 

in a timely and appropriate manner. The role of the internal auditor is to assist the AC in 

ensuring that the controls are effective and functioning as intended, to undertake 

investigations as directed by the AC and to conduct regular in-depth audits of high risk areas. 

 

The AC approves the hiring, removal, evaluation and compensation of the head of the internal 

audit function. The Internal Auditor has unfettered access to all the company’s documents, 

records, properties and personnel, including access to AC. 

13.2 

The Company has an in-house internal audit team that primarily reports to the Chairman of AC 

on a project by project basis. Internal Audit serves as a check and balance function on the 

Company's operation processes, procedures and new projects, especially in relation to newly 

established functions and projects within the Company. The in-house team comprises 

personnel of the Company’s HR &amp; Admin team. The AC is of the view that such arrangement 

would ensure that the internal audit function would have appropriate standing within the 

Company. 

 

The AC ensures that the internal audit function as discharged by the in-house team is 

adequately resourced. 

13.3 

The AC ensures that the internal audit function as discharged by the in-house team is staffed 

with personnel with the relevant qualifications and experience to perform its function whilst still 

maintaining objective views. 

13.4 

The internal audit function as discharged by the in-house team is according to the standards 

set by nationally or internationally recognised professional bodies.  

13.5 

On an annual basis, the AC continues to review specific audit risk areas and ensures that the 

internal audit function is adequate and effective.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

 

Shareholder Rights 

 

Principle 14: Companies should treat all shareholders fairly and equitably, and should recognise, protect and 

facilitate the exercise of shareholders' rights, and continually review and update such governance 

arrangements. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

14.1 

The Company is committed to regular and timely communication with shareholders as part of 

the organisation's development to build systems and procedures that will enable the Group to 

compete internationally. The Company places great emphasis on investor relations and strives 

to maintain a high standard of transparency and to promote better investor communications. It 

aims to provide investors with clear, balanced and useful information, on a timely basis, about 

the Group’s performance, financial position and prospects. 

14.2 

Management supports the Code’s principle to encourage shareholder participation. 

Shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM to ensure a high level of accountability and 

to stay informed of the Company’s strategy and goals. Notice of the AGM is despatched to 

shareholders, together with explanatory notes or a circular on items of special business (if 

necessary), at least 14 days or 21 days, as the case may be, before the meeting. The Board 

welcomes questions from shareholders who have an opportunity to raise issues either 

informally or formally before or at the AGM. Shareholders are informed of the rules, including 

voting procedures, that govern general meetings of shareholders. 

14.3 

A shareholder who is unable to attend the general meetings is entitled to appoint up to two 

proxies, unless the shareholder is a relevant intermediary as defined in Section 181 of the 

Companies Act (Chapter 50) of Singapore (the “Companies Act”). A relevant intermediary is 

entitled to appoint more than two proxies, but each proxy must be appointed to exercise the 

rights attached to a different share or shares held by such shareholder. 

 

 

COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS 

 

Principle 15: Companies should actively engage their shareholders and put in place an investor relations 

policy to promote regular, effective and fair communication with shareholders. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

15.1 

All materials on the full year financial results are available on the Company’s website – 

www.wearepolaris.com. The website also contains various other investor-related information 

on the Company and an investor relations page which serves as an important resource for 

investors. Quarterly and full-year financial statements containing a summary of the financial 

information and affairs of the Group for the period are also released via SGXNet. 

15.2 

The Company does not practice selective disclosure. In line with continuous obligations of the 

Company pursuant to Catalist Rules and the Companies Act of Singapore, the Board’s policy 

is that all shareholders should be equally and timely informed of all major developments that 

will impact the Company or the Group. Information is communicated to shareholders on a 

timely basis through the Singapore Exchange Network (the “SGXNet”) and/or the press. 

Additionally, annual reports are prepared and issued to all shareholders within the mandatory 

period. Notices of shareholders’ meetings are advertised in a newspaper in Singapore. 

15.3 

The Board welcomes the views of shareholders on matters affecting the Company, whether at 

shareholders’ meetings or on an ad hoc basis. At AGMs, shareholders are given the 

opportunity to air their views and to ask the directors and Management questions regarding 

the Group. 

15.4 

The Company conducts briefings occasionally for analysts, brokers and fund managers. 

Briefings for investors are held in conjunction with the release of the Company’s quarterly and 

full year financial results, with the presence of the executive officers and the key management 

personnel to answer the relevant questions which the investors may have. 

15.5 

As the Company has registered accumulated losses as at 31 December 2018 and its current 

priority is to achieve long-term capital growth for the benefit of shareholders, its profits shall 

therefore be retained for investment into the future. The Board continues to monitor the 

financial position of the Company and will propose dividends at the appropriate time to the 

best interest of the shareholders.

CONDUCT OF SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS 

 

Principle 16: Companies should encourage greater shareholder participation at general meetings of 

shareholders, and allow shareholders the opportunity to communicate their views on various matters affecting 

the company. 

 

Guidelines 

of the Code 

The Company’s Corporate Governance Practice 

16.1 

Shareholders have the opportunity to participate effectively and to vote in the AGM either in 

person or in absentia by proxy. The Company’s Constitution allows a shareholder to appoint 

up to two proxies to attend and vote in his or her place at general meetings. A shareholder 

who is a relevant intermediary (as defined in the Companies Act) may appoint more than two 

proxies, but each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share 

or shares held by such shareholder. 

 

The Company is not implementing absentia voting methods such as voting via mail, e-mail or 

fax until security, integrity and other pertinent issues are satisfactorily resolved. 

16.2 

Resolutions to be passed at general meetings are always separate and distinct in terms of 

issues and are consistent with the Code’s guideline that companies should avoid ‘bundling’ 

resolutions unless the resolutions are interdependent and linked so as to form one significant 

proposal. 

16.3 

All directors attend general meetings of shareholders. The Chairman of the AC, RC and NC 

will be available at the AGM to respond to those questions relating to the scope of these Board 

Committees. The external auditors are also present to address shareholders’ queries on the 

conduct of audit and the preparation and content of the Independent Auditors’ report. 

 

The Board views the AGM as the principal forum for dialogue with shareholders, being an 

opportunity for shareholders to raise issues pertaining to the proposed resolutions and/or ask 

the directors or Management questions regarding the Company and its operations. 

16.4 

In general meetings, shareholders are given the opportunity to communicate their views and 

direct questions to directors and Management regarding the Company. The Chairpersons of 

Board Committees are present at the AGM and other general meetings of shareholders, to 

assist the Board in addressing shareholders’ questions. While the Company does not avail the 

minutes of general meetings on its corporate website, the Company will provide digital copies 

of the minutes to shareholders upon request. The Company believes that with the 

aforementioned arrangement in place, Shareholders will have easy access to minutes of 

general meetings while enabling the Company to maintain confidentiality of the contents of the 

minutes in the interest of the Company. 

16.5 

To have greater transparency and fairness in the voting process, the Company conducts the 

voting of all its resolutions by poll at all its AGM and EGM. The detailed voting results of each 

of the resolutions tabled are announced on the same day after the meetings. The total 

numbers of votes cast for and against the resolutions are also announced after the meetings 

via SGXNet.

Confirmation of 

adequacy of internal 

controls 

Save as disclosed in our respone in respect of Rule 1204(10C), the 

Board and the AC are of the opinion that the internal controls are 

adequate to address the financial, operational and compliance and 

information technology control and risk management systems which 

the Group considers relevant and material to its current business 

scope and environment for FY2018 based on the following: 

• 

internal controls and the risk management system established 

by the Company; 

• 

work performed by the Internal Auditors and External Auditors; 

• 

assurances from the CEO (or equivalent) and CFO (or 

equivalent); 

and 

• 

reviews done by the various Board Committees and key 

management personnel. 

1204(10C) 

AC’s comment on the 

independence, 

effectiveness and 

adequacy of the 

internal audit function 

The Board and AC are of the opinion that the internal audit function 

is not independent, effective and adequately resourced as the in-

house internal audit work was performed by the director of a 

subsidiary of the Company whose personnel is not independent of 

the activities he audits. The Board and the AC intend to outsource 

the internal audit function to a third party professional firm in 2019. 

1204(17) 

Interested Persons 

Transaction (“IPT”) 

The Company has established procedures to ensure that all 

transactions with interested persons are reported on in a timely 

manner to the AC and that the transactions are carried out on 

normal commercial terms and will not be prejudicial to the interests 

of the Company and its minority shareholders. 

 

During the year under review, there were no material interested 

person transactions requiring disclosure pursuant to the Catalist 

Rules. 

1204(19) 

Dealing in Securities 

The Company has adopted internal practices in relation to dealings 

in the Company’s securities pursuant to the Catalist Rules that are 

applicable to all its officers. The Company and its officers are not 

allowed to deal in the Company’s securities on short term 

considerations; and during the period commencing two weeks 

before the announcement of the Company's financial statements for 

each of the first three quarters of its financial year and one month 

before the announcement of the Company's full year financial 

statements. 

 

Directors and officers are required to observe insider trading 

provisions under the Securities and Futures Act Cap. 289 at all 

times even when dealing in the Company's securities within the 

permitted trading periods.  

 

Directors of the Company are required to report all dealings to the 

Company Secretary. 

1204(21) 

Non-sponsor fees 

The Company’s sponsor, Stamford Corporate Services Pte. Ltd., 

has not rendered any non-sponsorship services to the Company for 

FY2018.  

1204(22) 

Use of Proceeds

DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements 

 

Opinion 

 

We have audited the financial statements of Polaris Ltd. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”), 

which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and the statement of financial position of 

the Company as at 31 December 2018, and the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, 

consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the year then 

ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.  

 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company 

are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the Act) and Singapore 

Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)s) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 

position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2018 and of the consolidated 

financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group for the year ended on 

that date. 

 

 

Basis for Opinion 

 

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs). Our responsibilities under those 

standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our 

report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) 

Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the 

ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our 

other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit 

evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

 

 

Key Audit Matters 

 

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 

financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 

statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matters (cont’d) 

 

Key Audit Matter 

How our audit addressed the key audit matter 

 

 

Impairment of trade receivables  

 

As at 31 December 2018, the carrying amount of the 

Group’s trade receivables amounted to S$2,001,000 

(Note 20), which represented approximately 14% of its 

current assets. 

 

The collectability of trade receivables is a key element of 

the Group’s working capital management, and is 

managed on an ongoing basis by management. The 

Group determines the expected credit loss (“ECL”) of 

trade receivables by making debtor-specific assessment 

of 

expected 

impairment 

loss 

for 

overdue 

trade 

receivables and using a provision matrix for remaining 

trade receivables that is based on the Group’s historical 

observed default rates, customers’ ability to pay and 

adjusted 

with 

forward-looking 

information. 

The 

assessment of correlation between historical observed 

default rates, forecast economic conditions and expected 

credit losses require the management to exercise 

significant judgement. Accordingly, we determined this as 

a key audit matter. 

 

The Group’s accounting policies on allowance for 

impairment and the critical accounting estimates and 

judgements thereon are disclosed in Note 3(i) and Note 

4(ii) to the financial statements, respectively. 

 

 

Our audit procedures included, amongst others, obtaining 

an understanding of the Group’s processes and key 

controls relating to the monitoring of trade receivables 

and considering their aging to identify collection risks. We 

performed audit procedures including, amongst others, 

reviewing the reasonableness of significant judgement 

used by the management in assessing the recoverability 

of trade receivables and reviewing management’s 

assessment of the recoverability of overdue trade 

receivables. 

We 

tested 

the 

reasonableness 

of 

management’s assumptions and inputs used to develop 

the provision matrix, through analyses of ageing of trade 

receivables and historical credit loss experience, and 

reviewed data and information that management has 

used, 

including 

consideration 

of 

forward-looking 

information based on specific economic data. We 

checked the arithmetic accuracy of management’s 

computation of the ECL. We checked to subsequent 

receipts from major debtors after the year end. We 

obtained documentary evidence, representation and 

explanations 

from 

management 

to 

assess 

the 

recoverability of overdue outstanding debts, where 

applicable. 

 

In addition, we reviewed the adequacy of the disclosures 

relating to allowance for impairment loss on trade 

receivables and credit risk in Note 20 and Note 32(a) to 

the financial statements, respectively.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 

assurance conclusion thereon.  

 

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 

so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 

obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we 

conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 

nothing to report in this regard.  

 

 

Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements 

 

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 

the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls 

sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or 

disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation 

of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets. 

 

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a 

going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 

accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic 

alternative but to do so.  

 

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements 

 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 

SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 

considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 

decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  

 

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 

throughout the audit. We also:  

 

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 

design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 

appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 

fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 

misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  

 

• 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 

appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 

Group’s internal control.  

 

• 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 

related disclosures made by management. 

 

• 

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 

on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 

cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 

uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 

financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 

on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 

cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. 

 

• 

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, 

and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 

achieves fair presentation.  

 

• 

Obtain sufficient appropriate evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities 

within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the 

direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

to the Members of Polaris Ltd. (Incorporated in Singapore)

(cont’d) 

 

Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont’d) 

 

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 

significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.  

 

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 

independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 

bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 

 

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 

audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 

in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 

circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 

consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 

communication.  

 

 

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements  

 

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary 

corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the 

provisions of the Act. 

 

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Mr Ng Chiou Gee Willy.

Application of Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) (cont’d) 

 

Optional exemptions applied on adoption of SFRS(I) 

 

For first-time adopters, SFRS(I) 1 allows the exemptions from the retrospective application of certain 

requirements under SFRS(I). The Group has applied the following exemptions: 

 

a) 

SFRS(I) 3 Business Combinations has not been applied to business combinations that occurred before 

the date of transition on 1 January 2017. The same classification as in its previous FRS financial 

statements has been adopted. 

 

b) 

SFRS(I) 1-21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates has not been applied retrospectively to 

fair value adjustments and goodwill from business combinations that occurred before the date of transition 

to SFRS(I) on 1 January 2017. Such fair value adjustments and goodwill continue to be accounted for 

using the same basis as under FRS 21. 

 

c) 

Cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations are reset to zero as at the date of transition to 

SFRS(I) on 1 January 2017. 

 

d) 

The Group has elected to apply the requirements in the SFRS(I) 1-23 Borrowing Costs from the date of 

transition to SFRS(I) on 1 January 2017. Borrowing costs that were accounted for previously under FRS 

prior to date of transition are not restated.

Notes to the reconciliation of the Group’s equity 

 

A. 

SFRS(I) 1 

 

In adopting SFRS(I) in 2018, the Group has applied the transition requirements in SFRS(I) 1 with 1 January 

2017 as the date of transition. SFRS(I) 1 generally requires that the Group applies SFRS(I) that are effective as 

at 31 December 2018 on a retrospective basis, as if such accounting policy had always been applied, subject to 

the mandatory exceptions and optional exemptions in SFRS(I) 1. Except as described below, the application of 

the mandatory exceptions and the optional exemptions in SFRS(I) 1 did not have any significant impact on the 

financial statements. 

 

Foreign currency translation reserve 

 

The Group elected the optional exemption in SFRS(I) 1 to reset its cumulative translation difference for all 

foreign operations to nil at the date of transition, and reclassified the cumulative translation difference of 

S$940,000 as at 1 January 2017 determined in accordance with SFRS to accumulated losses. After the date of 

transition, any gain or loss on disposal of any foreign operations will exclude translation differences that arose 

before the date of transition. By electing this optional exemption, the cumulative translation difference 

decreased by S$940,000 and accumulated losses increased by the same amount as at 1 January 2017. 

 

B. 

SFRS(I) 15 

 

SFRS(I) 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers, and 

introduces new contract cost guidance. Under SFRS(I) 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the 

consideration which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a 

customer. 

 

The Group adopted SFRS(I) 15 in its financial statements using the retrospective approach. All requirements of 

SFRS(I) 15 have been applied retrospectively. There is no impact on the Group’s financial statements on the 

adoption of SFRS(I) 15, and no comparative information was restated.

C. 

SFRS(I) 9 

 

SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial 

liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. It also introduces a new “expected credit loss” 

(ECL) model and a new general hedge accounting model. The Group adopted SFRS(I) 9 from 1 January 2018. 

 

The Group has elected to apply the short-term exemption to adopt SFRS(I) 9 on 1 January 2018. Accordingly, 

requirements of FRS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement will continue to apply to financial 

instruments up to the financial year ended 31 December 2017 (Accounting policies Note 3(i)). Additionally, the 

Group is exempted from complying with SFRS(I) 7 for the comparative period to the extent that the disclosures 

required by the SFRS(I) 7 relate to the items within scope of SFRS(I) 9. As a result, the requirements under 

FRS are applied in place of the requirements under SFRS(I) 7 and SFRS(I) 9 to comparative information about 

items within the scope of the SFRS(I) 9. 

 

Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of SFRS(I) 9 have been generally applied by the 

Group retrospectively, except as described below: 

 

• 

The following assessments were made on the basis of facts and circumstances that existed at 1 January 

2018. 

 

- 

The determination of the business model within which a financial asset is held; 

- 

The determination of whether the contractual terms of a financial asset give rise to cash flows that are 

solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding; 

- 

The designation of an equity investment that is not held-for-trading as at FVOCI; and 

- 

The designation and revocation of previous designations of certain financial assets and financial 

liabilities measured at FVPL. 

 

• 

If a debt investment has low credit risk at 1 January 2018, the Group had assumed that the credit risk on 

the asset has not increased significantly since its initial recognition. 

 

The adoption of SFRS(I) 9 has not had a significant effect on the Group’s accounting policies for financial 

liabilities.

The impact upon the adoption of SFRS(I) 9 as well as the new requirements are described below. 

 

(i) 

Classification of financial assets and financial liabilities 

 

The following are the qualitative information regarding the reclassification between categories of financial 

instruments at the date of initial application of SFRS(I) 9. 

 

Under SFRS(I) 9, financial assets are classified in the following categories: measured at amortised cost, FVOCI 

(debt instrument), FVOCI (equity instrument); or FVPL. The classification of financial assets under SFRS(I) 9 is 

generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow 

characteristics. SFRS(I) 9 eliminates the previous FRS 39 categories of held-to-maturity, loans and receivables 

and available-for-sale. Under SFRS(I) 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset 

in the scope of the standard are never separated. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument as a whole is 

assessed for classification.  

 

On the date of initial application of SFRS(I) 9 on 1 January 2018, the following table and the accompanying 

notes below explain the original measurement categories under FRS 39 and the new measurement categories 

under SFRS(I) 9 for each class of the Group’s financial assets as at 1 January 2018:

(a) 

Available-for-sale equity investment 

 

For quoted equity investment, the Group has elected to present fair value changes on this equity investment in 

other comprehensive income under SFRS(I) 9, because this instrument is not held for trading. Accordingly, this 

asset is categorised as “Equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income”. Unlike FRS 39, 

the accumulated fair value adjustment reserve related to this investment will never be reclassified to profit or 

loss. 

 

(b) 

Trade and other receivables 

 

Trade and other receivables that were classified as loans and receivables under FRS 39 are now classified at 

amortised cost.

SFRS(I) 9 (cont’d) 

 

(ii) 

Impairment of financial assets 

 

SFRS(I) 9 replaces the “incurred loss” model in FRS 39 with an “expected credit loss” (ECL) model. The new 

impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost, but not to equity investment. 

 

The Group has applied the simplified impairment approach to recognise only lifetime ECL impairment charges 

on all trade receivables and that arise from SFRS(I) 15. Based on the assessment made, there is no allowance 

for impairment recognised in opening accumulated losses of the Group at 1 January 2018 on transition to 

SFRS(I) 9 as the ECL is insignificant. For other receivables, the Group has assessed the latest performance 

and financial position of the counterparties, adjusted for the future outlook of the industry in which the 

counterparties operate in, and concluded that there has been no significant increase in the credit risk since the 

initial recognition of the financial assets. Accordingly, the Group measured the allowance for impairment using 

12-month ECL and determined that the ECL is insignificant. 

 

The application of SFRS(I) 9 impairment requirements at 1 January 2018 did not have significant effect on the 

Group and the Company. Additional information about how the Group and the Company measure the 

allowance for impairment is described in Note 32(a). 

 

(iii) 

Transition impact on the Group’s equity 

 

There is no impact to the Group’s reserves and accumulated losses at 1 January 2018 on the initial application 

of SFRS(I) 9. 

 

D. 

Impact on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 

 

There were no material adjustments to the Group’s consolidated statement of cash flows arising from the 

transition from FRS to SFRS(I) and the initial application of SFRS(I) 9 and SFRS(I) 15.

Except for SFRS(I) 16, the Group expects that the adoption of the other standards above will have no material 

impact on the financial statements in the period of initial application. 

 

SFRS(I) 16 

 

Leases 

 

SFRS(I) 16 sets out a revised framework for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of 

leases, and replaces SFRS(I) 1-17 Leases, SFRS(I) INT 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a 

Lease, SFRS(I) INT 1-15 Operating Leases – Incentives; and SFRS(I) INT 1-27 Evaluating the Substance of 

Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. SFRS(I) 16 requires lessees to recognise right-of-use assets 

and lease liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, except where the underlying asset is of 

low value. The right-of-use asset is depreciated and interest expense is recognised on the lease liability. The 

accounting requirements for lessors have not been changed substantially, and continue to be based on 

classification as operating and finance leases. Disclosure requirements have been enhanced for both lessors 

and lessees.

SFRS(I) 16 

 

Leases (cont’d) 

 

The Group plans to adopt SFRS(I) 16 on 1 January 2019 based on a permitted transition approach that does 

not restate comparative information, but recognises the cumulative effect of initially applying SFRS(I) 16 as an 

adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on 1 January 2019. The Group will elect the transition 

option to record, in respect of leases previously classified as operating leases, the right-of-use asset on 1 

January 2019 at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease 

payments as at 31 December 2018. The Group also plans to adopt an expedient offered by SFRS(I) 16, 

exempting the Group from having to reassess whether pre-existing contracts contain a lease. 

 

As disclosed in Note 31, the Group has entered into operating leases for its retail outlets as lessee. The Group 

does not expect any significant impact on the financial statements based on the existing operating leases, when 

the standard is applied as of 1 January 2019. However, the nature of expenses related to those leases will 

change as SFRS(I) 16 replaces the straight-line operating lease expense with depreciation charge for ROU 

assets and interest expense on lease liabilities. 

 

The Group’s activities as a lessor are not material and the Group does not expect any significant impact on the 

financial statements. However, some additional disclosures will be required.

Significant Accounting Policies 

 

(a) 

Basis of Preparation 

 

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards 

(International) (“SFRS(I)s”) as issued by Accounting Standards Council. These are the Group’s first financial 

statements prepared in accordance with SFRS(I) and SFRS(I) 1 First-time adoption of Singapore Financial 

Reporting Standards (International) has been applied. In the previous financial years, the financial statements 

were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore (“FRS”). An explanation of how 

the transition to SFRS(I) and application of SFRS(I) 9 and SFRS(I) 15 have affected the reported financial 

position, financial performance and cash flows is provided in Note 2(a). These financial statements have been 

prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below. 

 

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial 

statements and in preparing the opening SFRS(I) statements of financial position at 1 January 2017 for the 

purposes of the transition to SFRS(I), unless otherwise indicated. The accounting policies have been applied 

consistently by Group entities.

Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d) 

 

(b) 

Group Accounting 

 

Subsidiaries 

 

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls 

an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 

and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 

from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control 

ceases. 

 

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there 

are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. When the Company has less than a 

majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient 

to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally.  

 

Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses, represents the excess of the sum of the consideration 

transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any 

previous held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the investee’s identifiable net assets acquired. 

Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is 

measured at cost less any accumulated impairment loss. Gains and losses on the disposal of subsidiaries, 

include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 

 

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred 

for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former 

owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the 

fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets 

acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at 

their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an 

acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the 

recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 

 

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 

 

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s 

previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or 

losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Group Accounting (cont’d) 

 

Subsidiaries (cont’d) 

 

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 

Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is 

recognised in accordance with SFRS(I) 9 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. 

Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is 

accounted for within equity. 

 

If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest 

measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain 

purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. 

 

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are 

eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have 

been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies. 

 

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity 

transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair 

value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the 

subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in 

equity. 

 

When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it: 

 

• 

derecognises the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts 

at the date when control is lost; 

• 

derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest (including any components of other 

comprehensive income attributable to them); 

• 

recognises the fair value of the consideration received; 

• 

recognises the fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value; 

• 

re-classifies the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to 

profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate; and 

• 

recognises any resulting difference as a gain or loss in profit or loss.

Group Accounting (cont’d) 

 

Associates 

 

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally 

accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.  

 

Goodwill on acquisition of associates represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s 

share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill on associates is included in the carrying 

amount of the investments. Gains and losses on the disposal of associates include the carrying amounts of 

goodwill relating to the entity sold. 

 

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting less impairment losses, if 

any. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is 

increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of 

acquisition. 

 

When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate, but the Group continues to apply the equity 

method, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been 

recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction in ownership if that gain or loss would be 

required to be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities. 

 

The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of post-

acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a 

corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an 

associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further 

losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. 

 

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the 

associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference 

between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in profit or 

loss. 

 

Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its associate 

are recognised in the Group’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s interests in the 

associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the 

asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure 

consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates 

 

Investments in subsidiaries and associates are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses in the 

statement of financial position of the Company. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries and associates, the 

difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the investments are recognised in 

profit or loss. 

 

(d) 

Foreign Currencies 

 

Functional and presentation currency 

 

The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are presented in the currency of the primary 

economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency).  

 

For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity in the 

Group are expressed in Singapore Dollar (“S$”), which is the functional currency of the Company and the 

presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand 

(S$’000) except when otherwise indicated. 

 

Transactions and balances 

 

In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 

functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the 

transactions.  

 

At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 

rates prevailing at that date. 

 

Currency translation differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of 

monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the closing rates at the reporting date are 

recognised in profit or loss, unless they arise from borrowings in foreign currencies and other currency 

instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges and net investment in foreign operations.  

 

Those currency translation differences are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in the 

consolidated financial statements and transferred to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal of the 

foreign operation. 

 

Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 

prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 

historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Foreign Currencies (cont’d) 

 

Translation of Group entities’ financial statements 

 

The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the 

presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: 

 

• 

assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates at the reporting date; 

• 

income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless the average is not a reasonable 

approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transactions dates, in which the case 

income and expenses are translating using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions); and 

• 

all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and 

accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. 

 

On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a 

disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an 

interest in a joint arrangement or an associate that includes a foreign operation of which the retained interest 

becomes a financial asset), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation 

attributable to the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.  

 

In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that does not result 

in the Group losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences 

are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial 

disposals (i.e. partial disposals of associates or joint arrangements that do not result in the Group losing 

significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is 

reclassified to profit or loss.  

 

Goodwill and fair value adjustments to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed through acquisition 

of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the rate of 

exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other

(e) 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

 

All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 

impairment losses. 

 

Subsequent expenditure related to property, plant and equipment that has already been recognised is added to 

the carrying amount of the asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item 

will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance 

expenses are recognised in profit or loss when incurred. 

 

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives, 

using the straight-line method: 

 

Commercial properties 

 

- 

30 years 

Furniture, fixtures and renovation 

- 

3 to 5 years 

Office equipment and computers 

- 

3 to 5 years 

 

Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned 

assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant leases. 

 

The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 

 

The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any 

changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. The effect of any revision are recognised in profit or 

loss when the changes arise. 

 

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 

are expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from disposal or retirement of an asset is 

determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is 

recognised in profit or loss.

Investment Properties 

 

Investment properties, which are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation, are measured 

initially at cost and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 

losses. Depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method to allocate the depreciable amount over the 

estimated useful life of 30 years. The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each 

year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. The effect of any 

revision are recognised in profit or loss when the changes arise. 

 

Investment properties are subject to renovations or improvements at regular intervals. The cost of major 

renovations and improvements is capitalised and the carrying amounts of the replaced components are 

recognised in profit or loss. All other costs of maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are recognised in 

profit or loss when incurred. 

 

Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the asset is 

permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gain or loss 

on the retirement or disposal of an investment property, calculated as the difference between the net disposal 

proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the year of retirement or 

disposal. 

 

(g) 

Intangible Assets 

 

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost or acquired in a business combination are 

identified and recognised separately from goodwill at their fair value at the acquisition date. Intangible assets 

are subsequently stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 

 

The carrying amounts of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 

 

The useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in 

estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. The effect of any revision are recognised in profit or loss when 

the changes arise. 

 

Intangible assets are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its 

use or disposal. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the 

difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is included in profit or loss in 

the period in which the asset is derecognised. 

 

The Group’s finite intangible assets comprise Customer Relationship and Lease Agreement.

(h) 

Impairment of Non-Financial Assets  

 

Non-financial assets (including finite intangible assets) are tested for impairment whenever there is any 

indication that these assets may be impaired. 

 

At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to 

determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such 

indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 

impairment loss (if any), on an individual asset. 

 

Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the 

recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent 

basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or 

otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and 

consistent allocation basis can be identified. 

 

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in 

use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 

reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 

estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 

 

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, 

the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.  

 

The difference between the carrying amount and recoverable amount is recognised as an impairment loss in 

profit or loss.  

 

An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised 

impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. 

 

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is 

increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not 

exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the 

asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in 

profit or loss.

i. 

Classification and measurement 

 

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: 

 

• 

those to be measured subsequently at fair value either through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or 

through profit or loss (FVPL), and 

• 

those to be measured at amortised cost 

 

The classification depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the 

contractual terms of the cash flows. The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business 

model for managing those assets changes. 

 

Initial Recognition 

 

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset 

not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction 

costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss. 

 

Trade receivables are measured at the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in 

exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amount collected on behalf of 

third party, if the trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component at initial recognition. 

 

Subsequent Measurement 

 

(a) 

Debt instruments 

 

Debt instruments mainly comprise of cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables. Subsequent 

measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset and the 

cash flow characteristics of the asset using the measurement as below:

Subsequent Measurement (cont’d) 

 

(a) 

Debt instruments (cont’d) 

 

Amortised cost 

 

Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments 

of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt instrument that is 

subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss 

when the asset is derecognised or impaired. For debt instrument that is measured at amortised cost that are not 

part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment 

losses are deducted from the gross carrying amount of these assets and are presented as separate line item in 

the statement of profit or loss. 

 

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and is included in the 

"other income" line item. 

 

(b) 

Equity instruments 

 

The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. On initial recognition of an equity 

instrument that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair 

value of equity investments in other comprehensive income and there is no subsequent reclassification of fair 

value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Designation at FVOCI is 

not permitted if the equity investment is held for trading or if it is contingent consideration recognised by an 

acquirer in a business combination. 

 

Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Group’s 

right to receive payments is established. Dividends are included in the ‘other income’ line item in profit or loss. 

 

Changes in fair value of equity instruments at FVOCI are recognised in other comprehensive income. The 

cumulative gain or loss will not be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the equity investments, instead, 

they will be transferred to retained earnings.

Impairment 

 

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with financial assets 

measured at amortised costs. 

 

Loss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases: 

 

• 

12-month ECLs – represents the ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 

months after the reporting date (or for a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 

months); or 

• 

Lifetime ECLs – represents the ECLs that will result from all possible default events over the expected life 

of a financial instrument or contract asset. 

 

The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. 

 

Simplified approach - Trade receivables 

 

The Group applies the simplified approach to provide ECLs for all trade receivables as permitted by SFRS(I) 9. 

The simplified approach requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the 

receivables. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based 

on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general 

economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the 

reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate. 

 

General approach - Other financial instruments 

 

The Group applies the general approach to provide for ECLs on other financial instruments which requires the 

loss allowance to be measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs at initial recognition.

Impairment (cont’d) 

 

General approach - Other financial instruments (cont’d) 

 

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased 

significantly since initial recognition. When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss 

allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. In assessing whether the credit risk of a financial 

asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers 

reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes 

both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including the Group’s historical 

experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. Forward-looking 

information considered includes the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s debtors operate, 

obtained from economic expert reports, financial analysts, governmental bodies, and other similar 

organisations, as well as consideration of various external sources of actual and forecast economic information 

that relate to the Group’s core operations. 

 

If credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial 

instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, 

loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs. 

 

The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management 

purposes as historical experience indicates that a financial asset to be in default when: 

 

• 

the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to 

actions such as realising security (if any is held); or 

• 

the financial asset is more than one year past due. 

 

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the 

Group is exposed to credit risk.

Impairment (cont’d) 

 

Credit-impaired financial assets 

 

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated 

future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether 

financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit-impaired. 

 

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the observable data about the following events: 

 

- 

significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; 

- 

a breach of contract such as a default or past due event; 

- 

the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s financial 

difficulty, having granted to the borrower or a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not other consider; 

- 

it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or 

- 

the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. 

 

Measurement of ECLs 

 

ECLs are probability-weighted estimates of credit losses. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all 

cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and 

the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the 

financial asset. 

 

Write-off policy 

 

The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe 

financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the counterparty has been placed 

under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to 

enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where 

appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.

iii. 

Recognition and derecognition 

 

Financial assets are recognised when, and only when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of 

the instruments. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date 

on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. 

 

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset 

expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the 

asset to another party. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 

ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset 

and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and 

rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and 

also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. 

 

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset's carrying 

amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On 

derecognition of an investment in equity instrument, the difference between the carrying amount and sales 

proceed is recognised in profit or loss if there was no election made to recognises fair value changes in other 

comprehensive income. If the Group has elected on initial recognition to measure the equity instrument at 

FVOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the fair value adjustment reserve is not 

reclassified to profit or loss, but is transferred to retained earnings.

Classification 

 

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: loans and receivables and available-for-

sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management 

determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. 

 

i. 

Loans and receivables 

 

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that 

are not quoted in an active market. They are presented as current assets, except for those expected 

to be realised later than twelve months after the reporting period which are presented as non-current 

assets. Loans and receivables are presented as “trade and other receivables” and “cash and bank 

balances” on the statement of financial position.

Classification (cont’d) 

 

ii. 

Financial assets, available-for-sale  

 

Financial assets, available-for-sale are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or 

not classified in any of the other categories. They are presented as non-current assets unless the 

investment matures or management intends to dispose of the assets within twelve months after the 

reporting period. 

 

Recognition and derecognition 

 

Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date – the date on which the 

Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. 

 

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial 

asset has expired, or has been transferred and transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 

of the financial asset to another entity. 

 

If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to 

control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability 

for amounts it may have to pay. 

 

If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the 

Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the 

proceeds received. 

 

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of 

consideration received is recognised in profit or loss. Any amount previously recognised in other 

comprehensive income relating to that asset is transferred to profit or loss. 

 

Initial and subsequent measurements 

 

Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Loans and receivables are 

subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Financial assets, available-for-sale 

are subsequently carried at fair value. 

 

Interest and dividend income on financial assets, available-for-sale are recognised separately in income.

Initial and subsequent measurements (cont’d) 

 

Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt investments are recognised in 

other comprehensive income with the exception of impairment losses, interest calculated using the effective 

interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Changes 

in fair values of available-for-sale equity securities (i.e. non-monetary items) are recognised in other 

comprehensive income and accumulated in the fair value reserve, together with the related currency translation 

differences, with the exception of impairment losses. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other 

comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the 

financial asset is derecognised. 

 

For financial assets, available-for-sale that do not have a quoted market price in an active market, and/or 

whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost less impairment losses subsequent to initial 

recognition. 

 

Impairment 

 

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a 

group of financial assets is impaired and recognises an allowance for impairment when such evidence exists. 

 

i. 

Loans and receivables 

 

Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy, and 

default or significant delay in payments are objective evidence that these financial assets are 

impaired. 

 

The carrying amount of these assets is reduced through the use of an impairment allowance account 

which is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of estimated 

future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. When the asset becomes 

uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 

previously written off are recognised against the same line item in profit or loss. 

 

The allowance for impairment loss account is reduced through profit or loss in a subsequent period 

when the amount of impairment loss decreases and the related decrease can be objectively 

measured. The carrying amount of the asset previously impaired is increased to the extent that the 

new carrying amount does not exceed the amortised cost had no impairment been recognised in prior 

periods.

Impairment (cont’d) 

 

ii. 

Financial assets, available-for-sale  

 

In addition to the objective evidence of impairment described above, a significant or prolonged decline 

in the fair value of an equity security below its cost is considered as an indicator that an available-for-

sale equity investment is impaired. 

 

If any evidence of impairment exists, the cumulative loss that was previously recognised in other 

comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss. The cumulative loss is measured as the 

difference between the acquisition cost (net of any principal repayments and amortisation) and the 

current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised as an expense. The impairment 

losses recognised as an expense on available-for-sale equity investment are not reversed through 

profit or loss. 

 

For financial assets, available-for-sale that are carried at cost, the amount of the impairment loss is 

measured as the difference between the equity security’s carrying amount and the present value of 

the estimated cash flows discounted at the current market return for a similar financial asset. The 

impairment losses recognised as an expense on equity security are not reversed. 

 

(j) 

Financial Liabilities 

 

The Group shall recognise a financial liability on its statement of financial position when, and only when, the 

Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 

 

Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are 

subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  

 

Financial liabilities are presented as “trade and other payables”, “loans and borrowings” and “other liabilities” on 

the statement of financial position. 

 

Borrowings are presented as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement 

for at least twelve months after the reporting period. 

 

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, 

cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the 

consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.

Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 

 

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial 

position, when and only when, there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and 

there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 

 

(l) 

Inventories 

 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods comprises direct 

costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is 

calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 

all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Allowance for stock obsolescence is 

made for obsolete and slow moving inventories.   

 

(m) 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

 

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, fixed deposits, bank balances and short-term, highly liquid 

investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk 

of change in value. For the purpose of presentation in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash 

equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above less pledged fixed deposits. 

 

(n) 

Provisions 

 

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past 

event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made 

of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration 

required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and 

uncertainties surrounding the obligation.

Share Capital 

 

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary 

shares are deducted against the share capital account.

Government Grants 

 

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the 

grant will be received and the Company will comply with all the attached conditions. 

 

Government grants receivable are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the 

related costs which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. Government grants relating to 

expenses are shown separately as other income. 

 

Government grants relating to assets are deducted against the carrying amount of the assets. 

 

(q) 

Revenue 

 

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for 

transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 

 

Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or 

service to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance 

obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount 

allocated to the satisfied performance obligation. 

 

Distribution sale of mobile handsets and accessories 

 

Revenue from the sale of mobile handsets and accessories is recognised when control of the products has 

transferred, being when the goods are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the 

manner of distribution and price to sell the goods, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the 

customer’s acceptance of the goods. Delivery occurs when the goods have been shipped to the specific 

location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer 

has accepted the goods in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the 

Group has the objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied. A receivable is recognised 

when the goods are delivered as this represents the point in time that the right to consideration is unconditional 

because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due. 

 

Retail sale of consumer electronics and related products 

 

The Group operates a retail store selling electronics and related products. Revenue from the sale of electronics 

and related products is recognised when control of the goods has transferred, being at the point the customer 

purchases the goods at the retail store. Payment of the transaction price is due immediately at the point the 

customer purchases the goods.

(r) 

Borrowing Costs 

 

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 

assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to 

the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 

Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowings of 

funds. 

 

All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 

 

(s) 

Employee Benefits 

 

Employee benefits are recognised as an expense, unless the cost qualifies to be capitalised as an asset. 

 

Defined contribution plan 

 

Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions 

into separate entities on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment 

obligations once the contributions have been paid. 

 

Employee leave entitlement  

 

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised as a liability when they accrue to employees. A 

provision for the estimated liability for annual leave is recognised for services rendered by employees up to the 

reporting date. 

 

(t) 

Leases 

 

Operating lease (when the Group is a lessor) 

 

Leases of investment properties where the Group retains substantially all risks and rewards incidental to 

ownership are classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating leases (net of any incentives given 

to the lessees) is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rents are 

recognised as income in profit or loss when earned. 

 

Operating lease (when the Group is a lessee) 

 

Leases where substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership are retained by the lessor are 

classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (when the Group is a lessee) are 

recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Contingent rents are recognised 

as an expense in profit or loss when incurred.

Significant Accounting Policies (cont’d) 

 

(u) 

Income Tax  

 

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 

 

Current tax 

 

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in 

the profit or loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items 

that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have 

been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 

 

Deferred tax 

 

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 

the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. 

 

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are 

generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 

will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 

 

Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or 

from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 

that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. 

 

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in 

subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 

and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 

 

Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and 

interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against 

which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable 

future. 

 

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the 

extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset 

to be recovered. 

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in 

which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 

substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

(u) 

Income Tax (cont’d) 

 

Deferred tax (cont’d) 

 

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the 

manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount 

of its assets and liabilities. 

 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 

against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the 

Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 

 

The Group recognises a previously unrecognised deferred tax asset to the extent that it has become probable 

that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 

 

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition 

at that date, would be recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances changed. The 

adjustment would either be treated as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it is 

incurred during the measurement period or in profit or loss. 

 

For the purposes of measuring deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets for investment properties that are 

measured using fair value model, the carrying amounts of such properties are presumed to be recovered 

entirely through sale, unless the presumption is rebutted. The presumption is rebutted when the investment 

property is depreciable and is held within a business model whose objective is to consume substantially all of 

the economic benefit embodied in the investment property over time, rather than through sale. 

 

Current and deferred tax for the year 

 

Current and deferred tax are recognised as income or an expense in profit or loss, except when they relate to 

items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the current and 

deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where the 

current and deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is taken into 

account in the accounting for the business combination. 

 

(v) 

Segment Reporting 

 

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 

management whose members are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 

operating segments.

Non-current Assets Held-for-sale and Discontinued Operations 

 

Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held-for-sale or distribution if their carrying amount will 

be recovered through a sale transaction or distribution rather than through continuing use. This condition is 

regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for 

immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected 

to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. 

 

When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and 

liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held-for-sale when the criteria set out above are met, regardless of 

whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale. Non-current assets 

(or disposal groups) classified as held-for-sale (held for distribution) are measured at the lower of the assets’ 

previous carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell (fair value less costs to distribute). 

 

The assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held-for-sale. In addition, equity 

accounting of associates and joint ventures ceases once classified as held-for-sale. Any impairment loss on 

initial classification and subsequent measurement is recognised as an expense. Any subsequent increase in 

fair value less costs to sell (not exceeding the accumulated impairment loss that has been previously 

recognised) is recognised in profit or loss. 

 

A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or that is classified as 

held for sale and; 

 

i. 

represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or 

ii. 

is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical 

area of operations; or 

iii. 

is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. 

 

When a component of an entity qualifies as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of 

comprehensive income is retrospectively restated to segregate the results of all operations that have been 

discontinued by the end of the latest reporting period.

Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty 

 

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are set out in Note 3 above, the management is 

required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 

that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 

historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these 

estimates. 

 

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 

estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or 

in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 

 

Critical judgements in applying accounting policies 

 

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the application of judgements that are expected to 

have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below. 

 

(i) 

Impairment of investments in subsidiaries 

 

The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investments in 

subsidiaries are impaired. To determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment, the Company 

considers factors such as the subsidiaries’ financial performance and financial position and the overall 

economic environment. 

 

The carrying amount of the Company’s investments in subsidiaries as at 31 December 2018 and the 

movements in the allowance for impairment loss are disclosed in Note 17.

Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty (cont’d) 

 

Key sources of estimation uncertainty 

 

The estimates at 1 January 2017 and at 31 December 2017 are consistent with those made for the same dates 

in accordance with FRS. The estimates used by the Group to present these amounts in accordance with 

SFRS(I) reflect conditions at 1 January 2017, the date of transition to SFRS(I) and as of 31 December 2017. 

 

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the 

reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 

and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. 

 

(ii) 

Allowance for expected credit loss of trade receivables 

 

The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate allowance for expected credit loss (ECL) for trade receivables. 

The provision rates are based on internal credit ratings for groupings of various customer segments that have 

similar loss patterns. The provision matrix is initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates 

analysed in accordance with days past due for groupings of various customer segments in the past two years. 

The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. At 

every reporting date, historical default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are 

analysed. The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic 

conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. Further, the Group’s historical credit loss experience and forecast 

of economic conditions may not be representative of customer’s actual default in the future. 

 

The information about the ECLs on the Group’s trade receivables is disclosed in Note 32(a). The carrying 

amount of the Group’s trade receivables as at 31 December 2018 is disclosed in Note 20.

Note A: 

 

On 6 September 2018, CM Polaris Pte Ltd (“CM Polaris”), a subsidiary of the Group, entered into an Asset 

Transfer Agreement (“ATA”) with R7 Rigel.1 Pte. Ltd. (the “Purchaser”), Asiatic Mart Holding Pte Ltd, and 

Polaris KKC Holdings Pte. Ltd., both of which are shareholders of CM Polaris (the “Shareholders”). The ATA 

encloses a novation agreement (the “Novation Agreement”) which was entered into by the Purchaser, CM 

Polaris and CM Polaris Company Limited (not part of the Group), a company incorporated in Myanmar. 

 

The assets to be transferred (the “Assets”) include (i) nett of all monies held in CM Polaris’s fixed deposit and 

(ii) all of CM Polaris’s rights and obligations under the franchise and license agreement between CM Polaris 

Company Limited and CM Polaris (the “Franchise and License Agreement”, which shall be novated in 

accordance with the Novation Agreement). 

 

The Franchise and License Agreement grants CM Polaris Company Limited the right to use the trademarks, 

service marks, logos and other commercial symbols as well as overarching distinctive business formats and 

methods owned by CM Polaris, for the operation of the business in Myanmar. Upon completion of the ATA, CM 

Polaris shall irrevocably novate all its rights and obligations under the Franchise and License Agreement to the 

Purchaser. 

 

The directors of the Company are of the view that the Proposed Transfer of the Assets was in the best interest 

of the Group, due to the lack of business performance and loss-making business in CM Polaris. As there were 

no conditions precedent under the ATA, the transfer of the Assets was deemed to have been completed on 

signing of the ATA. The consideration for the transfer of the Assets of approximately S$1,121,000 has been 

fully received in cash by the Group pursuant to the terms of the ATA at the reporting date.

As at 31 December 2018, the Group has unutilised tax losses of approximately S$41.1 million (2017: S$40.7 

million) which can be carried forward and used to offset against future taxable income of those entities in the 

Group in which the losses arose, subject to the agreement of the tax authorities and compliance of the relevant 

provisions of the tax legislation of the respective countries in which they operate. The unutilised tax losses have 

no expiry dates. 

 

The deferred tax assets arising from these unutilised tax losses of approximately S$7.0 million (2017: S$6.9

Impairment loss of subsidiaries 

 

An allowance for impairment loss of S$675,000 was recognised in the current financial year for the Company’s 

investment in a partially owned subsidiary, Polaris KKC Holdings Pte. Ltd. The allowance for the impairment 

loss was the estimated irrecoverable amount of the Company’s investment in the subsidiary, determined by 

reference to its financial position which in the opinion of the management, represented the fair value of the 

Company’s investment in the subsidiary. The allowance for impairment loss of S$1,000,000 recognised in the 

previous financial year was for the Company’s investment in a wholly owned subsidiary, Polaris Culture Pte. 

Ltd., which has now been written off as the subsidiary was struck off during the financial year.

reporting period.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and the credit period ranges from 30 to 90 days (2017: 30 to 90 

days; 1.1.2017: 30 to 90 days). 

 

Loss allowance for trade receivables has always been measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit 

losses (ECL) as disclosed in the accounting policy Note 3(i)(ii). There has been no change in the estimation 

techniques or significant assumptions made during the current reporting period. None of the trade receivables 

that have been written off is subject to enforcement activities. 

 

The Group’s credit risk exposure in relation to trade receivables under SFRS(I) 9 as at 31 December 2018 are 

set out in the provision matrix as presented below. The Group’s provision for loss allowance is based on past 

due as the Group’s historical credit loss experience does not show significantly different loss patterns for 

different customer segments.

Previous accounting policy for impairment of trade receivables 

 

As at 31 December 2017, trade receivables disclosed below include amounts which are past due at the end of 

the reporting period but for which the Group has not recognised an allowance for impairment losses because 

there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The 

Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances nor does it have a legal 

right of offset against any amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty.

due. 

 

(g) 

Impairment loss on financial assets 

 

For purpose of impairment assessment, the other receivables (exclude trade receivables, loan receivables and 

amounts due from subsidiaries) are considered to have low credit risk as they are not due for payment at the 

end of the reporting period and there has been no significant increase in the risk of default on the receivables 

since initial recognition. Accordingly, for the purpose of impairment assessment for these receivables, the loss 

allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL which reflects the low credit risk of the exposures. 

There is no allowance arising from these outstanding balances as the expected credit losses are not material. 

There has been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the current 

reporting period in assessing the loss allowance for these financial assets.

Financial Risk Management 

 

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies 

 

The Group is exposed to financial risks arising from its operations. The key financial risks include credit risk, 

liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and market risk. 

 

Financial risk management is carried out by management under policies approved by the Board of Directors of 

the Company. The Board of Directors is responsible for setting the objectives and underlying principles of 

financial risk management of the Group. 

 

(a) 

Credit Risk 

 

Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a loss to 

the Group. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises primarily from trade and other receivables, refundable 

deposits, amounts dues from subsidiaries, and cash and bank balances. For other financial assets (including 

cash and bank balances), the Group minimises credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating 

counterparties. 

 

The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. The Group performs ongoing 

credit evaluation of its counterparties’ financial condition and generally do not require a collateral. 

 

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a 

significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. 

 

The Group has determined the default event on a financial asset to be when internal and/or external 

information indicates that the financial asset is unlikely to be received, which could include default of 

contractual payments due for more than one year and nine months or there is significant difficulty of the 

counterparty. 

 

The credit risk concentration profile of the Group’s trade receivables at the reporting date is as follows:

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (cont’d) 

 

(a) 

Credit Risk (cont’d) 

 

Trade receivables 

 

As disclosed in Note 3(i)(ii), the Group uses a provision matrix to measure the lifetime expected credit loss 

allowance for trade receivables. In measuring the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based 

on their shared credit risk characteristics and numbers of days past due. The expected credit losses on these 

financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, 

adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both 

the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money 

where appropriate. 

 

Further details on the loss allowance of the Group’s credit risk exposure in relation to the trade receivables is 

disclosed in Note 20. 

 

Cash and bank balances and other financial assets 

 

The cash and bank balances are entered into with bank and financial institution counterparties, which are rated 

A to AA, based on rating agency ratings. 

 

Impairment on cash and bank balances has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and reflects 

the short maturities of the exposures. The Group considers that its cash and bank balances have low credit risk 

based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. The Group uses a similar approach for assessment of 

ECLs for cash and bank balances to those used for debt investments. The amount of the allowance on cash 

and bank balances was immaterial. 

 

Credit risk grading guideline 

 

The Group’s management has established the Group’s internal credit risk grading to the different exposures 

according to their degree of default risk. The internal credit risk grading which are used to report the Group’s 

credit risk exposure to key management personnel for credit risk management purposes are as follows:

SFRS 39 - financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired 

 

As at 31 December 2017 and 1 January 2017, trade and other receivables that are neither past due nor 

impaired are with credit-worthy debtors. Cash at banks, short-term deposits and other financial assets are 

placed or entered into with reputable financial institutions. The information of the past due financial assets 

(trade receivables) are disclosed in Note 20. 

 

(b) 

Liquidity Risk 

 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations 

due to shortage of funds. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from 

mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. The Group’s and the Company’s objective is to 

maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of stand-by credit facilities.

(b) 

Liquidity Risk (cont’d) 

 

To manage liquidity risk, the Group monitors its net operating cash flow, maintains a level of cash and bank 

balances and secured committed funding facilities from financial institutions. In assessing the adequacy of 

these facilities, the Group reviews working capital and capital expenditure requirements continually so as to 

mitigate the effects of fluctuations in the cash flows. When a potential shortfall in cash is anticipated, the Group 

will finance the shortfall by way of borrowings, share placements and/or issue of convertible securities in a 

timely manner. The Group places its surplus funds with reputable banks. 

 

The Group will continue to review, formulate and implement a liquidity risk management policy and to maintain 

sufficient liquid financial assets and stand-by credit facilities with three different banks. At the end of the 

reporting period, approximately 5% (2017: 5%; 1.1.2017: 5%) of the Group’s loans and borrowings (Note 24) 

will mature in less than one year based on the carrying amount reflected in the financial statements.

(c) 

Interest Rate Risk 

 

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s and the Company’s financial 

instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s and the Company’s 

exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from their loans and borrowings. 

 

As the Group’s and Company’s loans and borrowings are presently on floating rates, the Group and Company 

will continue to review, formulate and implement policies to manage interest costs for new loans and borrowings 

using a mix of fixed and floating rate debts. 

 

Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk 

 

At the end of the reporting period, if the Bank Commercial Financing rate, Bank Commercial Variable rates and 

Bank’s cost of funds had been 0.1% (2017: 0.1%) basis points higher/lower with all other variables held 

constant, the Group’s and Company’s loss before income tax would have been S$4,527 (2017: S$4,778) 

higher/lower, arising as a result of higher/lower interest expenses on floating rate loans and borrowings.

Foreign Currency Risk 

 

The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases that are denominated in 

foreign currencies; consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. The foreign currencies in which 

these transactions are denominated are mainly United States Dollars (“USD”) and Euro (“EUR”). 

 

To manage the foresaid foreign currency risk, the Group maintains a natural hedge, whenever possible, by 

depositing foreign currency proceeds from sales into foreign currency bank accounts which are primarily used 

for payments of purchases in the same currency denomination.

Financial Risk Management (cont’d) 

 

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (cont’d) 

 

(e) 

Market risk 

 

Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s financial instruments will 

fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than interest or exchange rates). The Group is exposed to 

equity price arising from its equity investment. 

 

Sensitivity analysis for market risk 

 

The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risks at the end of the 

reporting period. 

 

The Group’s equity investment is listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). If the quoted equity price of the 

IDX listed equity classified as financial asset measured at FVOCI (2017: available-for-sale), had 

increased/(decreased) by 5% with all other variables including tax rate being held constant, the Group’s net loss 

for the year would have been unaffected as the equity investment is classified as FVOCI; and the Group’s other 

comprehensive income would have increased/(decreased) by S$2,309,000 (2017: Nil). 

 

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to equity prices or the manner in which these risks are 

managed and measured. 

 

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, based on the prevailing quoted equity price of the IDX 

listing equity, the Group’s equity investment had increased from S$46,184,000 as at 31 December 2018 to 

S$49,425,000, resulting in a fair value gain of approximately S$3,241,000. 

 

(f) 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 

Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position 

 

The Group has established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. This framework 

includes the finance team that reports directly to the Group’s key management, and has overall responsibility 

for all significant fair value measurements, including Level 3 fair values. 

 

The finance team regularly reviews significantly unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party 

confirmation, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair value, then the finance team 

assesses and documents the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such 

valuations meet the requirements of SFRS(I)s, including the level in the fair value hierarchy the resulting fair 

value estimate should be classified. 

 

Significant valuation issues are reported to the Company’s Audit Committee.

(f) 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments (cont’d) 

 

Fair value hierarchy 

 

The financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are required 

disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: 

 

(i) 

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

 

(ii) 

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 

liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 

 

(iii) 

Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 

inputs). 

 

Fair value measurements that use inputs of different hierarchy levels are categorised in its entirety in the same 

level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. 

 

Assets and liabilities not carried at fair value but for which fair value is disclosed 

 

The following table shows an analysis of each class of assets and liabilities not measured at fair value at the

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (cont’d) 

 

(f) 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments (cont’d) 

 

Assets and liabilities not carried at fair value but for which fair value is disclosed (cont’d) 

 

Investment properties and assets held-for-sale 

 

The valuation of investment properties is based on comparable market transactions that consider sales of 

similar properties that have been transacted in the open market. In estimating the fair value of the properties, 

the highest and best use of the properties is their current use. 

 

Other financial assets and financial liabilities 

 

The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities with a maturity of less than one year, which are 

primarily cash and bank balances, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and short-term loans 

and borrowings, are assumed to approximate their carrying amounts because of the short-term maturity of 

these financial instruments. 

 

The fair value of non-current other receivables and long-term loans and borrowings are calculated based on 

discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows. The discount rates used are based on market 

rates for similar instruments at the reporting date. The carrying amounts of these financial assets and financial 

liabilities are assumed to approximate their respective fair values. The Group does not anticipate that the 

carrying amounts recorded at the reporting date would be significantly different from the values that would 

eventually be received or settled. 

 

(g) 

Excessive Risk Concentration 

 

Concentration arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in 

the same geographical region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual 

obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations 

indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry. 

 

In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the Group’s policies and procedures include specific 

guidelines to focus on maintaining a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled 

and managed accordingly.

Segment Information 

 

For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their products and services, 

and has four reportable operating segments as follows: 

 

I. 

The distribution segment engages in the distribution of mobile communication devices and 

accessories for leading brands. 

 

II. 

The retail telecommunication segment engages in the retail sale of mobile communication devices and 

accessories and provision of broadband and other related telecommunication services in Singapore. It 

operates a network of strategically located retail stores island-wide. This retail telecommunication 

segment comprises franchise of SingTel. 

 

III. 

The retail consumer electronics segment engages in the retail sale of IT and related products in 

Singapore. 

 

IV. 

The corporate segment is involved in Group-level corporate services, treasury functions and 

investments in associates and marketable securities. It also involves in strategic investment and joint 

venture opportunities in emerging Southeast Asia markets to synergise and complement the Group’s 

existing offerings. 

 

Except as indicated above, no other operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable 

operating segments. 

 

Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions 

about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on 

operating profit or loss which in certain respects, as explained in the table below, is measured differently from 

operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. Group financing (including finance costs) and 

income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. 

 

Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm length’s basis in a manner similar to transactions 

with third parties.
