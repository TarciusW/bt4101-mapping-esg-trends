Corporate Profile

At present, we operate in Singapore and manage our 

operations in accordance with our sustainability principles. 

We work closely with our management and staff to identify 

and consider any sustainability opportunities and risks that 

may arise.  

Sustainability trends such as climate change, resource 

scarcity and demographic changes shape the competitive 

environment in which companies like OEL operate. We 

therefore view our business performance beyond short term 

gains and financial bottomline. Our conviction is to achieve 

a balanced triple bottomline (People, Profit, Planet) for 

sustained growth of the organisation and the community it 

operates in.

The success of our business is highly dependent on 

the commitment of our management and staff.  Their 

knowledge, professional expertise and their job satisfaction 

are key to our economic sustainability.  

More importantly, we strive to contribute positively to the 

society through our economic presence, while maintaining 

good stewardship of the resources we manage and 

generating good shareholders’ value.

Our business model focuses on cost effectiveness without

Corporate governance and compliance has always been

reported to the Board of Directors on a need basis.     

The Company has not received any correspondences or

we have business dealings with, to the people in the society 

whom we serve and towards each other as employees

corporate values to act with integrity.  

A direct whistle-blowing channel has also been implemented

Nevertheless, we strive to embrace environmental 

sustainability by managing environmental conservation 

through adopting ‘Reduce’, ‘Re-use’, ‘Recycle’ and energy 

efficient practices.  

Target:

to conserve electricity consumption.

Board and disposed used water into the public sewage 

system.

There is no incident of non-compliance with environmental 

laws and regulations reported.

aim to encourage the following 'Go-Green' initiatives in

• ‘Reduce’ the use of papers by setting the printers to print 

on double-sides of each piece of paper and print only when 

necessary.  

• ‘Re-use’ single-side printed papers for non-conﬁdential 

ENVIRONMENT

As part of our initial efforts, we will align our environmental 

performance in our Singapore operations to key evaluation 

criterion like water and energy conservation.
