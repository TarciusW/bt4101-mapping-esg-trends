Statement from our Board  

The Board of Directors is proud to present CSC Holding Limited (“CSC”)’s Sustainability Report for the 

financial year ended 31 March 2020 (“FY20”), which formalises and demonstrates our commitment towards 

building a more sustainable future. Within the construction industry, we recognise the significant impact that 

our company can have on the economy, environment and society. As we stay focused on providing our 

capabilities in foundation and geotechnical engineering, we will deliver on that mission through taking a 

proactive approach to adopt sustainable practices and stay relevant through innovation.       

Underscoring this importance, our Board directly oversees the company’s overall sustainability efforts, 

supported by an Executive Committee to identify material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

matters in our strategic formulation and set sustainability policies and strategies. 

This Sustainability Report complements our financial and corporate governance disclosures in our Annual 

Report as an expression of our firm belief in doing business with integrity and innovation to deliver quality 

services to our clients.  

Moving forward, CSC Holdings will build on the foundation of this Sustainability Report and work with our 

stakeholders and business partners to continuously improve our business models and ESG performance 

to foster sustainable development.     

About this Report  

 

This Sustainability Report sets out our efforts towards contributing to a sustainable built environment. 

We have adhered to the principles set out in SGX Listing Rules for Sustainability Reporting and applied the 

Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Reporting Principles for Defining Report Content and Quality. 

We have chosen GRI Standards to be the reporting framework as it is very prescriptive and provides the 

needed guidance for us. Further, our peers too have adopted this. The report has been prepared in 

accordance with the GRI Standards: ‘Core’ option.   

This report covers our significant operations in Singapore, our headquarters, and reflects our sustainability 

performance in FY20 relating to the following entities, with data from the previous year for comparison 

purposes (to the extent possible).

Our People   

 

People define our organisation here at CSC. It is our policy to uphold fair employment practices in our hiring 

process and maintain zero tolerance of any form of discrimination. We believe in providing equal 

opportunities for all our employees to help them realise their fullest potential. From FY19 to FY20, our full-

time employee numbers (in Singapore) decreased from 1,037 to 997 while the number of temporary supply 

workers we engaged decreased from 92 to 23. There were no employees on part-time employment.  

Owing to our nature of services, i.e. a company providing ground engineering solutions, which our 

operations are labour-intensive, leading to significant participation of males in our workforce.

Sustainability Approach at CSC  

 

As the region’s leading ground engineering solutions provider and geotechnical specialist, we take our 

commitment to sustainability seriously. CSC adheres to the Precautionary Principle through sound internal 

controls and system of risk management.   

The Group adopts international best practice, being accredited with ISO 14001:2015, ISO 9001:2015 and 

BS OHSAS 18001:2007 for the design and installation of bored piles. Additional accreditations include the 

Building and Construction Authority (BCA)’s Contractors Registration System, bizSAFE programme, and 

strict adherence to the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 as set out by the Monetary Authority of 

Singapore.   

The Board of Directors has collective oversight of the Group’s sustainability strategy and works closely with 

Management to ensure sustainability matters are considered as part of its business strategy. At the senior 

management level, the Board is supported by an Executive Committee comprising the Group Chief 

Executive Officer, Group Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  

The Executive Committee is responsible for 4 primary areas:  

1. Decision-making on economic, environmental and social topics 

2. Setting sustainability policies and strategies 

3. Investment decisions or directions for major innovations relating to sustainability  

4. Reviewing progress quarterly to ensure that the best practices of sustainability are embedded 

across the Group 

A Sustainability Committee that works across the Group’s core business and operations units reports to 

the Executive Committee.

Identify 

 

We considered a combination of internal and 

external factors such as the concerns 

expressed by stakeholders and CSC’s 

competitive strategy. A preliminary list of 

potential ESG factors was developed.   

Assess and Prioritise 

 

From the list, we rated and prioritised each 

ESG matter through anonymous voting. The 

highest ranked material sustainability matters 

were selected for disclosure to start CSC on its 

formal sustainability reporting journey.        

Validate 

 

The selected material sustainability matters 

were presented to the Board of Directors for 

their validation and confirmation.   

Review 

 

To ensure the matters continue to remain 

relevant and material, re-assessment would be 

carried out in future reporting cycles.  

Materiality Assessment  

 

CSC has adopted the following four-step process to determine the relevant material sustainability topics 

that are key areas of interest to our stakeholders and involve substantive impacts from our business 

activities.

Community Involvement  

CSC strongly believes in maximising the full potential of our children and youth. Since 2011, CSC has made 

annual contributions of $10,000 to the Business &amp; Community Partners (BCP) Programme at the Nanyang 

Technological University (NTU). Funds in the programme go towards supporting the university studies of 

financially disadvantaged students. For its contributions, CSC continues to be recognised as a silver partner 

and loyal donor by NTU.   

 

In FY20, CSC went one step further and donated $5,000 in support of the North West Food Aid Fund, which 

requires $1 million yearly to assist average of 1,300 needy households every month.    

 

Together with our subsidiaries CSBP, LMFS and CSCG, we also donated:- 

 

 

$28,000 to Talent Trust Limited, a charity which improves the lives of disadvantaged people in 

Singapore by working with other charities to help them become more effective and sustainable by 

uniting senior business leaders with ambitious charities that want help.  

 

 

$2,888 to North East Community Development Council, which promote community bonding and 

strengthen social cohesion in the community, and help the less fortunate.    

 

 

$2,000 in support of National University Singapore’s School of Design and Environment (“SDE”) 

Development Fund, which is used to support SDE’s development activities such as to advance and 

support both staff and student development activities, and to fund the upcoming SDE2 building. 

 

 

$500 to Caregiving Welfare Association, a non-profit voluntary welfare organisation with mission to 

improve the quality of elderly through dependable direct services, and to inculcate a generation of 

responsible and knowledgeable caregivers in an ageing population. Its services broadly fall under these 

three areas - Elderly Wellness &amp; Social Support, Welfare Support and Education &amp; Awareness.

Our Supply Chain  

We strive to embed sustainability principles at all points within our supply chain, to grow long-term 

environmental, social and economic value for all stakeholders. The Group’s main suppliers are 

infrastructure service providers.  

To achieve our mission, we have implemented purchasing processes, procedures and guidelines to operate 

an effective and efficient purchasing system and ensure the quality of our suppliers. The figure below details 

our business process flow and interaction chart to ensure all purchasing activities are carried out with the 

highest professional, ethical and legal standards.

Governance 

Corporate Governance  

 

The Board of Directors (“Board”) of CSC Holdings Limited (the “Company”) is also responsible for the 

Corporate Governance of the Company and its subsidiaries to protect stakeholders’ interests and enhance 

the stakeholder value in the long term. It consists of an executive, the Group CEO, and 3 non-executive 

independent directors as well as 1 non-executive non-independent director. To discharge the duties of the 

Board, all Board members maintain independent judgment, diversified knowledge, experience and 

expertise to address issues of strategy, performance, resources and the standards of conduct of the 

Company. As fiduciaries in the interests of the Company, all Directors are expected to discharge their duties 

and responsibilities objectively.  

Certain functions of the Board are delegated to the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee, Remuneration 

Committee and Risk Management Committee, which would make recommendations to the Board. Each 

committee has clearly defined terms of reference and operating procedures.  

The Board holds formal meetings quarterly or convenes ad-hoc meetings when circumstances require. 

Where a physical board meeting is not possible, the Board can communicate through electronic means or 

via circulation of written resolutions for approval.  

For a full report on our corporate governance practices, please refer to our Corporate Governance Report 

2020. 

 

Our Values  

 

Our way of doing business is defined by integrity, consistent with the highest ethical standards and 

compliant with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. The Company strongly believes that the 

action and conduct of all employees of the Group, as well as other person acting on behalf of the Company 

and/or its subsidiaries, are essential to maintaining these standards.  

CSC has in place a Whistle-Blowing Policy and an employee Code of Conduct and Discipline. The Whistle-

Blowing Policy is developed based on the recommendations of the Singapore Code of Corporate 

Governance, which is reviewed and recommended by the Audit Committee and subsequently approved by 

the Board. It provides an avenue for employees of the Group, and any other persons to raise concerns in 

good faith with the reassurance of being protected from reprisals or victimisation and ensures that 

arrangements are in place for independent investigations of such matters and for appropriate follow-up 

actions.     

The Code of Conduct and Discipline and Whistle-Blowing Policy is made available to all employees and 

communicated regularly to stress their importance and maintain awareness of the Board’s commitment. All 

new employees are also briefed on them as part of their orientation program.  

The management of CSC welcomes feedback from the public and its employees as a valuable tool to 

enhance its services and operations. Grievance mechanisms are also available at the organisation level 

through phone calls, emails and suggestion boxes. 

 

 


13 

 

The Company has established the Quality, Environmental, 

Health &amp; Safety (QEHS) Policy in an integrated 

management system, which has been updated as of 

November 2018.  

 

To ensure it is in tune with the company’s strategic direction 

that is consistent with the purpose and context of CSC, top 

management at CSC will review the policy periodically to 

ensure objectives are being achieved. The CEO and COO 

are directly responsible for the implementation of the QEHS. 

 

This policy references the Workplace Safety and Health 

(WSH) Act, Environmental Protection Management Act 

(EPMA), ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 as well as 

relevant code of practices.  

 

CSC actively communicates this to our stakeholders to 

ensure it is understood, and consults their views through 

notice boards, talks or other promotional activities, general 

awareness training for existing staff and orientation training 

for new staff.

CSC assesses our approach to addressing our quality, environmental, health and safety issues through 

various means. The table below details how we conduct the assessment and the identified improvement 

opportunities: 

Method of assessment 

Results 

Internal Audits 

 

Environmental Health &amp; Safety (EHS) 

inspections by EHS managers, WSH 

officers and WSH coordinators 

 

ISO 14001 audit by trained internal 

auditors at selected projects 

 

Unsafe practices and conditions observed during the 

piling work process identified during inspection and audit 

were rectified with appropriate control measures and 

trainings. 

External Audits 

 

Integrated management system (ISO 

9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001) 

surveillance and renewal audits by a 

registered external auditing firm 

System lapses are identified and corrected with 

appropriate preventive actions, i.e. risk assessments, 

introduction of new method. 

 

Good practices from industry stakeholders were shared 

among the work group to enhance the safety &amp; health 

standard. 

 

Measurement Systems 

 

Number of Corrective and Preventive 

Action (CAPA) and observations 

issued by the auditors 

 

Suggestions and area of 

improvements given by the auditors 

 

Company's incident trend and 

statistics safety trainings 

 

Employees are carefully selected and sent for EHS 

trainings as required by law / clients. 

 

Feedback obtained from employees through issuance of 

"Training Evaluation Form".  

External performance ratings 

 

Subcontractor's performance 

evaluation from main-contractors 

and/or clients 

 

Safety recognition award or 

commendation letter from main 

contractors and/or clients 

 

External performance ratings given from main-contractors 

and clients though "Customer feedback form" helps CSC 

identify its strengths, weaknesses and areas for 

improvement. 

Benchmarking 

 

WSH Act &amp; Subsidiary regulations 

 

Approved code of practices 

 

Environmental Protection &amp; 

Management Act 

 

Competitors 

 

CSC has committed and set benchmark to comply with 

WSH Act and other relevant Acts of Singapore (as 

minimum standard). Adopting industry good practices 

has been acknowledged by our leading clients, e.g. 

Singapore’s Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Housing 

&amp; Development Board (HDB), other government and 

private projects. 

 

Stakeholder feedback  

Feedback from stakeholders is requested 

during meetings and trainings, e.g. tool 

box meeting, in-house training, EHS 

committee meetings, etc. 

 

Company has feedback management plan 

to receive and address grievances from 

stakeholders on quality, EHS and 

productivity matters.  

 

Stakeholder (i.e. clients, public, and employees) feedback 

is registered and addressed diligently. This improves 

stakeholder confidence in CSC. 


15 

 

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE  

 

CSC is sensitive to the deterioration of the natural environment, ensuring that its work activities and 

products do not cause any further damage, or wherever possible, minimise impact on the environment. In 

line with our commitment, CSC has been adopting ISO 14001 in compliance with globally set standards as 

well as the EPMA in Singapore. These are closely monitored through established systems and regular 

audits from both internal and external auditors.  

To manage our compliance with environmental 

regulations, we have provided silt water treatment plants 

and implemented a test bed of separation system for 

slurry water management. All machines undergo 

maintenance regularly to minimise smoke emissions and 

reduce the consumption of energy from diesel, water 

and power. Noise monitoring meters together with noise 

barriers for heavy or noisy equipment help mitigate 

potential noise disamenity.   

Our performance on compliance is internally and 

externally scrutinised and verified. Our EHS managers, 

WSH officers and WSH coordinators perform internal 

inspections while a registered auditing firm carries out 

surveillance on ISO 14001 and renewal audits.  

In FY19, noise levels were found to be in violation of regulations at a project site.  Consequently a fine of 

$5,000 was imposed by the authority. 

Appropriate measures have been taken to rectify the problem. We take a serious view of such offences and 

have taken concerted steps to prevent their re-occurrence.  

Despite our best effort, CSC was found to be in breach of the EPMA for noise control at 4 project sites in 

FY20 and a fine of $60,000 was imposed by the authority.  

We will continue to strive to maintain noise standards at our work sites through stepping up site inspections 

and environmental audits.   

 

Case Study: Condominium Development at Silat 

Avenue &amp; Public Residential Project at Tengah 

Plantation 

 

The project sites are located very close to residential buildings. By installing all heavy machines, i.e. 

crane and boring rigs, in these projects with high quality double layer noise enclosure for both engine 

compartment and rotary head, this measure proved effective in reducing the noise level at source.

SUSTAINABLE USE OF MATERIALS 

 

 

As far as possible, CSC endeavours to prevent material wastage and reduce the environmental impact of 

our operations (precast piles and concrete). We recognise that geotechnical engineering is heavily 

resource-intensive and can significantly influence the 

sustainability of the built environment as it lies at the 

upstream end of the construction process. CSC complies 

with the code of practice for materials and grade based on 

contract requirements for steel, reinforcement steel bars, 

structural steel materials and ready mixed concrete. Every 

contract from CSC will set a percentage of tolerable 

wastage.  

The table below details our average percentage of wastage 

for precast piles and concrete over FY19 and FY20. 

 

CSC has in place an organisational structure for reporting on the consumption of materials. Senior 

management and our operations team are able to provide feedback through daily, weekly and monthly 

reporting to management. Project managers, project engineers, site coordinators and site supervisors, 

together with the purchaser report to the Director or Head of Subsidiary Company. The Director is 

accountable to the Executive Committee comprising the Group CEO, Group COO and CFO which will in 

turn update the Board. This ensures that material use is tracked for every project so that we remain viable 

in the long-term.

MINIMISING NOISE POLLUTION 

 

The nature of work in CSC involves the use of heavy machinery, such as cranes and piling 

rigs which emit noise during operation. The high density of the urban environment in Singapore means that 

CSC has to be even more sensitive to the disturbance our operations can cause to nearby residents. 

Besides the social impact on residents, exposure to high noise levels (85 dBA or more) for prolonged 

periods may also negatively affect the well-being of our workers. Strict legislation also controls the 

permissible noise exposure level enforced by penalties. If repeated violation notices are received, this would 

greatly affect CSC’s business and reputation within the industry.    

To manage this, the aforementioned QEHS policy guides our 

approach to minimising noise pollution. Investing in noise-

mitigating equipment is an essential part of our efforts. For 

example, noise meters are installed for projects where 

workplaces are registered as an occupier, while noise barrier 

enclosures are erected for piling rigs and generators. In line 

with regulations, piling work activities are restricted beyond 

10:00 p.m. if the project site is located within 150m from any 

residential, school and hospital environment. Real-time noise 

monitoring system further alerts CSC to potential violations 

that can be rectified immediately.  

We conduct regular training in ISO 14001 for our operational staff as well as noise management briefings 

for our workers. Noise-related hazards are incorporated in the risk assessments and communicated to 

workers.  At project sites where noise and vibration issues are particularly sensitive, temporary pile casings 

are installed using a secondary rotator head attached in the boring rig instead of the conventional method 

of installing/extracting casings using a vibro-hammer. This method reduces the noise emission level 

significantly. However, this concept is only selectively implemented where noise and vibration levels are 

expected to have significant impacts to the nearby residents and buildings as it consumes more time and 

resources. 

We cease all piling rig operations based on statutory requirements to contain the noise level from heavy 

piling rigs where the project site is within 150m from any residential, school and hospital environment.  For 

diaphragm wall works, bored piling, precast piling and bored micropile work, equipment and stationary 

machines are located away from residents and engines are undergo regular maintenance to minimise 

noises. We will continue to pay close attention to keep noise levels to a minimum and strive for zero incident 

of fines.    

Additionally, to promote reuse or recycling, all noise barrier materials are reused for multiple projects.  

 

 



Targets 

 Zero incident of fines for noise 

violations (in perpetuity) 

Performance for FY20: 

4 incidents resulting in fine

Case Study: Noise reduction at Keppel Station in FY19 

(future station on Circle Line in Singapore) 

 

During the construction of an underground MRT station, 11m high noise barriers were expected to 

reduce the noise level for stakeholders which are close to the working site.  

 

All heavy equipment are fixed with noise barriers and generators sited farthest away from premises and 

further shielded with noise barriers. The noise level is monitored periodically and advance notice is 

given to stakeholders when ad-hoc work is scheduled.   

 

 

 

Case Study: Noise reduction at Claymore Road Hotel in 

FY20 

 

The work site fully surrounded by hotels and condominiums. The noise levels generated from the piling 

activities were well controlled / minimized by using double layer noise barriers,  training to the operators 

and time management.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 

Worker safety is of paramount importance to us at CSC.  

CSC Holdings Limited sees itself playing a leading role to improve 

construction safety across the industry. The mission of CSC is to 

protect its most valued asset – our people – from any kind of harm 

arising from work activities. In addition to adherence to the QEHS 

policy, CSC has also adopted a Fall Prevention Policy since 30 

August 2017 which is overseen by senior management and head 

of departments.   

Our commitment to health &amp; safety also extends to all our customers. We have been providing competent 

professionals and expertise to execute our operations safely to protect our employees and customers. 

Qualified safety professionals and the operations team are deployed for each project to analyse and 

mitigate the associated hazards and risks by carefully studying the site-specific operations, surrounding 

environment and OHS expectations of our customers.  

All operation staff undergo mandatory safety training in accordance with their designation and job 

requirements. In addition, in-house trainings are also conducted on a regular basis to enhance the safety 

awareness of our employees. Some examples of such trainings include construction safety course for 

project managers, risk management courses for project managers, engineers and safety personnel, WSH 

officer course, manage work at height course, operator’s course, and supervisory courses.  

Our safety track record shows that for FY19 and FY20, there have been 0 work-related fatalities and a total 

of 9 reported cases of work injuries from our male employees. Out of these 4, 1 case of finger injury and 1 

case of leg injury occurred in FY19 while 3 cases of finger injury and 1 case of knee injury were caused by 

moving parts of the piling rig and 1 case of shoulder injury was caused by object handling in FY20. Since 

then, we have provided re-training to our mechanics and mandated that all engines shall always be 

switched off during repair and maintenance works. We value the safety of all our workers and will continue 

to uphold the strictest safety standards.    

 

 

 

 

 

 

We believe that 

workers are the assets of 

our company. Their 

understanding in safety is 

vitally important to us.

QUALITY OF WORK AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION 

 

CSC remains strongly committed to our customers. We have been providing competent professionals and 

expertise to execute our operations safely and we believe that a systematic Operational Health &amp; Safety 

(OHS) system will help uphold the company brand reputation with our employee and customers.  

Qualified safety professionals and operations team are deployed for every project to analyse and mitigate 

the associated hazards and risks by carefully studying the site-specific operations, surrounding 

environment and OHS expectations of our customers.  From a financial standpoint, delivering the highest 

quality services to our customers provides assurance and contributes to our financial sustainability.   

Employees and customers are able to voice out concerns and grievances relating to our quality of work 

through our general corporate relation channels. The management at CSC welcomes feedback as 

invaluable to further improving our services and operations.   

Staff on site are provided with tablets to conduct safety works, such as electronic inspections or application 

of electronic permits. We have also introduced the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for the set-

up of pile positions in selective projects. This technology detects the pile position automatically, thus 

reducing the manpower previously required by surveyors to set up the piles physically.  

Collectively, the QEHS policy sets out our targets towards maintaining the highest quality standards and 

guides our practices towards satisfying our customers’ needs.
