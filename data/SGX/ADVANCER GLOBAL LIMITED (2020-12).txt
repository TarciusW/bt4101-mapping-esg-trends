SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

MESSAGE FROM 

THE BOARD

The board is pleased to present Advancer Global 

Limited’s (“AGL” or the “Group”) Sustainability 

Report covering the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 

December 2020 (“FY2020”). In this report, we share 

how the Group integrates key Environmental, Social 

and Governance (“ESG”) issues in its strategies, how 

the Group manages impacts and risks associated 

with these issues as well as its progress towards 

its 2020 sustainability target. 

We recognise the importance of sustainability and 

how integrating sustainability into our business 

operations could contribute to the long-term 

growth of the business. Good management of 

our sustainability risks and opportunities not 

only strengthens our corporate governance and 

enhances our operational efficiency, but also 

improves stakeholders’ satisfaction. 

The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 

early 2020, has led us to witness a major disruption 

which destabilised both personal lives and businesses. 

The pandemic reminds us of the importance of 

integrating sustainability into our business. The 

Group experienced a slow-down in its business 

operations in 2020 due to the pandemic and 2021 

continues to be a challenging year. However, we 

believe that our efforts to adopt and incorporate 

technology and digitalisation in our business since 

2018 have helped us to remain resilient and nimble 

as we continue to embrace opportunities during 

this period of ‘new normal’.

Amid the COVID-19 situation, we remained committed 

to support our customers while also safeguarding 

the health and safety of our employees. We have 

enforced safe management measures at our 

workplace including SafeEntry scanning, use of the 

Trace Together app, temperature screening, use of 

masks, and safe distancing among employees at the 

workplace to protect the health and well-being of 

our people. We have also leveraged on Government 

support grants e.g. Job Support Scheme, Work-Life 

Grant, property tax rebates and rental rebates 

where possible to keep the business going. The 

Group’s business was also adversely affected by 

the reduction in supply of foreign workers and 

Foreign Domestic Workers (“FDWs”) due to the 

border restrictions in neighboring countries e.g. 

Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines and 

others which inevitably led to decrease in revenue.

In FY2020, the Security Services segment also 

secured new contracts in servicing community 

care facilities for patients with mild symptoms 

and recovering from COVID-19 while our cleaning 

and pest control subsidiaries gained traction and 

were appointed by the National Environment 

Agency (“NEA”) as disinfection vendors. Ashtree 

International Pte. Ltd., an indirect subsidiary of 

AGL started a new revenue stream providing traffic 

control management services during the year. This 

includes, amongst others, the supplying of traffic 

marshalls to ensure events proceed smoothly and 

work sites as well as key facilities are secured.

AGL will continue to focus on sustainable growth 

through our strategies, policies and procedures in 

creating value for our stakeholders. It is also the 

people behind the scenes and the customers we 

serve that make up the backbone of our business. We 

are firm in our vision of creating value and shaping 

the future by conducting business operations in 

a manner that considers the environmental and 

social impact to sustain profitable growth. 

We would like to express gratitude to our clients, 

business partners and shareholders for their 

unwavering support over the years.  We are 

committed to sustaining our leadership for our 

stakeholders and look forward to keeping them 

appraised of our progress.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

Financial Highlights

COVID-19 pandemic has dampened our Group’s business activities last year and 2021 is expected 

to be another challenging year. The Group’s revenue decreased by S$14.6 million (20.5%) 

from S$70.9 million in FY2019 to S$56.4 million in FY2020 due to the decrease in revenue 

across all the Group’s business segments.  The decrease was attributed by (i) decreased in 

the number of FDWs that the Group had placed out to households due to worldwide travel 

controls;  (ii) decrease in service income received from stewarding and cleaning, pest control 

and fumigation, rendered to customers across residential, commercial properties, hotels and 

restaurants and (iii) decrease in security projects at Changi airport, shipyard, schools and 

commercial properties. 

For FY2020, the Group’s revenue for its Building Management Business and Security Services 

Business were S$30.7 million and $20.1 million respectively (FY2019: S$37.5 million and 

S$20.3 million respectively). As at 31 December 2020, the Group has service contracts from 

its Building Management and Security Services Businesses (with varying contract periods) 

amounting to approximately S$3.3 million monthly (31 December 2019: S$3.7 million monthly).

TRAINING

Average Training Hours &amp; 

Training Programs

At AGL, we believe in ensuring our employees are adequately trained and kept relevant of 

any updates and advances in their specific and relevant job positions. Every new employee 

must go through an orientation programme to familiarize themselves with their job position 

and embrace the Company culture. This ensures that they are able to perform their jobs 

efficiently and effectively.

With the rapid technological and market changes 

in our industry, it is vital for our employees to 

keep themselves abreast of the latest industry 

developments and be future-ready. The yearly 

average training hours per employee stands at 32 

hours (FY2019: 35 hours) for our Operations staff 

and 11 hours (FY2019: 18 hours) at the Management 

level. Selected programs for upgrading employee

Performance and Career Development Review

In FY2020, all employees received their performance review in line with the Group’s policies. We 

encourage on-going and two-way communication between employees and their supervisor(s). 

This exercise allows the managers and employees to set expectations and address potential 

gaps in their performance. Regular and ad-hoc feedback are also given to employees. The 

practices in place to develop and improve employees’ performance have contributed to improve 

organisational performance. Furthermore, these practices allow the Group to monitor the 

skillsets of employees and to develop human capital within the organisation. 

For FY2020, the Group had aimed to maintain yearly average training hours per operation 

staff and management staff at 35 hours and 18 hours respectively. However, the Group was 

unable to maintain their training hours for local workforce as the number of opportunities 

for training was reduced due to Circuit Breaker and outsourced training providers was only 

able to provide online courses towards the end of the year. While the number of training 

hours increased for some subsidiaries such as Nation Human Resources Pte. Ltd. and Nation 

Employment Pte Ltd, majority of the other subsidiaries had postponed their training.

For FY2021, our aim is to achieve the target that was set for FY2020 being training hours of 

35 hours per operation staff and 18 hours per management staff.

LOCAL 

COMMUNITIES

While pursuing growth and development, we 

believe in giving back to the community. Where 

possible, the Group strive to engage in activities 

that promote positive impact. However, due 

to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group was 

unable to attend or hold any events as what 

have been done for the previous years.

During the financial year, the Group issued 

boxes of medical masks to all employees and 

also  gave out mask to customers and the 

public.

Ashtree also successfully secured a contract 

to provide security services at a COVID-19 

community care facility in Jurong East which 

is able to house up to 2,900 patients with mild 

symptoms. About one hundred security personnel 

were deployed round the clock to ensure the 

security protection plan was executed to the 

highest standards, which included actions to 

address incidents of trespass, medical and 

service delivery, medical evacuations, patient 

in-process and out-process. 

For FY2021, the Group’s target is to continue to 

have initiatives to build a better environment 

for FDWs and participate or contribute to 

more social events.

CUSTOMER 

PRIVACY

Personal Data Protection Act

Our materiality assessment has indicated that customer data privacy and protection is of 

paramount importance to our stakeholders, making this one of the material topics for AGL. 

We understand that with the advancement of technology, there is a growing trend of concerns 

for individuals on how their personal data are being collected, managed and used.

Data privacy and protection are key business 

challenges and the responsibility of the whole 

organisation. Our holistic management approach 

to legal compliance and operational management 

fosters a culture of awareness to respect and 

ensure the privacy of our stakeholders.

Customers’ data are stored in secure databases 

where we have established safeguards in place 

against impending IT security threats for instance, 

periodic change of passwords, installation of 

anti-virus and firewalls. These policies and 

procedures are disseminated to all employees 

and our operating entities in the Group. Every 

operational manager is expected to establish and 

implement the Group’s PDPA policy and monitor 

for compliance.

In FY2020, there were no substantiated complaints 

or any breaches or loss of customer data. Customers’ 

privacy is of utmost importance to our Group and 

we consistently monitor and update our PDPA 

policy in accordance with new requirements and 

business developments. For FY2021 and beyond, 

we target to continue achieving zero complaints 

and PDPA breaches on a yearly basis.
