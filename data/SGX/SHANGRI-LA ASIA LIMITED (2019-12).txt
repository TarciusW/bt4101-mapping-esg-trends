Sustainability Report

About Shangri-La

The name Shangri-La evokes images of a 

mythical, harmonious world; perfect and 

beautiful.

Our resorts and hotels are situated in some 

of the most pristine natural environments 

and some of the most vibrant urban centres 

around the world. In every place we do 

business, we aspire to live up to our name 

by providing stewardship for sustainable 

development.

We do this because we want to do right and it 

is the right thing to do.

Shangri-La Asia Limited (Shangri-La or the

limited liability. It is primarily listed on the 

Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX) with 

a secondary listing on the Stock Exchange of 

Singapore (SGX). We are governed by our

Welcome to our Sustainability Report 2019

• Scope of Sustainability Report

The scope of key performance data in 

this report includes 99 operating hotels 

that have been in operation for at least 

one full calendar year and the Aberdeen 

Marina Club in Hong Kong SAR. There 

has been a change in scope compared 

with our 2018 Responsible Business 

Report resulting from the closure of 

two hotels, namely Hotel Jen Brisbane, 

Australia and Shangri-La Hotel, Doha, 

Qatar. Our latest hotel, Shangri-La Hotel 

Suzhou Yuanqu, opened in Mainland 

China during the reporting period but 

In 2019, Shangri-La was listed on the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index and Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index. In addition 

to participating in the CDP Climate Change and Water Security surveys, we also subscribe to the UN Global Compact and have been 

recognised for our support of sustainable fisheries.

Shangri-La International Hotel 

Management Limited (SLIM), 

headquartered in Hong Kong SAR, is a 

wholly-owned subsidiary of Shangri-La. 

SLIM operates from Hong Kong SAR, 

Shanghai, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur and 

Singapore to provide management 

services for Shangri-La hotels worldwide 

under four hotel brands — Shangri-La, 

Kerry, JEN by Shangri-La, and Traders.

We are committed to disclosing meaningful 

and timely information about our 

Environmental, Social and Governance 

(ESG) performance and management 

approaches with focus on material 

environmental and social topics for our 

hotel management services. Increasingly, 

we aim to leverage technology for better 

communication with our stakeholders and 

to help reduce our carbon footprint, such 

as by producing this Sustainability Report 

in digital format. An executive summary 

highlighting our sustainability initiatives 

is available in the Responsible Business 

Section of our latest Annual Report.

has yet to complete a full year of 

operation. Development programmes, 

property rentals and property sales of 

the Group are not currently within the 

scope of our ESG disclosures.

Sustainability Report

This report complies with relevant 

provisions from HKEX Main Board Listing 

Rule 13.91 and ESG Reporting Guide. In 

line with international best practices, it 

has also been prepared with reference to 

GRI Standards from the Global Reporting 

Initiative. For more information, please refer 

to the HKEX ESG Content Index and GRI 

Content Index respectively at the end of this 

report.

• Sustainability in Shangri-La

Our approach to prioritising ESG 

issues is shaped by our stakeholders’ 

expectations and priorities for 

sustainable development. We seek 

feedback from our guests through 

satisfaction surveys, and we actively 

engage with our colleagues and local 

communities on an on-going basis. 

In addition to meeting regularly with 

investors and responding to their 

queries, we participate in external 

surveys such as the Dow Jones and 

Hang Seng Sustainability Indexes and 

CDP, which allow us to benchmark our 

performance with respect to local and 

international peers in the hospitality, real 

estate and other sectors.

The first comprehensive materiality 

assessment of our business was conducted 

in 2012, and in 2016 we interviewed a 

selection of our external stakeholders to 

ensure that the issues we had previously 

identified continued to be relevant. This 

year, we have updated our materiality 

assessment to reflect important 

internal developments arising from the 

introduction of our Integrated Assurance 

Framework (IAF) and Balanced Scorecard. 

We are also mindful of the consultation 

outcomes recently published by HKEX 

concerning the review of its ESG Reporting 

Guide and related listing rules.

Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality

Managing ESG Risks

Good corporate governance is integral to achieving sustainable, long-term value-creation 

through our business.

• Sound and effective systems of risk management and internal control are the cornerstone of 

corporate responsibility

Since December 2018, we have adopted an Integrated Assurance Framework (IAF) to support 

the Group’s strategic focus and growing business needs as well as to promote a responsible 

risk-management culture and develop a common language for risks and internal controls across 

all business units. Collectively, our four Lines of Defence (LODs) provide integrated assurance 

to the Board and Shareholders as follows: 1st LOD by Regions &amp; Hotels/Properties; 2nd LOD 

by Corporate Headquarters; 3rd LOD by our Integrated Audit Department and 4th LOD by our 

External Auditor.

The Group approaches risk-management through the IAF by applying the key principle of 

integrated assurance to ensure key operational risks of Safety &amp; Security, Legal, IT &amp; Cyber 

Security, Human Capital and Procurement are managed with clear accountability. We are 

committed to working progressively through the current and emerging material ESG issues 

facing our business in order to strengthen our commitment to ESG goals and objectives.

• Code of Conduct and Ethics

In all dealings with our guests, colleagues, business partners, shareholders and suppliers, the 

Group is committed to upholding the core values that define our reputation and brand, namely 

integrity, fairness, respect, ethical business conduct and excellence in service. The Group has in 

place a Code of Conduct and Ethics that reaffirms and promotes these values by setting out the 

standards required of our directors, officers and employees in the performance of their duties. 

The Group is committed to conducting its affairs in full compliance with all applicable laws, 

rules and regulations.

• Climate-related Risks

We constantly strive to better understand the impact of environmental and climate- 

related risks on our businesses in order to develop appropriate mitigation and adaptation 

measures. For more information please refer to our CDP Climate Change survey

response, which is updated annually.

• Procurement &amp; Supply Chain

Effective and responsible engagement with our suppliers is important for maintaining our 

competitive advantage and ensuring the quality of services we provide to our guests. It 

also allows us to leverage our influence and promote sustainable development of local 

communities in all places we do business.

We have a comprehensive Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC), which states our 

expectations with regard to legal and regulatory compliance, product safety and quality, 

business integrity and ethics, labour standards, the environment, anti-corruption, 

record-keeping, confidentiality, data protection and intellectual property rights. Our 

preference is always to do business with partners who go above and beyond our basic 

requirements in terms of environmentally and socially responsible behaviour.

In 2019, we are not aware of any 

instances of non-compliance with laws 

and regulations that have a significant 

bearing on the performance of the 

Group.

As a signatory to the UN Global Compact, 

the Group is committed to upholding 

fundamental human rights.

To ensure proper respect for human rights 

throughout our supply chain, we insist that 

our suppliers must implement fair, humane 

and non-discriminatory employment 

practices, treat their employees fairly, and 

respect diversity and inclusion. We do 

not condone any form of forced labour, 

including coerced, bonded, indentured or 

child labour; nor do we condone any form 

of slavery and/or human trafficking, or any 

contribution thereto.

Since 2010, we have banned shark 

fin from our Chinese restaurants 

and banquet menus. Our hotels 

source sustainable seafood 

products certified by the Marine 

Stewardship Council (MSC) and 

Aquaculture Stewardship Council 

(ASC). In 2019, the Group received 

MSC’s “Leadership in Sustainable 

Seafood Award” and Futian 

Shangri-La, Shenzhen received 

MSC’s “China Hotel of the Year 

Gold Award.”

Working Together to Make a Difference: Reducing Single-Use Plastics

In 2019, we implemented a group-

wide ban on plastic straws and stirrers, 

switched to glass bottled water for more 

venues and outlets, and introduced 

greener packaging for our in-room 

slippers. These initiatives are part of our 

overall plastic reduction roadmap, under 

which we plan to tackle many more 

items, including packaging for bathroom 

amenities, takeaway containers, utensils 

and more.

We are working closely with our suppliers 

to achieve the right balance. Our goal is to 

raise awareness and improve acceptance 

for reducing single-use plastics among 

our colleagues and guests, while investing 

in long-term alternative solutions that will 

not wcompromise our guest experience.

Our Guests

Sustainability is a collaborative effort.

• Everyone can help to protect our fragile planet; we strive to inform and educate our colleagues, 

guests and suppliers about best practices.

• We aim to do our best to make responsible choices and to encourage others – guests, colleagues 

and third parties – to do the same.

Our Balanced Scorecard is a strategic management tool for assessing the performance of 

our hotels in a holistic and transparent way with reference to measurable indicators that are 

quantified, benchmarked and aggregated. The scorecard system is designed to align our entire 

organisation behind a common set of key focus areas. It encourages both collaboration and 

personal accountability among our colleagues by rewarding them for teamwork as well as individual 

performance.

• Guest Experience

In order to ensure that all guests’ feedback receives the priority it deserves, we track 

measurements of guest satisfaction through our Balanced Scorecard and link them directly 

to regular performance reviews of our colleagues.

Since 2018, we have implemented TrustYou, which is an independent comprehensive 

feedback measuring tool designed to help us evaluate guest satisfaction dynamically. It 

combines internal and external ratings data with an evaluation of our hotels’ performance 

relative to competitors in each market. Our Post-Stay Guest Survey gathers information 

from guests on their Overall Stay Experience (OSE), which feeds into each hotel’s TrustYou 

CompIndex score. Regular feedback to the hotels about their scores on key drivers for OSE 

provides useful insight for our colleagues to design and implement new initiatives that will 

continually enhance guest experience.

• Safety and Security

The safety and wellbeing of our guests and colleagues is our highest priority. We strive to 

continually enhance security standards throughout our fast-expanding portfolio of properties and 

hotels.

Shangri-La has a number of policies in place concerning guest security, including but not 

limited to conflict resolution, crime, medical emergencies and emergency evacuations. Our 

Corporate Security Division is responsible for implementing these policies in line with our 

values and commitment to protecting human rights.

Cross-functional emergency response teams are on duty in our hotels 24 hours a day, 7 

days a week. Each hotel undergoes an annual security audit to ensure that the Group’s 

standard operating and emergency response procedures are robust and well understood. 

Together with our Group Business Continuity Plan, these procedures help to guarantee the 

highest standards of safety and security for our guests, colleagues and visitors. We also 

have a group-wide Security and Safety Reporting System (SSRS) in place to facilitate timely 

reporting and management of every incident.

Earning and donating green points through 

“Shangri-La Ant Forest” will help combat 

deforestation in mainland China 



We are the first hospitality group to launch 

on Alipay Ant Forest, a new app available 

from China’s leading payment and lifestyle 

platform. This latest environmental 

protection campaign brings together all 

50 Shangri-La hotels in mainland China to 

encourage daily participation from guests, 

colleagues and local communities under 

the banner of Shangri-La’s “Race for Hope” 

programme.

Achieving Shared Goals: “Race for Hope”

Everyone is invited to earn and donate 

points by participating in eco-friendly 

activities, such as walking or using public 

transport. The points are converted into 

real trees that are planted and nurtured by 

local NGOs to help combat deforestation in 

vulnerable regions across China. With just 

a few simple steps on Alipay, we can all 

help to protect the planet.

fun-run competitions. On 1st December, 

over 700 people participated in our 

family-friendly 5km race and 2km fun-run at

Our People

• At Shangri-La, we strive to attract and retain talented people who are a good fit for our corporate 

culture.

• We promote a fair and inclusive workplace where all colleagues treat each other with courtesy and 

respect; we empower everyone to pursue their personal and professional goals.

• Fire Life Safety

Shangri-La’s standards for Fire Life Safety (FLS) reference the USA National Fire Protection 

Association’s regulations, China Green Building codes and other relevant codes for the 

countries in which we operate. At least one dedicated FLS manager is appointed in each 

hotel with responsibility for monitoring and maintaining our FLS systems. All hotels are 

subject to FLS Audits at least once a year to verify their compliance with the Group’s 

standards and procedures.

In April 2019, we hosted a group-wide fire drill and evacuation exercise to strengthen our safety 

culture and prepare our colleagues to handle any emergency situation. Many of our hotels 

conducted fire drills and safety training activities in collaboration with local fire departments and 

civil defence forces.

Our Code of Conduct and Ethics 

sets out the standards we expect 

every employee to uphold. We have 

a whistleblowing and whistle-blower 

protection policy in place to support 

anyone who comes forward with a 

query or complaint.

• Human Capital

Under our IAF, the Group risk category of Human Capital encompasses a number of material 

issues for our hotels, ranging from corporate culture, succession planning, talent acquisition 

&amp; retention, and training &amp; development, to employee engagement, payroll, absenteeism 

and health &amp; safety. Considering the global nature of our operations, there are also 

significant legal, regulatory and compliance implications associated with human resource 

management in our hotels.

We are committed to ensuring that our workplaces embrace diversity and are free from 

discrimination on the basis of gender, race, religion, disability, marital status, sexual 

orientation, family status or any other personal characteristics. We do not condone 

harassment or any form of conduct that may cause our colleagues to feel embarrassed or 

uncomfortable at work.

Leveraging the Power of the Digital Age: Shangri-La Academy Online

2019 was a year of transformation for 

learning with the introduction of Shangri-La 

Academy Online. This bespoke virtual 

platform facilitates learning anytime and 

anywhere; providing our colleagues with 

dynamic, engaging and relevant content that 

they can review at their own pace.

The content is organised into:

• Essential Learning – to know more 

about our brand, or comply with legal 

requirements

• Functional Learning – to enhance skills 

based on job functions

• Leadership Learning – to develop high 

potentials in line with our Leadership 

Competencies

Hotel Jen Tanglin Singapore was selected to 

pilot the new system early in 2019.

Zul is the Fire Life Safety (FLS) Manager at 

Hotel Jen Tanglin Singapore. As a former 

Singapore Civil Defence Force Fire fighter 

and officer, he has extensive experience 

conveying important knowledge and skills 

about FLS.

According to Zul, the best thing about 

Shangri-La Academy Online’s new Global 

Fire Life Safety e-learning course is that it 

empowers his colleagues to take charge of 

their own learning process.

Alice from Housekeeping has worked 

at Hotel Jen Tanglin Singapore since 

2013. She was one of our first colleagues 

worldwide to complete all essential 

learning courses via Shangri-La Academy.

At first, Alice found it challenging to 

adjust to the new way of learning but she 

quickly got up to speed and now goes 

online daily to keep herself updated on all 

the latest content.

Shangri-La Academy 

(since 2004)

Goal: To build up the capability of all hotels to roll out digital learning

Features:

• &gt; 100 e-learning programmes in the pipeline for 2020

Nurturing Talent

Goal: To actively implement talent review and succession planning processes

Features:

• Leadership teams are responsible for identifying and stewarding the development of high potentials in each 

hotel

• Leadership development programmes are offered to our colleagues at various management levels

• Learning &amp; Development

We foster a culture of active learning throughout our organisation. Every hotel, regional 

and corporate office has an annual budget amounting to 2% of payroll cost for learning 

and development initiatives, including essential, functional and leadership programmes, 

subscriptions for digital content from the Shangri-La Academy Learning Management 

System, on-the-job learning, and participation in internal or external workshops.

We strive to ensure that all learning is relevant and effective. In addition to using 

e-assessment to validate colleagues’ experiences, we collect data from participants for 

course evaluation. To ensure consistency across the Group, our hotels maintain complete 

records of learning and development activities for all colleagues, which are subject to 

regular audits by our Corporate HR division.

Blended Learning

Culture of Learning

• Critical essential learning programmes – such as Fire Life Safety – are delivered in a 

“blended” format.

• This means learners first complete an online course to gain theoretical knowledge.

• Then they put their knowledge into practice during facilitated sessions under the guidance 

of a Fire Life Safety Manager. For example, using a fire extinguisher or a fire blanket in 

real-life settings.

• After completing the course, there is constant reinforcement of learning through regular 

drills and exercises.

• Some hotels also implement a buddy system, whereby experienced colleagues are assigned 

to support those who have less experience in acquiring new skills.

• Occupational Health &amp; Safety

Safeguarding the health and safety of employees and others with whom we work is a 

top priority. We ensure that every hotel has an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 

management system in place to: identify potential health and safety hazards in the 

workplace; implement plans and procedures to control these hazards; and, regularly review 

and revise those plans in order to achieve continuous improvement in OHS performance. 

The Group’s OHS Implementation Manual provides guidance to hotels on how to prepare 

and implement OHS Management Systems in accordance with internationally recognised 

standards such as OHSAS 18001.

Our hotels conduct regular assessments to ensure that all OHS training needs have 

been identified and fulfilled, particularly for new and less-experienced colleagues. In 

addition, multiple learning resources covering OHS knowledge and skills are available from 

Shangri-La Academy Online.

Security measures across all properties continue to be reviewed to reflect any change in the 

risk environment. These measures reflect each country’s risk assessment as determined by 

independent agencies and ratings from international experts.

Shangri-La’s Security and Safety Reporting System tracks data on accidents. We combat the 

spread of infectious diseases through training and information briefings for our colleagues.

Lighting a traditional oil lamp in memory of 

the victims

On 21 April, Shangri-La Hotel Colombo was one of three luxury hotels among several other 

sites targeted in a series of terrorist bombings that rocked Sri Lanka. Although the tragedy 

caused untold pain and suffering for many, our global Shangri-La family came together during 

this difficult time to provide comfort and support.

In November, Shangri-La Hotel Colombo unveiled a Memorial Garden in honour of the people 

who lost their lives during this tragic event.

It has partnered with the Dialog Foundation, a local non-profit organisation, to provide 

long-term educational support for children from affected communities.

In the aftermath of this attack, the Group has supported various charitable events, foundations 

and memorial funds established by the families of some of the victims.

• Employee Experience

We are focused on creating a nurturing environment where our people can grow and thrive.

We strive to support our colleagues to achieve their personal and professional goals. In 

2019, we conducted a group-wide Employee Experience Programme Survey complemented 

by focus group sessions in which our colleagues were encouraged to co-own any problems 

they are experiencing at work and to find solutions collectively.

Shangri-La Asia Limited Sustainability Report 2019

Sustainability Report

• Energy

In addition to purchased electricity, chilled water and steam, our hotels consume fossil 

fuels for heating and standby electricity generation as well as for cooking. Combustion of 

fossil fuels results in some local air emissions, namely NOx, SOx and Particulate Matter 

(PM).

• Water

Water accounts for a significant portion of our hotels’ utility bills, with many paying not 

only to purchase fresh water but also to dispose of wastewater. To ensure compliance with 

local regulations and provide data for accurate calculation of Scope 1 GHG emissions, the 

Group monitors Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) content of effluents from all hotels.

Since water is a scarce resource in many places around the world, our hotels have a 

responsibility not to consume more than necessary. We work hard to mitigate our impact 

on the availability of freshwater in ecologically sensitive regions. For example, our resorts 

in Boracay, Cebu, the Maldives, Mauritius and Yangon operate desalination plants using 

groundwater or seawater to produce freshwater for consumption. Furthermore, our 

resorts in the Sultanate of Oman, Maldives and Mauritius produce recycled water for 

irrigation, washing of external surfaces and other suitable purposes.

“Water stress” refers to the ability, or lack thereof, of local ecosystems to meet human 

and ecological demand for water. It occurs when demand exceeds supply during a certain 

period, or when poor water quality restricts its use. At Shangri-La, we use the Aqueduct 

Water Risk Atlas developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) to identify which of 

our hotels are located in areas experiencing “High” or “Extremely High” levels of water 

stress. These areas include North, East and West China, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, the 

Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, India, Mongolia and 

Turkey.

We participate in CDP’s questionnaires 

on climate change and water security 

annually to help us manage our 

environmental risks and opportunities, 

and provide useful information to our 

stakeholders. For more information, 

please refer to our most recent 

questionnaires on the CDP website.

• Performance against Targets

We have targets in place to reduce our environmental footprints for energy, water and 

carbon by 15% in 2020 compared with 20152. This goal has challenged our hotels to reduce 

the energy, water and carbon intensities of their operations by 3% per year on average.

Between 2015 and 2019, the number of properties included in the scope of our performance 

evaluation increased from 85 to 100. These charts show the average performance of all 

properties compared with desired reduction trends over this period. The energy, water and 

carbon intensities of our portfolio decreased by 10.0%, 3.6% and 8.9%, respectively.

• Biodiversity and Conservation

Shangri-La is proud to operate hotels in some of the most beautiful and ecologically diverse 

regions of the world. We are committed to conserving and protecting the biodiversity of 

these areas for present and future generations to enjoy. Through Sanctuary, Shangri-La’s 

Care for Nature project, 15 hotels have formed partnerships with local experts to leverage 

specialised knowledge and skills. Many of these hotels support Shangri-La Eco Centres, 

which seek to engage with colleagues, guests and locals about conservation through 

interactive learning experiences and other educational activities. In 2019, we invested 

USD103,000 on our Sanctuary projects.

Our hotels strive to continually improve their environmental performance. Many have 

implemented energy and water saving technologies and initiatives to reduce consumption of 

precious resources. Some hotels are producing renewable energy for hot water or electricity 

using photovoltaics.

In June 2019, Shangri-La Mactan, Cebu launched the 

first-of-its-kind Shangri-La Eco-trail; a stunning nature 

route that showcases endemic, medicinal, rare and 

endangered plants across all 13-hectares of the resort.

Guests can spot notable endemic plants including 

the Cebu Cinnamon, a rare tree discovered in the 

1980s, and the Cynometra Cebuensis, an endangered 

flowering plant recently discovered in the Tabuan 

forest. Both plants are unique to Cebu.



Visitors on the Eco-trail

Shangri-La Mactan, Cebu also has its own six-hectare marine protected area situated in 

front of its white sand beach. Established in 2007, the resort’s Sanctuary Care for Reef 

Project has a successful track record of helping to propagate a rich diversity of marine 

life while promoting sustainable livelihoods for local residents and fostering a culture of 

environmental stewardship among guests, colleagues and the local community alike.

Our Community

We are proud to be part of the local community in every place we call home.

• 

We work collaboratively to benefit local people by helping to promote their produce and protect 

their culture.

• 

We thrive when our communities do too.

We actively embed the ownership of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives within 

the management and culture of our hotels. In accordance with our Balanced Scorecard 

approach, we encourage each hotel to identify their local stakeholders and to determine the 

nature of their CSR programmes in relation to local needs.

“Waste not, want not”: Serving Food with Purpose

Food waste has been described as one of the biggest problems facing mankind today. To tackle 

this important issue, our hotels are actively exploring creative ways to reduce food waste and 

encourage our guests and colleagues to make more sustainable choices.

Shangri-La at the Fort, Manila, for example, has implemented a zero food waste programme in 

Bake House – its new sustainable cake shop and bakery. One of its innovative creations is the 

“Conscious Cookie”, a delicious biscuit baked from the trims and excess ingredients of other 

pastries.

In May, our hotels in the Middle East, India and the Indian Ocean came together during 

the period of Ramadan to raise awareness about global hunger. Ramadan is traditionally a 

time for families and friends to share Iftar – the meal enjoyed by Muslims after sunset to 

break their fast. A portion of proceeds from Iftar meals served in our hotels were donated to 

ShareTheMeal (a digital application of the United Nations World Food Programme) in order to 

help children-in-need.

In 2019, the reported amount of non-hazardous waste sent to landfills by our hotels declined 

by nearly one fifth compared with the previous year. This category of waste includes food, 

paper and cardboard, plastics, metals, glass and garden waste. We recognise that some of 

our hotels still experience great difficulty in monitoring and collecting reliable data for their 

waste disposal. They do their best to take actual measurements or make estimations based on 

volume when weight data is not available.

• Waste

Disposing of waste into landfills can cause serious problems for local communities. 

Some waste will eventually decompose, but not all, and in the process it may smell, or generate 

methane gas, which is explosive and contributes to global warming. Leachate from landfill sites 

can also threaten local surface water and groundwater sources.

Our hotels strive to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills through waste 

prevention and recycling. To avoid unnecessary paper waste for example, 91 hotels have 

implemented paperless check-in. At the same time, our recycling partnerships with key group 

suppliers and NGO partners continue to grow.

Food waste is our most significant sub-category of waste, accounting for nearly half (45%) of 

total non-hazardous waste by weight. Our hotels are taking primary steps to avoid food waste 

at source through appropriate planning, storage and handling, as well as secondary steps 

to recycle unavoidable food waste through food donations and composting. The efficacy of 

these measures is borne out in our data for waste sent to landfill and waste diverted in 2019

Our hotels form long-standing partnerships with their local communities to promote health, 

wellbeing and/or education through Embrace, Shangri-La’s Care for People Project.

Established in 2009, one of the key purposes of this programme is to foster a sense of 

responsibility from each hotel towards its community by identifying and responding to local 

needs in the form of financing, infrastructure and facilities, or labour and skills. Most of our 

hotels have chosen to work with children and young adults – particularly people with special 

needs – by increasing their access to education and skills development opportunities. Other 

hotels invest in health services, such as surgeries and cancer treatments, for those who would 

otherwise have no access to life-saving care.

Introduced in 2012, Embrace ++ 

encourages our hotels to provide skills 

training to less fortunate members of 

their communities with a view to helping 

them gain permanent employment at 

Shangri- La.

At Shangri-La’s Tanjung Aru Resort &amp; Spa, our colleagues are helping to create opportunities for 

students at SK Bantanyan School, which is attended by children of the indigenous Kadazan 

community living on the outskirts of Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia.

When our partnership started four years ago, the school ranked 54/58 in the district but it has 

since risen to 27. In 2019, all graduating students from the primary school were successfully 

enrolled into secondary education.

Over the years, our colleagues have worked hard to improve the school’s infrastructure by 

building toilets and fixing classrooms. They have also introduced “Meal a Day” and “English 

Booster” programmes to ensure all students have access to adequate nutrition and learning 

support.

In 2019, SK Bantanyan School partnered with the local Jesselton Philharmonic Orchestra 

to create the first school orchestra in Sabah. With our hotel’s support, 28 students had the 

opportunity to expand their horizons and to enter a whole new world of music.
