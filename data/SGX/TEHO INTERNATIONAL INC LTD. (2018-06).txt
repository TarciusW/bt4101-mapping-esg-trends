About this Report 

 

TEHO International Inc Ltd (“TEHO” or “the Group”) presents our inaugural sustainability report. This 

report allows for TEHO’s stakeholders to have a better understanding of TEHO’s strategy as well as the 

incorporation of sustainability within our business. 

Report Scope 

The report covers the period 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018 (“FY2018”). The content of this report will 

focus on the sustainability performance, activities and initiatives that are under our direct control in 

Singapore since our head office is in Singapore and we derive more than half of our revenue from 

Singapore. Material issues and topics described in this report have been selected according to their 

level of significance within the company boundaries, the sustainability context and the expectations of 

the stakeholders. In this respect, this report covers our business in the Marine &amp; Offshore Segment as 

our material operational boundary in Singapore. All material aspects disclosed in this report are relevant 

to the activities in Singapore only.  

While we start with activities in Singapore in our inaugural sustainability report, we will continue to 

improve as we embark on our sustainability reporting journey. TEHO plans to publish its sustainability 

report annually. 

Report Methodology 

This report has been prepared in alignment with the requirements of Rules 711A and 711B of the Listing 

Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the “SGX-ST”) 

(the “Catalist Rules”), using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards as a guide, since it is a well-

known and globally recognised sustainability reporting framework.  

This report is also developed in accordance with the SGX-ST “comply or explain” requirements of 

primary components of a sustainability report. As we embark on our sustainability reporting journey 

with the publication of our first sustainability report, we will continue to improve on our sustainability 

reporting processes. 

We did not seek external assurance for this report.

Board Statement 

 

The Board of Directors (“the Board”) is pleased to present TEHO’s first sustainability report which 

captures our commitment to sustainability and our sustainability performance throughout FY2018.  

Our strengths are our technical expertise, robust inventory, high service level, value pricing and global 

network and TEHO recognises the importance of keeping abreast of changes and developments in the 

industry in order to stay competitive in a dynamic market. Consideration of how environmental, social 

and governance (“ESG”) issues may affect our success is an important part of a holistic business 

strategy. Therefore, for FY2018, management has identified and considered ESG factors as well as 

opportunities and risks in relation to the Group’s sustainability practices through stakeholder 

engagement and a materiality assessment process which is presented in this report. The Board oversees 

the management and monitoring of these factors and takes them into consideration in the 

determination of the Group’s strategic direction and policies. 

Through this report, we invite you to learn more about our sustainability journey as well as our 

endeavours for the year while creating value for our shareholders and stakeholders.

Corporate Profile 

 

Vision and Mission 

Our vision is to be a leading and trusted key supplier for the marine and offshore oil &amp; gas industries. 

Our mission is to build a company that is recognised internationally as a dependable key supplier and 

servicing different customers in various major ports of the world.  

Values 

Description 

Co-operation 

We embrace openness and differences of opinions and are committed to work as a team to 

fulfil our mission. 

 

Respect 

We treat everyone, from colleagues to customers and suppliers, with dignity and respect, 

regardless of one’s position in the company. 

Excellence 

Our competitive edge is not just on price, but also service, quality and confidence level. 

Development 

We are committed to constantly develop ourselves, personally and professionally. 

 

Sustainability Governance 

In order to best manage ESG related risks, opportunities and performance, TEHO has formulated a 

sustainability governance structure where the Board incorporates sustainability issues as part of the 

company’s strategic formulation. The Board is also responsible in approving, managing and monitoring 

ESG factors that are material to the business, strategy, business model and key stakeholders.  

 

Ethics and Compliance  

Being a listed company on the SGX-ST, we strive to adopt the standards of corporate governance as 

required in the listing rules. We conform to local and international practices. Our corporate governance 

framework covers ethics and compliance through a Code of Conduct as well as action guidelines which 

are to be adhered by the officers and employees across the organization. Every new employee is 

introduced to our Code of Conduct and our policies on ethics and compliances. Communication 

channels, such as Fraud and Whistle-Blower process, are in place to enable all employees and 

individuals to report complaints of unethical behaviour.  

 

Stakeholder Engagement 

TEHO undertakes a proactive approach in engaging its stakeholders – both internal and external – via 

various channels in order to identify and understand issues relevant to them. We recognise that our 

stakeholders are core to our business operations, hence effective collaboration with them is crucial. 

We have identified our stakeholders based on their relevance and importance to TEHO and our 

business.  

We engage with our shareholders at least once a year through Annual General Meetings. We provide 

timely announcements and press releases via SGXNet and our company’s website.  

The quality and safety of our services and products to our customers are the core focuses of our 

commitments. Through our quality and safety commitments to our customers, we will, in turn, be 


5 

 

contributing to their own sustainable development. To effectively and meaningfully implement our 

sustainability agenda, it is important that our suppliers share our values in their business practices in 

areas such as the environment, labour practices and corporate ethics.  

We believe that an ethical and professional working environment is crucial in cultivating a corporate 

culture which motivates and empowers our employees to meet their full potential both professionally 

and personally. We conduct training of employees on critical skillsets to sustain competitiveness. We 

maintain employee well-being and engagement through organising workplace health and safety 

activities.  

 

Materiality Assessment 

TEHO conducted a materiality assessment to identify, prioritise and validate ESG factors that were 

material to the business as well as its stakeholders. Under the guidance of an independent external 

consultant, background research was conducted to identify ESG factors that were relevant to TEHO. 

The research includes publications from industry peers and best practices, reporting frameworks and 

related sector-specific guidance as well as local and global emerging sustainability trends.  

Representatives from various business areas took part in a questionnaire which reflected their views 

on ESG factors relevant to TEHO. They were also involved in the materiality exercise, and were required 

to participate in a workshop which prioritised the list of ESG factors.  

TEHO’s top material ESG factors were then identified and are presented in the table below.

Product Quality 

 

Product safety 

At TEHO, we strive to be a leading and trusted key supplier in the industry. We are committed to 

providing the best for our customers through our technical expertise. Being able to provide quality 

products and services ensures that we are able to help our customers meet their business needs.  

Maintaining the quality of our products is important to us, thus we ensure appropriate consideration 

of technical and customer requirements in our material selection and product design. Some of these 

considerations include how to reduce the use of hazardous substances, ensure compliance with 

relevant laws and regulations, safeguard the health and safety of the end user, and reduce any 

environmental impacts during product manufacturing and use. 

Managing Health and Safety impacts of products 

TEHO’s relationships with its customers are forged on a strong foundation of trust. We are committed 

to safety and quality, and constantly work towards ensuring the health and safety of our end users by 

enabling the effective and safe use of our products.  

TEHO has in place a thorough assurance process to monitor our policies and performance. These 

include the following: 

➢ Bi-annual internal quality audits to ensure performance in compliance with ISO quality 

management standards 

➢ Bi-annual external quality audits conducted by Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance, provider of 

ISO certification 

➢ TEHO ensures that all findings and issues highlighted from these audits are properly addressed 

and monitored. 

➢ Corrective Action Request (CAR) and Supplier Corrective Action Request (SCAR) processes to 

manage corrective actions towards non-conformity in quality standards, both internally and 

externally. 

In relation to TEHO’s commitment to safety, TEHO is the first and only local supplier to attain the 

qualification to issue DNV GL’s Certificate of Test and Thorough Examination of Wire Ropes, endorsing 

TEHO as a company capable of independent assembly and testing of wire ropes. We are working on 

developing a rope prototype with in-house finishing to produce a product with improved longevity and 

safety during use.   

Managing environmental impacts of our products 

TEHO is compliant with the Environmental Protection and Management (Hazardous Substance) 

Regulations and the Environmental Approved Lubricant (EAL) in accordance to US EPA 2013 Vessel 

General Permit (VGP). We also encourage responsible end-of-life treatment of the materials found in 

our products and packaging. Some of our products are also designed to enable recycling or disposal in 

a manner which would not harm the environment. We engage an external party to recycle scrap metal, 

paper, cardboard and plastic water bottles from our offices and warehouses. Packaging material such 

as wooden drums and pallets are reused for alternate purposes. 

 


7 

 

TEHO has implemented several initiatives that increase safety and/or reduce environmental impacts of 

the Group’s products: 

Initiative 

Measure 

Ensuring that all materials are free from asbestos, as the inhalation of 

asbestos fibres has been found to cause serious diseases such as lung 

cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis.  

 

We require our suppliers to declare 

that all materials supplied do not 

contain asbestos. 

TEHO is conducting customer trials with a rope made of aramid fibre – 

a material used in car tyres but also suitable for mooring ropes in a 

marine environment. Apart from being resistant to high temperature, 

these ropes are also recyclable, i.e. yarn can be reused in different 

applications such as safety barriers. 

 

TEHO is promoting this new type of 

rope for its operational and 

environmental benefits. 

We were the first in the local market to promote and sell an 

environmentally acceptable lubricant (EAL) for wire ropes which has 

been specifically formulated to be biodegradable and minimally toxic, 

while still meeting the rigorous demands of industrial applications 

 

TEHO will continue to promote and 

sell EAL. 

 

Performance and targets 

This year is our first year of reporting the performance. As of FY2018, there were no reported incidents 

of health and safety issues relating to our products. In subsequent years, we will monitor this 

performance indicator and evaluate the suitability of other performance indicators. 

Supplier Assessment 

Supply chain management is an important aspect in our efforts to address the sustainability concerns 

of our business activities. We recognise that our stakeholders may be indirectly impacted by the 

business partners whom we choose to collaborate with.  

TEHO has an extensive supplier base. With our operations spanning across Asia, the Middle East, Europe 

and Latin America, we work with a variety of suppliers to ensure the availability of quality products 

worldwide. These suppliers serve as an extension of our global network. We foster good working 

relationships with our suppliers and cooperate to ensure consistent quality standards and responsible 

business practices.   

TEHO adopts a structured approach to supplier selection and the initiation of due diligence in the 

development of a new relationship with a supplier. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Selection and Evaluation of Suppliers 

All suppliers are evaluated based on their ability to meet the 

company requirements for quality purposes. If found 

suitable, the suppliers will be included in the approved 

supplier list. The requirements for the suppliers are as 

follows: 

✓ The company is established 

✓ Able to deliver the goods 

✓ Reliability and responsiveness 

✓ Competitive pricing 

✓ Able to meet specifications and standards 

 


8 

 

 

Our supplier requirements address issues relating to quality, legal compliance, and product-specific 

requirements. Our final decision on supplier selection is based on overall assessment which takes a 

balanced view of all selection criteria.  

In addition to our evaluation of suppliers, we also practice supplier due diligence as part of our 

procurement policy. Our current supplier due diligence process is currently being enhanced to further 

integrate sustainability into our supply chain management. 

As part of our review process, we engage our key suppliers and communicate our expectations and 

feedback to ensure alignment of our key suppliers’ services and products to our business requirements 

and sustainability objectives through continuous improvement in our collaboration.  

Performance and targets 

This year is our first year of reporting the performance. As of FY2018, the key suppliers screened for 

sustainability criteria is nil. In subsequent years, we will monitor this performance indicator and 

evaluate the suitability of other performance indicators.

Our People 

 

Employment 

 

Our people drive the success of our business and are of utmost importance to TEHO. We aim to build 

and maintain a strong and cohesive workforce. We have invested our efforts in rewarding our 

employees with fair and attractive remuneration and benefits, and engaging with them on a regular 

basis to involve them in the Group’s strategic decisions and promote employee wellbeing. 

Our Human Resource Policy contains our Code of Ethics and covers topics such as talent recruitment, 

compensation and benefits, and learning and development. It is made available to all employees via the 

staff intranet and Employee Handbook. TEHO is also in compliance with the Singapore Ministry of 

Manpower laws and regulations, such as the Employment Act, Employment of Foreign Manpower Act 

and Retirement and Re-employment Act.  

TEHO constantly engages with its employees and encourages bottom-up feedback so as to improve on 

its human resource management. We adopt an open-door office and office policy to encourage 

employees to voice out areas of concern through confidential discussions with senior management 

(including the CEO). TEHO also conducted an Employee Satisfaction Survey to collect employee 

feedback on issues related to work environment, management, learning and development and 

wellbeing at work. In 2016, we introduced suggestion boxes in the office and warehouses as an 

additional means to gather employee feedback.  

TEHO has in place several initiatives centred around three pillars – rewarding employees, ensuring 

wellbeing and engaging employees – for our employees. We recognise the importance of our 

employees and that their motivation and wellbeing will affect their work.  

Rewarding Employees 

Employee remuneration is determined based on local market rates and in accordance with local 

regulations and guidelines. We ensure that we comply with minimum wage requirements throughout 

our operations worldwide.   

We adopt a pay-for-performance framework and compensate our employees based on their level of 

qualification and performance. We believe this drives individual ownership of Group performance and 

creates long-term shareholder value.   

We aim to provide employee benefits beyond the statutory requirements. Seeing that our workforce 

comprises individuals of a diverse range of nationalities, we also try to reduce the gap in the type and 

range of benefits that are available to our Singaporean and foreign employees. 

Ensuring Wellbeing 

We are committed to the welfare of our workforce and make efforts to build strong cohesive teams 

with camaraderie amongst employees.  

Every year, TEHO organises a Christmas dinner gathering and also distributes vouchers and red packets 

during the Chinese New Year festive season. Employees are also given gift vouchers for the birth of 

child, marriage, hospitalisation, bereavement and staff retirement.  


10 

 

Engaging Employees 

We regularly involve our employees in strategic planning and conduct various engagement initiatives 

throughout the year to enhance communication between management and staff.  

The Group has conducted Annual International Co-ordination Meetings since the incorporation of TEHO 

Europe in 2013. Workshops are held to discuss operational and commercial issues with key employees 

from overseas subsidiaries.  

In FY2017, TEHO Singapore conducted a two-day strategic planning retreat involving managerial staff 

across various functions. Participants re-examined and re-defined TEHO’s Vision, Mission, Core Values 

and Strategic Thrusts. They also developed strategic goals and action plans. Going forward, we plan to 

further integrate ESG topics in our discussions.  

A benchmarking workshop was held to communicate TEHO’s strategic plans to its employees.  

In January 2017, we achieved the Business Excellence (BE) certification as a testament to our 

management system and processes. 

Performance and targets 

During the year, TEHO saw an increase in new employee hires from 12 new hires in FY2017 to 16 new 

hires in FY2018, this was an increase in annual new hire rate from 14% to 19%. On the other hand, 

TEHO saw no change in employee turnover from 19 in FY2017, to 19 in FY2018, therefore, the annual 

turnover rate remained at 22% each year.

Diversity and Equal Opportunity 

 

TEHO’s human resource policies are grounded on equal opportunities and fair employment practices. 

We believe that a fair and inclusive workplace helps our employees perform to their full potential. Our 

operations are enriched by the exchange of knowledge and expertise that comes with a healthy and 

diverse workforce. 

TEHO does not condone any form of harassment or unlawful discrimination in the recruitment, 

retention, and development of our employees. All opportunities for advancement and promotion are 

provided purely based on merit.  

We subscribe to the five principles of the Fair Employment Practices outlined in the Tripartite 

Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP):  

a. Recruit and select on the basis of merit (such as skills, experience or ability to perform the 

job) regardless of age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or 

disability.  

b. Treat your employees fairly and with respect and put in place progressive human resource 

management systems.  

c. Provide employees with equal opportunities to be considered for training and 

development based on their strengths and needs, to help them achieve their full potential.  

d. Reward your employees fairly based on their ability, performance, contribution and 

experience.  

e. Comply with the labour laws and abide by the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment 

Practices.  

TEHO is committed to building a diverse and collegiate culture on the Board. As such, the Board’s 

diversity policy describes that in examining the Board composition and succession planning, the Board 

will consider balancing the benefits of all aspects of diversity, including diversity of skills, experience, 

knowledge, gender and other relevant factors. The Board is of the view that the current composition 

does facilitate effective decision-making. All director appointments are based on meritocracy with the 

objective of forming an effective board. In relation to gender diversity, the Board does not preclude the 

selection of female candidates for director appointments. While the Board recognises the emerging 

target of Singapore’s Diversity Action Committee of having at least 30 per cent female representation 

on boards of Singapore listed companies, the Board’s collective view is that it should not be the main 

selection criteria and that board appointments, based on the right blend of skills, experience relevant 

to the Group’s business and ability to contribute effectively, should remain a priority. Thus far, TEHO 

has maintained 40% of its Board or 2 out of 5 directors, to be females. 

Performance and targets 

In FY2018, TEHO’s workforce consisted of 38% females and 63% males across the three companies. In 

FY2017, 100% of employees were permanent employees, and this remained the same in FY2018 as 

well.

TEHO is proud to have employees from different nationalities such as Singaporean, Malaysian, 

Burmese, Chinese, Indian and Belgian. TEHO does not discriminate against aged employees and values 

the commitment and experience which they bring to the Group. There is no clause within the Group’s 

human resource policies which prescribe employee termination based solely on age, and employees 

who reach the local statutory retirement age are not subject to revisions of their employee contracts.  

We did not have a significant portion of our activities performed by workers who are not employees in 

FY2018. We intend to continue to employ fair recruitment practices with no preference for any 

particular age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disabilities.

Training and Education 

 

We recognise that investing in our people is the key to sustaining excellent service quality. We 

constantly strive to enrich the skills of our employees and encourage personal development. TEHO 

mandates in-house training for all new employees as part of the employee orientation process. In 

addition, the Human Resource department maintains a training log to record the trainings attended by 

each employee. Supervisors and employers may refer to this log to identify their training gaps or needs.   

TEHO also conducts external and in-house staff training programmes which aim to develop employees’ 

management and maritime skills, operational excellence, and promote a proactive attitude towards 

workplace health and safety and environmental conservation. All training materials are widely available 

to employees via the internal company server. Some of these trainings include product training, rigger 

and signal course and Excel. Employees are also encouraged to sign up for courses conducted by the 

NTUC Learning Hub or the Singapore National Employers Federation, or any other relevant courses.  

With regard to employee development, all employees participate in an annual appraisal exercise where 

supervisors review and provide feedback on their performance and career progression. Leadership 

development programmes are also provided for employees.  

Performance and targets 

The table below presents the number of hours of training that our employees received by gender and 

employee category. The average number of hours of training in FY2017 was higher than that in FY2018 

because of additional training conducted as part of the Business Excellence workshops in FY2017.

Occupational Health and Safety 

 

Ensuring the health and safety of employees is our top priority. Our employees might be exposed to 

workplace hazards in our day to day operations. As a responsible employer, TEHO recognises its 

obligation to address and mitigate these risks where possible, thereby creating a zero-accident 

workplace environment for its employees. 

TEHO has in place an internal Occupational Health and Safety Policy which aims at creating a healthy 

and safe working environment for our employees. We are also a member of the Workplace Health and 

Safety Council to promote acceptable WSH practices and raise WSH standards in Singapore. TEHO 

encourages all employees to be proactive towards ensuring health and safety within the workplace.    

TEHO is in compliance with the Ministry of Manpower’s Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) 

requirements, including the following: 

➢ Workplace Health and Safety Act 

➢ Work injury compensation  

➢ Work accident reporting 

➢ Workplace safety and health training  

➢ Requirements for a safety and health management system 

 

Through our efforts, TRSPL has attained bizSAFE Level 3 certification for workplace health and safety. 

This signifies that top management is committed to continuously monitor HSE matters and develop 

practices to enable the effective management of HSE performance.  

 

 

Performance and targets 

During the year, there were 2 injuries. There were no workplace fatalities in FY2017 and FY2018.We 

intend to achieve zero incidents resulting in employee workplace injury for FY2019. 

Health and Safety within the Workforce 

TRSPL has set in place several initiatives relating to health and safety for our employees. 

These include the following: 

✓ Regular safety briefings and safe work procedure trainings are conducted for office 

employees and warehouse staff. TRSPL has dedicated and highly experienced 

training managers to conduct in-house trainings, in addition to external trainers.  

✓ EHS trainings on safety awareness and risk assessment are conducted bi-annually, 

which all operations staff are mandated to attend.  

✓ All warehouse staff are required to attend a safety orientation course for 

metalworking.  

✓ We send our workers to attend specific skills training as and when required. Some of 

these training include forklift operation and lifting operation for signalmen and 

riggers.

Businesses exist and grow with the permission of the communities in which they operate. Maintaining 

public trust in the business is our utmost priority. TEHO is committed to uphold high ethical standards 

and integrity in its operations. This involves good corporate governance as well as an accountable and 

transparent management system. We undertake measures to prevent corruption and criminal 

misconduct in our business. 

TEHO has in place a Whistleblowing Policy which establishes the procedures for reporting, in good faith, 

any improper conduct while protecting the whistle-blower from reprisals. In addition, the Employee 

Code of Conduct, found in the Employee Handbook, sets out expectations of employees in relation to 

issues such as fraud or bribery. Our employees are required to adhere to the Employee Code of Conduct 

and maintain high levels of integrity. Internal Auditors monitor for risk of corruption and report any 

findings to the Audit Committee, without the presence of management as a means of monitoring 

TEHO’s policies and performance internally.  

 

Performance and targets 

During the year, there were zero confirmed incidents of corruption and zero received whistle-blowing 

reports. There were also zero confirmed incidents in which employees were dismissed or disciplined 

for corruption and zero confirmed incidents when contracts with business partners were terminated or 

not renewed due to violations relating to corruption. Additionally, there were zero public legal cases 

regarding corruption brought against the organisation or its employees during the reporting period and 

the outcomes of such cases. We aim to continue with our current performance the following year.

Compliance with Laws and Regulations 

 

TEHO is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance within the Group to ensure 

greater transparency and to protect the interests of all stakeholders. This includes ensuring compliance 

with the relevant laws and regulations. The Group has put in place various policies and practices to 

avoid the violation of any laws and regulations.   

TEHO is compliant with external laws and regulations such as the Catalist Rules and Personal Data 

Protection Act.  

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework facilitates the identification and management of 

the risk of regulatory non-compliance. Where significant risks of non-compliance occur, the Heads of 

Department or Risk Champions will escalate the incident to the ERM Office immediately to assess if 

further action is required. We practice a strict zero tolerance policy for violations of the law. We take 

the appropriate disciplinary action against employees who violate them. 

 

Every employee is tasked with the responsibility of ensuring compliance and to act in accordance with 

prevailing legislation and regulations. Any employee can report a suspected violation to his/her line 

manager or the Chief Financial Officer. 

 

Performance and targets 

 

During the year, TEHO had zero significant fines and non-monetary sanctions. We did not have any 

cases brought through dispute resolution mechanisms and no other major incidents that should be 

disclosed.  

 

We intend to achieve zero non-compliance with laws and/or regulations resulting in significant fines 

and non-monetary sanctions.
