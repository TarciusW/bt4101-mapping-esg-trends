MindChamps PreSchool Limited

MindChamps PreSchool Limited (“MindChamps”) is pleased to present our 

Sustainability Report (this “Report”) for the fnancial year ended 31 December 

2019 (“FY2019”). 

At MindChamps, we strongly believe in the potential of education to drive 

positive social change. This belief gives us the impetus to move forward 

dynamically, as we strive for excellence in leadership and expertise. The vision 

of our organisation to revolutionise education is becoming a global reality. In 

Singapore, MindChamps has established its position as the Number One 

provider of premium preschool centres1, and we continue to transform and 

grow each day.  

As the Board of Directors (the “Board”), we recognise the importance of 

sustainability and seek to contribute to our environment and society through 

our business activities as a responsible corporate citizen. 

We are supported by the Sustainability Task Force (“STF”), which is comprised 

of C-suite and senior management, to ensure that MindChamps’ sustainability 

initiatives are aligned with the long-term business strategy of taking the 

MindChamps education movement from Singapore to the world. Through the 

STF, we oversee the management and monitoring of the ESG factors. 

This Report outlines MindChamps’ position on integrating sustainability into 

our strategies and operations and provides an overview of our policies and 

practices and sustainability initiatives and performance during FY2019.

MindChamps conducted a materiality assessment guided by the GRI Materiality Principle. 

The objective of the assessment was to identify the ESG factors that are material for both 

MindChamps’ business and our stakeholders. 

The Working Team facilitated the three-step assessment process which involved 

identifying, prioritising and validating ESG factors that are material to MindChamps. 

The assessment process is summarised in the diagram below.

Nine material ESG factors were identifed as topics that matter most to MindChamps’ 

business and stakeholders. We categorised the material ESG factors as follow:

2     Quality of Education System includes education innovation and technology.

3     Health and Safety includes employees’ and students’ health and safety.

MindChamps believes that, as a leader in Singapore’s education sector, we should 

inculcate the right values in our students (our “Champs”) and empower them through our 

curriculum and teaching pedagogy. This is a critical consideration for MindChamps as we 

continue to strengthen our business through responsible conduct of all our operations.

We address our material factors across three sustainability pillars, namely Environment, 

Social and Governance. Due to the nature of our business, our approach is focussed on 

people – who are fundamental to the long-term success of MindChamps. 

In FY2019, MindChamps accomplished several key milestones and set targets for the 

coming year to drive continuous improvement in the relevant areas.

MindChamps is committed to nurturing our 

Champs through a holistic curriculum in a 

vibrant environment.

MindChamps’ curriculum nurtures our Champs 

in all aspects of development, preparing them 

for the future from their early learning years.

M I N D CHA M PS’ APPROACH

O BJ E CT IVE

Anchored by MindChamps’ philosophy of 

flling the gaps in education systems 

worldwide, the objective of MindChamps’ 

education model is to prepare the children 

of today with the skills, fexibility and 

mindset to thrive in a rapidly-changing and 

information-saturated future, and nurturing 

every child to be the best they can be.

Sustainability is a key global issue in today’s 

context. Recognising this, MindChamps 

imparts this responsibility in our Champs. 

MindChamps educates our Champs to 

interact responsibly with the environment 

through our curriculum, which includes 

lesson design, class activities, excursions 

and 

year-end 

concerts. 

MindChamps 

believes that nurturing and instilling a 

sense of responsibility should begin from 

our Champs’ early childhood.

Our Champs in Australia learn to 

care for the environment.

The MindChamps “Enquiry Approach 

to Teaching and Learning” has a strong 

focus on environmental awareness and 

sustainability. Three out of the four 

Enquiry themes for each level in 

MindChamps PreSchool are focussed 

on “Animals”, “Growing Things” and 

“Our World”. 

During a class activity, our Champs in 

Australia learned the craft of making 

their own recycled papers. This 

activity taught our Champs one of the 

many simple methods that they can 

use to help to save and protect the 

environment in their own way. They 

apply what they learn in school and 

bring the knowledge home to share 

with their family and friends.

Through these Enquiry themes, our Champs 

explore and discover the world around them 

and learn about the importance of protecting 

the earth through environmentally-friendly 

practices, such as recycling, responsible 

consumption and practical energy-saving 

methods. 

Champs 

also 

learn 

about 

empowerment – the role each individual plays 

in protecting the environment.

performances on helping to save Our

The learning about sustainability and environmental 

protection culminates in year-end concerts for all our 

MindChamps PreSchool centres. Our Champs’ performances 

are based on a common theme:

saving the Earth and 

promoting the ideals 

of environmental 

protection. 






MindChamps believes in leading by 

example to nurture and encourage 

behavioural changes that positively 

impact the environment. MindChamps 

teachers and employees practise the 

3Rs – Reduce, Reuse and Recycle in 

their daily activities at MindChamps 

PreSchool. 

Our teachers encourage our Champs to 

collect used materials such as bottles, 

aluminium cans and newspapers to 

decorate the classrooms as well as for their 

arts and crafts projects. This initiative 

exposes 

our 

Champs 

to 

sustainable 

practices, sparks their learning interest and 

inculcates recycling habits in them from 

their early learning years.

Our Champs in Australia also 

practise the recycling of food waste. 

Before they wash their plates after 

each meal, they empty any food 

waste into a bucket. The food waste 

is then taken to a worm farm and 

recycled as food for the worms. 



To step up our sustainability eforts at the corporate level, the Human Resource (“HR”) 

department did a major exercise in FY2019 to digitalise all personnel records and employee 

performance appraisal forms and processes in Singapore and Australia. The digitalisation of 

these records greatly reduced the need for the printing of documents.

There are also conscious eforts by employees to reduce paper, water and electricity 

consumption in our corporate ofces. Employees are encouraged and reminded to avoid 

printing documents where possible, and to switch of lights when they leave their ofces.

proactively to the expectations of its 

stakeholders helps MindChamps to stay

MindChamps recognises the importance of interacting with our stakeholders to build their 

understanding of MindChamps’ business. MindChamps regularly interacts and connects with our 

stakeholders through various engagement methods. These engagements aim to build and 

strengthen the trust in MindChamps’ brand and create long-term value for both MindChamps and 

our stakeholders.

This section describes MindChamps’ interactions with four key stakeholder groups; (1) customers, (2) 

media, (3) shareholders and analysts, and (4) employees, as they each have a major infuence on 

MindChamps’ success, and are in turn, impacted by MindChamps.  

Understanding our customers is key to ensuring that MindChamps, and our Champs and their 

parents (“MindChamps parents”) develop a long-standing relationship. 

To deepen our understanding of MindChamps parents, we conduct surveys twice a year called the 

MindChamps PreSchool Parents’ Survey (“Parents’ Survey”) in Singapore and Australia. The Parents’ 

Survey aims to capture and understand the satisfaction level of MindChamps parents. The results 

drive continuous improvement in engaging with our customers. 

Based on the latest results of the Parents’ Survey, MindChamps achieved the following results:

I N T E R A C T I O N  W I T H  S T A K E H O L D E R S

To facilitate continuous interaction with our customers, we conduct Parent-Teacher 

Conferences (“PTCs”) and also implemented regular communications via the MindChamps 

Application (“MindChamps App”) and similar applications.

PTCs are held at the end of every semester. 

The PTCs not only provide a platform for our 

teachers to update MindChamps parents on 

their Champs’ learning journeys, but also 

allow MindChamps parents to provide 

feedback on MindChamps’ curriculum and 

practices. This iterative, 360-degree platform 

facilitates efective and meaningful dialogue. 

 

The MindChamps App is a mobile application 

that was specially designed for MindChamps 

parents to participate in and celebrate their 

Champs’ growth and progress. Our teachers 

provide updates on our Champs’ educational 

development through the ‘My Learning 

Curriculum’ function on the MindChamps App. 

Furthermore, the MindChamps App enables 

MindChamps to continually strengthen the 

parent-centre partnership to nurture the best 

potential in all our Champs. It enables our 

teachers and MindChamps parents to foster 

two-way communication and easily exchange 

information about their Champs. Our teachers 

also recognise the importance of personal 

interaction and carry out good practices, such 

as greeting and meeting MindChamps parents 

every day when they come to the centres and 

sharing verbal updates regarding their Champs.

Media

The media plays an important role in communicating accurate information on MindChamps in 

their publications to a wider audience. The media also helps to widen exposure opportunities 

for MindChamps’ brands and products. 

In Singapore and Australia, MindChamps’ Corporate Communications team is responsible for 

overseeing both public relations and media relations for MindChamps, carries out media 

monitoring and engagement and issues media releases. The team works closely with the 

media to profle MindChamps’ CEO, Executives and World Advisory Board Members. The team 

also works with the media to share the latest developments through print, broadcast and 

digital media outlets. MindChamps shares corporate announcements and news from our 

centres on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube and blogs.

MindChamps regularly invites analysts to meetings after our 

quarterly fnancial results  announcements. At these meetings, 

our Chief Executive Ofcer and Chief Financial Ofcer share on 

MindChamps’ business performance from the results, which 

enables analysts to have a deeper understanding about

Employees

MindChamps is in a people-centric 

industry and regards its employees as a 

key stakeholder group that drives the 

success 

of 

MindChamps. 

For 

more 

information on our initiatives relating to 

communications with our employees, 

please refer to the material ESG factor 

“Talent Retention” on the following page.


T A L E N T  R E T E N T I O N

MindChamps places great importance on talent retention. The ability to attract and retain 

candidates who ft MindChamps’ culture will positively impact MindChamps’ business. 

Longer-term employees would have acquired essential knowledge and established 

relationships with industry players. Hence, it is MindChamps’ objective to retain these talents, 

in order to facilitate sustainable growth.

Retention

A set of policies and processes has been established with the objective of retaining talent. The 

policies are embedded in MindChamps’ Employee Handbook and provide guidance over 

matters such as working hours, leave entitlement, code of conduct and employee benefts. 

Employees are encouraged to approach the HR department with any concerns that they may 

have regarding HR policies and practices. 

To 

retain 

employees, 

MindChamps 

strives to create a welcoming culture. 

Staf meetings called “Pow Wow” 

meetings are organised around once 

every quarter. During such “Pow Wow” 

meetings, 

new 

employees 

are 

introduced, and business updates are 

shared 

with 

all 

employees. 

Team 

activities are also held during such 

meetings. For example, employees from 

diferent departments are assigned to 

groups to create and perform short skits 

exemplifying MindChamps’ six core 

themes, 

namely 

“Consistency”, 

“Realistic”, “Excellence”, “Accountability”, 

“Teamwork” and “Energy” (CREATE). 

M I N D C H A M P S  W O W  

A W A R D

The WOW Award recognises employees who 

excel in their performance and rewards them 

for 

their 

continuous 

contributions 

to 

MindChamps' success. Their performance is 

assessed based on values such as “Heart”, 

“Service Excellence”, “Commitment” and 

Teamwork”. The Heads of Departments will 

rate and nominate employees who excel in 

these areas. Employees who receive the WOW 

Award will be awarded a certifcate and a 

monetary reward of S$200 to S$300. This 

award also motivates employees to strive for 

further excellence in their work.

TALENT RE TENTION

CREATE is MindChamps’ backbone to shape a fun workplace environment for employees to 

feel motivated and committed to work at MindChamps. The skit competitions also greatly 

encourage bonding and facilitate smoother business interactions between diferent departments.

Additionally, annual teachers’ retreats are 

organised for our teachers from all 

MindChamps PreSchool centres. These 

retreats are organised to appreciate our 

teachers’ passion and commitment in 

educating and nurturing our Champs. The 

retreats also provide opportunities for our 

teachers 

to 

bond 

and 

share 

their 

experiences and best practices with one 

another. 

In 

2019, 

MindChamps 

HQ 

organised a 3-day 2-night retreat to Bali for 

our teachers as well as non-teaching staf.

As part of MindChamps’ retention initiatives, the HR department also conducts exit interviews 

with resignees to understand the reasons behind their resignations. The HR department then 

looks into the concerns raised during such interviews.






Engagement

To constantly be in tune with the pulse of our employees, MindChamps conducts annual 

employee surveys for our teachers and corporate staf to engage and understand employee 

satisfaction levels. From the FY2019 annual employee survey, both our corporate staf and 

teachers ranked MindChamps’ employee engagement index the same as the national 

average of 4.69 published by the Singapore Workforce Engagement Study in 2019. As for the 

survey item “likelihood to recommend MindChamps as employer”, MindChamps scored 4.69, 

which was above the national average of 4.34. The results from the surveys are used to 

identify issues that our employees may have. The HR department works towards addressing 

these issues as MindChamps is driven by the objective of increasing employee engagement 

and satisfaction and, in turn, increasing the retention of talent that is key to drive and 

support our business and operations.

MindChamps is also committed to ensuring that work performance requirements are met 

and that our employees progress in their careers. Performance appraisals are conducted 

annually, reinforced with regular feedback to identify talent gaps, training needs and 

promotion opportunities, as well as to strengthen relationships between MindChamps and 

our employees. To encourage life-long learning, MindChamps provides four days of Learning 

and Development leave annually for employees to attend courses that are relevant to their 

work. As a result of our robust internal HR policies and processes, MindChamps received the 

2019 Infuential Brands® Top Employer award for the second year running.

Organisational Culture

Consistent with MindChamps’ brand philosophy, it is our belief that a brand is not simply 

expressed in a logo, packaging, typography or product. Rather, it is an amalgamation of 

personality and experience where organisational culture plays a key factor in truly defning 

MindChamps’ distinctiveness as a brand.

The HR department has recently implemented an upgraded annual performance appraisal 

framework and system for employees, whereby 10% of the performance score will involve an 

assessment of the employee’s exemplifcation of MindChamps’ 5 Core Values, namely 

“Heart”, “Integrity”, “Prosperity”, “Growth” and “Expansion”, to ensure that our Core Values 

are deeply embedded throughout the whole organisation and to create a positive

QUALIT Y OF EDUCATION SYSTEM 4

MindChamps’ 3-Mind education model prepares the children of today with the skills, 

fexibility and mindset to thrive in a rapidly-changing and information-saturated future. The 

model strives to nurture every child to be the best that they can be, by focussing on the skills 

and strategies of learning. The model emphasises the teaching of the ‘how’ rather than the 

‘what’ to learn. The 3-Mind concept was conceived alongside international experts, including 

world-renowned neuroscientist, Professor Emeritus Allan Snyder FRS. MindChamps’ unique 

approach draws inspiration and research from the domains of Neuroscience, Child 

Psychology and Theatre, synthesising them with education theory and practice.

MindChamps delivers, through “S.M.I.L.E.S.”, an environment of engagement, security, 

nurturing and exploration. This prepares the brain for optimal growth and anticipates the 

future development of the 3 Minds. The acronym S.M.I.L.E.S. stands for: Sensory, Motor 

(Music and Movement), Intellectual, Linguistic, Emotional and Social. The S.M.I.L.E.S. 

principle acknowledges that brains, in their formative stages, need all aspects of 

mind-stimulation simultaneously, and that all types of activities have the potential to engage 

all of the S.M.I.L.E.S. elements.

MindChamps teachers develop weekly Enquiry teaching and learning lesson cycles that best 

exemplify our philosophy of the 3 Minds and S.M.I.L.E.S. The Enquiry approach begins with 

active provocation by the teachers to stimulate our Champs’ interests and curiosity that sets 

them on active learning journeys. The various provocation methods applied range from 

books, images, games, to living things such as plants to appeal to the diferent learning 

styles of our Champs. This is aligned with the S.M.I.L.E.S. elements.  

4     Quality of Education System includes education innovation and technology.

The Learning Mind

Through provocation and discovery, the 

Learning Mind is tapped and nurtured. Our 

Champs embark on learning through crafted 

play that uses all forms of manipulatives, games 

and other creative learning resources. Crafted 

play allows our Champs to have a ‘hands-on’ 

approach 

to 

learning 

and 

discovery. 

Furthermore, MindChamps teachers observe 

and document the interests of our Champs and 

design lessons which allow our Champs to 

further pursue their interests.

The Champion Mind

The Champion Mind is actively nurtured through the 10 values of a MindChampion, and our 

teachers elaborate on these values through purposeful and incidental teachable moments. 

Through Enquiry, our Champs learn about discovering their own voice, personal creativity 

and self-expression – all these elements are refective of the Champion Mind.

The Creative Mind

The Creative Mind is developed through various 

platforms. A key platform is the documenting of our 

Champs’ learning in the Enquiry Approach to 

Teaching and Learning. The Creative Mind is about 

nurturing self-expression, unique viewpoints and 

the mindset of listening and accepting the 

viewpoints of others. MindChamps teachers adopt 

various lesson strategies to encourage our Champs 

to demonstrate their learning through unique 

pieces of work as opposed to cookie-cutter works. 

Each work showcases a statement by the Champs 

because they are encouraged to refect on their 

works and articulate these refections – to 

encourage their own voice.

P R E S C H O O L  E N V I R O N M E N T

At MindChamps PreSchool centres, each class is managed by one English language teacher and 

one Chinese language teacher, who jointly educate our Champs through the daily curriculum. 

This provides our Champs with the learning opportunity to be efectively bilingual and nurture 

their interest in both languages from young.

To further facilitate a conducive learning environment and have a greater alignment to the 

3-Mind Education Model, all MindChamps PreSchool classrooms are designed with six 

Learning Zones – Dramatic, Construction, Art and Craft, Reading, Writing and Numeracy. 

These Learning Zones are designed with the objective of promoting imagination and 

learning. 

MindChamps HQ provides a yearly Enquiry Theme Guide to all MindChamps PreSchool 

centres. A set of 16 Curriculum Folders, which provide comprehensive details of 

MindChamps’ curriculum and pedagogy as well as how the classroom space should be set 

up, is also communicated to and rolled out at all MindChamps PreSchool centres. These 

folders include lesson planning templates for integrated activities to drive the Enquiry 

Approach to Teaching and Learning.

MindChamps’ curriculum is the result of over a decade of research and development in the 

three domains of Neuroscience, Child Psychology and Theatre. Our curriculum nurtures all 

aspects of our Champs and includes world proprietary academic and enrichment 

programmes.

To ensure that our MindChamps PreSchool centres are operating at the highest standards, a 

ChampionGold Standard site visit is conducted annually. This audit reviews the teaching and 

learning conducted at each of our centres, as well as the centre’s overall operations and the 

experience of MindChamps parents and our Champs. Following the site audit for each 

centre, MindChamps HQ follows up with a report and feedback session. MindChamps 

PreSchool centres then use this report to formulate and carry out improvement plans.

QUALIT Y OF TE ACHERS

Our teachers are accredited by MindChamps HQ as part of training and must demonstrate 

learned skills and knowledge through practical exercises. 

Annually, all our teachers are required to undergo two full days of TDT organised by 

MindChamps HQ and one full day of TDT organised by the centres. The TDT provides a 

platform to share the best pedagogical practices and to refect on MindChamps’ culture and 

values, and includes training from our CEO and MindChamps World Advisory Board members.

During the MindChamps TDT in March 2019, Dr Scott Hicks, our Senior Fellow, an Academy 

Award Nominee and Emmy Award-winning Director and Screen Writer, shared his deep 

insights on how MindChamps teachers could bring out the best in our Champs. Through the 

right settings in classroom, MindChamps teachers can efectively engage our Champs and 

build their confdence in learning.

To deliver MindChamps’ curriculum, it is 

crucial that our teachers develop the right 

mindsets, values and skills and are equipped 

with the right tools. MindChamps teachers are 

required to attend training to enhance their 

skills in areas such as coaching, tools for 

engagement, positive guidance as well as 

MindChamps’ curriculum within three months 

of onboarding.

HE ALTH AND SAFE T Y5

MindChamps is responsible for the safety and well-being of thousands of young children. MindChamps 

is also mindful of the need to create a safe workplace for our employees. 

MindChamps undertakes robust measures to ensure the safety of our Champs and employees. In 

addition to complying with the local laws and regulations, various policies have been established by 

MindChamps to address both Occupational Health and Safety and Preschool Health and Safety. 

MindChamps considers the work health and safety of all workers, contractors, suppliers, and visitors to 

MindChamps to be of utmost importance. MindChamps is committed to conducting its business in a 

manner that promotes the work health and safety of its employees, contractors, visitors and clients. In 

the event of a work-related injury, MindChamps is also committed to ensuring that all injured workers 

have the opportunity to recover and return to work in a safe and timely manner.

MindChamps HQ has established a health and safety committee in compliance with the relevant laws 

and regulations, and maintains a WSH Policy as guidance in creating a safe environment for our Champs 

and employees. An SOP on Incident Management and Reporting has been established to ensure prompt 

reporting and investigation of incidents concerning safety. Regular checks are conducted at 

MindChamps HQ and PreSchool centres to identify any areas of potential safety risk. Operational risks 

are also reviewed in an efort to reduce and eliminate risks, where possible. Maintenance is scheduled 

regularly for properties such as elevators, escalators and stairwells, and hazards identifed (if any) which 

cannot be eliminated are well signposted. Briefngs are also conducted for all centre leaders in Singapore 

about workplace health and safety in accordance with the Work Injury Compensation Act.

In FY2019, MindChamps launched a Return to Work programme to promote the importance 

of safety and well-being of all our employees in Australia, through the development of a 

health and well-being strategy. The objective of the programme is to outline MindChamps’ 

commitment and approach to the management of the return to work of employees who 

have sufered workplace injury. 

All MindChamps teachers attend child frst aid courses and are certifed frst aiders. They are 

trained to observe and identify medical conditions in our Champs and to take the necessary 

actions such as providing frst aid and contacting the relevant emergency response teams. It 

is critical to ensure that our Champs receive the appropriate attention during an emergency. 

In addition, each centre has a safety team comprising teachers and admin staf who are 

assigned to ensure that health and safety measures are upheld at the centre, which include 

periodic checks on the expiry dates and the stock up of frst aid kits and fre extinguishers. 

Each centre also has a fre warden to lead fre-drill exercises and safe evacuations in the event 

of an actual fre outbreak. 

Furthermore, MindChamps PreSchools are regularly audited for health and safety to ensure 

compliance with licensing requirements. To ensure the safety of our Champs, audits are 

conducted through the MindChamps ChampionGold Standard framework. The 

MindChamps safety manager conducts bi-annual spot checks, carries out timely 

investigation and implements preventive and corrective actions when incidents are 

reported. Preschool equipment such as toys and playgrounds are cleaned daily and 

maintained and upgraded annually. Our centres also ensure that our Champs of diferent age 

groups are provided with age-appropriate toys. 

MindChamps takes pride in providing a 

safe learning environment for our 

Champs. For example, one of the key 

safety 

features 

that 

MindChamps 

upholds strictly is the installation of door 

guards in all our centres. This minimises 

the risk of doors accidently closing on our 

Champs’ fngers. 

W A L K I N G  F E E T  C A M P A I G N

Our Champs are reminded to use their 

‘walking feet’ when moving about in 

MindChamps PreSchool centres and not to 

run within the premises. MindChamps 

instils safe behaviours in our Champs and 

encourages them to be responsible for their 

own safety as well as the safety of their 

peers and teachers through positive 

guidance and fun activities. 


Note 1: The survey question was not covered in 

the Parents’ Survey for our Australian centres.

Health and safety trainings are provided to both our Champs and employees to 

educate them on the potential health risks and safety hazards at MindChamps 

HQ and PreSchool centres, and the proper precautions to take. Additionally, fre 

evacuation drills are conducted for our Champs and employees at least once 

every six months to increase their awareness and preparedness in case of an 

emergency. Due to our robust health and safety processes in place, no serious 

work-related incidents were recorded in FY2019.

LOCAL COMMUN ITI E S

MindChamps is committed to investing in local communities to drive positive change and to 

support communities in need. In FY2019, MindChamps PreSchool centres in Singapore 

organised various community engagement programmes that positively impacted the lives 

of benefciaries.

Through initiatives to support local communities and guided by the “10 Values of a 

MindChampion”, our Champs are better able to understand and appreciate the true 

meaning of the values ‘I am grateful’, ‘I am compassionate’ and ‘I focus on the beauty in 

others’. 

Here are some of the initiatives in FY2019:

The Meaning of Charity

Our Champs were involved in charity work throughout the year.  They donated their toys, food 

or some of their hong bao money to low income families and spent time with senior citizens.

Children Play a Role in Cancer Awareness

Our Champs from MindChamps PreSchool @ Rafes Town Club starred in a music video for 

the Breast Cancer Foundation’s breast cancer awareness month of October 2019. In this 

partnership with Bridgestone Corporation, the video features our Champs dancing to a song 

– “Molly Sings and Saves”. The video used the song lyrics and dance movements to subtly 

remind women how to carry out regular breast self-examination, in order to promote early 

breast cancer detection. 

Our amazing Champs rehearsed for two months and debuted their performance at the Pink 

Ribbon Walk 2019.

Wearing monkey costumes in Singapore’s 

warm weather did not deter our Champs’ 

enthusiasm and like true champions, they 

gave their best performance, much to the 

delight of the Pink Ribbon Walk participants, 

parents and guest-of-honour, Minister of 

Education, Mr Ong Ye Kung.

REGUL ATORY COMPLIANCE

Good corporate governance is essential to operate in the regulated preschool sector as it safeguards 

MindChamps from risk and reputational damage. It is also key to building customer confdence, loyalty 

and trust. 

In view of the various regulations that govern preschools, MindChamps institutes policies to guide its 

operations. MindChamps also regularly reviews these policies to ensure that they are kept up to date. 

In addition to having policies as overarching governance, MindChamps PreSchool centre leaders 

conduct self-assessment in compliance with the Early Childhood Development Agency’s (“ECDA”) 

licensing requirements. A compliance audit is carried out by MindChamps HQ one month prior to the 

ECDA licensing ofcer’s renewal assessment visit. Meetings are regularly held with business leaders to 

communicate and align ECDA’s licensing requirements and Code of Practice with centre operations and 

practices.

For Australia, all MindChamps Early Learning Centres use the MindChamps policies and protocols as well 

as the ChampionGold Standards to meet the standards spelt out the National Quality Framework.  Our 

centres are regulated, assessed and rated under this framework. Our centres also conduct 

self-assessment and make the necessary improvements which are refected in the Quality Improvement 

Plan of each centre, on an annual basis. 

MindChamps also takes a serious stance on ensuring that our franchisees comply with regulations and 

uphold our values, so that our brand and curriculum are not compromised. MindChamps has in place a 

robust compliance audit framework for our franchisees. An annual compliance audit is carried out on 

every franchisee by an independent service provider. Through the audit process, issues are identifed 

and follow up actions are reported to MindChamps HQ and the franchisee. Our teams work closely with 

franchisees to resolve any issues identifed and constantly improve on operations. Due to the framework 

in place and annual checks on our franchisees, no signifcant issues were reported in FY2019.

 

MindChamps endeavours to continue to operate to the highest standards in compliance with the 

relevant laws and regulations.
