BOARD

STATEMENT



The Board is pleased to present our fourth Sustainability Report covering the financial year ended 31 March 2021.

The 2021 Sustainability Report continues to reflect the Group’s performance as well as the company’s strategy and 

vision for the future. Throughout the year, The Board reviewed the company’s sustainability objective, targets, and 

progress, and continues to embark on our sustainability journey amidst the challenges faced in our society today. 

Our sustainability efforts through the integration of the material environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors 

into our business strategy demonstrates our commitment to drive sustainability for the long-term. We recognise that 

we must conduct our operations in a manner that considers the environmental and social impact to ensure the success 

and longevity of the business. 

The Board recognise the importance of sustainability initiatives, and similar to the past, has actively sought to address 

sustainability issues for better risk management and drive long-term growth. Material issues such as customer privacy, 

ethical business practices, talent development and retention as well as economic performance remain to be key 

considerations on the sustainability agenda for the Board in the financial year under review. 

This Report describes the identification of the ESG factors material to the business of Azeus, and outlines a balanced 

account of our practices and performance in managing these factors listed under these four pillars, Social, Governance, 

Economic and Environment.

Looking ahead, the Board aims to strengthen Azeus’ sustainability performance and management by adopting 

new measures in our sustainability practices including reviewing the need to set-up a dedicated taskforce for the 

implementation of sustainability measures. We look forward to aligning our sustainability efforts throughout the Group 

to drive continued business growth.

SUSTAINABILITY RISKS

GOVERNANCE



AND OPPORTUNITIES



The Board and the Management of the Company are committed to maintain a high standard of corporate governance 

and transparency to protect the interests of the shareholders of the Company. Processes and procedures have been 

instituted and are being constantly reviewed and revised to ensure effective corporate governance. This includes taking 

sustainability issues into consideration as part of its strategic formulation, and continuously explore ways to deal with 

areas of improvement in its sustainability agenda. The Board’s close interaction with management ensures that Azeus’ 

values, principles and policies are consistently applied across the organisation. This will enable Azeus to optimise long-

term value creation and fulfil its social responsibilities towards all our stakeholders.   

 

The Board comprised six members, three of whom are Executive Directors including the Chairman of the Board and 

three Independent Directors. While the sustainability objectives and strategy are developed, managed, and monitored 

by the representatives from the respective regional business functions, this is continuously overseen and monitored by 

the Board. The material ESG factors on economic, environmental, and social issues identified relevant to the Group are 

strategically reviewed and approved by the Board.

Sustainability is emerging as a source of competitive advantage and is seen as a crucial business practice that 

stakeholders see in a company. These days, while there are numerous issues that could constitute risks that threaten 

an organisation’s sustainability, the act of attempting to solve such issues may lead to new business opportunities. 

Azeus is committed to systematically assess and manage these risks and opportunities to identify the material ESG 

factors, and ensures that a sound internal controls and a structured governance framework are in place to reduce the 

risk of these identified material ESG factors. Azeus recognises that risk management is vital for the Group’s operational 

management and resource planning, for a sustainable corporate growth.

 

There are no significant changes to the previously reported list of sustainability-related risks and opportunities that 

impact the Group’s material topics on operations and strategic planning. Further details on the identified risks and 

opportunities are discussed in the relevant sections of the material topics covered in this Report.

During Azeus’ AGM in July 2021, the Group held its first hybrid 

AGM, where the meeting is held both physically at the Suntec 

Singapore Convention Centre and virtually through live 

webcast and live audio stream. The Group believes the best 

practice for shareholder meetings is that the experience for 

physical and virtual meetings should be the same, whereby 

people can fully interact with each other, ask questions, and 

vote in real-time.

The Board is primarily responsible to identify key stakeholder 

groups.

IDENTIFYING

MATERIAL FACTORS



Following regular internal and external engagement with our stakeholders throughout the FY2021, Azeus continues to 

assess and review the material ESG factors for the Group.

 

In FY2021, the material ESG factors were reviewed for relevance and for any changes to the priorities and risks and 

opportunities that will impact on the business, operations, finance and the reputation of the Group and influence on 

our stakeholders.  

We continue to apply the following methodology as the previous Report to identify and prioritise the topics for this 

Report.

By applying the above methodology and guidance from GRI, Azeus focused on the following as material issues in their 

order of priority for this Report:

The next section of our Report details the approach and performance data of the identified material topics. Azeus will 

continue to review and assess from time to time the relevance and priorities of each of the material aspects to better 

reflect Azeus’ commitment and focus on sustainability in our business.

As a responsible employer, Azeus is committed to promote a fair, diverse and safe working environment for its people while 

keeping in mind the local communities in places where we operate in. 

Employment practises 



Employees 



Our people are an integral part of our business for our long-term success. We believe in building a sustainable workforce 

with a focus on competitive compensation packages and a diverse, inclusive, safe, and healthy workplace. We work 

hard to motivate, develop, and retain our people. Hiring and retaining skilled IT professionals has been challenging in 

the IT industry as the industry has faced a shortage of skilled workers. With this in mind, we maintain robust policies on 

hiring IT personnel, who all go through the most stringent recruitment processes.

 

Based on our core values of “Collaboration and Teamwork” – we strive to create a work environment that is supportive 

and collaborative where our employees grow and feel valued.

 

Azeus also ensures good employment practises by complying with the local employment laws and regulations in the 

respective countries where the entities operate. Azeus also ensures its offices have in place employment policies and 

guidelines that address fair employment practices, including recruitment, employee compensation and the overall well-

being of our employees.

Employee Engagement Events/Activities



Throughout FY2021, team building activities were reduced as compared to FY2020, due to the COVID-19 measures 

put in place by the local government authorities in the regions that Azeus operates in. Despite this, we’ve moved 

our employee engagement events or activities online, to minimize group gatherings. We held multiple virtual team 

building activities such as the Dice game and Christmas Celebration Party in the Philippines, to foster closer working 

relationships between the employees and the management team.

Diversity and Equal Opportunities



The Azeus Group workforce includes part-time employees, foreign nationalities, and employees on contractual basis. 

With this diversity in our workforce, Azeus recognises that we have a duty as a corporation to support different working 

formats and cultural differences. 

 

The Azeus Equal Opportunities Policy aims to eliminate, to such extent reasonably possible, against discrimination, 

harassment of any employee and employ a diverse workforce community. This Policy provides a strong commitment to 

equal opportunity, and in treating people with dignity and providing equal employment and advancement opportunities 

for all. We hire based on credentials, not gender, race or nationality. 

While we understand the importance of workforce diversity, it is important that the Policy is enforced and communicated. 

The Policy is displayed at all our offices and disseminated to all employees and potential employees from the start of 

the recruitment process.

 

To ensure that Azeus Equal Opportunities Policy is effective, the Board reviews and where required, takes necessary 

steps to identify areas of unintentional impact on groups in the workforce, as well as what appropriate corrective 

actions to take, including defining targets for future changes to take place.

Training and Development



The success of our growth depends on the quality of our workforce. We help our employees grow, develop, and reach 

their full potential by providing regular and relevant training programmes to enhance knowledge and skills to better 

perform at work.

 

Our training framework is designed for all employment levels, and programs are developed based on the needs within 

the organisation via a Training Needs Assessment (“TNA”). The TNA working group comprises the Azeus management 

team and the HR department. The team works to identify and analyse training needs based on organisational direction, 

needs of employees and projects as well as changes to the processes and procedures. Training needs are evaluated 

annually. The Azeus Institute is set up to provide the identified training programmes. 

In FY2021, Azeus Group continued to invest in our employees’ training and development. The training programmes 

offered by the Azeus Institute focused on the areas of personal development and general security awareness made 

available through the orientation programmes, web programming and product testing courses.

 

Our internal Organisation and Project/Product Training processes outline a planned and structured approach to 

learning that aims to produce employees who can execute their roles in the organisation and in their specific teams.

 

Performance evaluations on the training are conducted for improvement purposes at various levels, including post-

trainings and follow-up training feedback surveys.

Occupational Health and Safety



It is fundamental that our workplaces are free of health and safety hazards. We encourage individual responsibility and 

good practices towards health and safety at all levels in Azeus as preventive measures at all our offices. Occupational 

health risks are identified to be a core threat to Azeus.

 

Azeus has taken steps to implement stringent policies and guidelines to strengthen health and safety standards within 

the organisation and to comply with the relevant laws and regulations in this area.

 

A Safety Committee is set up by each of the offices in Hong Kong, the Philippines, and the UK to coordinate, implement 

and administer the safety and health programs for Azeus. The Safety Committee also conducts an annual risk 

assessment to identify potential workplace safety and health risks, and to take preventive measures against them. The 

Safety Committee reviews safety standards, systems and performances periodically and is responsible to implement 

major decisions, policies and safety and health procedures.

Hong Kong Office



The Health and Safety Policy for the HK office embraces healthy working conditions and aims to provide adequate 

control of risks arising from work activities. All the Management and the employees of Azeus Hong Kong must read and 

observe the Occupational and Health Ordinance under the laws of Hong Kong, in particular the Occupational Safety and 

Health (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations. The Group had previously identified prolonged use of display screen 

equipment as a major risk of occupational hazards and injuries in the HK office. With robust policies and regulations 

in place, there were no reports of any complaints from any prolonged use of display screen equipment in the FY2021.

 

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HK Office has implemented precautionary measures to reduce the risk of the 

virus spreading in its office.

Target and performance



There was a decline in the total number of training hours in FY2021 as compared to FY2020. This is resulting from a 

reduction in general and external training to adhere to COVID-19 health measures. 

Despite this, the Philippines office has successfully conducted several technical training such as the General Data 

Protection Regulation (GDPR) training.

The Group continues to review the training provided based on the needs of the employee and the Group’s organisational 

direction. We are exploring the feasibility of organising more online workshops and training in FY2022.

Philippines Office



Azeus Philippines established a Policy and Program of Safety and Health to protect employees from workplace injuries. 

The various Emergency Preparedness Workshops planned for FY2021 had to be postponed due to COVID-19. We are 

exploring ways of conducting these workshops virtually in FY2022 to raise awareness of the safety risks. Additional 

measures and efforts were taken to prepare the Philippines office from any unexpected emergencies that may require 

safe evacuation from the office. 

 

As part of the COVID-19 preparedness, the Philippines office had implemented measures to minimise risk of employee 

exposure to COVID-19 once its employees returned to the office gradually.

UK Office



Azeus UK implemented the Health and Safety Policy, which aims to create a safe working environment for employees 

working alone and provides guidance on managing risks related to health and safety. The Directors of Azeus UK have 

overall and final responsibility for health and safety of the UK office.

COVID-19 Response



In continued response to the changes to business operations and measures in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 

the Group has monitored the situation and ensured that measures were put in place to keep employees and customers 

safe. Our Business Continuity Plan was continuously monitored and responded to as the situation requires. Employees 

can report any health and safety incidents to the HR or Administration Departments.

Employees at Azeus group of business were split into groups and allowed back into the office on an alternating basis 

if they required materials or services that were provided only in the office, such as completing contracts or other 

transactions on-site or when really needed. Employees staggered their lunch breaks and working hours to minimise 

exposure when commuting on public transport. Safe distancing and Safe Management Measures were implemented 

and enforced when in office premises, such as the checking in and out of the office building, always keeping a mask on 

and avoiding crowding or gathering in the office. 

Over the last three years, the Group did not experience any incidences of fatalities by work-related injury, high-

consequence work-related injuries, recordable work-related injuries, fatalities caused by work-related ill health, and 

recordable work-related ill health.

Employee Grievance Mechanism



Our employee grievance process provides our employees a formal avenue to raise their concerns on any complaints, 

difficulties or unlawful discrimination or harassment in confidence to the relevant HR directors in their local offices. 

Where such grievances may concern their normal line of supervision or management, an employee may approach 

the relevant Group employee. Employees also have the right to pursue complaints of discrimination to an industrial 

tribunal or the Fair Employment Tribunal under the anti-discrimination legislation in the country where the employees 

concerned are hired.

Local Communities 



Azeus is committed to go beyond our operations and extend our social responsibility to communities where we operate. 

We support various initiatives that we believe support and will build a stronger community.

 

Azeus provides support to the Group’s employees when they volunteer in or sponsor community events. The employees 

are entitled to take sabbatical leave, financial allowances or stipends, for activities such as teaching in universities. 

 

We believe in community investments to various programmes to support these initiatives.

In FY2021, the planned volunteering activities were postponed due to COVID-19. 

Azeus Group aims to fulfil its responsibilities as a member of many local communities by fostering coordination 

and cooperation with each community. The Group continuously seeks opportunities to contribute to community 

development and the creation of a prosperous living environment through its business.

by The Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute and shared views on the importance of having a dynamic Board, and 

growing demands on Board in areas such as environmental and social performance. 

Guided by this, we are constantly reviewing the existing processes and procedures to ensure effective corporate 

governance. Details of Azeus’ corporate governance activities are available in our Annual Report 2021.

Ethical Business Practices 



All our operations are managed under the applicable laws and regulations in each of the countries Azeus operate in.

GOVERNANCE



Data Protection and Privacy 



Azeus operates under a comprehensive governance framework to ensure that quality software and services are 

delivered while maintaining a high level of security. An overall company security policy is in place that outlines the 

company’s expectation of an employee’s behaviour and conduct with regards to security. 

This security policy has been approved by senior management and is available to all employees from a centralised 

(cloud) repository. In addition, this security policy is regularly reviewed by its respective document owner, any material 

changes will have to be further reviewed and approved by senior management before being published. In addition, 

our policies and procedures have been prepared with reference to the SOC-2 framework for Security and Availability 

and have been audited against these standards to ensure adherence and compliance to industry standards and best 

practices. 

Regardless of the role, all employees are trained during their initial employment to ensure security awareness on topics 

including but not limited to security attacks, social engineering tactics, prevention and detection, and proper reporting 

procedures. A refresher training is conducted annually after. An established privacy policy is in place, governing all use 

of personal data that we may meet (either directly or indirectly) through the operation of our service. This is publicly 

available at the following URL: https://www.azeusconvene.com/privacypolicy. 

All production data will always remain in the production environment – If testing data is required, simulated or fabricated 

data is used. In addition, a dedicated data processing team is in place to handle all data protection related matters. 

This team ensures that our processing activities follow established data laws and regulations (including GDPR). Where 

feasible and technically possible, data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 and data in transit is secured using HTTPS/

TLS1.2.

A formal risk management process has been defined and approved by management that specifies a risk evaluation 

process based on identified threats and pre-specified tolerance. As part of this process, a formal risk assessment is 

performed annually to identify threats that could affect system security. Any identified threats are rated using the 

above management approved metrics. Risk mitigation strategies are then developed to address these risks directly.  

Azeus is committed to protect all confidential information and minimise risks against cyber security risks to protect the 

confidential information of all stakeholders through constant monitoring of our IT systems. We are aware that any loss 

or breach of customer privacy can result in both financial and non-financial losses and lead to reputational damage.

In FY2021, there were no reported incidents of non-compliance or data breach within the Group.

ECONOMIC

Economic Performance 



The overall economic performance and profitability of the Group is one of Azeus’ core concerns. Many of our 

stakeholders, which includes our shareholders, investors, employees and suppliers, rely on our economic performance.

 

We monitor our economic performance through our budgeting process. The budget is set annually, reviewed 

throughout the financial year to monitor whether targets are met and what actions can be taken up to achieve the 

same. To evaluate our economic performance, internal and external audits are conducted on a regular basis.

 

The following tables provide an overview of the economic performance of the business segments over the last 3 years:

Professional IT Services



Azeus strives to achieve sustainable economic excellence while embracing responsible business practices across our operations 

and supply chain.

In FY2021, the Group recorded a total revenue of HK$178.1 million, with profit after tax amounting to HK$23.7 million. 

The revenue reported constitutes a slight decrease of 1.7% from FY2020, but the profit after tax of HK$23.7 million is 

an 86.7% increase from the HK$12.7 million reported in the FY2020.

While the slight decrease may be contributed by the decrease in professional IT services due to delays in service delivery 

caused by COVID-19 measures, there is higher revenue achieved in FY2021 from the Azeus products, and its associated 

professional services as well as the higher sale of third-party hardware and software upon the delivery. The Azeus 

Products segment surged 34.9% to HK$113.2 million in FY2021 from HK$83.9 million in FY2020.

 

There was no significant change to the organisation and our supply chain in the reporting year.

AGM@Convene 



Globally, the steady rollout of vaccinations and the gradual easing of COVID-19 related restrictions has lent some 

optimism towards an economic recovery. However, with the reality of COVID-19 becoming endemic and more infectious 

virus mutations, it is likely that we will continue to feel the impact of COVID-19 for years to come.

As a leading provider of IT consultancy services, Azeus remains cautiously optimistic that the increased digitalisation 

and demand for IT solutions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to create opportunities for the 

Group over the long-term.

To address the challenges that listed companies faced due to COVID-19 related restrictions, Azeus launched our new 

e-AGM solution, AGM@Convene, in FY2021. AGM@Convene seeks to redefine the future of e-AGMs by enabling the 

borderless intertwine between physical and virtual AGMs and stands to benefit from the long-term shift towards hybrid 

AGMs.

Azeus is an advocate for shareholders’ rights and places a strong emphasis on setting the best practices for e-AGMs.

During Azeus’ AGM in July 2021, the Group held its first hybrid AGM, where the meeting is held both physically at the 

Suntec Singapore Convention Centre and virtually through live webcast and live audio stream. The Group believes the 

best practice for shareholder meetings is that the experience for physical and virtual meetings should be the same, 

whereby people can fully interact with each other, ask questions, and vote in real-time.

In FY2021, the Group has emerged as a credible player in the market and have conducted approximately 400 meetings 

since the product launched last year. Azeus has found a niche in the market and will continue to improve AGM@

Convene to make the experience of hybrid meetings seamless and empowering to shareholders.

Proper management of procurement practices is vital for our business. We work with suppliers and vendors who share 

the Group’s commitment in managing our risks throughout the lifecycle of our business operations. 

 

The Sustainable Procurement Policy is a Group wide policy that encourages the purchase of all products and services 

that are manufactured, delivered, used and disposed of in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. The 

topics under this Policy are addressed during the induction training programmes for new employees and regularly 

reminded to the employees and suppliers when procuring goods and services. All suppliers must be notified of this 

Policy.

ENVIRONMENT



Azeus is committed to contribute to the global goals of minimising the environmental impact and ensure compliance with environmental 

legislations by efficiently using and conserving available resources across our business operations. We aim to continuously improve our 

environmental performance through application of international standards and best practices.

Azeus HK and Azeus UK have separate Azeus Environmental Policies for their offices to promote sound practices on environmental 

protection within all departments across their operations. Several environmental initiatives have been introduced in both offices 

addressing recycling, waste reduction, reduction of energy consumption and natural resources and reduction of carbon footprint. All 

employees and contractors of Azeus HK and Azeus UK are expected to comply with the Azeus Environmental Policy that is reviewed on 

an annual basis.

 

Azeus recognises that any change in climate such as extreme weather change in today’s environment, may have an impact on the 

Group’s ability to access resources and sustain operations. In order to mitigate environmental related risks that may impact Azeus, 

Azeus HK implemented the Environmental Management System (EMS) in 2018 to comply with the ISO 14001:2015 standards. The EMS 

is a systematic process developed to identify and address non-conformities, environmental accidents, and incidents through both 

corrective actions and preventive measures to minimise impact to the environment and the potential for recurrence. The EMS also 

handles enquiries, complaints (both internal and external) and nonconformities of the EMS. All practices to manage environmental 

impacts on office activities of Azeus HK are set out in the Environmental Instruction – Environmental Office Practices. As part of Azeus 

HK’s commitment to the ISO 14001:2015 standards, all suppliers and contractors are required to observe the requirements under the 

Environmental Guidance Notes when dealing with the Group.

The Azeus Environmental Policy and the Azeus Environmental Guidance Notes for the HK office are published on our website, www.

azeus.com.

The HK office provides routine environmental training programmes for new employees as part of their onboarding orientation to 

encourage its employees to be mindful of the conservation efforts carried out by Azeus HK. Additional training will be arranged for the 

existing employees if there are any new or major changes made to the policies, regulations or guidelines. Our Environment Management 

Representative (EMR) based in the HK Office, monitors and evaluates the EMS to ensure that our employees, suppliers and contractors 

align their activities with these standards. The Environmental Management System Committee, is a working group set-up in the HK 

office to manage ISO 14001:2015 matters.

Use of Resources



            Water



Water is an essential component of our ecosystem. At Azeus, we take our responsibility towards managing and working towards 

reducing our water consumption across our operations seriously although our water consumption is relatively low as compared to 

other industries.

 

Even though our IT business doesn’t use water directly, we are consciously advocating for awareness. In our previous Report, Azeus 

reported that the Group has undertaken a series of water reduction initiatives to manage the use of water in our building operations.

Examples of initiatives that the Group has implemented since FY2019 are: 

• 

Regularly checking pipes and taps for leakage

• 

Repair immediately any pipe leakage detected

• 

Regularly monitoring water consumption

• 

Adopting water efficient appliances

• 

Placing signages at strategic locations in the offices to conserve water

We monitor water consumption on a regular basis and make efforts to drive the water reduction initiatives. The areas of focus on 

water consumption in the HK office are based on the results of the annual internal carbon audit carried out by Azeus HK.

The water usage in Azeus’ Hong Kong office has doubled as compared to FY2020, owing to the increased sanitation in response to 

COVID-19. While there were no mandatory work from home (WFH) regulations in Hong Kong, employees may return to office as 

needed. Hence, most of Azeus’ Hong Kong employees were working in the office on a split team basis.

As employees return to the office in the Philippines and the United Kingdom, we will expect to see a similar increase in water usage 

due to increased sanitation as well.
