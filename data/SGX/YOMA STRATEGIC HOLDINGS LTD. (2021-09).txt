CEO STATEMENT

This year has been a challenging period for Myanmar, with 

substantial uncertainties in the economic and business 

environment since February 1st, followed by the third wave 

of Covid-19. These conditions posed significant unforeseen 

challenges for Myanmar and impacted an economy that has 

already been weakened by the pandemic in 2020.

During these challenging times, our top priorities have 

been protecting the health, safety and the wellbeing of 

our employees and their families, mitigating the spread 

of Covid-19, and running our businesses safely. We have 

reached the milestone of 99% of our people vaccinated as 

at 31 December 2021, by Pun Hlaing Hospitals, part of the 

Enlarged YOMA GROUP**. Yet we have also retained our focus 

on our core mission– Build a Better Myanmar for Its People, 

while supporting the principles of the UN Global Compact 

and Sustainable Development Goals ("SDGs"). 

We support the United Nations in the implementation of the 

UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which create the 

framework for sustainable business practices. The scale and 

ambition of the SDGs mean that they cannot be achieved 

by governments alone. Businesses and other organisations 

also play important roles in addressing the sustainable 

development agenda. We have considered opportunities 

where we can make the biggest contributions towards the 

SDGs while growing our business sustainably and the SDGs 

that we have identified (SDGs 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 11 and 16) that most 

value directly relate to our business and where we can add 

most value. Our contribution to the SDGs is described in the 

Sustainability Highlights of this report. 

As a Group, our long-term goal is to serve the needs of the 

people of Myanmar. We feel a collective responsibility to serve 

the market effectively and have refined our business strategy to 

reinforce our commitment to provide sustainable growth and 

development to serve the communities in which we operate. 

For us, it is all about having a strong engagement with the 

strong engagement with local communities and ensuring that 

no matter what we do, we can build a better Myanmar for 

its people. It is not just about building better infrastructure 

and better buildings, but also about how you help people. 

And rather than doing this as a separate corporate social 

responsibility programme, we want to embed this into 

the things that we do and contribute to solving economic 

inequality. 

Wave Money is a mobile-based financial services provider 

that facilitates secure, real-time transactions with the aim of 

improving financial inclusion in Myanmar. Wave Money runs a 

network of more than 45,000 agents in urban and rural areas 

across 299 townships in Myanmar. It also caters to Myanmar’s 

migrant workers who have migrated to urban centres for 

work. These workers support their families in the villages by 

periodically sending part of their earned wages home.

The Group is mindful of its environmental impact and aware 

of the complexities involved in topics like climate change and 

water preservation. Yoma Strategic considers its net impact 

on the environment to be positive, but many challenges still 

remain. Yoma Micro Power has constructed 545 off-grid solar 

plants and three grid-tied solar plants which supply clean 

and reliable power to telecommunications customers and 

individual customers in the surrounding rural communities. 

Additionally, 24 villages with 2,202 households in off-grid areas 

now have access to electricity.

I would like to again express our gratitude to our employees 

for their hard work and dedication, and to our partners, 

shareholders and other stakeholders who have weathered 

the crisis together with us. Yoma Strategic will continue to 

serve the people of Myanmar.

YOMA STRATEGIC’S CONTRIBUTION

The Group’s businesses provide a total of approximately 3,755 jobs to local staff in Myanmar. All 

employees are paid at least the local minimum wage. 

In particular, Wave Money is a mobile-based financial services provider that facilitates secure, 

real-time transactions with the aim of improving financial inclusion in Myanmar. Wave Money 

runs a network of more than 45,000 agents in urban and rural areas across 299 townships in 

Myanmar. It also caters to Myanmar’s migrant workers who have migrated to urban centres for 

work. These workers support their families by periodically sending part of their wages back to 

their home communities.

The Group’s heavy equipment business is committed to mechanise the agriculture industry 

in Myanmar and aims to help farmers to improve crop productivity by using machines to save 

time and energy and address labour shortages. It has 13 branches and 35 independent parts 

distributors throughout the country and is supported by a dedicated maintenance team to 

better serve farming communities in rural areas. 

Yoma Group Covid-19 Vaccination Policy

The Group has allowed employees to work from home in order to ensure their health and 

safety during the Covid-19 pandemic. In response to the third wave of Covid-19 in Myanmar 

in the summer of 2021, the Group announced the ‘’Yoma Group Covid-19 Vaccination Policy’’ 

and privately arranged for 7,122 doses of vaccines to be administered to staff and their families. 

Vaccination against Covid-19 is now a requirement for all Yoma Group employees, and the aim 

is to have all staff, except those underlying medical conditions, vaccinated by 1 January 2022.  

As at 31 December 2021, 99% of the employees were vaccinated. 

Partner of M2030 

Various companies within the Group are partners of M2030. M2030 is a movement launched 

by the Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance (APLMA) to eliminate malaria in Asia by 2030.  The 

existing M2030 partners at the Yoma Group10 include Pun Hlaing Hospitals, Wave Money, 

Volkswagen, New Holland, JCB; KFC, YKKO, Yoma Micro Power and Yoma Land.

Be Well, Work Well 

During these challenging times, the Group provides free, professional and supportive services 

in both Myanmar and English to address the mental health of its staff. This programme is 

designed to provide a safe space to talk about the issues that may be troubling individuals or 

their families. 

Anargat Programme

The Anargat programme is designed to provide support to the Group’s female employees as 

they look to start a family. As part of this programme, a maternity leave policy, which offers 

longer leave options (20 weeks, 40 weeks or up to 52 weeks ) and guarantees employment at 

the end of the maternity leave period, has been implemented. This programme also includes 

pre- and post-pregnancy support counselling, as well as financial support for child delivery 

services.  A lactation room has been made available at The Campus to support breastfeeding 

mothers.

Approximately 43% of the Group’s workforce is female. As at 31 December 2021, female 

representation on Yoma Strategic’s Board of Directors is 22%. Women also currently hold senior 

management positions across all the Group’s businesses. 

The Group is a founding member of the Business Coalition for Gender Equality (“BCGE”) and 

strives to be a role model in this area.

The Group is committed to supporting the UN’s SDGs in its operations.

10 For this purpose, Yoma Group comprises Yoma Strategic and First Myanmar Investment Public Company Limited.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

SDG

YOMA STRATEGIC’S CONTRIBUTION

Yoma Micro Power has completed 545 off-grid solar plants and three grid-tied solar plants as at 

30 September 2021. Additionally, 24 villages with 2,202 households in off-grid areas now have 

access to electricity. These solar plants offset more than 5 million litres of diesel per year which 

prevents the equivalent of more than 13,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.

The Group fully supports and practices the International Labour Organisation’s eight 

fundamental Conventions and the IFC’s Labour and Working Conditions Standards. The Group 

prohibits child labour at all of its business operations and projects, and there were no cases of 

child labour reported in FY2021.

Yoma Land has built a vibrant community offering at StarCity with a variety of residential 

products – City Loft, Star Villas, Galaxy Towers, Zone A/B – and expanded commercial and 

retail activities. As at 31 December 2021, 4,900 residents now live at StarCity. Furthermore, the 

Dulwich College Yangon campus at StarCity has been converted into office space, and the 

anchor tenant commenced occupation in October 2021. 

To further efforts in providing renewable energy to our communities, Yoma Land has partnered 

with Yoma Micro Power to install ground-mounted solar farms at both Pun Hlaing Estate and 

StarCity. These are estimated to provide 2,956 kWp and 1,900 kWp, respectively, which will 

significantly reduce Yoma Land’s use of grid electricity and diesel (which is used to power back-

up generators during grid outages). It is estimated that both solar farms combined will save 

almost 4,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per annum which is the equivalent emissions from 10,000 

barrels of oil.

The Group has also generated approximately 603,090 MJ of renewable energy from the 26 

kWp11  solar panels installed at The Campus (the Yoma Group’s office in Pun Hlaing Estate) and 

the 52 kWp solar panels installed at StarCity. This is equivalent to the electricity consumed by 

approximately 385 households in Myanmar for one month based on an average of 435 kWh 

consumed per household per month12. 

The Group has undertaken to raise employees’ awareness of environmental stewardship by 

championing activities such as Earth Hour, Earth Day, World Cleanup Day and Digital Cleanup 

Day.

The Group strongly opposes bribery and all other kinds of corruption. This extends to its business 

dealings with third-party service providers and vendors. To reinforce its Code of Conduct, the 

Group conducts trainings for all employees covering its policies on Anti-Bribery, Anti-Corruption, 

Conflicts of Interest and Whistle Blowing. 

The Group prohibits any form of discrimination, including any distinction, exclusion or 

preference made on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion or political opinion which has 

the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or 

occupation. As a committed nation builder, the Group believes that it has to lead by example 

so as to ensure that internationally recognised best practices are established as part of the 

development of Myanmar.

11 kWp stands for kilowatt ‘peak’ power of a photovoltaic system.

YOMA STRATEGIC'S APPROACH

TO SUSTAINABILITY 

Yoma Strategic’s sustainability efforts are structured around the Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) of the 2030 Agenda 

for Sustainable Development, and the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. In February 2019, Yoma Strategic published its 

inaugural Sustainability Report and identified its nine key material topics through an extensive shareholder survey and workshop. 

In FY2021, the Group continued its outreach efforts to its business units to enhance their awareness and understanding of the 

Group’s approach to sustainability including the data collection process for material topics.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MATERIALITY

YOMA STRATEGIC'S APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

The Group conducted its first materiality assessment and 

stakeholder engagement survey in 2018 through a third-

party sustainability consultant to gather inputs from all key 

stakeholders on the significant issues relevant to its business. 

Since 2019, the Group has expanded the boundaries of its 

Sustainability Report to include new entities that have an 

impact on its material topics.

In FY2021, the Group has improved its data collection process 

resulting in better accuracy and reliability of the data collected. 

To enable employees to make sustainability a part of their 

job, the Sustainability Team has also conducted regular 

engagement exercises with the various business units to raise 

awareness through employee training. An internal review of 

the Group’s material topics is carried out annually by the 

Sustainability Committee to ensure that they are still relevant 

to its business and stakeholders.

ETHICAL BUSINESS

The Group strongly opposes to bribery and all other kinds of corruption. This also extends to its business dealings with third-party 

service providers and vendors. Its steadfast adherence to prudent business principles has seen Yoma Strategic become a trusted 

partner to some of the world’s leading brands as they look to expand into Myanmar. The Group also has the continued active 

support of IFC, ADB and FMO who are working in partnership to help the Group fulfil its mission according to these same principles.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

ANTI-CORRUPTION, ANTI-BRIBERY &amp; 

POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS

GRI 205-2, GRI 415-1

OUR APPROACH

Yoma Strategic manages its exposure to corruption risks 

by applying and emphasising good corporate governance, 

business ethics and transparency. Its reputation is one of its 

greatest assets. Corruption represents a risk to an organisation’s 

business and reputation. The Group is committed to a 

high standard of corporate governance for the long-term 

sustainability of the Group’s business. It has a zero-tolerance 

approach to corruption, bribery and fraud, and has developed 

a number of key policies and procedures such as the Anti-

Bribery Policy, Anti-Corruption Procedure, Code of Conduct, 

Conflict of Interest Policy and Whistle Blowing Policy which 

are disseminated and available to all employees, contractors, 

suppliers and business partners and are also publicly available 

on Yoma Strategic’s website at http://www.yomastrategic.

com. Direct or indirect contributions to political causes may 

also represent a corruption risk because they can be used to 

exert undue influence on the political process. Yoma Strategic 

does not make – and has never made – any financial or in-kind 

political contributions, directly or indirectly.

OUR PERFORMANCE

All employees are required to abide by the Group's Code of 

Conduct and Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy. These are 

reinforced by training sessions made available to employees 

online and regular newcomer orientation programmes that are 

conducted by the Group's Risk Management and Assurance 

function. Employees are encouraged to use the Whistle 

Blowing hotline to report any improprieties and concerns to 

Group for investigation. 

The Group Risk Management function also reviews processes 

and procedures that carry inherent risk to ensure any exposures 

are highlighted to management and addressed.  

The Group is implementing a new online platform for 

employee training and plans to provide all new hires and 

existing employees with training on the Group’s Code of 

Conduct, fraud awareness, Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, 

as well as the Group’s processes and functions. This would 

be a compulsory module of the Group’s Employee Induction 

Programme for all new employees.

OUR TARGET (FY2022)

One training / refresher session per quarter on the Code 

of Conduct and Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy 

for targeted audiences (multi-segment and function 

attendees across the Group).

COMPLIANCE 

GRI 419-1, GRI 307-1

OUR APPROACH

The Group continuously advocates a strong corporate 

governance culture among its employees to ensure that they 

operate in an ethical and responsible manner. The Group 

strives to comply with the relevant national environmental 

policies, laws and regulations as well as the IFC’s Performance 

Standards, the ADB’s Safeguard Policy and the Sustainability 

Policy Framework from FMO. The Group’s Enterprise Risk 

Management (“ERM”) system is designed to achieve a 

prudent and reasonable balance between risk and return, 

while providing the framework for managing risks and future 

events effectively to both protect and enhance the business 

in meeting its strategic objectives. It sets out the governance 

structure for the Group’s risk philosophy, risk appetite, 

tolerance levels and approach to manage risks. For details 

on the Group’s Risk Management Framework, please refer to 

pages on 30, 31, 32 and 33 in the Yoma Strategic’s FY2021 

Annual Report.

OUR PERFORMANCE

Yoma Land is the first developer in Myanmar to have received 

the Environmental Compliance Certificate issued by MONREC 

in May 2019 for the Yoma Central project. Yoma Central has 

also adopted IFC EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater 

Efficiencies) as a sustainability standard for green design and 

construction principles. 

Yoma Strategic was ranked #15 out of 51915 in the SGX-ST 

Governance and Transparency Index 2021, maintaining its top 

5% of listed companies for the fifth year. 

In FY2021, there were no significant fines or non-monetary 

sanctions for non-compliance with environmental laws or 

regulation. There were no significant fines or non-monetary 

sanctions for non-compliance with laws or regulations in the 

social and economic area.

OUR TARGET (FY2022)

The Group strives to maintain compliance with the 

relevant national environmental policies, laws and 

regulations as well as the IFC’s Performance Standards, 

FMO's Sustainability Policy Framework and the ADB’s 

Safeguard Policy.

OUR

PLANET

Balancing the need for rapid development with good 

stewardship of Myanmar’s resources, Yoma Strategic is dedicated 

to safeguarding, and where possible, improving Myanmar’s 

environment – for the people of Myanmar, and to ensure 

the sustainability of its own business. The Group is mindful 

of its environmental impact and aware of the complexities 

involved in topics like climate change and water preservation. 

Yoma Strategic considers its efforts to have an overall positive 

contribution to the environment but many challenges remain 

in a country developing as rapidly as Myanmar.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY &amp; CLIMATE CHANGE

GRI 302-1, GRI 302-3, GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4

OUR APPROACH

To raise awareness and highlight the importance of integrating 

sustainability into the Group’s day-to-day operations, training 

about its sustainability initiatives, which include topics such 

as energy conservation and waste reduction are provided 

to its employees. At the same time, the Group has in place 

active air quality monitoring systems for outdoor air at Pun 

Hlaing Dulwich College and StarCity Dulwich College. Updates 

on the air quality are provided to all residences on a regular 

basis. Other initiatives that the Group has undertaken to raise 

employee’s awareness on environmental stewardship include 

World Clean Up Day, Earth Hour and Earth Day activities, 

which the Group has been actively participating since 2018. 

It is also eliminating or reducing the use of single-use plastics 

across our various business units to minimise harm to the 

environment.

Climate change is both a local and global challenge. The 

management of climate-related risks and opportunities 

is an integral part of Yoma Strategic. The Group is taking 

responsibility and is doing its part in a concerted effort to 

reduce greenhouse gas emissions: not only by reducing 

energy use in its operations but also through its efforts towards 

reforming the agricultural sector and bringing solar power to 

rural areas. Beyond meeting standard expectations, the Group 

encourages individual business units to implement their own 

initiatives to decrease energy use and reduce waste. The Group 

has been collecting data from April 2017 across its various 

subsidiaries to have a better understanding of its energy 

emissions. Calculations for fuel and electricity data for both 

buildings and non-buildings which are owned and operated 

by Yoma Strategic are made available and its energy intensities 

based on the most relevant metrics for the business segment 

are reported, as shown in the tables below. The Group will 

continue to monitor and evaluate the relevance of the metrics 

used as its business continues to evolve. The Group aims to set 

quantitative targets in FY2023. 

OUR PERFORMANCE

Yoma Land strives to be a leader in the property development 

industry with regards to socially responsible construction 

and development. During the construction of the Group’s 

real estate projects, the team and management took 

environmental issues seriously and implemented protocols to 

ensure the project minimised any impact on the surrounding 

environment. As a result, StarCity has seen a wide variety of 

rare butterflies and wild bird species. Two ancient trees which 

are on the Yoma Central project have been conserved and 

transplanted to the StarCity River Park project in 2018 to 

protect them from damage due to construction.

WORLD CLEANUP DAY 2021

The Group sponsored Digital CleanUp on World CleanUp 

Day 2021. The Group’s staff participated in Digital CleanUp 

by clearing all digital waste such as unnecessary emails, files, 

apps, duplicates of photos and videos which creates digital 

pollution that continues to consume energy even when we 

have forgotten them. Digital trash sits in the backups on servers 

that provide us with cloud service and continue consuming 

electricity. 

CARBON STORAGE AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION 

There are 8,822 big trees in Pun Hlaing Estate, StarCity and 

other investment entities. The tree spieces on the majority 

of the land owned by the Group's are Samanea saman (Rain 

Tree), Mangifera indica (Mango Tree), Persea americana 

(Avocado Tree), Pterocarpus indicus (Myanmar Padauk) etc. 

These trees’ Carbon Storage* is 1,924 tonnes of carbon and 101 

tonnes of Carbon Sequestration*. The trees help the Group to 

reduce GHG emission by 101 tonnes of carbon per year.

SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT 

The Group provides transport options for employees – 

company buses are provided for employees at designated 

pick-up points to encourage employees to take buses instead 

of driving to ease traffic congestion in central Yangon and also 

to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles driven 

by employees. The Group provides 73 company buses for 1,180 

employees at The Campus, the headquarters of the Group, Pun 

Hlaing Estate, Star City, Yoma Central, Yoma Heavy Equipment, 

Mitsubishi Motors, KFC and YKKO. This transport programme

RENEWABLE ENERGY  

Yoma Land has already embraced the provision of renewable 

energy to serve its communities. Yoma Micro Power’s first 

grid-tied solar system (26kWp) was activated in March 2018 

at The Campus (Yoma Group’s HQ in Pun Hlaing Estate). In 

May 2018, a 52kWp installation was commissioned on the 

rooftop of residential A5 building in StarCity. kWp stands for 

kilowatt ‘peak’ of a photovoltaic system, and it is how the 

power generation is estimated. 

In June 2021, solar capacity 300.3 kWp was extended at 

The  Campus car park, resulting in an average of 85% of total 

electricity consumption at The Campus potentially replaced 

with renewable energy. Since January 2022, all the electricity 

consumption at The Campus were generated by renewable 

energy. 

A total of 40,115,053 MJ of renewable solar energy was 

generated from Yoma Land and Yoma Micro Power. The 

603,090 MJ of renewable energy generated by Yoma Land has 

allowed the Group to avoid approximately 73,879 kg of CO2

17. 

The 545 off-grid solar micro power plants and three grid-tied 

solar plants constructed by Yoma Micro Power have generated 

39,511,963 MJ of solar energy which was sold to telecom

towers and communities in FY2021. Additionally, 24 villages 

with 2,202 households in off-grid areas now have access to 

electricity. This is equivalent to more than 4,840,220 kg of CO2

17 

that was avoided through the use of renewable energy.

GHG EMISSION

The Group’s overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in FY2021 

was 6,756 tCO2e. This is 48% higher compared to the same 

period last year which was 4,573 tCO2e because of electricity 

cut off nationwide in FY2021.

Since FY2019, we have tracked and monitored the energy 

intensity and GHG intensity of our business  segments, based 

on square area or man hours worked as a basis to calculate 

intensity. With a better understanding of our performance, 

we aim set targets in FY2023. We recognise that we still have 

certain challenges related to the reporting of our climate 

impact. We are working with dedicated sustainability staff 

from each business unit to improve the collection of the 

information and to define new methods, process, and records 

for identifying accurate data. We have now obtained partial 

data across the Group since the process of data collection 

started in 2018. The process has been improving gradually with 

the Sustainability Committee has been delivering training to 

staff from each business unit.

OUR APPROACH

The Group acknowledges its responsibility to preserve the 

quality of the land, water and air and actively work to protect 

and conserve the land it owns and on which it operates. Most 

of the Group’s Real Estate and Automotive &amp; Heavy Equipment

WASTE &amp; EFFLUENT 

GRI 306-2

OUR APPROACH

Yoma Strategic is raising awareness on reducing use of single 

use plastics and the importance of recycling to reduce items 

being sent to landfill. In addition to implementing guidelines 

in procurement practices to substantially reduce waste 

generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and 

reuse, the Group also advocates for the use of reusable bottles 

and jars. The Group has been part of the “Refill Not Landfill” 

campaign since 2018. 

OUR PERFORMANCE

PAPERLESS CULTURE VIA YOMA CONNECT 

  

The Group reduced the use of paper and printing by switching 

to digital forms via The Yoma Connect App. Employees can 

easily access ‘’FORMS’’ under The Yoma Portal and submit the 

digital forms related to HR, Covid-19, finance, administrative, 

and onboarding forms etc. 

According to the UK government’s conversion factors for 

carbon emissions, just 100,000 sheets of A4 paper has a carbon 

footprint of 6,000kg and requires eight trees and 2,000kWh 

of energy. The same paper recycled seven times produces 

3,200kg of carbon over its lifetime. The Group could save over 

8,000 sheets of A4 papers, or over 480 kg of carbon footprint.

WORKFORCE MOVEMENT

GRI 401-1

OUR APPROACH

Successful employee engagement is a necessary requirement 

for the Group’s ambitious growth plans and progress towards 

achieving its Mission. 2021 has been a very challenging year 

for our employees, the Group has initiated a People 2020 

Programme with the aim of caring for our employees through 

the use of a holistic approach:

HEALTH CARE

Since the Covid-19 pandemic started, medical coverage for all 

employees has been doubled. The telehealth initiative provides 

for easy online medical support in case employees need to see 

the doctors regarding any medical concerns.

COVID-19 VACCINATION 

In March 2020, the Group made the decision to allow 

employees to work from home in order to ensure the health 

and safety of staff. 

In August 2021, the Group announced the ‘’Yoma Group 

Covid-19 Vaccination Policy’’ to minimise the risk of outbreaks. 

Covid-19 vaccination is also a requirement for all Yoma Group 

employees and the aim is to have all staff vaccinated by 

1st  January 2022,  except for those with underlying medical 

conditions.  As of 31 December 2021, 99% of the employees 

were vaccinated and are back working in normal operations. 

Yoma Strategic is setting the benchmark for domestic and international companies operating in Myanmar with 

its strong commitment to be a responsible employer. From state-of-the-art workplaces in its new corporate 

headquarters, The Campus at Pun Hlaing Estate, to the working conditions and career opportunities that the Group 

brings to all parts of Myanmar, Yoma Strategic is creating a work environment that reflects the best international 

business has to offer. The Group invests in its people to build careers around a shared culture of fairness, diversity, 

empowerment and recognition. 





SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

FINANCIAL SUPPORT 

To help our employees who might be facing financial 

difficulties during this time, the Group also offered a 12-month 

loan of up to twice the employees’ monthly salary. The Group’s 

Yoma Plus programme offers installment plans which would 

allow employees to buy laptops or mobile devices. 

SAVE WELL 

A retirement savings plan for its employees was also set up 

where a portion of their salary is set aside for retirement 

purposes with the Group matching that amount for the 

employee to keep. This serves as a form of investment for 

the employee and upon retirement, the sum of money 

accumulated will be available for the employee.

YOMA CONNECT APP

Yoma Connect was also developed and all employees have 

been encouraged to download it so that the Company could 

communicate with employees, especially related to important 

announcements. New features such as Social, Chat, Portal, 

Office and Notification are added. 





TRANSPORTATION 

To facilitate transportation for employees who may need to go 

home urgently or see a doctor, the frequency of the shuttle 

bus from The Campus to the downtown area and Pun Hlaing 

Hospital has been increased.

ANARGAT PROGRAMME

In response to a Group wide employee survey in October 2020, 

the Anargat Programme (or “Future Programme”) was rolled 

out in January 2021. The Anargat Programme provides support 

to the wellbeing and family life of all employees. As part of 

this programme, a maternity leave policy offering longer leave 

options (20 weeks, 40 weeks, or up to 1 year) and guaranteeing 

employment at the end of the maternity leave, is offered to the 

Group’s female employees. This programme also includes pre- 

and post-pregnancy support counselling, as well as financial 

support for the delivery of the child. A lactation room is also 

available at The Campus to support breastfeeding mothers.

TRAINING &amp; DEVELOPMENT, TALENT RETENTION

GRI 404-1

OUR APPROACH

The Group invests in its people to build careers around a shared 

culture of fairness, diversity, empowerment and recognition. 

As such, the training, development and retention of talent in 

the organisation is very important to the Group.

Developing the Group's workforce means providing 

continuous learning opportunities for employees. Training 

and development programmes cover a wide variety of topics 

to equip its employees with the relevant knowledge and skill 

sets to achieve goals such as higher productivity, efficiency, 

and workplace harmony and also health and safety, human 

rights and sustainability-related topics. 

SUCCESSION PLANNING

In 2012, the Group made a conscious decision to build capacity 

for its local employees. The Group brought in expatriates with 

sound expertise and practical experience to guide its various 

businesses and develop the next tier of local management. By 

2018, the Group had around 200 expatriates and repatriates. 

One of the key KPIs of these expatriates and repatriates is to 

appoint a local replacement to their position within five years 

of their employment. Meeting this KPI involves the planned 

and coordinated transfer of knowledge to local staff, which 

provides unique opportunities to the Group’s local employees 

based on their individual performance, and regardless of 

gender, religion, or cultural identity. 

To support these activities, the Group has also established 

partnerships with private institutions such as the Global 

Institute For Tomorrow (“GIFT”) and the Singapore Institute of 

Management (“SIM”) to develop high impact training courses 

for the development of its future leaders.

Today, more of the Group’s younger Myanmar executives have 

built strong capabilities in their fields and have assumed 

leadership roles within the Group. Since the start of the 

Covid-19 pandemic last year, the transition accelerated and 

some of the Group’s local talent have become the promising 

new stars of the future. The Head of Group Human Resources, 

senior management teams at Yoma Land and Yoma F&amp;B, 

as well as key personnel at several corporate functions now 

consist of local managers. This localisation of management 

will ensure the continuity and leadership of the Group.

OUR TARGET (FY2022)

•  The Group will continue to employ, empower and 

promote local and internal talent, as well as adapting 

exist training programmes to prepare its workforce for 

the upcoming digitalisation of its businesses. 

•  To achieve 12 hours of training per employee in FY2022. 

DIVERSITY &amp; EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

GRI 405-1, GRI 406-1

OUR APPROACH

The Group recognises that employees are the foundation of its 

businesses and believes that a strong workforce will provide a 

better foundation to capitalise on the emerging opportunities 

in Myanmar. By nurturing their individual talents and providing 

them with opportunities for personal growth and career 

development, Yoma Strategic is helping its employees to 

realise their full potential. 

As an organisation, the Group sees itself as a catalyst to 

empowering its people to perform at their best. Yoma 

Strategic is committed to a working environment that is 

free of discrimination of any kind. As a committed nation-

builder, the Group believes that it has to lead by example 

and ensure that internationally recognised best practices are 

established early in Myanmar’s rapid development process. 

The Group is a founding member of the Business Coalition 

for Gender Equality (BCGE) and strives to be a role model to 

other companies in this regard.

BOARD DIVERSITY PLEDGE

The Board welcomes the push for greater diversity in the 

boardroom which can provide a more diverse approach to 

business decision making. The Company had, on 28 August 

2015, supported the Board Diversity Pledge initiated by 

Singapore Institute of Directors and SGX-ST where the 

Company pledged its commitment to promoting diversity as 

a key attribute of a well-functioning and effective Board and 

believes that a diverse Board will enhance decision making 

by harnessing the variety of skills, industry and business 

experiences, gender, age, ethnicity and culture, geographical 

background and nationalities, tenure of service, and other 

distinguishing qualities of the members of the Board.

MERIT-BASED EMPLOYMENT

Merit-based employment means that all Group employees are 

given the same level of opportunities to succeed, regardless 

of their background. The Group understands the importance 

of giving its people the autonomy and room to grow, both as 

individuals and as valued employees. As such, fulfilling careers 

are planned for and built upon the numerous opportunities 

constantly being generated within the Group.

OUR PERFORMANCE 

Currently, Yoma Strategic’s workforce consists of more than 

22 nationalities as well as a large and growing number of 

returnees. Female and male representation in the Group is 

approximately 43% and 57%, respectively. Since the launch of 

its training programme “Building and Maintaining a Respectful 

Workplace” in March 2019, to date, 90% of managers in the

** 

Enlarged YOMA GROUP comprises Yoma Strategic, First Myanmar Investment Public Company Limited, Serge Pun Associates 

(Myanmar) Ltd and their subsidiaries.

20 EDGE Certification is a leading global assessment methodology and business certification standard for gender equality.

Group have been trained on topics such as anti-harassment. 

No incidents of discrimination were recorded during the 

reporting period.

Respectful Workplace and Anti-harassment trainings were 

conducted for Managers by Business Coalition Gender 

Equality (BCGE). The Group uses the Economic Dividend for 

Gender Equality (“EDGE”) certification to assess the Support 

Services group and PHSH Gender policies and practices. 

Both groups have passed the certification and have action 

plans in place to further address gaps identified. Security 

Awareness &amp; Emergency Response Training was conducted 

for 80+ employees of the group who are responsible for safety 

measures. During the Covid-19 pandemic period, employees 

had to experience an emotionally challenging time. As such 

the Group introduced the Yoma Wellness (aka Thukha) - a joint 

effort between Group HR, and the Emerging Health Team at 

Pun Hlaing Hospital with the aim of educating, supporting 

and bringing awareness of the importance of mental wellness 

to all Yoma Employees. 57% of managers have attended two 

compulsory sessions: Stress &amp; Resilience and Mental Health 

Awareness. 

The Yoma Group’s 10-member Group Diversity and Inclusion 

Council, which is chaired by the Head of Group Human 

Resources and includes nine members of the Enlarged YOMA 

GROUP** Executive Committee, focuses on the following 

initiatives:

• Building Leaders - The Leading the Yoma Way Programme 

was developed to build future leadership capability. This 

6-month programme is facilitated by senior business leaders 

of the Enlarged YOMA GROUP** and comprises classroom 

learning, social learning and project learning. Since the 

programme was launched in 2018, 55 employees have since 

graduated from this programme. 

• Policies - The Group used the Economic Dividend for Gender 

Equality (EDGE)20  certification to assess the Group Support 

Services and PHSH Gender policies and practices. Both 

Groups have passed the certification and have action plans 

in place to further address gaps identified.

OUR TARGET (FY2022)

100% of managers to receive training on topic of anti-

harassment and respectful workplace. 

60% of Yoma employees to complete respectful workplace 

training programme. 

HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; LABOUR MANAGEMENT

GRI 407-1, GRI 408-1

OUR APPROACH

Labour management includes basic labour practices such 

as those described by the International Labour Organisation 

(ILO) that includes not hiring child labour or forced labour. 

This material issue also covers collective bargaining, freedom 

of association, and sub-issues such as a minimum number 

of weeks’ notice provided to employees prior to significant 

operational changes.

The Group cares for its people and their welfare. As people 

will always be a vital resource in the organisation, employees 

are treated fairly and with respect. The Group believes in 

supporting the development of an organisational structure 

and culture that promotes motivation, performance, mutual 

respect, trust and transparency. This organisational structure 

is at the forefront of ethical behaviour in Myanmar.

Yoma Strategic is aware of the human rights risks in its 

operations and supply chain, including risks of child or 

forced labour and suppliers in which the right to freedom of 

association and collective bargaining may be at risk. Yoma 

Strategic also conducts training on human rights for new 

employees and has introduced training on topics such as 

anti-discrimination and workplace bullying. 

OUR PERFORMANCE 

Trade Unions were legalised in Myanmar in 2012 and the 

Confederation of Trade Unions of Myanmar (CTUM) was 

officially recognised in 2015. It is an umbrella body with 

various federations. Currently, none of the Enlarged YOMA 

GROUP** businesses have unions. As signatories to the UN 

Global Compact, Yoma Strategic recognises employees’ right 

to belong to unions, and it also follows Myanmar labour law in 

this regard. Yoma Strategic does not ask or require employees 

to disclose if they are members of CTUM or any other Union. 

Yoma Strategic’s Human Rights Policy sets out the Group’s 

clear stance on human rights. This policy is publicly available 

on Yoma Strategic’s website at http://www.yomastrategic.com.

No cases of human rights breaches, violations or complaints 

were identified nor reported during this reporting period.

OUR TARGET (FY2022)

Maintain zero tolerance and prevent the use of child labour 

by raising awareness on how to identify children at work.

OUR PERFORMANCE 

The Group has achieved a total of 36,580 hours of health and 

safety training in 12M-Sep2021as compared to a total of 41,124 

hours in 12M-Sep2020 across the business segments of Yoma 

Land, Yoma Motors and Investments.This is approximately 11% 

fewer training hours compared to FY2020. 

Health and safety trainings relate to safety working in hot 

climates, safety at heights, safety working in confined spaces, 

handling electrical equipment, fire drills, etc. 

The injury rate for 12M-Sep2021 was an average of 0.3321 which 

is an improvement from 12M-Sep2020 rate of 1.02, while the 

lost day rate for 12M-Sep2021 was 4.6622  which is also an 

improvement from its 12M-Sep2020 rate of 7.59. The Group 

will continue to strengthen its efforts in promoting safe work 

practices across the sites. There were no fatalities or incidences 

of occupational diseases.

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY 

GRI 403-2

OUR APPROACH

Providing a healthy and safe work environment for employees, 

customers, business partners and visitors is one of Yoma 

Strategic’s top priorities. Every employee has a personal 

responsibility to support this commitment. Employees are 

obligated to carry out their work in a safe manner, without 

causing harm to themselves or others and to report any 

potentially unsafe or unhealthy situations immediately. 

They must observe and follow all safety and environmental 

regulations laid down in the operational instructions, including 

putting on the necessary safety equipment, where applicable.

Any health and safety accidents or incidents as well as 

occupational health &amp; safety inspections, food safety 

inspections and health cases of the Group are registered 

according to the type of case, and incident. These are 

consolidated into a monthly report and reviewed by Risk 

Management and Assurance team, as part of the overall risk 

assessment process. 

MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATION

Key policies include:

•  Code of Conduct

•  Environmental, Health and Safety Policy

In line with IFC's Performance Standards, FMO's Sustainability 

Policy Framework and ADB's Safeguard Policy, national 

environmental policies and other applicable laws, the Group 

is required to safeguard the health and safety by: 

1.  incorporating environmental and social considerations into 

business strategy, and allocating adequate resources to 

manage EH&amp;S risks associated with projects;

2.  promoting a safe, clean and healthy environment and 

better work culture to minimise any adverse environment, 

health, safety and social impacts arising out of operations;

3.  establishing an EH&amp;S system and processes to adhere to 

and comply with applicable legislation, regulations and

essential for employees to be prepared to implement the plan 

effectively and efficiently in the event of an actual crisis:

OUR TARGET (FY2022)

Promote safe work practices across the business segments 

and reduce the number workplace injuries. 

OUR COMMUNITY 

Since the beginning of 2020, Myanmar has faced 

unprecedented times. The Covid-19 pandemic as well 

as substantial uncertainty in the economic and business 

23 https://www.undp.org/press-releases/pandemic-and-political-crisis-could-result-half-myanmars-population-living-poverty

environment since February 1st has had and will continue to 

have a significant impact on the people of Myanmar.

With the closures of factories, restaurants and businesses, 83% 

of households in Myanmar reported a reduction of incomes 

by almost half due to the pandemic alone. The continued 

closures of businesses is expected to increase the number of 

people living under the poverty line. According to a report by 

the UNDP on April 30, 202123, if left unmanaged, nearly half 

of Myanmar’s population may live below the poverty line by 

early 2022. This level of poverty has not been seen since 2005.

The Group challenges itself in building a better Myanmar for 

its people. With a deep sense of purpose, the Group not only 

aims to deliver superior returns for our investors, employees, 

customers and partners, but also add value to the people of 

Myanmar.

Yoma Strategic gives back to the community through its 

donations and voluntary work. In FY2021, Group employees 

collectively achieved 5,085 hours of volunteer work. Yoma 

Strategic provided food and essential supplies to over 320,000 

people in Myanmar and contributed for social causes such as 

emergency relief (medicine, oxygen tanks) during Covid-19 as 

well as other community programmes. Some examples are 

highlighted below.

FOOD DONATION 

In October 2020, the Group's F&amp;B Businesses reached out 

to over 500 families providing essential supplies. Supplies 

provided including rice, oil, salt, potatoes, eggs, sardines, 

noodles, masks, hand sanitizers, onions, garlic, and vitamin C. 

The supplies were hand delivered by KOSPA volunteers to the 

people in Thilawa and Mingalardon.

In November 2020, in conjunction with Yoma Bank, Step-

in Step-up donated care packages consisting of medical, 

healthcare and food supplies to Daing Su and Nyaung villages 

in Hlaing Thar Yar Township. The donation yielded direct 

benefits to over 11,000 individuals, most of whom are day 

workers and unemployed due to the pandemic.

In December 2020, the Group provided provisions for over 

306,000 people in need by delivering over 6,502 kg of 

chicken. Meals were cooked and loaded up onto trishaws and 

distributed house to house. The children were very excited 

to be eating chicken once again after many months of not 

being able to afford chicken. For this project, the Group was 

able to reach as far south as Dawei and Myeik, as far north as 

Taungyi and Nay Pyi Taw, and the regions around Yangon, 

Thanlyn, Mingalardon, Hlaing Tha Yar, Taikyi and Shwe Pyi 

Thar. The Group's focus was the vulnerable, including women, 

children, the handicapped, the elderly, and those with mental 

health illnesses. During this time, chicken was delivered to 

community kitchens and food centers to cook meals for those 

in quarantine facilities and Covid-19 hospitals. 

The Group also continued to donate food, with over 2,700 kg 

of chicken and fish donated to those in need. Recognising 

the tough times, even for our  employees, food such as fish 

and chicken was provided to Yoma’s staff to share with their 

family, friends, and neighbours. The Group, with the support 

of KOSPA, was able to provide meals for 10,990 members of 

the community, and donated over 10 tonnes of food to over 

318,000 people around Myanmar. 

THE FIGHT AGAINST MALARIA

Various Enlarged YOMA GROUP companies are partners of 

M2030, a movement launched by the Asia Pacific Leaders 

Malaria Alliance (APLMA) to eliminate malaria in Asia by 

2030. The existing M2030 partners include Pun Hlaing 

Siloam Hospitals, Wave Money, Volkswagen, New Holland, 

KFC, YKKO and Yoma Micro Power. Funds are raised annually 

for the M2030 campaign which support malaria elimination 

programmes implemented by the Population Services 

International Myanmar, one of the leading non-profit 

organisations fighting malaria in the country.

STEP-IN STEP-UP PROGRAMME

Yoma Group supports Step-in Step-up, a Vocational Training 

Association based in Hlaing Thar Yar Township.  Step-in Step-

up’s primary focus is on making a difference to the lives of the 

young and vulnerable.  

With its livelihood tailored training, Step-in Step-up focuses 

on preparing local youth for entry level jobs.  To date, Step-in 

Step-up has delivered and sourced employment for over 300 

men and women from the age of 18 and above, with 93% of 

the candidates completing the training to date successfully in 

securing long-term employment.  Up to 85% of the graduates 

are still working in their current employment after 12 months, 

with 6% of the candidates inspired to go back to school or 

embark on a course of further education.  

During their training, Step-in Step-up interns work in key 

frontline positions at Pun Hlaing Hospital, Yoma F&amp;B, Memories 

Group and Pun Hlaing Estate. Interns also volunteered at the 

quarantine centres within Daing Su and Nyaung Villages.

TARGET (FY2022) 

Contribute average 2 volunteer hours per employee

Continue implementing community investment programmes.
