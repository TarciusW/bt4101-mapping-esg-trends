The Group is committed to conducting business 

responsibly through high standards of corporate 

governance, 

environmental 

sustainability, 

and 

stakeholder engagement. With that in mind, we are 

delighted to publish our first sustainability report 

for FY2018.  

We value our customers immensely and achieving 

customer satisfaction, confidence and trust are of 

utmost importance. At Epicentre, we are constantly 

trying to enhance our services and improve our 

customer’s experience with us. Through our report, 

we aim to provide greater transparency of our 

sustainability performance and bring our customers 

and stakeholders on this sustainable journey with 

us. 

ENVIRONMENT  

As an environmentally conscious organisation, we 

aim to minimise the negative impact of our business 

on the environment. As a retail service provider, one 

of the key areas of concern is energy consumption. 

The electricity usage across all retail stores is 

consolidated and reviewed at Group level on a 

regular basis before they are presented to the Audit 

Committee and the Board.  We understand the role 

we can play to protect our environment and 

encourage our employees to adopt good practices 

in our day-to-day operations.  

SOCIAL 

For 

Epicentre, 

sustainability 

extends 

beyond 

protecting the environment. It is reflected and 

integrated into our corporate governance and 

workplace practice.  

It is our priority to create a safe and conducive work 

environment for our valued employees. They form 

the foundation of our businesses and we endeavor 

to provide training and development opportunities 

to help them perform to the best of their abilities. 

We are proud to have a culture, which fosters 

growth and encourages personal as well as 

professional development.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

GOVERNANCE 

Our senior management leads our sustainability 

agenda. They help align our business strategy with 

our sustainability targets. We also understand that 

in the journey of sustainable business operations, 

stakeholder engagement plays a critical role. The 

senior management communicates with our key 

stakeholders regularly and addresses their areas of 

concerns to create long-term value.  

In addition to the Group’s organic growth initiatives, 

the Group has also been exploring various 

opportunities to diversify its current business 

portfolio. The Group will continue to evaluate 

potential acquisitions that could strengthen and 

broaden its revenue base and help to position the 

Group strategically for further growth. 

We want to thank our stakeholders for their 

continued support and look forward to sharing our 

sustainability 

performance 

and 

goals 

in 

the 

forthcoming years.

Picture of Japan IPL Outlet

The Group was set up in 2002 with our 

headquarters 

in 

Singapore 

and 

operations 

extending to serve markets in Malaysia as well. On 

18 January 2008, the Group was listed on the 

Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited (SGX-ST). 

Our goal is to offer the best quality service to our 

customers who have high expectations when it 

comes to the quality and efficacy of services. Since 

our inception, we have established ourselves as one 

of Singapore’s leading lifestyle retail companies. To 

date, we operate six Epicentre stores in Malaysia; 

and twelve Japan IPL stores in Singapore, Malaysia 

and China.  

In 2017, we acquired a 51 percent equity interest in 

Japan IPL Holdings Pte Ltd and its subsidiaries (“JIPL 

Group”).  

The acquisition of JIPL Group represents a strategic 

development of the Group’s business to diversify its 

business and revenue stream. 

JIPL Group, as Singapore’s first unisex IPL centre, 

offers both skin treatment and permanent hair 

removal services. JIPL Group promises to provide 

professional and high quality of service to establish 

reputation and trust among the customers. Our 

goal is to establish Japan IPL as a firm and 

trustworthy brand.  

Currently, there are 12 outlets in Singapore, 

Malaysia and China (9 outlets in Singapore, 2 

outlets in Malaysia and 1 outlet in Beijing China). It 

also has 2 franchises in the Philippines. JIPL Group 

plans to continue expanding in Singapore and 

Malaysia market by opening new outlets.

Epicentre believes in inculcating good sustainability 

practices in our staff and across all our operations. 

This is reflected in our Group’s governance 

approach as well as the vision and mission 

statement. 

Governance 

Our senior management ensures that the Group’s 

business 

objectives 

are 

in 

line 

with 

our 

commitments to sustainable development leads our 

sustainability efforts. They are also responsible for 

on-going communication with internal and external 

stakeholders. 

Epicentre’s sustainability management comes under 

the purview of the Sustainability Committee, 

compromising the independent directors and the 

representatives from all the business units. In 

respect of the individual committee members, an 

evaluation was carried out by the Board and the 

members were elected by the Board when 

establishing the Sustainability Committee. The 

sustainability performance is reviewed at least once 

a year by the Sustainability Committee and 

endorsed by the Board during the Board meeting. 

The Sustainability Committee guides and reviews 

the sustainability performance and progress of 

different functions as demonstrated below.  

 

 

 

 

Vision and Mission 

Our values as a company underpin our high 

standards of ethical conduct. We respect human 

rights, embrace diversity and stand firm against 

corruption. This is core to who we are as a business 

and essential to our sustainable growth. We have a 

staff manual reflecting our expectations on staff 

conduct, primarily on customer data privacy. All 

employees are given a copy of the staff manual 

upon joining the company to ensure they are 

familiar with the Group’s expectations on ethical 

and professional conduct. 

 

Supply chain 

We have 22 main vendors from the local market (i.e. 

Singapore and Malaysia) to ensure efficient supply 

of the high-quality products. We have overseas 

vendors (e.g. China and India) to fulfil certain 

specific products or services to our customers.  

We target to provide our customers with high-

quality product, beauty services, and therefore 

collaborate with reliable suppliers with whom we 

share good long-term relationship.

In order to identify our sustainability aspects and 

topics, we believe it is critical to engage our

the issues that are important to our stakeholders 

and address their concerns while evolving our 

business policies and strategies. 

We identified and selected our key stakeholders 

based 

on

The key material issues identified during the 

materiality assessment process have developed the 

content of this report. Our approach to materiality 

assessment involved identification, prioritisation, 

and validation of the material issues.  

We conducted a thorough peer benchmarking 

exercise and established a list of issues deemed 

material by them. We then further prioritised these 

topics by their importance to our key stakeholders 

and the environmental, social and economic impact 

of our business. The selected topics were then 

endorsed by the senior management and the Board.

Corporate Governance 

GRI 102-18 

Why It Matters? 

The Group believes strong corporate governance is 

critical to the long-term success of the organisation 

and forms the foundation for the trust that our 

shareholders have placed in us to protect their 

interests. 

Beyond 

the 

basis 

for 

regulatory 

compliance, 

we 

believe 

strong 

corporate 

governance also translates to more robust risk 

management 

systems 

and 

better 

business 

performance. 

 

 

How We Approach It 

The Group has a Sustainability Committee in place 

to ensure all strategies, policies and practices have 

been incorporated and the Sustainability Committee 

reports to the board of directors ("the Board") on all 

sustainability matters.  

At 

the 

same 

time, 

the 

Board 

and 

senior 

management 

regularly 

review 

business 

and 

operational activities to identify areas of business 

risks as well as to take appropriate measures to 

control and mitigate these risks.  

The Board also assess and determines the nature 

and extent of significant risks that they are willing to 

take to meet their strategic goals. 

On an annual basis, the Board reviews the adequacy 

and effectiveness of risk management and internal 

control systems. 

For more details on our Corporate Governance 

policies and procedures please refer to the 

Corporate Governance Report section of Epicentre 

Holdings Limited Annual Report FY2018. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our FY2018 Performance 

The Board meets on a regular basis and engages 

our continuing sponsor to ensure that the Group 

meets all regulatory requirements.  

 

Our Target for FY2019 

We strive to actively engage our continuing sponsor 

to remain compliant with all reporting requirements 

under the Catalist Rules as well as other rules and 

regulations in Singapore.

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 401-1 

Why It Matters? 

The core asset of Epicentre is our people, who 

shape the experiences of thousands of our 

customers every day. It is therefore imperative for 

us to invest and support their professional 

development, which in turn will enable us to deliver 

the highest standard of service and support the 

growth of our business. We also recognise the role 

of the organisation in contributing to job creation 

and wealth generation for the local economy. 

 

How We Approach It 

The Group understands the importance of job 

satisfaction, as it lowers turnover rates and increases 

productivity. Employees are entitled to a variety of 

benefits, such as medical leave and paid annual 

leave. 

The management along with the Human Resources 

("HR") department conducts a regular review 

regarding the benefits and compensation package 

for 

our 

employees. 

The 

review 

takes 

into 

consideration 

the 

specific 

job 

scope 

and 

responsibility of each staff to ensure all our 

employees retain high satisfaction in terms of the 

remuneration 

package. 

HR 

performs 

routine 

interview for all full-time employees. All the 

employees are encouraged to share problems 

encounter regarding work, colleagues, supervisor 

and customers. HR also interviews resigning staff as 

part of the resignation process to improve the 

retention policies. 

We provide our employees with training and 

development 

opportunities 

to 

help 

in 

their 

professional development. This allows them to offer 

high-quality services to our customers. All full-time 

staffs are required to attend at least one learning 

event every year hosted internally or externally. All 

the employees are also encouraged to share 

knowledge with each other during working hours.  

We provide our employees with a safe and healthy 

work environment across all our outlets.   

 

 

 

Our FY2018 Performance 

The highlights of our employment performance are 

presented below. 

Total new hire rate1 

66% 

Total turnover rate1 

70% 

 

Due to the labour-intensive retail industry in 

Malaysia that Epicentre is in, as well as large 

number of non-executive staff, the staff movement 

whilst significant, was normal. In FY2018, the staff 

turnover of Japan IPL was 22.4%, which is close to 

the national average of 21.6% in Singapore.  

Please see Appendix on page 13 for further 

breakdown of our social indicator performance. 

 

Our Target for FY2019 

We aim to decrease our turnover rate by at least 

20% through team bonding activities and training 

and development opportunities for our employees. 

 

 

1 The employment performance excludes Singapore Headquarter 

and disposed Singapore business (i.e. the “Epicentre” retail 

business of selling Apple brand and complementary products in 

Singapore which was held by Epicentre Pte, Ltd).

Inclusive and Diverse Workforce 

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 405-1 

 

Why it Matters? 

 

At Epicentre, we believe an inclusive workforce 

allows individuals to contribute effectively while 

providing 

the 

organisation 

with 

diverse 

perspectives, skills and talents. We are committed to 

gender diversity and in creating an inclusive and 

harmonious 

work 

environment 

for 

all 

our 

employees. This also plays a key role in motivating 

the 

employee 

to 

consistently 

improve 

their 

capabilities and contribute to the continued growth 

of the organisation.  

 

How We Approach It 

We provide equal opportunity to all employees 

regardless of gender, age, nationality, religion, 

sexual orientation, disability, or another aspect of 

diversity.  

The HR department performs a regular review of 

the 

current 

employment 

of 

each 

operating 

segment. This helps to prevent any gender and age 

discrimination of each outlet within the Group.  

During the hiring process, our HR aims to cultivate 

an inclusive culture where employees with wide-

ranging backgrounds and qualities are hired and 

nurtured into a highly motivated, engaged and 

connected 

workforce. 

Whilst 

we 

expect 

our 

employees to constantly challenge and improve 

themselves, we also require our employees to treat 

each other with respect and honesty. 

 

Employees 

have 

the 

discretion 

to 

air 

their 

grievances on unfair labour practices and we have a 

system in place to ensure incident of discrimination 

is heard and handled in a fair and appropriate 

manner.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our FY2018 Performance 

We are proud to affirm that during the reporting 

period, 

we 

have 

received 

zero 

reports 

of 

discrimination. 

Please see Appendix on page 14 for further 

breakdown of our social indicator performance 

 

Our Target for FY2019 

We aim to improve the gender ratio of our 

employees and create a greater gender balance 

within the Group.

Energy 

GRI 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 302-1 

Why It Matters? 

Globally, companies are playing a more active role 

in moving towards a low carbon economy and 

combatting the negative impacts of climate change, 

with the reduction of carbon emissions from 

electricity consumption as one urgent call-to-action. 

At Epicentre, we take our role as a responsible 

corporate citizen seriously. We are conscious of the 

impact of our energy consumption at each of our 

outlets and in the countries of our operations and 

are committed to reducing our carbon footprint. By 

ensuring our operations are conducted in a 

sustainable, cost-effective and responsible manner, 

we believe our commitment can contribute to the 

international 

momentum 

to 

reduce 

carbon 

emissions.  

 

How We Approach It? 

We are committed to take measures to minimise 

our overall energy consumption and improve 

energy efficiency to reduce the environmental 

impact of our operations. We believe that every 

little step goes a long way towards sustaining a 

clean and green environment, and at the same time 

help to improve efficiencies and deliver cost 

effectiveness for the Group.  

To minimise energy usage, we ensure there is no 

additional energy wasted during off-business hours. 

We conduct weekly meetings to ensure all our 

outlet employees are aware of the initiatives and 

adhere to them. During the meeting, we educate 

our staffs about energy usage and what they should 

achieve. We ensure light switches are properly 

labelled, so that the staff can choose only what are 

needed in the outlets during business hours. The 

last staff that leaves the outlets has to ensure all the 

lights and equipment are switched off. In most of 

the outlets, the occupancy sensors are installed in 

staff-only areas and stock room to minimize the 

excess energy consumption. Moving ahead, the 

management and the Board plan to review our 

energy consumption at least once a year.  

 

 

 

Our FY2018 Performance 

Our energy consumption is from our electricity 

usage at our outlets. These are measured by 

tracking the utility bills. Currently, we do not have 

any non-renewable sources of energy consumption.  

 

Our energy performance for the current financial 

year is presented below. 

 

Energy Consumption2 

198,323 kWh  

 

 

Our Target for FY2019 

As part of our initiatives, we will consider energy 

efficient 

equipment 

when 

purchasing 

new 

equipments in our retail outlets and our office.We 

aim to reduce our electriity consumption by 5% in 

the next 3 years.   

 

 

 

2 The 

energy 

consumption

excludes 

Singapore 

Headquarter and disposed Singapore business (i.e. the “Epicentre” 

retail business of selling Apple brand and complementary products 

in Singapore which was held by Epicentre Pte, Ltd).
