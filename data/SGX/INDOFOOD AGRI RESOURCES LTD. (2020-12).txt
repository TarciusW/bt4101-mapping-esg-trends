OUR NINTH ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT ON 

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE 

PERFORMANCE IS GUIDED BY OUR LATEST 

MATERIALITY REVIEW AND HAS BEEN APPROVED 

BY THE INDOAGRI BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 

2020 has been an extraordinary year, with the emergence 

of a pandemic that caught the world by surprise and 

catalysed changes in the ways we work and live overnight. 

Companies and entire industries have been forced to 

confront their exposure to risks and make fundamental 

changes to adapt. 

As an agribusiness and palm oil company, our products 

continue to be essential in feeding communities during this 

pandemic. We have remained resilient in the face of great 

uncertainty, preserving business continuity while ensuring 

that the health and safety of our workers remain of utmost 

importance. A dedicated COVID-19 Response section has 

been included in our report this year. It features our efforts 

in protecting our workers and local communities while 

ensuring the resilience of our supply chain. 

Even as we respond to changes on the ground, we are 

planning for the post-pandemic world. This year, we 

conducted a desktop materiality review to re-examine our 

material topics and their relevance and significance to our 

business and stakeholders. Our new list of 15 key material 

topics, up from 10, highlight our evolving sustainability 

priorities. The addition of pandemic resilience as a material 

topic reflects the seriousness with which we view the current 

pandemic and future pandemic preparedness.

We remain committed to sustainability through challenging 

times. With our revised set of material topics, we have 

revisited existing targets and set new ones, including 

water and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. We 

recognise the potential impacts of a changing climate on 

our business and communities and take steps to contribute 

to climate change mitigation and adaptation, be it through 

increasing our use of renewable energy, conducting R&amp;D 

on seeds resistant to extreme weather conditions, or 

engaging communities through our PROKLIM projects to 

protect water sources and strengthen food security.  

In a year of difficulty, we celebrate successes at every 

step. KUD Teratai Biru, a smallholder cooperative with 183 

members, received ISPO certification, making it the first of 

our cooperatives to be ISPO-certified. By 2025, we target 

to ensure that 100% of CPO we refine is ISPO-certified. 

2020 has reminded us that the health, wellbeing and safety 

of people cannot be taken for granted. We regret to report 

one fatality in 2020. We have investigated the incident 

thoroughly, implemented corrective action, and are 

supporting the family and colleagues affected. We remain 

committed to our goal of zero fatalities every year. We 

are also committed to conducting our business activities 

responsibly, ethically and in full compliance with prevailing 

rules and regulations and Indonesian Law, whilst fully 

respecting workers’ rights. We are committed to ensuring 

that the rights of all people working in our operations are 

respected and represented, as set out in our Labour Policy. 

We recognise our responsibility to positively impact the 

lives of those working in and surrounding our operations. 

As we reflect on the turbulence of 2020, one element that 

remained persistent was the resilience and commitment of 

our people. Our Board remains grateful to our employees, 

communities and stakeholders for braving through such 

unprecedented times with us.

With 2020 now behind us, IndoAgri will carry forward the 

lessons learnt from the challenges of the crisis to remain agile 

and prepared for major disruptions. IndoAgri continues to 

be steadfast in our commitment to sustainability as we join 

the rest of the world to collectively build back better.

OUR COVID-19 RESPONSE

Introduction

2020 was an extremely challenging year with the COVID-19 

pandemic that affected businesses and supply chains 

worldwide. As the pandemic situation evolved over the 

months, IndoAgri has kept up to date with the latest 

developments and responded accordingly to achieve the 

best possible outcomes for all stakeholders. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges 

and induced new ways of operating for many companies.

Being a “stress-test” for bigger disruptions such as climate 

change, IndoAgri has taken steps this year to adapt to 

the new normal and prepare itself for future disruptions, 

including disease outbreaks. 

In this section, we explain our plans to build pandemic 

resilience while caring for the wellbeing of our stakeholders.

Pandemic resilience

RISK MANAGEMENT, BUSINESS CONTINUITY 

AND SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE

We have included pandemics as our material issue 

and as part of our regular Enterprise Risk Management 

(ERM) process. The key risk posed by pandemics such 

as COVID-19 is the spread of the virus in IndoAgri’s 

business units, that could affect employees’ health and 

lead to the closure of operations.

COVID-19 has further compounded existing risks in 

our risk profile, such as weakening CPO prices due to 

falling demand, the weakening value of the Indonesian 

Rupiah, and the slowdown in sales of refinery products. 

We remain vigilant of these risks, and continue to closely 

monitor them as the pandemic develops. 

Our ERM functions work together with relevant 

departments to minimise, if not eliminate, the impact 

of this risk on IndoAgri’s business. For example, to 

secure the safety of our employees and the continuity 

of our operations, we monitor the health conditions 

of all employees across all our operations daily and 

constantly remind them of preventive measures. 

Working closely with our vendors, we continue to plan 

ahead and monitor the availability of necessary supplies 

to minimise disruptions. 

As more consumers moved from purchasing at physical 

stores to online retail, we introduced new mediums of 

retailing our EOF products, offering home deliveries via 

distributors online (see page 55 in the Product section). 

Many of our operations have moved online where 

possible, including our internal audits which were modified to 

facilitate remote auditing.

Our teams have also developed plans to manage the 

transfer of operations across all our mills, factories and 

refineries, in the event that confirmed COVID-19 cases at 

a particular operating unit cause a temporary shutdown of 

operations. We are in the midst of updating our business 

continuity plans to include a more comprehensive scenario 

for future pandemics.  

HEALTH OF WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES

To manage risks on the ground, IndoAgri established a 

cross-organisational COVID-19 Task Force to coordinate 

and manage the day-to-day prevention and handling 

of COVID-19. There is a clear line of communication 

from the teams at each business unit (head offices, 

regional offices, estates, mills and factories) to the head 

of the Task Force. This way, up-to-date information 

can be communicated both ways, to ensure that all 

our operations are fully prepared to respond to the 

evolving situation – be it remaining in-compliance with 

government regulations or ensuring that our employees 

and their families are healthy and safe. 

The main responsibility of the Task Force is to facilitate 

the implementation of programmes to prevent 

and handle COVID-19, in compliance with regional 

and central government regulations. In addition to 

continuous daily monitoring of employees, workers 

and their families’ health conditions and whereabouts, 

the Task Force also renders prompt assistance and 

carry out contact tracing in the event of confirmed 

COVID-19 cases. 



IndoAgri has implemented standard operating 

procedures for employees who test positive for 

COVID-19, from the start of their diagnosis until 

they return to work. All employees confirmed 

to be COVID-19 positive are required to 

undergo treatment for as long as is necessary 

for them to recover. Employees’ conditions are 

monitored throughout the recovery period by 

the COVID-19 Task Force team until their PCR 

(polymerase chain reaction) test results return 

negative. Employees are given an additional 

seven days of rest before a final PCR test is 

performed. If this test result returns negative as 

well, they are allowed to return to work.

We continue to monitor our parent company, 

Indofood, and the Indonesian Government’s 

COVID-19 handling directives to ensure we 

keep our workers and communities healthy 

and protected.

permission letter from Management as well as 

test negative on a rapid COVID-19 test before 

they are allowed to enter any estate. 

STANDING IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS

Sunaryo Sitopu, Administration Staff at the Lonsum 

office in Medan, North Sumatra, never imagined 

that he would be infected with COVID-19. What 

he initially thought were symptoms of the common 

cold eventually gave way to days of stomach 

churning, diarrhoea, and eventually losing his 

sense of smell. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) 

swab test confirmed that he was COVID-19-

positive.

IndoAgri’s COVID-19 Task Force teams took swift 

action to care and support Sunaryo and his family. 

Sunaryo’s initial PCR swab test was done at a 

reputable lab, with a referral from the Company. 

He subsequently was directed to one of the 

Company’s top partner hospitals, experienced in 

treating COVID-19 patients, for hospitalisation and 

recovery. IndoAgri also facilitated PCR swab tests 

for his entire household.

Sunaryo was grateful for the quality of care 

provided by the Company for COVID-19 patients 

like himself. Even after he was declared to be 

recovered, the Company’s doctors continued 

to monitor his condition and respond to any 

complaints that arose.

“I was given adequate rest time to recover, as well 

as supplements and vitamins to speed up recovery. 

I continued to receive a full salary over the course 

of my medical leave.

The Sustainability Think Tank comprises Executive 

Directors, Chief Operating Officers, the ERM unit, the 

R&amp;D team, and sustainability representatives from each 

business unit. Prior to writing the Sustainability Report 

every year, the Sustainability Think Tank conducts a 

review of IndoAgri’s material topics accounting for the 

UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Of the 17 

SDGs, we have identified 13 of particular relevance to 

us, which we contribute towards through our Policy and 

programmes, see page 08.

In FY2020, we conducted a desktop materiality review 

with the help of an independent consultant to ensure 

that our material issues remain relevant to IndoAgri 

and aligned with stakeholder expectations, industry 

developments as well as global and local sustainability 

agendas. We introduced five new material topics as 

well as refreshed existing terminology to better reflect 

the significance of these topics to IndoAgri and increase 

alignment with industry peers. Our new list of 15 material 

topics were validated by the Board and can be found on 

page 08. 

Our sustainability performance is evaluated using progress 

against targets, see pages 12-13. ISPO certification for 

our oil palm operations and the Indonesian Government’s 

Programme for Pollution Control, Evaluation, and Rating 

(PROPER) environmental initiative help us to deliver 

performance on governance, no deforestation, land 

rights, no new planting on peatland regardless of depth, 

A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

Our approach to sustainability is supported by our Vision, 

Mission, Values, Code and Policies that commit us to 

responsible business practices and the highest standards 

of quality and conduct. Our management approach and 

six programmes show how we manage the risks and 

opportunities of our material topics, as detailed on page 08.  

They translate into action in the form of management 

systems and standard operational procedures (SOPs), 

certifications, external engagement, internal collaboration, 

R&amp;D, and training. We use an SAP enterprise data and 

sustainability information system to assess progress against 

targets. We continuously review and update our approach 

to align with emerging topics and global developments.

GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS FOR 

SUSTAINABILITY

We apply the precautionary principle in managing our 

material ESG topics; we are committed to preventing 

undesirable impacts, for which we hold ourselves 

accountable, and we seek alternatives in a risk-based 

manner, as appropriate. Our Board oversees the 

management and monitoring of our material ESG topics. 

At our quarterly Board Meetings, senior leaders of our 

Sustainability Think Tank, led by the CEO, report on 

sustainability performance, provide updates on recent 

sustainability developments, and share decisions made 

in response to these developments. Our Audit and Risk 

Management Committee receives a quarterly update on 

material sustainability risks and related concerns.

RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

and gratification. Our whistleblowing policy enables 

employees to raise any concerns without fear of reprisal. 

More information on our whistleblowing policy can be 

found in our Annual Report.

Our approach on key sustainability focus areas



IndoAgri takes a strident approach, actively monitoring 

hotspots and engaging stakeholders on fire prevention.

To minimise our environmental footprint, we also 

proactively manage our use of resources and disposal of 

waste. All our interactions with water (water withdrawal, 

consumption and effluent discharge) are governed by 

Indonesian government permits, and we reuse 100% of our 

milling waste. To ensure that oil palm is grown efficiently 

with minimal impact on the environment, we are constantly 

finding ways to reduce our use of fertilisers, pesticides and 

chemicals, replacing inorganic, chemical substances with 

natural, biological controls. 

 

We believe that environmental protection can only be 

achieved with cooperation across the value chain. As 

outlined in our Policy, we expect our suppliers to comply 

with our sustainability standards. Our ERM framework and 

whistle-blowing mechanisms help to ensure compliance 

with relevant environmental regulations, and to mitigate 

the associated risks.

IndoAgri is aware of the risks and opportunities that climate 

change may pose to the ecosystems, communities, and the 

agribusiness supply chain. Environmental challenges arising 

from climate change, such as water scarcity and unpredictable 

weather patterns, may further disrupt the industry’s traditional 

models and crop yields. In the face of climate and socio-

economic ‘disruptors’, agribusinesses must innovate to 

address changing needs and demands, through developing 

both mitigation and adaptation solutions. We are taking steps 

to increase our use of renewable energy, improve energy 

efficiency, and reduce GHG emissions, while engaging in R&amp;D 

to produce seeds resistant to extreme weather conditions. 

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

As a leading agribusiness company, we recognise the 

role we play in conserving and protecting our natural 

resources. Guided by our Sustainable Agriculture Policy, 

we are committed to minimising negative impacts on the 

environment and to consuming resources responsibly 

throughout our value chain. In protecting forests, peatlands 

and biodiversity, we regularly evaluate environmental risks 

and the value of ecosystems as well actively conserve HCS 

and HCV areas. 

Forest fires and resulting haze occurrences severely impact 

the health of local and global ecosystems and communities. 



RESPONSIBLE SOURCING

Transparency in the supply chain and responsible sourcing 

practices are increasingly important to customers as 

their own operations and procurement come under 

scrutiny. Commercial success depends on our customers 

having confidence in our products and their origins. We 

are committed to excellence in supply chain relations 

to encourage transparent, responsible, and profitable 

practices. We regularly engage with our suppliers to ensure 

that expectations are communicated. Assessments and 

audits of our supply chain are also carried out on a routine 

Workers sort and inspect fresh fruit bunches (FFB) at Begerpang Mill,

The white buttercup (Turnera subulata), is part of our integrated pest

The eight “core” ILO Conventions ratified by Indonesia are:

i. 

Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29);

ii. 

Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to 

Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87);

iii. Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 

1949 (No. 98);

iv. Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100);

v. 

Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105);

vi. Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 

1958 (No. 111);

vii. Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138);

viii. Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182).

All IndoAgri employees are paid above the minimum wage of 

their respective regions, which are determined by regional 

governments, taking into account the sector, cost of living in 

each province, and collective labour agreement in that region. 

This ensure all our workers receive a decent living wage. We 

also provide all permanent employees and their families 

with additional free benefits such as housing, healthcare 

and education to ensure a decent living wage. We support 

employees’ rights to collective bargaining. Employees are 

free to register themselves with their preferred labour union.

We are committed to providing safe workplaces for our 

thousands of employees across Indonesia. We have a 

rigorous OHS management system in place to minimise 

negative health impacts and prevent accidents. All our 

sites are equipped with SMK3 (Indonesian OHS standard) 

management systems and undergo SMK3 refresher trainings 

every year to ensure day-to-day compliance across all 

sites. In addition, workers are reminded of safety standard 

operating procedures before they start work every morning.

We encourage professional development and the upskilling 

of our workforce through Training and Development 

programmes. This provides career progression opportunities 

for our employees and meets our needs for skilled, capable 

human resources.

PEOPLE

The well-being and development of our workers is 

fundamental to our success. Our Sustainable Agriculture 

Policy and Labour Policy outline our commitment to respect 

and protect the rights of our workers, comply with the 

Indonesian law as well as the UN Universal Declaration on 

Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation 

(ILO) codes of practice ratified by the Republic of Indonesia2. 

We aim to provide our workers with stable incomes, safe 

working environments, and improved job opportunities. We 

take strict, actionable measures to ensure no forced labour 

or child labour on any of our sites.

basis. and work with our smallholders to help them develop 

capacity and improve quantity and quality of yield. 

To establish the traceability of each tonne of palm oil, 

we record the following: 

• Name, parent company, address

• GeoCoordinates of plantation1 and mill

• Nucleus or plasma KUD/kelompok profile and data

• Refinery dispatch number

• Certification status

In the agribusiness industry, third-party sustainability 

certifications guide the implementation of best-practice and 

provide assurance to our stakeholders. ISPO certification, 

developed and mandated by the Indonesian Government, is a 

key component in delivering on our Policy and commitments. 

As part of our commitment to responsible sourcing, we aim 

to have 100% of our mills and estates ISPO certified by 2023. 

In Indonesia, smallholders account for more than 40% 

of all oil palm cultivated. IndoAgri recognises the crucial 

role smallholders play in the palm oil industry, and hence 

we support and engage our smallholders through various 

capacity building and training programs. We also assist the 

smallholders we work with to obtain the ISPO certification.

Improving our yields, including those of our smallholders, 

is vitally important as it brings higher revenues and reduces 

pressure on additional land conversion and resource use. 

Building the resilience of our crops against possible climate 

change impacts has also become a key priority. We engage 

in continuous R&amp;D to improve our agronomy techniques 

and increase our seed yield and quality.

COMMUNITY RELATIONS

As a large palm oil company with operations in rural 

Indonesia, we recognise our ability to positively impact 

the lives of those living in and surrounding our areas of 

operation. We respect the rights of our communities and 

maintain strong relations with them, to ensure that we 

address their needs and concerns. 

In addition to our compliance with the Indonesian law as 

well as the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights 

and the ILO codes of practice ratified by the Republic of 

Indonesia, we are committed to respecting the FPIC rights 

of indigenous people whenever our operations impact 

them.

We aim to empower local communities and achieve 

inclusive growth that improves their quality of life. Our 

Work and Estate Living Programme ensures that needs of 

the community and local governments are met through 

economic development. Under this programme, we also 

provide access to healthcare and education.

PRODUCT INTEGRITY

Due to its versatility, palm oil is used extensively across 

thousands of edible and non-edible products. As such, 

product quality and safety are crucial to our commercial 

success. Our Quality Policy and Sustainable Agriculture Policy 

hold us to high standards of product quality, process safety, 

as well as the implementation of food safety management

OIL PALM: OUR PRINCIPAL CROP











As of 31 December 2020, 16% of our total planted oil palm 

estate areas of 253,061 hectares were immature estates. The 

average age of our oil palm trees is 16 years, of which 18% 

are under seven years old, a key attribute for our future CPO 

production.

In 2020, we produced 3,710,000 tonnes of FFB from our 

nucleus estates, plasma, and third parties. These FFB were 

milled into 737,000 tonnes of CPO and 178,000 tonnes of PK.

RUBBER

We operate rubber operations in North and South Sumatra, 

East Kalimantan, and Sulawesi. In 2020, we produced 7,800 

tonnes of sheet and cup lump rubber. Fifty-three per cent 

of rubber products, comprising sheet rubber and crumb 

rubber, were sold domestically, and the rest were exported.

As 72% of CPO processed in our refineries are sourced from 

our own plantations, we have greater control in managing 

our sustainability risks and opportunities.

Our oil palm seeds are produced using world renowned 

breeding populations from Southeast Asia and Africa. We 

meet the evolving needs of our customers and stakeholders 

through our two state-of-the-art seed breeding R&amp;D centres: 

PT Sumatra Bioscience (Sumbio) in North Sumatra and PT 

Sarana Inti Pratama (SAIN) in Pekanbaru. They produce 

high-yielding seed material, free of Genetically Modified 

Organisms, which attract a premium on the open market.

HCV signpost in Begerpang Estate, North Sumatra.

Protection of forests, peatland and biodiversity 

We recorded zero primary forest 

clearance and degradation of 

HCV areas in 2020.

All operations are guided by our Sustainable Agriculture 

Policy. We are strongly committed to the preservation of 

areas of High Conservation Value (HCV) and High Carbon 

Stock (HCS) in all our operations.

The HCS Approach Toolkit guides us in identifying areas 

suitable for planting or to be set aside for conservation. 

Identification of HCV areas is done through our internal 

and third-party accredited assessments. Our HCV areas 

include riparian areas, indigenous land, and habitats for 

endangered species.

To date, we have 

identified 23,279 

hectares of HCV areas 

across our sites

All of our sites have HCV 

Management Plans in 

place to monitor any 

disturbances to HCV areas

Since 2016, we have 

planted approximately 

188,508 trees in over  

783 hectares of HCV areas

All of our sites have HCV 

Rehabilitation Plans to enhance 

biodiversity and promote afforestation, 

especially in riparian areas

HCV MANAGEMENT AND REHABILITATION PLANS 

ACROSS ALL INDOAGRI SITES

Each of the HCV areas is surrounded with boundary pits to 

prevent encroachment. Signs are erected at HCV sites to 

prohibit hunting, logging or burning in the HCV area. Our 

HCV Management Plans have been assessed and accredited 

by licensed assessors. To deliver on our HCV Management 

Plans, 100% of our sites have HCV Rehabilitation Plans 

delivering results. The map above shows the locations of our 

sites, all of which have HCV Management and Rehabilitation 

Plans. Our team of trained HCV managers manage and 

monitor these identified HCV areas. 

Prior to any new planting, HCV and HCS assessments are 

required. During new planting and replanting in 2020, no 

primary forest or HCV land was affected. Regular training 

on HCV Monitoring and Rehabilitation is conducted for 

employees in our estates. This training aims to ensure that 

knowledge on HCV management and implementation of 

best practices is fresh and relevant.

As a HCV caretaker, I am able to witness the extent of 

IndoAgri’s commitment to HCV maintenance. IndoAgri 

pays strong attention to HCV management as part of its 

efforts in ensuring environmental sustainability.

To carry out my role as HCV caretaker, I was provided with 

training on management and monitoring on HCV areas, 

which was conducted by IndoAgri’s Sustainability Team.

Periodically, I monitor the conditions in HCV areas to 

ensure that there are no disturbances and identify areas 

which require rehabilitation. My work involves assisting 

in the planting of various  trees along riverbanks that 

flow through our plantations to prevent erosion and 

allow effective drainage of water. We will continue such 

rehabilitation efforts in a sustainable manner to ensure 

the functioning of our HCV areas. 

IndoAgri also actively manages the fauna in plantations 

such as Elang Ular Bido (Spilornis cheela), Cekakak 

Belukar (Halcyon smymensis), Monyet Ekor Panjang 

(Macaca fascicularis), Bekantan Kahau (Nasalis larvatus), 

and  Barn Owl (Tyto alba). Aside from increasing the 

biodiversity in our plantations, barn owls are also 

biological control agents for rats, a common pest found 

in plantations. This also helps maintain the ecosystem in 

our plantations. We monitor barn owl activity monthly 

to understand their developments.

HCV Monitoring and 

Management Training in 2020

In collaboration with external HCV and HCS certified 

experts, we conducted 49 HCV monitoring and 

management training sessions for various stakeholders, 

including employees and smallholders. 

Through our HCV assessments, we have identified protected 

species in our concessions and surrounding areas. To protect 

the rich biodiversity in Indonesia’s rainforests, we operate a 

strict zero tolerance policy towards hunting, destroying, 

logging, or burning of protected species and wildlife. 

Regular monitoring of our HCV areas allows us to track the 

health of key species and biodiversity indicators. IndoAgri 

conservation team works together with local universities to 

conduct rehabilitation works as necessary. 

 

The full list of protected species on our estates which are on the IUCN Red List or Indonesia’s national conservation lists can be found 

on our website.

Our HCV management approach described on page 21  

also applies to peatland. Additionally, we maintain a 

minimum water table depth for our existing cultivated 

peatland and work closely with the Government and peat 

experts to ensure compliance. For more information on 

our commitments to peatland protection, please refer to 

our Sustainable Agriculture Policy on our website.

Our initiatives include monitoring of water levels on estates 

using peat subsidence measurement, GIS remote sensing, 

and 3D flood risk modelling. We apply canal engineering 

techniques to ensure sufficient water distribution during 

dry seasons.



Since 2013, there has been  

no new planting on peatlands 

and water levels maintained 

in all peatlands under our 

control.

Peatlands store a third of the world’s soil carbon. If 

drained or burned, peatlands are a major source of carbon 

dioxide, the major greenhouse gas driving climate change. 

IndoAgri prohibits development on peat regardless 

of depth and complies with related regulations of the 

Government of Indonesia. All nucleus planting programs 

must be approved at the IndoAgri Executive Board level.

In July this year, a team from BRG visited our Hulu Merang 

Estate, Mangsang Estate, and Muara Merang Estate, 

South Sumatra. to understand our peatland management 

initiatives at these sites. During the visit, the IndoAgri 

and BRG teams jointly monitored the peat quality (i.e. pH &amp; 

mineral content) and peatland management infrastructure 

(i.e. canal blockers, canal conditions). 

Such collaboration of peatland monitoring allows mutual 

sharing of knowledge, and the continual maintenance of 

the hydrology of the peatland ecosystem.

Firefighting Training at Kencana Sari Estate, Lahat, South Sumatra. 

The impacts of forest fires can be catastrophic – loss of 

life, loss of biodiversity, and adverse impacts on the health 

of surrounding communities. Fires also incur long-term 

commercial, reputational, and financial costs to businesses. 

All operations and suppliers must comply with our zero-

burning requirement as set out in our Policy. All land-

clearing – for example, of non-productive oil palms – must 

be done mechanically, and good practices are shared with 

the communities.

IndoAgri takes a strident approach to monitoring hotspots 

and engaging stakeholders on fire prevention. Our ERM 

team sets out our strategy in responding to fire risks and 

scenarios. Satellite images from the National Oceanic and 

Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National 

Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are 

monitored daily and compared with IndoAgri’s concession 

maps to identify hotspots. On-the-ground checks are 

conducted by our estate managers and specialist fire teams 

to verify any potential hotspots. The ERM team, estate 

managers, and specialist fire teams are in constant contact, 

enabling swift and decisive responses to manage fire risks.

We have trained fire control teams and fire specialists 

across all our plantations. Our estates are equipped with 

vehicles and equipment for firefighting. Our fire specialists 

are regularly trained in fire prevention and firefighting. 

Training is done in collaboration with the Ministry of 

Environment and Forestry, the military, police, and the local 

government. IndoAgri delivered 27 fire control training

days in 40 estates in 2020. COVID-19 has slightly affected 

our ability to conduct training as often as previous years, 

due to the restrictions on movement of peoples in and out 

of our estates and safe distancing considerations. 

The number of fire incidents in 2020 was reduced from 

previous years, demonstrating the effectiveness of our 

proactive approach, as well as more regular rainfall in 2020.

As of 2020, we have a total of 202 fire towers across all 

our estates. We have plans to increase the number of fire 

towers, especially at areas which are historically fire hotspots 

and at the boundary with local communities. We continued 

with the implementation of our community collaboration 

programs to build local capacity and knowledge to prevent 

fires. Since the launch of the program in 2016, we have 

engaged 60 local villages.

Climate change is said to be the biggest challenge of 

present and future generations. As a large agribusiness, 

the impacts of climate change to our operations are clear 

– such as increasing temperatures potentially  leading to 

an increase in forest fires and drought, as well as increased 

severe and prolonged rainfall leading to flooding. As we 

find ways to adapt to a changing climate, we also recognise 

our part in mitigating climate change.  

ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE

This year alone, we have experienced unpredictable weather, 

such as off-season rains that lead to prolonged flooding in 

West Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, South Sumatra and Riau. 

This has impacted our ability to make use of the typical May 

to August dry season to conduct road maintenance efficiently. 

We expect such erratic weather to continue being the 

norm. To better adapt to such climate risks, we stepped-up 

our forecasting efforts in order to better plan for weather-

dependent operations, such as gearing up fire protection in 

the dry season and increasing drainage systems in the wet 

season. We use forecast from the Meteorology Climatology 

and Geophysics Council (BMKG) as basis for our planning.

OUR MITIGATION EFFORTS 

As we put in place measures to better adapt to climate 

change impacts, we also acknowledge our role in mitigating 

climate change. Our initiatives and policies on protection 

of forests, peatland and biodiversity, as well as fire control 

and haze prevention all play a part in reducing carbon 

emissions through the maintenance of ecosystem integrity. 

In our operations, we also strive to reduce our GHG emissions. 

Our Sustainable Agriculture Policy commits us to improving 

our processes to increase our energy efficiency and reduce 

emissions. Besides mitigating climate change, improving our 



Map of Indonesia’s rainfall trend from Meteorology Climatology and Geophysics Council (BMKG).

process efficiency also leads to lower costs. Our sustainability 

team continues working with colleagues from Indofood Group 

to focus on best management practices. 

As 98% of fuel used in mills are already from renewable 

products, we focus our initiatives on increasing the 

percentage of renewable fuel used in refineries. Since the 

beginning of 2018, the boilers in our Lubuk Pakam Refinery, 

North Sumatra have switched from using coal to palm shell 

entirely. We are in the process of switching the fuel used in 

our Surabaya and Bitung refineries.

From the success stories and achievements of our palm oil 

operations, we adopted these best practices in our other 

crop operations. We are pleased to report that two rubber 

factories, two sugar factories, one tea factory and one 

cocoa factory are using renewable energy from palm shells 

and sugarcane bagasse.     



Energy consumption monitoring at the Priok Refinery, Jakarta.

In 2020, the energy consumption per tonne of FFB processed 

at our mills decreased by 2% from 2.24 GJ/tonne in 2019 to 

2.20 GJ/tonne in 2020. 

Energy consumption per tonne of material produced 

at our refineries increased by 4% from 0.96 GJ/tonne in 

2019 to 0.99 GJ/tonne in 2020. This is due to decrease 

in CPO volume processed at Pluit Refinery, while energy 

consumption remained relatively constant.

Energy consumption per tonne of rubber produced in our 

rubber factories increased by 6% from 24.77 GJ/tonne in 2019 

to 26.29 GJ/tonne in 2020, due to lower crop production.

IndoAgri has implemented four main approaches to reduce energy use and increase efficiency across our operations:

1.

Established and implemented ISO 50001 

certified 

energy 

management 

systems 

(EnMS) in our palm oil mills and refineries. 

To date, two refineries and four mills have 

implemented this EnMS and we continually 

monitor and ensure that procedures and 

processes are adhered to. 

Optimise reuse of condensate water 

in palm oil mills and refineries through 

collecting condensate water from steam, and 

circulating collected water back to boilers to 

reduce hot water used. This reduces water 

and energy consumption.

2.

Increase energy efficiency in our boilers by 

improving performance. Improvements in 

oxygen content in the combustion chamber 

of boilers lead to higher quality combustion 

and hence lesser fuel consumption. 

Continuous review and re-standardisation 

of operating procedures for boilers to 

ensure that boilers are operating efficiently. 

We set the oxygen content standard to 

6%, from 10% previously, and decreased 

allowable total dissolved solids water for 

boilers.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Our primary GHG emissions 65.8% are from peat emissions. 

These emissions are not a result of the disturbance of peat, 

but from its naturally occurring, low-level methane emissions. 

As most of the estates included in our scope are planted 

mostly in peat, peat accounts for the majority of our GHG 

emissions.

In addition to land conversion, which accounted for 12.5% of 

our emissions, other sources of GHG emissions are methane 

from POME, fuel usage in our mills and in the transport of 

FFB, chemical usage in mills and plantations, and nitrous 

oxide emission from fertilisers.

Total emissions from mills and estate operations decreased 

by 14% from 1,800,014 tonnes of CO2e in 2019 to 1,545,073 

tonnes of CO2e in 2020. Total emissions in 2020 for each 

tonne of palm product were 2.10 tonnes of CO2e, a 2% 

decrease from 2.13 tonnes of CO2e per tonne of palm 

product in 2019. 



Aerated Bunker Composting at Turangie Palm Oil Mill, North Sumatra.

Emission related to transport of CPO to four refineries 

were maintained at the same level at 0.05 tonnes CO2e per 

tonne of CPO transported.

Our three aerated bunker composters continue to reduce 

methane emissions by up to 70 % compared with conventional 

waste management system (anaerobic system). We plan to 

install aerated bunker composters in future mills.

Worker comparing the before-and-after results of purified water from 

the reverse osmosis machine at the Priok Refinery.

Water is a critical resource for our operations and the local 

communities living around our operations. With the changing 

climate, global water availability risk is an increasingly 

important issue, even in tropical and subtropical regions.

All our interactions with water (water withdrawal, consumption 

and discharge) are governed by Indonesian government 

permits, which specifies for the source of water withdrawal, 

water consumption, and discharge quality. Prior to obtaining 

the permit, the authorities will conduct an impact assessment 

to ensure that there will not be significant impact arising 

from water withdrawals of our operations. With such permits, 

we carefully draw water from rivers and the ground, as well 

as manage our water interactions in line with government 

regulations. We also engage our suppliers to ensure they 

comply with government regulations on wastewater treatment 

and any water-related regulations.  

WATER USE EFFICIENCY

Water consumption is managed carefully at our estates, 

mills, and refineries.

• Our rubber and oil palm estates in tropical Indonesia 

are entirely watered by seasonal rainfall.

• 87% of mill water is from rivers. The rest is from 

groundwater and rain-harvest.

• 84% of water used in our refineries is from municipal 

sources while groundwater is 16%.

• 90% of water used in our rubber factories is from rivers, 

the rest is from groundwater.

• Water used in our offices and site accommodation in 

our plantations are from groundwater and rain-harvest.

 

All our sites passed the compulsory Environmental Impact 

Assessments (locally known as ‘AMDAL’) during their 

development. Water sources that are important to sustain 

the local biodiversity and surrounding communities were 

identified under the HCV assessments (please refer to 

pages 21-23 for more information). In 2020, we recorded no 

incidences of non-compliance in water use and wastewater 

management.

• At our mills: we used 1.00 m3 of water per tonne of FFB 

processed in 2020. This is a decrease of 1% compared 

to 2019 levels.

• At our refineries: we used 0.07 m3 of water per tonne 

of material produced, with a slight decrease in total 

consumption of 3% compared to 2019 levels.

• At our rubber sites: we used 43.34 m3 of water per tonne 

of rubber processed. This is a decrease of 0.3% compared  

to 2019 levels.

WASTE AND EFFLUENT MANAGEMENT

A systematic process for managing waste and effluent is 

important for process efficiency and cost control. All sites 

have waste management systems guided by PROPER and

Indonesian regulations. 

• At our mills: we produced an average of 1.20 tonnes of 

hazardous waste in 2020 (2019: 1.39 tonnes).

• At our refineries: we produced a total of 21,541 tonnes 

of hazardous waste in 2020 (2019: 28,900 tonnes), 82% 

of which was spent bleaching earth. We also produced 

a total of 2,826 tonnes of non-hazardous waste in 2020 

(2019: 2,170 tonnes); 67% of this waste was sent for 

recycling while the other 33% was sent to the landfill.

• At our rubber factories: we produced an average of 0.90 

tonnes of hazardous waste in 2020 (2019: 1.16 tonnes).

 

Our estates and mills reuse 100% of milling waste. Milling 

waste is solid non-hazardous waste consisting of EFB, fibre, 

and shells, which we use as organic fertiliser or fuel for our 

boilers. The total weight of milling waste produced in 2020 

was 1,370,334 tonnes (2019: 1,472,586 tonnes). 

 

Effluent from milling, POME, is generated during the 

processing of FFB into CPO. Our solid waste and POME 

are managed in compliance with regulatory controls. 

Mill wastewater, such as POME, is treated on site. POME 

undergoes composting in aerated bunker composted in 

three of our mills, resulting in the added benefit of GHG 

emissions reductions. Going a step beyond treatment of 

POME, aerated bunker composting systems installed in 

three mills sites also reduces GHG emissions.

• 

Mill effluent volume: we produced 1,837,198 m3 of 

wastewater from our 22 certified/audited mills, a 

decrease 12% from 2019 levels (2019: 2,079,788 m3).

• Mill effluent quality: the median Biological Oxygen 

Demand (BOD) was 1,852 mg/l at the 22 mills  

(2019: 2,149 mg/l) while the median Chemical 

Oxygen Demand (COD) was 5,854 mg/l at the 22 mills  

(2019: 5,951 mg/l).

Effluent from our refineries decreased from 2019 levels. 

The quality remains in compliance with regulatory controls. 

All effluents are sent to wastewater treatment plants prior 

to release into water courses or municipal sewers.

• Refinery effluent volume: we produced 306,006 m3 of 

wastewater (2019: 325,796 m3)

• Refinery effluent quality: the median BOD was 14 mg/l 

(2019: 18 mg/l) while the median COD was 45 mg/l 

(2019: 54 mg/l).

No spills of effluent, CPO, or diesel were recorded in 2020 

during harvesting, processing or transportation. No fines 

or sanctions related to environmental regulations were 

imposed on IndoAgri in 2020. No significant environmental-

related complaints were received from our stakeholders in 

2020. 

100% of hazardous waste is disposed according to national 

regulations and transported by an accredited third-party.

This year, we have worked on reusing spent bleaching 

earth, to repurpose it as input for cement production.

While oil palm is, per hectare of land used, the most 

efficient oilseed crop in the world1, we are constantly 

seeking ways to maximise and increase the palm oil yield 

in our operations. 

This year, our research teams have identified new ways to 

reduce fertiliser use through increasing plant resistance and 

developing new methods of applying fertilisers. Integrated 

pest management still remains a strong focus, as we 

continue to enhance biodiversity in our sites. 

Fertiliser Consumption

We are committed to the use of organic fertilisers in order 

to minimise the use of chemicals. We are scaling up soil 

and water improvement technologies using a blend of 

precise fertiliser dosage, slow-release dosing, and natural 

improvements. 

The use of fertilisers is tailored based on soil productivity 

and the age of trees in each plantation block.  Whilst we 

administer fertiliser during planting and replanting, we 

also use leguminous cover crops to manage atmospheric 

nitrogen and improve the soil. We also recycle EFBs and 

POME for use as a soil improver and compost. In our estates, 

we ensure appropriate interval between fertiliser applications 

and avoid applying fertilisers during heavy rain.

crop: opportunities and challenges, Journal of Oil Palm 

Research, 26, 1-24

Application of microbes 

to reduce use of inorganic 

fertiliser

Microbes, or microorganisms, are integral in converting 

insoluble phosphate and potassium into soluble form, 

increasing the nutrients available for absorption by plant 

roots, and thus reducing the amount of fertiliser needed. 

One of these microbes is the Trichoderma fungi, which we 

conducted laboratory and nursery trials on in 2020 with 

promising results that show that oil palms with Trichoderma 

require 25% less fertiliser to achieve the same growth rate. 

Trichoderma provides multiple benefits to the oil palms, 

such as promoting plant growth, disease control (such 

as induced Ganoderma resistance), increased resistance 

to drought, heat and flooding. We will continue to 

explore Trichoderma microbe application to oil palm 

roots as an eco-friendly and cost-effective approach for 

the sustainable growth of our crops.

Workers applying CRFs. 

IndoAgri’s R&amp;D teams are innovating new methods 

of fertiliser application that reduces our impact on the 

environment, while also maintaining our yield. This year, 

we experimented with Controlled Release Fertilisers 

(CRFs), which enables slow and prolonged release 

duration of nutrients (&gt; 9 months). 

As opposed to CRFs, straight fertilisers are mainly applied 

manually for nursery and immature oil palm phases. 

The frequency of application is 23 and 28 times during 

nursery and immature stages, respectively. The frequent 

manual applications thus require considerable amount and 

cost of labour. 

Preliminary initial field trial testing different soils showed 

promising results of CRF which can substitute conventional 

straight fertilisers, with similar effects on the oil palm’s 

nutrient status and growth rate. Bah Lias Research Station 

(BLRS) plans to conduct nursery and immature palms 

trials comparing straights with CRF. If successful, then 

fertiliser application in nurseries can be reduced to only 

5 applications (instead of 23), and a reduction to only 3 

applications (instead of 28) for immature palms.

initiative to reduce fertiliser application rates in nurseries and 

immature palms

Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

We apply IPM techniques to achieve a variety of benefits 

such as cost savings, lower risk to human health, and richer 

biodiversity. Natural, biological, and mechanical controls 

are preferred over chemical controls. Chemical pesticides 

are only deployed when our other controls have failed. We 

eliminated Paraquat from our operations since March 2018.

Some examples of controls from our IPM are

• barn owls to control rat populations in our estates;

• leguminous cover crops to suppress weeds;

• encouraging natural habitats for predators and parasites 

of leaf-eating insects; and

• use of pathogens i.e. viruses and fungi to control leaf-

eating insects.

Sustainability certification

Developed by the Indonesian Government, ISPO is a 

mandatory certification for all oil palm growers in the 

country. ISPO aims to cultivate a sustainable plantation 

industry and in the process contribute to the Indonesian 

Government’s commitments to reduce GHG emissions, 

while increasing competitiveness of Indonesian palm oil 

in global markets. To that end, Indonesian Government is 

working towards achieving international accreditation for 

ISPO, to further improve acceptance and competitiveness 

of Indonesian palm oil products.  

In November 2020, the Indonesian Government released 

an update on the ISPO regulations1 to improve the 

certification system and keep it relevant to international 

developments. Several progressive elements were added, 

such as collaboration with certification bodies to increase 

independence and efficiency of the certification process, the 

inclusion of Independent Monitors in the ISPO committee 

as well as public participation in ISPO certification, and a 

greater emphasis on transparency.   

All of our plantations have been registered for ISPO 

certification, out of which 80% have been certified and 

audited. We will continue to support our smallholders in 

achieving ISPO-certification so that they can meet the 

compliance deadline by 2025 (see page 41).

ISPO CERTIFICATION PROCESS

To register for ISPO certification, palm oil growers have to 

first pass a Plantation Business Assessment, Penilaian Usaha 

Perkebunan (PUP) administered by the Regional Plantation 

Estates Office to ensure that the grower’s operations have 

implemented ISPO requirements. 

The ISPO audit is conducted by a government approved 

certification body in two stages; the first stage is a 

compliance audit of plantation licenses and required 

business documentation, and the second stage involves 

plantation audits and assessments.

Plantations

We conduct annual audits on our plantations, including our 

plasma smallholders, to ensure 100% compliance with our 

Sustainable Agriculture Policy, which commits us to ensuring:

• No deforestation; conservation of High Conservation 

Value (HCV) and High Carbon Stock (HCS) areas

• No planting on peat regardless of depth

• No burning

• Respect for Labour and Human Rights, including 

Freedom of Association and non-discrimination

• Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)

Our smallholders are expected to meet the same FFB 

quality criteria as our nucleus plantations. Please refer to 

pages 40-41 for details on how we support our plasma 

smallholders in improving agronomy practices and 

achieving ISPO certification. 

Mills

For our third-party suppliers, we track their names, parent 

company, ownership structure, scale of operations, and 

location coordinates.

All IndoAgri mills and third-party CPO suppliers must 

formally accept our Sustainable Agriculture Policy. We 

assess risk levels of all our own mills on an annual basis as 

part of our risk management and audit process. 

In 2020, we met our goal of having 100% of CPO volume 

from suppliers in compliance with our Sustainable 

Agriculture Policy. 

Supplier engagement and assessment

At IndoAgri, we understand that sustainable supply chains and 

procurement practices have the most positive environmental, 

social, and economic impacts across the entire production 

lifecycle. Our Sustainable Agriculture Policy and commitment 

to ISPO aligns with sustainable procurement practices that 

promote accountability, transparency, and fair opportunity. 

The scope of our Policy includes our nucleus and plasma 

estates, our mills, and all our third-party CPO suppliers.

As more than 72% of our CPO supply is from our own mills, 

we focus our Policy compliance audit on our internal supply 

chains. In spite of the ongoing pandemic, we managed 

to conduct 152 visits, workshops, and audits on 100% 

of our mills and their supplying estates in 2020. Besides 

compliance to our Policy, our assessments also focus on:

• agronomy (good agricultural practices, yield, soil health, 

crop protection);

• responsible operations (safety, biodiversity, peatland; 

fire risk, human rights, community engagement, FPIC);

• efficiency of operations (energy and water consumption, 

GHG emissions, waste production); and

• compliance with Government regulations and ISPO 

certifications.

We also regularly engage with our third-party CPO 

suppliers to ensure their compliance with our Policy. Major 

findings and recommendations will be communicated and 

followed-up. We cease sourcing from uncooperative and 

non-complying third-party mills. 

In 2020, we began audits to have our refineries and kernel 

crushers certified to the ISO 50001 Energy Management 

System. This has resulted in more stringent requirements of 

the quality of CPO received from our mills and third-party 

suppliers, as higher quality CPO requires less processing 

time and energy consumption. We check the quality of 

every CPO shipment received and suppliers that fail to 

meet our quality requirements are given a few months’ 

notice to comply, following which we stop buying from 

them if they are still unable to meet our requirements. 

In 2020, we did not cease sourcing from any suppliers due 

to reasons of non-compliance with our Policy or inability to 

meet our CPO quality requirements.

While all IndoAgri suppliers must meet regulatory and 

commercial conditions, our procurement team treats all 

suppliers equally, with respect to price, quality, and capacity.

To achieve a resilient supply chain, we implement initiatives 

to improve the agricultural productivity and sustainability 

certification of our smallholders (see pages 40-41). We 

also run various community projects which aim to improve 

local socio-economic development and micro-enterprise 

opportunities (see page 53). 

Human rights assessment in our supply chain

IndoAgri’s human rights assessments are based on our 

Sustainable Agriculture Policy, Labour Policy, the ISPO 

certification, the Indonesian Government regulations and 

their ratified ILO conventions. Our Certified Sustainability 

Internal Auditors conduct these internal audits twice a year 

and any findings of non-conformity are reported for follow 

up action. There were zero human rights related breaches 

reported through our whistle-blowing mechanism in 2020. 

We undergo annual external audits by independent bodies 

on our operation units that are ISPO-certified. As such, 

100% of our operational units have been formally assessed 

for human rights risk in 2020. 

ISPO audits also include criteria for assessing human rights 

risks for new suppliers. The competence developed through 

the ISPO certification process also informs and guides other 

IndoAgri sites which are preparing for ISPO certification. 

More information on our commitment to respecting human 

rights can be found on pages 46-47.

Improving our yields, including those of our smallholders, 

is vital as it brings higher revenues and helps to reduce the 

pressure for additional conversion of land for agricultural 

purposes. Oil palm seeds from our Bah Lias Research Station 

and SAIN Research Stations, which are both certified to 

Quality Management System ISO 9001, can potentially 

produce 34 tonnes of FFB per hectare. We use some of the 

seeds in our own plantations, but a large proportion is sold to 

external parties.

Palm oil yield is affected by various conditions, such as age 

of palm trees, seed quality, soil and weather conditions, 

plantation management, and the timely harvesting and 

processing of FFB. Our agronomy research teams are 

continuously experimenting and implementing techniques 

for improvement, such as sub-soil planting, and fallowing 

to prevent Ganoderma disease. Some achievements by our 

team include advanced planting materials with improved 

resilience against the Ganoderma disease (see pages 32-

34), shorter duration to maturity for harvest, and higher 

oil content. A main focus is our increased application of 

mechanisation to improve productivity while maintaining 

accuracy and efficiency. This has proven especially 

critical during the pandemic when labour movement 

across plantations is limited. We also continue to explore 

collaborations with universities and research institutions to 

accelerate some of the important R&amp;D programmes, such 

as Ganoderma research.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, R&amp;D teams had limited 

access to the fields due to restrictions on visitors to 

villages and plantations. To circumvent this, workers in the 

plantations shared field conditions through virtual meetings, 

enabling the R&amp;D teams to gauge field conditions and 

advise accordingly.

Yield resilience and innovation

Technological advancements have enabled our usage 

of drones in monitoring replanted areas on our estates. 

Equipped with cameras and controlled remotely via 

computer or remote control, the drones take aerial 

photographs of plantation areas on a large scale, using 

photogrammetry techniques. 

These photographs help us remotely determine the plant 

populations post replanting and the physical variations, 

plant health, and condition of each plant block (e.g. 

cover crops, weeds, etc). We are able to quickly identify 

blocks with less ideal conditions and mitigate the issues 

to maximise yield while improving productivity.



Drone pilot operating drone.

One of the precision agriculture technologies adopted 

at IndoAgri is remote sensing, using satellite imagery. By 

measuring the optical properties of oil palm leaves, satellite 

imagery enables effective identification of the leaves’ 

nutrient status. Based on the results, recommendations on 

the amount and dosage of fertiliser needed by the plants 

over a certain time period are given to the estates to ensure 

high-yield, high quality oil palms.  

 

Compared to conventional methods of obtaining leaf 

nutrient status, such as through manual leaf sampling 

unit surveys in the fields, satellite imagery costs 90% less, 

and requires just 1% of conventional working time and 

2% of labour.   

Example of leaf nutrient status (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, 

and magnesium) map results from satellite imagery in Riau.

In 2020, we utilised satellite imagery to determine 

leaf nutrient status in 107,940 hectares of planted

Novel Trait Programme

To improve harvesting efficiency in view of anticipated 

labour and machine shortages during bunch harvesting 

period, we embarked on the Novel Trait Programme in 

2004, which aimed to combine three traits from different 

palms into a single palm. The three traits enable ripe 

bunches to be easily identified from afar without manual 

checks needed, drop fewer loose fruit when ripe, 

and have longer stalks that are more easily cut during 

harvesting, saving both time and cost. Over the years, we 

have undergone several rounds of breeding trials and are 

finally ready to begin field experiments in 2021. 





Yield recording of individual palms.

Analysis of palm leaf DNA in our genomic laboratory.

95% of our smallholders are 

involved in our smallholder 

programmes.

In Indonesia, smallholders represent more than 40% of all oil 

palm cultivation. For these smallholders, oil palm cultivation 

has provided an income, lifted millions of rural households 

out of poverty, and reduced inequalities between urban 

and rural populations. As the palm oil industry is a critical 

industry for Indonesia’s rural smallholders, it is crucial to 

include smallholder farmers in the sustainable palm oil 

production approaches. 

We encourage and provide training to our smallholders on 

HCV area maintenance and protection, good agronomic 

practices and materials management. For example, our 

HCV training provides smallholders with knowledge to 

manage riparian areas well and maintain water availability 

in the fields, which is especially crucial during periods of 

drought. As a result, we hope that our smallholders can 

improve their techniques for better yields and achieve 

higher income which will in turn reduce socio-economic 

pressure to clear new land for farming, and thus reduce 

environmental impact. 

We understand that smallholders are vulnerable to volatile 

market conditions, so training is provided at zero cost. 

Furthermore, when our plasma smallholders are replanting, 

we support them by ensuring that the costs of essential 

resources such as seed stocks and fertilisers are affordable.

We also provide financial plans to encourage smallholders 

to cultivate larger areas, and to use better equipment, 

seeds, and materials. Plasma farmers can then eventually

In 2020, the Indonesian Government updated 

ISPO 

regulations 

to 

make 

compliance 

mandatory for smallholders, within a five-year 

grace period. We aim to continue to support 

and assist our smallholders in achieving ISPO 

certification through providing training and 

building capacity for financial independence to 

overcome the high costs of certification. In 2020, 

one of the KUDs that we assisted in ISPO audits 

received its ISPO certification, making them the 

first of our smallholders to be ISPO-certified. 

The 

COVID-19 

pandemic 

exacerbated 

some challenges for smallholders as banks 

became more conservative in providing loans, 

resulting in plasma smallholders struggling 

to obtain financing for land development 

or planting. To help our smallholders obtain 

the financial assistance they need during this 

time, IndoAgri assisted our smallholders with 

the administration and criteria to qualify for 

the government’s micro credit scheme, Kredit 

Usaha Rakyat, invited banks to partner us in 

financing the smallholders, and engaged with 

the local government to assure the banks of 

the good potential of these loans. 

Successful qualification for the Kredit Usaha 

Rakyat: The Palm Oil for People Rejuvenation 

Programme 

of 

Koperasi 

Karya 

Mandiri, 

Riau covering an area of 142 hectares was 

launched in June 2020. The financing from the 

programme will cover up to the second year of 

the establishment and the succeding years will 

be provided by Bank Rakyat Indonesia either 

on the programme of Kredit Usaha Rakyat or 

commercial scheme.



Progress on Sustainable  

Oil Palm Smallholders Forum 

IndoAgri launched the Sustainable Oil Palm 

Smallholders Forum (Forum Petani Kepala Sawit 

Berkelanjutan) in December 2019, in collaboration 

with our long-time partner and non-profit SNV.

We invited KUDs and smallholders to be a part of this 

forum, through which we conducted capacity building 

and training programmes on HCV management, 

better farming techniques to increase productivity, 

leadership and management skills.

Mr Arif, 

Deputy Chairman of KUD Teratai Biru

“My name is Arif, I am the deputy chairman of KUD Teratai Biru, Musi 

Banyuasin South Sumatra which has 183 members. I am very happy 

and proud that KUD Teratai Biru can finally achieve ISPO certification. 

This shows that KUD Teratai Biru has been able to improve its quality 

of FFB and raise the standard of farmers.

By receiving this ISPO certificate, we have benefited greatly. Even 

when faced with conditions such as erratic weather, the production of 

our oil palm plantations is still good. This is due to better plantation 

management, for example in terms of maintenance and timely 

application of fertiliser. 

While it was challenging to help members understand and apply ISPO’s 

principles and criteria, support from IndoAgri and local government 

agencies helped us overcome this challenge. We are very grateful to 

IndoAgri for always providing support to us and we hope our good 

partnership will continue.

We hope that by obtaining ISPO certification, KUD Teratai Biru 

can be even better in terms of both plantation management and 

administration, resulting in increased production and quality of 

smallholder palm FFB. We also hope that future oil palm farmers will 

become more independent and prosperous.”



 I am very happy and 

proud that KUD Teratai 

Biru can finally achieve 

ISPO certification.

Occupational health and 

safety (OHS)

We take our responsibility in providing a healthy and safe 

working environment very seriously, so that everyone can 

go home safe. All of IndoAgri’s operations, workers and 

workplaces are covered by our OHS management system. 

In addition to complying with the OHS requirements set out 

in ISPO, ISO 14001, and Halal Certification, all our sites in 

Indonesia operate according to the SMK3 (Sistem Manajemen 

Keselamatan dan Kesehatan Kerja), Indonesia’s national 

OHS management system. 53 sites achieved SMK3 Gold 

Certification (43 in palm oil, five in rubber, and five in other 

crop operations). SMK3 refresher training is conducted across 

all our sites every year. This is to ensure day-to-day SMK3 

compliance of all our workers at their respective sites.

As our rubber products are exported internationally, all our 

rubber operations are also certified to the international 

OHSAS 18001:2007 standard, which provides a framework to 

identify, control, and decrease OHS risks.

An OHS committee, consisting of a committee head, OHS 

expert, security guard and assistants, is set up in each of 

IndoAgri’s operational sites and registered with the Ministry 

of Manpower. The OHS committee is responsible for ensuring 

that all sites comply with IndoAgri’s OHS management system, 

and is the first line of response in emergencies, accidents and 

near miss incidents. All incidents, including near misses, are

investigated thoroughly by the OHS expert and assistants, 

who identify the cause of incident and recommend corrective 

action, in discussion with workers, to prevent reoccurrence of 

similar incidents. Implementation of the corrective actions and 

their effectiveness is monitored by the Supervision Division. 

Risk assessments are conducted on every estate using the 

Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Tool (HIRAT), 

with monthly reviews conducted by the OHS committee. 

Each hazard identified is assessed on its risk level, and high 

risk hazards are prioritised for monitoring and control. The 

OHS committee, together with the workers, discuss the best 

course of action to respond to the hazards and risks identified. 

Internal and external safety audits are conducted against the 

HIRAT form, follow-up action is identified and monitored in 

subsequent audits to ensure continuous improvement of 

hazard and risk management. Workers are free to remove 

themselves from dangerous work situations, but they are 

prevented from doing so, they can report such instances 

through IndoAgri’s grievance mechanism, whistleblowing 

system, or their labour union. Workers can also directly express 

their opinions at daily safety briefings or monthly meetings 

with their respective OHS committees. 

We ensure the upkeep of our healthcare facilities such as first 

aid posts, clinics and  Posyandu, and conduct regular OHS 

training for our workers, including basic first aid delivery. 

Daily safety briefings are held for workers in our estates, mills, 

refineries, and factories to ensure protection from hazards via 

proper use of their personal protective equipment as well as 

to inculcate a safety mindset. 

We also identify employees who operate in high-risk 

environments and have developed SOPs in accordance with 

national regulations to safeguard their wellbeing. High-risk 

employees include our chemical sprayers and operators 

of generators in estates, welders and operators of boilers 

in mills, operators of heavy equipment and engine rooms, 

workers handling effluent and security officers across our 

operations. Our high-risk employees undergo annual health 

check-ups regulated by SMK3 to identify and eliminate 

chemical, respiratory, and audiometric-related health risks 

they face in the course of their work. The test results are 

shared with workers and checked during audits as well. 

Employees detected to be at risk of health conditions are 

transferred to other jobs until their subsequent test results 

are normal. 

Beyond our own operations, we try to prevent and 

mitigate OHS impacts in our value chain. As part of 

contractual agreements, suppliers are expected to comply 

with IndoAgri’s OHS policies in addition to government 

regulations. Our smallholders are encouraged to comply 

as well, with the help of an appointed safety assistant in 

each KUD. 

As mentioned in the earlier chapter Our COVID-19 Response 

(see pages 02-04), we have taken stringent measures to 

ensure the health and well-being of our employees during 

the pandemic. For employees working in offices, we 

provided IT support to enable them to work from home 

effectively, giving priority to employees with lower access 

to private transport and those who are pregnant or have 

disabilities. For workers in estates who had less access to 

face masks, we created a video to teach them how to sew 

their own masks, so that they could be protected as well.

Security Guards

The safety of our workers and their families are our top 

priority, especially those who live in plantation areas. For 

this reason, we employ security guards to ensure a safe 

and conducive working and living environment in our 

operational areas.

Our health and safety data relate to all IndoAgri group assets, not solely palm oil operations. There is no change in scope for our health and safety indicators. For FY2020, we reported on three additional safety 

indicators as required by GRI Occupational Health and Safety 2018 for reports published 2021 onwards: rate of fatalities as a result of work-related injury; rate of high-consequence work-related injuries (excluding 

fatalities), and rate of recordable work-related injuries

3 

Accident frequency rate (AFR) is calculated as follows: No. of Workplace Accidents x 1,000,000 divided by Total Hours Worked (number of employees x 40 hours x 50 weeks)

4 

Accident severity rate (ASR) is calculated as follows: No. of Workdays Lost x 1,000,000 divided by Total Hours Worked. ASR gives an average of the number of lost days per recordable incident. It is recorded when an 

employee is referred to a clinic due to a workplace accident and given leave of absence. In accordance with regulations, we track the accident if the lost day is more than one day

5 

Rate of fatalities as a result of work-related injury is calculated as follows: No. of fatalities as a result of work-related injury x 1,000,000 divided by Total Hours Worked

6 

Rate of high-consequence work-related injuries (excluding fatalities) is calculated as follows: No. of high-consequence work-related injuries (excluding fatalities) x 1,000,000 divided by Total Hours Worked

No operations or suppliers were 

identified as having significant 

risk relating to collective 

bargaining, forced labour, or 

child labour in 2020. 

IndoAgri is committed to ensuring that the rights of all 

people working in our operations are respected and 

represented. We adhere to all national and local laws, 

including laws on employees’ freedom of association and 

collective bargaining, decent pay and working hours, non-

discrimination and equal opportunities, and the elimination 

of forced and child labour. In 2020, we published our Labour 

Policy that details the systems and processes we have in 

place to safeguard human rights across our operations.

SEASONAL CONTRACT WORKERS

We hire seasonal contract workers as and when required for 

seasonal jobs, especially during peak season. Our contract 

workers are usually hired from the local communities and 

priority is given to permanent employees’ family members. 

Contract employment in seasonal agricultural work remains 

attractive in rural Indonesia as the job flexibility allows 

workers to tend to other activities such as juggling a variety 

of household jobs, or in other income generating activities 

such as cultivating their own crops and running small 

businesses.

As detailed in our Labour Policy, the hiring of contract 

workers, including their working conditions and wages, 

complies with Government regulations, our Code of 

Conduct, our Policy, and the Principles and Criteria of lSPO. 

As non-registered persons are banned from working on our 

sites, all seasonal workers are registered in our fingerprint 

recognition system. 

Depending on skills and job availability, our seasonal 

workers can be promoted to permanent workers. Job 

vacancies are announced during the daily morning briefings 

and on the announcement boards of our estates, mills, and 

the relevant village head’s office.

Having considered their skills and duration of service, 

IndoAgri hired 1,183 contract workers (including seasonal 

contract workers) as permanent workers in 2020.

CHILD LABOUR

In accordance with Indonesian laws, we strictly prohibit 

those below age 18 from working at our sites. Based on 

our employee database, no registered IndoAgri worker is 

under 18 years of age. Our Labour Policy describes the 

proactive measures we take to prevent child labour from 

arising. As education is critical in drawing children from 

fields, we provide free education and day care facilities to 

the children of our employees in estates.

In addition to verifying the age and identity of each 

applicant, all workers’ employment contracts include a 

clause on disallowing children to help with agricultural 

production work. Signs across our plantation areas reminds 

workers not to bring children; disciplinary action is taken 

against those who do not comply. 

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 

We are committed to upholding the principle of equal 

opportunity and supporting the inclusion of women across 

our operations, including addressing barriers faced. Our 

Labour Policy sets out the role of Gender Committees in 

all our work units and how they champion the interests 

of women at work and home. We have zero tolerance 

for sexual harassment and conduct regular socialisation 

initiatives to ensure all our workers adhere to our gender 

policies. All estates are required to complete an annual 

questionnaire to show that their operations comply with 

government regulations on diversity and discrimination.

In accordance with Indonesian labour laws, all permanent 

workers are entitled to maternity and menstrual leave. Jobs 

of new mothers are reserved while they are on maternity 

leave. In 2020, 366 women took maternity leave (2019: 308),  

77% or 282 women returned to the same job position (86% 

in 2019). The rest remained on leave or chose to leave the 

company.  In 2020, there were no incidents of discrimination 

or harassment reported via our whistle-blowing facility or to 

our Gender Committees.

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION

We fully comply with Indonesian law on freedom of 

association and regularly communicate to all employees 

their freedom to register with their preferred labour union 

and bargain collectively. We do not believe there are 

any sites where the right to freedom of association is at 

significant risk. As at end 2020, 75% (2019: 61%) of our 

permanent operational employees were registered with a 

union. The remainder are covered by a company regulation 

known as Peraturan Perusahaan which complies with 

government labor regulations.  

Our Labor Policy details the collective bargaining process. 

We engage regularly with the labour unions of our workers 

through bipartite meetings to discuss issues labour issues, 

benefits and workloads, and establish lawful collective 

labour agreements that are made available to all workers.

FAIR WAGES AND ACCESS TO BENEFITS

Our Labor Policy commits us to ensuring that all IndoAgri 

employees are adequately compensated for their work. 

All workers receive a wage that is equal to or above 

the minimum wage set by their respective regional 

governments. 

We are committed to improving the benefits and 

incentives for all our employees and workers to improve 

job satisfaction. Besides competitive remuneration, our 

Work and Estate Living Programme provides employees 

with housing, sports facilities, places of worship, 

educational institutions such as schools, and medical 

facilities. Please refer to pages 50-53 for our section on 

Community Relations and page 54 for more information 

on healthcare and education facilities which employees 

and their dependants enjoy free of charge. 

It doesn’t feel like it has been 14 years since Dewi 

Widyastuti began her career with IndoAgri.

She started her career as a Field Assistant Trainee in 2006. 

According to Dewi, career opportunities at IndoAgri are 

equally great for women and men. She is proof of that, 

having risen through the ranks to become an Estate 

Manager in Kertasarie, West Java.

While working at IndoAgri, Dewi experienced a corporate 

culture very supportive of career development. “There 

is no difference in treatment at work between male and 

female employees. For example, my job description as 

a Field Assistant was the same as my male colleagues. 

This means we experience the same work culture and 

training. As a result, each individual is provided with 

equal opportunities to develop their abilities,” she said

From Dewi’s experience, IndoAgri’s policies so far have 

also been very supportive of female employees. The 

company has accounted for all special leave rights for 

female employees in the company policy, including 

those around on maternity and menstruation leave. 

“During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has 

also been very proactive in caring for employees. For 

example, they have delivered posters and banners with 

information on regulations to employees who are working 

in the fields. When there were cases of employees 

who tested positive for COVID-19, the company has 

responded quickly to provide support, enabling us to 

feel safe and comfortable at work,” she said.”

Our people are our most important asset. We are constantly 

exploring ways to better manage our human capital. We 

have a specific budget allocated for training programmes 

every year. Guided by the Total Quality Management 

principles, our modules and initiatives seek to improve the 

career development, job satisfaction, and welfare of our 

employees. 

Programmes such as Managerial Development and 

Administrative Development for aspiring estates, mills, and 

refineries managers are available for employees who are 

interested in assuming leadership roles and advancing their 

career path. In 2020, we offered an extensive list of training 

topics for our employees ranging from environmental 

sustainability and technical agricultural skills to non-

technical skills such as effective decision making and self-

awareness. All training has been conducted online since 

March 2020, due to the pandemic. 

 

We report an 9% permanent employee turnover in 2020, 

compared to 10% in 2019. Employee statistics and other 

data on training, turnover and new hires can be found in 

the Appendix, on pages 60-61.

All employees from staff-level and above complete an 

annual performance and career development review. 

This appraisal process is an important milestone in our 

employees’ career as their performances, strengths and 

areas of improvement are evaluated objectively. This allows 

IndoAgri to reward and retain high performance employees 

with a competitive rewards package. It also helps implement 

the Balanced Scorecard for individual employees, which 

tracks their performance against individual targets. The 

scorecard focuses on quality, cost, regulatory, and social 

practices, as well as culture change and learning.

Introduction  

Community relations is central to how we operate. We 

empower the local communities we operate in by giving 

local stakeholders a voice and ensuring inclusive growth 

for rural communities in Indonesia. As an agribusiness 

company, we take responsibility to respect land rights of 

indigenous people, and also ensuring the safety, health 

and well-being of our communities. 

In this section, we explain our progress on maintaining 

good relationships with our host communities by respecting 

their rights, contributing to their positive development and 

ensuring their wellbeing.

Community rights and 

relations

As an agribusiness in rural Indonesia, we recognise the 

crucial role we play in the wellbeing of the communities 

we operate in. We aim to contribute to the socio-economic 

development of our employees and their families, and 

the communities living in the vicinity of our operations. 

Beyond providing employment to thousands living in 

remote areas, we contribute to the holistic development 

of communities through a range of initiatives in education, 

health, infrastructure, microenterprise, farmer, culture, and 

humanitarian living. 

LAND RIGHTS

In spite of the complex land tenure systems in rural 

Indonesia, we remain steadfast in respecting the rights 

of communities and indigenous people through our 

commitment to the principles of FPIC. 

Every land transaction that we are involved in complies 

with Indonesian law and company policy. Prior to the 

development of every estate, we conduct an Environmental 

Impact Assessment (locally known as ‘Analisis Dampak 

Linkungan’ or ‘AMDAL’) and Social Impact Assessment (SIA), 

which enables us to identify baseline conditions and likely 

social impacts of development. 100% of our operations have 

undergone AMDAL and SIA, in accordance with Indonesian 

law. The assessment results and our land development plans 

are shared with the local village government and community 

to obtain their input and approval. For cases involving 

land compensation, we have established certification and 

confirmation processes for proof of ownership, to ensure

that the right person is compensated, with the village head 

present as witness. Our FPIC policies and processes for 

working with communities and governments on land tenure 

and rights enable us to promote open negotiations, inclusive 

decision-making, and clear agreements. 

We go beyond regulatory compliance to advance the 

livelihoods of our farmers, suppliers, and their families 

living in our development areas. 100% of our estates have 

community development and engagement programmes. 

In the event of complaints on land rights, local communities 

can file these complaints with IndoAgri or with the 

Indonesian government. Complaints addressed to IndoAgri 

go through our Grievance Mechanism in which supporting 

documents are required to be submitted as proof. 

Complaints addressed to the government usually involve 

the local government office or land agency office (BPN). In 

2020, there were no recorded incidents of FPIC violations, 

violations of the rights of indigenous peoples, or land rights 

issues that arose involving IndoAgri.  

Beyond land rights complaints, complaints from the community 

that are related to other operational, social and environmental 

matters can be submitted to IndoAgri. These complaints are 

processed through our grievance mechanism, which sends 

the complaints to the relevant company representatives, who 

verify, follow-up, and mediate to achieve resolution of the 

complaints. There is also room for whistleblowing through 

IndoAgri’s usual engagement with the community, such as 

during regular stakeholder meetings and fire trainings days. 

ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE

We continue to ensure access to healthcare for the 

communities at each of our operating sites. In each estate, 

we have set up clinics and first aid posts for employees 

and their families. On a wider community level, we operate 

Posyandu which provide monthly health check-ups for 

mothers and babies, immunisation, food and nutritional 

supplements, and counselling. Posyandu are also equipped 

with additional infrastructure to promote maternal and 

infant healthcare. 

One of the challenges we face is in getting mothers and 

their children to visit the Posyandu regularly for check-ups. 

Hence, we try our best to communicate to mothers the 

importance of regular check-ups, working with our Gender 

Committee and the village heads to reach out to mothers. 

 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, our Posyandus remained 

operational while following applicable health protocols, 

prioritising maternal and child health, particularly those of 

pregnant women and children under the age of five.

As of 31 December 2020, we have 189 medical clinics in our 

estates, and 199 Posyandu, supported by 263 midwives/

nurses and 59 doctors. Moving forward, we are considering 

conducting training programmes for new village health 

workers as part of our succession planning in maintaining 

the Posyandu.

This year, we continued to conduct our Cleft Lip Surgery 

Programme for children born with a cleft lip or cleft palate. 

Through this programme, we collaborate with hospitals 

and non-profit organisations to search for cases, counsel 

families, provide examinations, the surgery, as well as post-

operative care and speech therapy. 

 

In 2020, cleft lip surgeries were halted after February 

to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In total, the team 

delivered 12 surgeries for 12 beneficiaries, bringing the 

total number of surgeries and beneficiaries since 2014 to 

512 and 447 respectively. 

ACCESS TO EDUCATION

We continue to provide locals with access to education 

through Smart Houses (locally known as ‘Rumah Pintar’) 

in our oil palm plantations. Rumah Pintar are typically 

equipped with books, children’s facilities and a computer 

workstation. School children who need extra tutoring on 

school subjects such as Math and Physics can receive help 

from tutors. Locals also sell artisanal products at Rumah 

Pintar, thus promoting financial self-sufficiency of the 

Rumah Pintar. In 2020, 10 out of 20 Rumah Pintars were 

financially self-sufficient, and with the help of 30 tutors, 

have educated and upskilled 29,190 visitors. 





During the pandemic, classes at the Kayangan Private 

Primary School (SDS), located in Kebun Kayangan, Rokan 

Hilir, Riau, could not be conducted face-to-face. Limited 

internet access in rural areas presented challenges in 

virtual teaching and learning for teachers and students.

“Apart from inadequate internet access, many parents 

complained about the costs associated with online 

learning. They have been forced to buy more data 

packages so that their children can continue to study. 

This is certainly burdensome,” said Widyawati, one of 

the teachers at SDS Kayangan.

While these challenges did not dampen the enthusiasm 

of teachers and students of Kayangan SDS, the teachers 

and principals found an innovative way to facilitate virtual 

classes: via collaborating with the local cable TV network.

“Since almost everyone has cable TV at home, lesson 

videos created by the teachers can be viewed by 

students instantaneously. There are no additional costs, 

making it a more economical solution,” said Widyawati. 

She hopes that the COVID-19 pandemic can end soon, 

so that students and teachers are able to meet face-to-

face again.

COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AND FOOD SECURITY

Our PROKLIM projects are part of a national programme 

to increase community resilience and food security, as well 

as promote local climate change mitigation and adaptation 

action in agriculture, waste and energy. Through our 

PROKLIM projects, we help strengthen community 

resilience, contribute to national GHG emission targets, 

improve local-level coordination to deliver climate change 

policies, and provide opportunities for local villages to 

adopt low-carbon technologies. Examples of initiatives that 

have benefitted local communities include diversification 

of crops that lead to additional income and strengthened 

food security, water management and installation of 

facilities to protect against the impacts of floods, landslides 

and drought, as well as energy reduction efforts that lead to 

cost savings. We have received 7 awards from the Ministry 

for Environment &amp; Forestry this year, and 20 awards in total 

since the programme first began in 2016. 

Receiving these awards has motivated us to continue 

raising awareness on environmental issues and contribute 

to the reduction of GHG emissions of local communities. 

We will continue to encourage and support more IndoAgri 

units in implementing PROKLIM programmes. 

Our plans for the future are represented in the new IndoAgri 

Care &amp; Ownership programme, which aims to protect the 

environment and encourage sustainable behaviour among 

IndoAgri employees and their families. This programme 

covers the entire IndoAgri operating area, from plantations 

to factories and offices. The focus areas are reduction of 

paper and plastic use, waste management, and water and 

energy-saving behaviour. Our hope is that the initiatives 

from this programme will go beyond the work environment 

to be implemented in employees’ daily lives and family 

environments. At the plantation level, these initiatives 

are being spearheaded by wives of our local employees. 

In the longer term, we hope to promote these initiatives 

digitally, thus overcoming larger distances to increase our 

community outreach.  

During the COVID-19 pandemic period, IndoAgri 

employees at Kebun Balam, Rokan Hilir, Riau, set up a 

food security programme to grow their own food. Known 

as the Balam Sejahtera Farmer Group, the programme 

involves employees utilising empty garden land in the 

Company’s operational area to grow vegetables and 

various commodities organically.  

Initiated by IndoAgri Estate Manager Subianto, this 

programme was also set up in response to Indonesian 

President Joko Widodo’s call to boost the country’s 

food security and increase innovation in the food sector, 

especially during the pandemic. 

Irwan, an Estate Assistant in charge of the programme, 

explained how farmers in this programme had access 

to organic fertiliser: “The location of the Balam Sejahtera 

Farmer Group’s farm is near Company’s mills, making it 

easy for us to obtain organic fertiliser such as empty strips, 

POME, and non-hazardous boiler ash, thus enabling us to 

grow organic vegetables.”

With their very own vegetable farm, employees have less 

need to travel out of the estate to purchase vegetables, 

reducing contact with people outside their estate and 

lowering the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Harvest from 

the vegetable garden is also sold to other employees, thus 

providing an additional source of income for employees in 

the programme.

Irwan’s hope is that the food security programme in Kebun 

Balam will continue to run smoothly and sustainably.

“In the future, we hope that the Company can expand the 

amount of land allotted to our farm so that all employees 

can participate in this programme,” he said.

products. 

Formal 

management processes ensure that we adhere to high 

standards of production. To stay updated on the latest food 

safety standards, our Quality Control teams responsible 

for product quality assurance undergo regular training on 

hygiene, safety, and Halal risk and control. Our production 

sites and suppliers are also audited annually on hygiene, 

sanitation, and housekeeping. 

As part of our continuous improvement efforts, we have 

achieved certification for the latest version of the FSSC 

22000, and have implemented several initiatives this

we have integrated the management system in our Refineries 

such that applicable changes in quality, food safety, health 

and safety, and environmental management can be assessed 

through a single Change Management Form. 

All IndoAgri product packaging meets the Indonesian National 

food safety standards. In 2020, we recorded zero incidents 

of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes 

concerning the health and safety impacts of our products. We 

also experienced zero incidents of product recall.  

NUTRITION

More than 80% of our EOF products serve the consumers 

in the domestic Indonesian market. Our cooking oils 

are marketed under our Bimoli, Bimoli Spesial, Delima 

and Happy brands, while our margarine and shortening 

consumer products are packed and sold under our Royal 

Palmia, Palmia and Amanda brands. 

We partially eliminated hydrogenated fat from our products 

by substituting hardened fat with interesterifed (IE) oil. 

R&amp;D on IE is currently underway to further enhance our 

capabilities of IE oil production. We have fully eliminated 

trans-fat from Palmia Serbaguna and Royal Palmia Butter 

Margarin. Since January 2020, all of our consumer pack 

cooking oil brands have been fortified with Vitamin A in 

line with national requirements.



Quality Control team member checking cooking oil.

NUTRITION FACTS

Our products provide carotenoid 

(for vitamin A) and tocopherol 

(for vitamin E) to ensure 

consumers achieve a balanced 

diet and to mitigate risk of vitamin 

deficiency.

Our exported 

cooking oils to 

the Philippines 

are further 

enriched with 

vitamin A, as 

required by 

regulations in 

that market. 

We take vitamin fortification 

beyond compliance. Whilst vitamins 

A and D are mandated by Indonesian 

law, as a manufacturer of high-quality 

food products, we aim to contribute 

to the healthy diet of Indonesians. 

For example, we have also added 

vitamins E, B1, B2, Niacin, Folic Acid 

and B12 in our table margarine.

Palm oil contains the right sorts of fat 

(saturated and unsaturated fatty acids) 

which promote healthy growth, supple 

skin and energy storage. Palm oil is 

free of cholesterol and trans-fat. 







Our products











Our products are fortified with 

essential vitamins. These vitamins 

strengthen the immune system, 

eyesight and the developing 

foetus in utero. These vitamins also 

improve cell development, and 

promote a healthy nervous system.

Product information, 

packaging and marketing 

We comply with all national and export market requirements 

on marketing and communication of product information. 

Our product packaging complies with the Indonesian 

policy on Extended Producer Responsibility. We continue 

to investigate the technology solutions to replace our 

packaging materials with fully recyclable packaging. 

Our cooking oil brand Delima has had its 1-litre pouches 

modified to a thinner packaging that requires less plastic 

since January 2018, and we have done the same this year 

for our new Amanda 1-litre cooking oil product. 

 

We are committed to responsible consumption and 

building a circular waste economy. We are currently actively 

engaging our suppliers to explore options for recyclable 

packaging. We also encourage environmentally friendly 

behaviour in our consumers as we do not provide plastic 

bags at campaign bazaars.

With changes in customer lifestyle and purchasing habits 

during the pandemic, we have directed our focus to 

distribute our products to local mini marts and small stores 

in residential areas, which are closer to the consumer. We 

also sold our products in smaller packages suitable for home 

cooking. Additionally, we broadened our sales channels 

from traditional retailers to include ecommerce platforms 

such as Tokopedia and Shopee. As a result, we have been 

able to maintain a sales volume similar to pre-pandemic 

times, despite the fall in business-to-business sales. Bimoli 

cooking oil listed on online retail platform Shopee.

In line with increasing digitalisation and physical distancing 

in 2020, we strengthened our social media presence to 

continue to engage customers over the pandemic. For 

example, our cooking demos were hosted weekly on our 

Instagram page, @Palmia_ID, and were well-received by 

individual consumers and SMEs. We plan to continue these 

engagements beyond 2020.

Customer service and 

satisfaction  

Our products are reputed for their quality, price, and 

consumer confidence. We recognise that meeting 

consumer needs are critical in maintaining their confidence 

in our brands. We regularly engage consumers to address 

their concerns on product quality, including communicating 

our sustainability progress and responsible supply chain 

practices, investigating areas of concern and making 

improvements based on feedback. We also conduct 

annual customer satisfaction surveys to obtain feedback on 

product and service quality. In 2020, we surveyed a total of 

75 industrial customers and 64 distributors. We received 

a score of 117% for industrial customers* and 119% for 

distributors**, exceeding our targets. 

We receive and respond to consumer feedback on our 

products and services through the centralised Indofood 

Customer Service centre, which is accessible via toll-free 

lines or e-mail. Each piece of feedback is recorded in a 

Customer Complaint Form (CCF), providing a systematic 

process for follow-up.

In 2020, we received 18 pieces of feedback from customers, 

most of which were product enquiries. All feedback 

received was handled appropriately within two weeks. In 

recognition of our ability to demonstrate high value, good 

quality, and market presence, Bimoli was awarded the SWA 

– Most Valuable Indonesian Brand (Brand Finance) 2020. 

Bimoli also received the SWA – Living Legend Brand 2020, 

for our longstanding presence in the Indonesian market. 

This award recognises brands that have been established 

for over 50 years. 

We will continue to innovate and offer new products at 

competitive price points, improve customer service and 

enhance product labelling and packaging.
