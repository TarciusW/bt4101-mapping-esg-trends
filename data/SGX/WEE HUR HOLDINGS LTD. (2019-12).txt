Dear Stakeholders, 

 

I am pleased to share with you the Sustainability Report of Wee Hur Holdings Ltd (“the Company” or 

“Wee Hur”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 

(“FY2019”).  

FY2019 was a busy and fruitful year for Wee Hur. We have 5 properties under development, 2 in Singapore 

and 3 in Australia. For our construction arm we have 9 current projects in which 5 projects were secured 

during the year. We have 3 investment properties, one in Singapore and two in Australia. 

We saw significant results in our resource conservation efforts in the Construction projects. For our completed 

project in FY2019, the energy consumption and carbon emissions were 9.6% lower than target, and water 

consumption was 25.9% lower than target, which is testimonial of our conservation efforts. 

In FY2019, we have stepped up on the leverage on technology to further improve productivity at our 

construction sites. We successfully implemented a web-based mobile application at all construction 

sites to manage the Permit-To-Work (“PTW”) system and Environment, Health and Safety (“EHS”) 

inspections. 

The Group is committed to providing a safe working environment for all employees. Our health and safety 

performance have significantly improved since 2018, and we achieved zero fatalities and no stop-work days 

in FY2019. Our Accident Severity Rate (“ASR”) also reduced significantly from 174.82 in FY2018 to 75.32 in 

2019. We will continue to stay committed to prioritising the health and safety of our staff and workers. 

At the end of FY2019, a newly discovered coronavirus emerged and resulted in the formidable COVID-19 

outbreak which evolved into a global pandemic. The COVID-19 has great impact to all businesses and is 

changing the ways we are operating. Despite all the challenges we may face amid this COVID-19, the 

safety and welfare of our staff and workers remain our top priority in these trying times. All necessary 

measures to stop the transmitting the virus imposed by the authority will be strictly complied with. 

 

I am thankful to our shareholders, business associates, consultants, sub-contractors, suppliers, staff and other 

stakeholders that have supported us and contributed in making our progress possible. I am also grateful to 

the Board for their guidance and support. Thank you for your interest in Wee Hur’s sustainability journey. 

I hope you enjoy reading this report. 

 

 

Sincerely,  

GOH YEOW LIAN 

Executive Chairman and Managing Director

WEE HUR’s SUSTAINABILITY STORY

At Wee Hur, we are committed to playing our part for society through meaningful partnerships with local 

communities and various institutions. 

This year, the Group continued our organised effort to move beyond doing good to instil a culture of sustainability in 

our people. We are committed to incorporating and improving sustainability practices throughout our 

organisation. 

 

A dedicated task force comprising key management personnel has been established to implement and 

oversee sustainable initiatives throughout our organisation. The Sustainability Task Force meets regularly to plan 

and review the progress of Wee Hur’s sustainability initiatives 

 

Sustainability Targets   

The economic landscape for properties under development, construction and investment property markets 

will be impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. As such, we will continue to adopt a prudent and cautious 

approach towards making investment decisions. We are progressively diversifying our businesses beyond 

Singapore to propel our growth.  

We aim for zero fatality and injuries to foster a safe and healthy workplace environment. Our suppliers will 

also be subject to more robust assessment regarding their socioeconomic compliance and environmental 

practices.  

We shall continue to maintain and uphold our energy saving standards and performances in workers’ 

dormitory and PBSA. We target to adopt innovative technologies within the next few years with the aim 

to lower our greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity ratio. 

We will continue to develop more meaningful partnership with charitable organisations and various institutions 

to improve the welfare of the community. We aim to bring more diversity in terms of gender, race and 

age groups to build a capable and diverse workforce.

Wee Hur is committed to running our business operations on a foundation of Integrity, Transparency 

and Honesty. The Company will devise and improve our processes continuously to prevent direct or

indirect bribery, in order to safeguard and uphold our values. 

We adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards any forms of corruption and bribery in our business. The Company 

and employees have to observe and comply with the anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislations and 

regulations in the countries where we have business activities in. 

We have an internal reporting structure, procedures and channels that are secure and accessible for our 

employees to raise concerns and report violations or suspicious activity. The Company will also strive to 

ensure that our business partners share our zero tolerance policy against corruption and bribery. The Company 

will avoid engaging in business dealings with those known or reasonably suspected to be engaging in 

corruption and bribery. 

There have been no incidents of corruption and no public legal cases brought against the organisation 

or its employees. We currently have no risk of corruption but we continue to be vigilant in ensuring 

our employees conduct themselves with the highest integrity.

Sustainable Accommodations (GRI 203-1, 416-1) 

We prioritise the well-being of our occupants. Some of the initiatives that we have taken to enhance well-being of 

our occupants include: 











Every habitable room has a window to provide an external outlook and maximum natural light

Ample access to natural ventilation and natural light around the facility

Communal areas for relaxation and enjoyment

Appointed operator will be experienced in engaging occupants 

Large green courtyard for activities

Sustainable Development of PBSA Properties 

The following sustainable development principles were incorporated during the design phase:  

 

•	 Energy efficient lighting was adopted. This comprises fluorescent and LED lighting at student 

 

 

accommodation units with a minimum output of 27 lumens per Watt 

 

•	 Air-conditioning	is	based	on	highly	efficient	air	cooled	and	water	cooled	Variable	Refrigerant	Flow	(“VRF”)	

 

•	 Lifts	will	be	installed	with	regenerative	drives	to	convert	the	excess	energy	generated	into	reusable	energy		

 

•	 Motion	detectors	or	occupancy	sensors	in	common	areas	will	be	used	to	provide	responsive,	demand-

 

 

controlled and energy efficient amenity 

 

•	 Every	habitable	room	has	a	window	to	provide	a	great	view	and	maximum	natural	light	

 

•	 Ample	access	to	natural	ventilation	and	daylight	around	the	facility	

 

•	 Large	green	courtyard	for	activities	

 

•	 Sky	gardens	for	communal	activities	

 

•	 Use	of	green	facade	provides	passive	shading	to	East	and	West	facing	facades	in	UniLodge	City	Gardens

 

•	 Airflow between green facade and the external skin of the building promotes energy efficiency 

 

 

by natural cooling effects 

 

•	 Capture	rainfall	and	slow	its	entry	into	the	stormwater	system.	

 

•	 Swipe	card	system	which	controls	the	power	supply	to	lights	and	air-conditioning	in	each	apartment		 

Furthermore, by selecting efficient water fittings and water management measures incorporated in the design, the 

predicted water consumption fares better than the average residential water consumption rates.:

Electricity and water metres are installed at every project site to track and monitor our electricity and water 

usage. The Group is committed to educate our employees and workers on good environmental practices. 

Water is recycled and reused at project sites to wash vehicles exiting construction site. Water reducers are

fitted at taps to reduce water usage, and regular on-site checks are conducted at all water outlets to ensure 

that there are no water leakages.  

All our construction projects are equipped with Earth Control Measure (“ECM”) as part of the requirement to control 

earth and silt from being discharged into public drains that lead to water catchment areas. The collected water 

containing a mixture of mud and silt will be treated and filtered before being discharged into the common public 

drainage. 

There were 10 construction projects in FY2019:

Noise Management (GRI 413-1) 

We proactively engage occupants of any upcoming construction works in the vicinity and where possible, minimise 

the inconvenience to the occupants. Any feedback received is acted promptly. 

 

We have also implemented a noise management programme to minimise noise levels at construction sites.  

 

Identify Noise Levels

•	

Real	time	noise	monitoring	to	ensure	noise	do	not	exceed	allowable	limit

Minimise Noise Impact

•	

Limit	noisy	activities	to	daytime	and	no	noisy	works	at	night

•		

Provide	noise	barrier	and	use	silencer	on	equipment	to	reduce	noise	generated

•		

Where	possible,	we	adopt	alternative	construction	methods	to	reduce	level	of	noise	generated

Public Relations

•	

Engage members of the public residing in the surrounding areas to seek their understanding on the 

 

ongoing works 

• 

Provide feedback avenue by displaying phone number of hotline and any complaints or feedback are acted 

 

on promptly  

In FY2019, our construction projects did not exceed the permissible noise limits set by National Environmental 

Agency (“NEA”) and there was no incident of non-compliance with NEA noise regulations. 

Vector Control (GRI 413-1) 

Vector control plans are implemented at every construction site to prevent mosquito breeding. NEA officers 

are invited to give talks during our annual campaign to eradicate mosquito breeding. The worksites are 

divided into different zones, with personnel in-charge assigned for each zone to monitor and take action 

to prevent any forms of mosquito breeding. 

We have also implemented cross-checking of sites for mosquito breeding to remain vigilant. External pest control 

companies are also engaged to carry out checks and regular insecticide spray to control mosquito breeding. 

We take a serious view on mosquito breeding as it might lead to a health hazard for our workers like dengue fever. 

Three instances of mosquito breeding were discovered at our project sites in FY2019. 

Public Safety  (GRI 413-1) 

We are aware that construction sites can be dangerous for the public, and we take full responsibility and 

precaution towards ensuring public safety. We strictly comply with relevant Health and Safety regulations and 

endeavour to reduce safety risks as is reasonably practicable. 

 

Our public safety measures include managing site access to ensure that site boundaries are clearly and 

physically defined with suitable fencing, such as installing netting and toe-boards on scaffolds. We also 

ensure that scaffolding is properly constructed and maintained, and open floor edges are properly blocked off with 

barriers or suitable covering.

WEE HUR HOLDINGS LTD 

Sustainability Report 2019

Innovation and Excellence (GRI 203-2) 

We adopted the use of biometric authentication system for all our construction projects. The system allows 

capturing of entry and exit of personnel at the worksite automatically using biometric authentication, 

thereby increasing security and reducing the need for manual recording and compilation of reports. 

In FY2019, we successfully implemented a web-based mobile application to manage our Permit-to-Work system, 

site safety inspections and corrective actions. This replaces the traditional paper based system and allows 

the safety team to perform more efficiently and productively in their work. 

 

Workplace Health and Safety (GRI 403-1, 403-3, 403-4) 

Wee Hur has a risk management plan in place for our construction sites to identify, analyse and 

management the risks throughout the lifecycle of the project. 

 

The project manager works closely with the project team members to ensure that risks are managed during the 

construction process. Risks will be identified as early as possible in the project so as to minimise their impact. 

The health and safety of employees is our number one priority  

The Group has implemented an Environment, Health and Safety (“EHS”) Management System to uphold best 

practices for workplace safety. 

 

A safety committee is formed for every project site, chaired by the project manager and assisted by the Workplace 

Safety and Health Officer (“WSHO”). A Safety Committee site-walk and meeting is convened every fortnightly to 

ensure all procedures are in place. Non-compliances are identified and action plans are formulated to prevent 

recurrence. 

For all new workers, they will undergo a safety induction briefing conducted by the project safety team before 

being allowed to commence work on site. For contractors, all personnel and workers entering construction sites 

will undergo a safety orientation by the site WSHO before they are allowed to work. Daily toolbox meetings are 

conducted to remind workers to thoroughly review the work for the day and the safety issues to look out for.

We also conduct twice weekly mass exercise and safety talk at all project sites for all contractors. Safety briefings, 

demonstration and talk are given to all workers to educate and remind them on safety. For all high-risk activities, 

a permission-to-work system is in place and the checklist will need to be checked by the Safety Assessor before 

approval from the project manager is obtained for the work. Site safety is reviewed monthly during the senior 

management review meeting for every site, where project managers report on the safety performance of 

their projects. 

Regular safety promotion campaigns are also conducted at project sites to raise awareness and remind workers 

of the best practices expected of them. Emergency drills are conducted to instil the level of vigilance in our 

workers to respond effectively to emergencies at construction sites. 

To further promote safety awareness, we have started the monthly evaluation of site safety performance. 

Corporate Safety will conduct monthly safety audits and evaluate the safety performance at every site. 

The performance of every site will be circulated to all teams to encourage them to perform well in 

safety, and areas for improvement will be highlighted. 

For project sites with poorer safety performance, the frequency of corporate safety inspection and audit will be 

increased. Close guidance will be given to the team to improve their safety performance in the shortest time 

possible. 

In FY2019, there were nine reportable incidents at our construction sites. A near miss is an unplanned event 

that did not result in any injury, illness or damage, but had the potential to do so. By tracking near misses, 

we can take pre-emptive action before an incident happens. Our Group abides by MOM regulations 

regarding the reporting requirements for work related incidents. There was zero near miss in FY2019.

Managing our Suppliers (GRI 308-1, 414-1) 

Wee Hur strives to ensure that suppliers throughout the supply chain meet the practices and standards expected 

by the Group. 

 

Suppliers and subcontractors are required to declare and acknowledge their responsibilities in ensuring 

compliance to local regulations. Above and beyond, we comply with the ISO 14001 Environmental 

Management Standards and assess our suppliers and subcontractors based on their environmental and 

social obligations. 

We target to include environmental and social criteria in the evaluation of our new suppliers and subcontractors

in FY2020. We will assess if suppliers carry Green Label products as endorsed by Singapore Green Labelling 

Scheme (“SGLS”), and whether subcontractors have the workplace safety and health capabilities to meet 

the standards of “Bizsafe level 3”. 

Fines or Penalty (GRI 307-1, 308-2, 414-2, 419-1) 

Wee Hur received fines of S$37,200 in FY2019, which was significantly lower than S$49,900 in FY2018. 

We have an overall monitoring structure to ensure that corrective actions have been implemented to 

effectively reduce future occurrences. 

 

Our health and safety performance has significantly improved since FY2018. We saw nine reportable incidents, 

zero fatalities and no stop-work days in FY2019.

The energy and water consumption increased in FY2019 as compared to FY2018, as there was an 

increase in the number of occupants. As a result, the intensity ratio of consumption per occupant 

decreased despite the increase in consumption.  

This attests to the effectiveness of our energy and water management, and we will continue our efforts to minimise 

consumption.   

Waste Management  (GRI 306-1, 306-2) 

The sewage and sanitary drainage system at Tuas View Dormitory is designed and operated in accordance to 

the requirements and provisions of the Sewerage and Drainage Act. All waste water generated from the 

dormitory are discharged into the public sewer according to the requirements and provisions of the 

Sewerage and Drainage Act.  

Occupant Health and Safety (GRI 416-1) 

Induction programmes are conducted for occupants during check-in to inform them of the safety rules and 

regulations. Posters for safety and health awareness have also been placed around the residential area for 

tenants in different languages to educate them of safety precautions. Regulatory bodies such as the 

Singapore Police Force, NEA and MOM are invited to conduct roadshows to engage with the occupants 

to educate on safety and legal obligations in Singapore. 

 

Wee Hur takes a firm stand towards complying with legal and regulatory requirements and ensures that 

treatment for fogging, larviciding and treatments for rats, cockroaches and mosquitoes are conducted to 

ensure cleanliness of premises. Clean room awards are given to occupants who display outstanding efforts in 

maintaining a hygienic premise.

By engaging staff, there will be more intra- and inter-department interaction, as well as between staff 

and management. The Group has also rolled out initiatives like meals and sports allowances to promote 

cohesiveness amongst staff and to promote active and healthy lifestyles. With these initiatives, the Group 

ensures the staff’s well-being and all-round personal development. Staff will also be able to better understand 

the Group’s policies and direction and providing feedback or suggestions to improve areas that may be lacking.

Wee Hur supports the government’s pro-family policies and follows MOM regulations with regards to parental 

leave. In FY2019, nine employees were entitled to Parental Leave. As part of our employee welfare and to stay 

competitive with the current market, we have also increased the leave entitlement for all staff.  

Employee Development (GRI 404-1, 404-2,404-3) 

 

Wee Hur understands that employees are the foundation 

of our Group and strives to improve and develop our 

employees to their fullest potential.  

The	Group	sends	staff	for	seminars/training	to	keep	them	

abreast with latest technology, knowledge and work 

skills. Moreover, Wee Hur invests to upgrade our staff 

skills capability and increase work productivity.  

Wee Hur rewards good work performance by offering 

competitive remuneration packages. Staff remuneration 

is compensated based on employees’ performance, 

expected roles and responsibilities. This is reinforced by a well-structured and open annual performance 

appraisal system to link performance with remuneration.  

Moreover, our compensation packages are benchmarked against the market rate and aligned with our 

Group’s salary guide. Thus, this ensures our competitiveness in attracting talent which we believe is the key 

to our sustained growth.  

Wee Hur recognises that our older workers bring with them a wealth of experience and we retain these 

workers if they choose to continue with the Group. 

Giving Back to our Community (GRI 413-1) 

OUR PEOPLE, OUR ASSETS
