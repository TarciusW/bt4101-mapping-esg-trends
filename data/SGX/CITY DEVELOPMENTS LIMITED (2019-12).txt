Dear Stakeholders, 

In 2019, we saw rising sea levels, blazing wildfires, intense 

storms and rapid melting of glaciers threatening the long-

term survival of people, property and nature. The year 

also concluded the hottest decade on record.¹  Despite 

countries’ commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate 

change, greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere 

reached a record high in 2019, locking in a warming trend 

for generations to come. UN Secretary-General António 

Guterres issued a dire warning about the global crisis, 

underlining that we are close to a “point of no return” on 

climate change.²  

Closer to home, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong 

called climate change “an existential threat” during the 2019 

National Day Rally, highlighting Singapore’s vulnerability to 

rising sea levels. This was the first time that climate change 

was addressed on a national platform. The Meteorological 

Service Singapore warned that Singapore is heating up twice 

as fast as other cities, and extreme heat combined with the 

island’s high humidity could be life threatening.³  

With the potential impact of global warming  

becoming almost too alarming to imagine, business 

as usual is not an option. As illustrated by Singapore‘s 

recent announcement to halve the amount of emissions 

produced by its 2030 peak by 2050, and given the 

rapid urbanisation of the global population, it has never 

been more critical for the built industry to lead the way 

on climate action. With the buildings and construction 

sector accounting for some 40% of global energy-related 

carbon emissions, the built environment has huge 

potential for global carbon reduction.4 

Having integrated sustainability into our operations for 

over two decades, CDL remains steadfast in embracing 

innovative strategies to mitigate the environmental 

impact of our operations and catalysing change 

within the larger ecosystem, through engaging our 

stakeholders across the value chain to create greater 

positive impact. Expanding on last year’s theme 

“Changing The Climate: Towards Future Value 2030 

Goals”, this year’s Integrated Sustainability Report titled 

“Changing the Climate. Changing the Future.” aims 

to inspire the larger ecosystem and our value chain to 

accelerate climate action.

Sustainability is integral to CDL’s business and 

operations, as illustrated in and aligned with our ethos 

of “Conserving as We Construct” since 1995. As a 

testament to the management’s firm commitment to 

green buildings, CDL has amassed a portfolio of 110 

Green Mark certified developments and office interiors 

by the BCA, the highest amongst private real estate 

companies in Singapore. Last year, we were also the 

only developer to clinch the BCA Quality Excellence 

Award – Quality Champion (Platinum) for seven 

consecutive years. 

Our company has proven that the strategic integration 

of ESG presents a strong business case. It has 

established a unique value proposition for CDL, 

strengthening our reputation and trust amongst 

stakeholders and the community at large. Our early 

adoption of green buildings and innovation has placed 

us in a strong position to address present and future 

climate challenges. 

The progress we made in integrating ESG strategically 

across our value chain has earned CDL global 

recognition on 12 leading sustainability benchmarks. 

We are honoured to be ranked the world’s top real 

estate company on Corporate Knights’ 2020 Global 

100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World 

and are the longest listed Singapore company on 

the Global 100 list since 2010. In addition, we are 

the only company in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong 

to be on the 2019 CDP A List for corporate climate 

action – the only Singapore company to be included 

for two consecutive years – and on the 2019 CDP A 

List for water security. These prestigious accolades, 

amongst many others, reaffirm our climate strategy and 

commitment, and underscore CDL’s positioning as a 

sustainable investment of choice.

I am glad that the company continues to contribute 

positively towards a low-carbon economy. In September 

2019, CDL was amongst the pioneer batch of 87 

companies worldwide pledging support to UNGC’s 

Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign, to set climate 

targets across our operations aligned with limiting 

global temperature rise to 1.5°C.5 CDL expanded the 

use of sustainable finance in 2019 by leveraging on 

our ESG credentials to accelerate climate action within 

capital markets. 

Our ESG-centric vision has built a sound foundation 

to mitigate climate-related business risks and is set 

to unlock new capital and business opportunities. 

Research has shown that more corporations are using 

ESG considerations as a lever to lower risk and thus 

factoring it into their acquisitions.6 

Moving forward, the Board is fully supportive of the 

CDL management’s unwavering commitment to further 

enhance our ESG and green buildings’ performance. In 

the face of climate emergency, the only way to deliver 

long-term value creation for our investors, shareholders, 

and stakeholders is through responsible business 

practices for a sustainable future.

Dear Stakeholders, 

2020 is a critical year to kick-start a decade of urgent and 

robust climate action. The past 10 years have gone down 

in history as the planet’s hottest decade, the environmental 

impacts of which have reverberated throughout the world. 

In the five years since COP21, climate change morphed 

from a serious challenge to a full-blown emergency, leaving 

impending threats and uncertainties in its wake. 

This year, countries that have pledged their support for 

the Paris Agreement are preparing to submit their new or 

revised national plans with much higher ambitions since the 

world is currently on track towards a global temperature 

rise of 3°C, double the target set out in the 2015 Paris 

Agreement on climate change.

2020 is also a crucial year for addressing the Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) that set targets for the world to 

become safer, healthier, fairer and more sustainable by 2030. 

To achieve these ambitious goals, both policymakers and 

businesses share the same level of responsibility to mitigate 

and adapt to the climate emergency, which makes it vital for 

all to work together to form a strong force for good.

Increasingly, the business case for ESG integration is 

strengthening, as seen in the rise of ESG investing.¹ 

According to Morningstar, ESG funds amassed US$20.6 

billion of new money in 2019 – four times as much as the 

previous high bar² of US$5.5 billion in 2018. Companies  

that manage sustainability risks and opportunities tend  

to have stronger cash flows, lower borrowing costs and  

higher valuations over time.³ Financiers are also increasingly 

pegging lending rates to the ESG performance of  

corporate borrowers. 

The need for a sustainability mindset has never been  

greater and more critical for businesses to unlock 

opportunities in a low-carbon economy. As a pioneering force 

in sustainability, CDL’s strong track record in ESG performance, 

guided by our four key pillars of strategy – Integration, 

Innovation, Investment, and Impact – will enable us to forge 

ahead in the new climate economy, future-proofing our 

business and sustaining growth in the right manner. 

INTEGRATION: 

Creating Enduring Value Through Our Ethos 

“Conserving as We Construct” Since 1995 

ESG integration is fundamental to creating long-term value 

for our business and all our stakeholders. As an expansion 

of our sustainability commitments, we have aligned our ESG 

efforts with 14 relevant SDGs out of 17, and we are also 

the first Singapore company to embrace the SDGs in our 

Integrated Sustainability Report since 2016. Guided by the 

CDL Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint that mapped

out strategic goals and ESG targets, we have continued 

to track and report our performance on a quarterly and 

annual basis since 2017. In the year under review, I am glad 

to report that we are on track to achieve all our key ESG 

targets, with some areas requiring further adaptation due  

to operational changes. 

Singapore recently announced its goal to halve its emissions 

by 2050 and to achieve net-zero “as soon as viable in the 

second half of the century”4. CDL has been an early mover 

to lower our carbon footprint through best practices and 

innovation. Being the first private sector property developer 

in Singapore to achieve the ISO 14001 Environmental 

Management and ISO 50001 Energy Management System 

certifications in 2003 and 2014 respectively, we continually 

build on our efforts to expand our natural capital as we grow 

our business for a low-carbon future. In 2019, we achieved 

a 38% reduction in carbon emissions intensity from base-

year 2007 against our 2030 SBTi-validated target of 59%, 

meeting our interim 2019 target and we are on track to 

achieving our 2030 goal.

Since 2009, CDL has stayed ahead of the curve by voluntarily 

reducing our annual carbon emissions to net-zero for our 

corporate office operations including our data centre, 

and 11 Tampines Concourse – the first CarbonNeutral® 

development in Singapore and the Asia Pacific. Besides 

carbon neutralising the construction phase of 11 Tampines 

Concourse, we also annually offset emissions from its 

operations, including that of its tenants.

As the first real estate company in Singapore to have our 

carbon reduction targets assessed and validated by the 

SBTi, we took a step further in our carbon management 

by joining the pioneer batch of 87 companies worldwide 

to pledge support to UNGC’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C 

campaign in September 2019.5 We pledged to set climate 

targets across our operations, aligned with limiting global 

temperature rise to 1.5°C. 

To raise CDL’s business resilience and readiness for 

potential climate-related risks, we completed the first 

phase of our climate change scenario planning on the 

2°C and 4°C warmer scenarios in 2018. We have since 

expanded our study to a 1.5°C warmer scenario and 

included our key operations in the US. The study provided 

greater insight and clarity for the Group to better prepare 

for the potential impact of both climate-related physical 

and transition risks, such as higher carbon taxes and 

stricter building regulations. 

To adapt to the rapidly changing business landscapes  

and stakeholder expectations, we started conducting 

biennial materiality assessments with internal and  

external stakeholders in 2014. Similar to 2017’s findings, 

the 2019 study concluded that “Innovation” remains  

CDL’s top material issue. The second was “Energy 

Efficiency and Adoption of Renewables”, followed by 

“Climate Resilience”.

INNOVATION: 

Adopting Technologies and Solutions to

Advances in low-carbon technologies present a huge 

opportunity to make business sense out of long-term 

decarbonisation. For the past two decades, we have driven 

innovative solutions to develop strategic low-carbon and 

resilient buildings. With innovation identified as our top 

material ESG issue since 2017, we have intensified our search 

and application of viable innovations and technologies to 

reduce our carbon footprint.   

Formed in 2018, the Enterprise Innovation Committee (EIC) 

is an inter-department and multidisciplinary establishment 

that scouts for latest technologies and solutions. Chaired  

by CDL Group Chief Strategy Officer Mr Kwek Eik Sheng, 

the EIC will continue to shape corporate innovation culture 

and implement innovative ideas that contribute to the 

company’s balanced triple bottom line and long-term 

sustainable growth.   

In 2019, we embarked on an exciting pilot project in 

partnership with the Solar Energy Research Institute of 

Singapore, combining new building and solar technologies 

for greater efficiency. The project integrates high-efficiency 

BIPV modules with PPVC, using The Tapestry, our new 

residential development in Singapore, as a testbed.

Introduction 

and 

Leadership 

Statements


Since 2017, CDL has formed a R&amp;D partnership with NUS 

School of Design and Environment (SDE). In addition to the 

NUS-CDL Tropical Technologies Laboratory (T2 Lab), which has 

been operational since late 2018, the NUS-CDL Smart Green 

Home Laboratory was opened in 2019 at NUS’ SDE Building 

4, Singapore’s first new-build net-zero energy building. The 

two labs will conduct innovative experimental studies on 

smart features, green building technologies and design for 

sustainable living.

The recent Singapore Budget 2020 announcement to 

increase adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and phase out 

internal combustion engines by 2040 validates our early 

efforts in enabling the accessibility of EV chargers to the 

public. We partnered with BlueSG and Greenlots in  

EV sharing programmes by providing carpark lots with 

charging stations at our commercial properties including 

Republic Plaza, Tagore 23 Warehouse, Central Mall  

and City Square Mall. In 2019, we were one of the leading 

landlords to partner with SP Group to provide direct current 

fast chargers at Republic Plaza. Going forward, CDL will  

look into expanding the EV charging infrastructure for  

our new residential and commercial developments as well  

as review our existing managed properties. These efforts  

will help support the transformation of the local urban 

mobility landscape.

Putting people at the heart of what we build, urban greenery 

and landscaping have always been key differentiators for 

our developments. All our new residential developments go 

beyond the mandatory requirement by BCA, devoting over 

40% of the site area to unique landscaping and communal 

facilities. In 2019, we also invested $3 million in Gush – a 

Singapore-based start-up specialising in sustainable paints 

and advanced building materials – to explore new building 

solutions. Through the EIC, Gush was also involved in a pilot 

programme to testbed a mould-prevention paint at Nouvel 18, 

a residential development that CDL manages.

Higher energy efficiency often contributes to lower 

operational costs. Through robust resource management 

and regular asset upgrading and enhancement efforts, we 

have been able to maintain efficient energy performance for 

our managed properties. Since 2004, CDL has retrofitted 

all our managed buildings by upgrading chiller plants, 

introducing motion sensors, installing energy-efficient 

lighting and recladding facades. From 2012 to 2019, 

we achieved savings of more than $28 million in energy 

expenses amongst eight of our commercial properties. 

Recognising that user behaviour is equally important in 

achieving energy efficiency and cost savings, we have been 

actively engaging and encouraging our tenants to adopt low-

carbon practices at the workplace, resulting in the continuation 

of 100% tenant participation in the CDL Green Lease 

Partnership Programme. 

Corporations are increasingly expected to be accountable for 

the environmental impact of their supply chain. Last year, we 

commenced a risk analytics and segmentation exercise on our 

supply chain, which utilises a risk-based and leverage-driven 

approach to identify environmental and social-sourcing risks 

posed by our top 100 suppliers and the products and materials 

they supply. With data-driven input, the findings will help CDL 

to prioritise our supplier engagement efforts and mitigate the 

environmental impact and sourcing risks of our supply chain.

INVESTMENT: 

Propelling Change to Accelerate Climate Action

Amidst the challenging macroeconomic environment, the 

CDL Group delivered a resilient set of results. For FY 2019, 

it posted revenue of $3.4 billion (FY 2018: $4.2 billion)6 

and EBITDA of $1.1 billion (FY 2018: $1.2 billion). Net 

attributable profit after tax and non-controlling interest 

(PATMI) increased by 1.3% to $564.6 million (FY 2018: 

$557.3 million), supported by a portfolio with diversified 

income streams and boosted by substantial gains from 

the unwinding of the Group’s second Profit Participation 

Securities (PPS 2) structure. The Group’s total assets grew 

11.5% to $23.2 billion. CDL launched a record number 

of six projects and sold 1,554 units including Executive 

Condominiums (ECs) with a total sales value of $3.3 billion  

in FY 2019, emerging as one of the top-selling private sector 

developers in Singapore. In 2019, the Group successfully 

privatised our London-based hotel arm, M&amp;C, in line with 

our focus to enhance recurring income.

The rising trend of responsible investing and sustainable 

finance provides significant opportunities to unlock 

alternative financing streams in the built sector which can be 

capital intensive. Leveraging CDL’s strong ESG track record 

has helped lower our long-term borrowing cost and expand 

our pool of ESG-centric investors and lenders. Based on our 

latest materiality assessment, sustainable finance has also 

emerged as a new material ESG issue for CDL, reaffirming 

our pioneering efforts in the issuance of a green bond in 

Singapore in 2017, and our continued pursuit of sustainable 

finance in 2019.

Leadership 

Statements


In 2019, CDL implemented a Sustainable Finance Framework 

to prepare for opportunities in which sustainable financing 

can be used to fund projects that support our business 

strategy and vision. To accelerate the green building 

movement and low-carbon developments, CDL secured 

its first green loans amounting to $500 million for new 

developments and pioneered a first-of-its-kind $250 million 

SDG Innovation Loan last year. This was an expansion from 

our pioneer issuance of a $100 million green bond by a 

Singapore company in 2017.

 

Shaping a fair, safe and inclusive workplace is fundamental 

to CDL’s performance and key to enhancing our human 

capital. In a traditionally male-dominated industry, CDL is the 

only Singapore real estate management and development 

company listed in the 2020 Bloomberg Gender-Equality 

Index for three consecutive years since the launch of the 

index in 2018. In 2019, four of our properties won the HPB 

Healthy Workplace Ecosystem Awards. CDL’s corporate 

office at Republic Plaza7 also achieved the Platinum rating for 

the BCA-HPB Green Mark for Healthier Workplaces Award. 

In addition, we were named “Best Companies to Work for 

in Asia” by Business Media International’s human resources 

publication, HR Asia.

Besides contributing to the development of Singapore’s 

built environment, CDL also actively gives back to society, 

providing continuous support and amplifying positive impact 

through our various outreach programmes and partnerships.

Conceptualised and developed by CDL, the Singapore 

Sustainability Academy (SSA) is the first ground-up  

initiative and zero-energy facility in Singapore dedicated 

to advocacy, capacity building for climate action, and the 

collective achievement of SDGs. Since its opening  

in June 2017, the SSA has served over 14,500 attendees 

through more than 370 outreach events and training  

sessions as of 31 December 2019. An extensive partnership 

involving six government agencies and 15 industry and  

NGO partners, the SSA has become a hallmark of  

CDL’s community engagement and is recognised as 

Singapore’s leading knowledge and networking hub for 

sustainable development. 

Since 2018, we have further expanded the SSA’s 

international outreach to include new partners – UNEP, 

UNDP, UNGC and the Asian Venture Philanthropy Network. 

As a reflection of the SSA’s strong 3P outreach and 

influence, the SSA has been the preferred venue by our 

partners’ engagement activities. The Academy, an epitome 

of extensive public-private-people partnership, served as 

an ideal platform for UNDP to hold its first Private Sector 

Advisory Group meeting in April 2019.

 

We believe in the power of youths in driving positive 

change for a sustainable future. Our longstanding 

investment in youth development initiatives, such as the 

CDL-GCNS Young SDG Leaders Award (launched in 2011) 

and CDL E-Generation Challenge (launched in 2010), 

as well as the Youth4Climate Festival (launched in 2018) 

have been growing in their outreach, empowering tens of 

thousands of youths to galvanise awareness and action to 

fight climate change and achieve the SDGs. 

G R O U P  C E O  A N D  

E X E C U T I V E  D I R E C T O R 

S T A T E M E N T 

To further drive our social investment impact, we continued to 

host notable community outreach initiatives last year, including 

the high-profile “Singapore’s Greening Journey: 200 Years and 

Beyond” exhibition to commemorate Singapore’s Bicentennial 

and the Botanic Gardens’ 160th anniversary. Through a 

partnership with Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore) and 

NUS, we featured world-renowned primatologist and 

conservationist, Dr Jane Goodall, at the 7th Asia Environment 

Lecture, where her captivating stories on nature and wildlife 

conservation inspired an audience of over 1,700.    

With rising global temperatures causing the rapid melting 

of glaciers, we launched the “Saving Glaciers Alliance” last 

year to raise awareness of the importance of conserving 

the world’s polar regions and glaciers. The event featured 

motivational speaker, polar explorer and climate advocate 

Sir Robert Swan – the first person to walk to the North 

and South poles unaided. The event attracted over 120 

supporters of the Alliance at the SSA, including diplomats, 

senior business leaders and NGO representatives. 

Last year, our longstanding community programmes 

continued to receive strong support from partners and the 

community. These included the 4th edition of EcoBank, 

which aims to promote recycling and responsible waste 

disposal; and SDG City Challenge 2019, a community and 

tenant engagement event that brought together over 2,000 

people to participate in activities that promote a green, 

active and healthy lifestyle in Singapore.

IMPACT: 

Driving Positive Change for a More  

Sustainable Tomorrow

In the face of unprecedented climate threats, as well as 

uncertain global political and economic outlooks, companies 

with strong ESG performance have proven to be more 

resilient and are in a stronger position to achieve sustained 

growth and attract investments. CDL’s track record in 

effective ESG integration and sustained performance has 

been widely recognised by leading global sustainability 

benchmarks, including being the world’s top real estate 

company on the 2020 Global 100 Most Sustainable 

Corporations in the World. We are also the only company in 

Southeast Asia and Hong Kong to score double ‘A’s in the 

2019 CDP Global A List for corporate climate action and 

water security.

In support of the national objective of greening 80% of 

all buildings by 2030, CDL will continue our longstanding 

commitment to achieve Green Mark GoldPLUS and above, 

two levels above the mandatory requirement, for CDL’s new 

and existing properties, and tap into new green building 

technologies. To facilitate greater ESG integration into 

the company’s expansion plan, CDL aims to step up our 

acquisition risk assessment as recommended by our climate 

change scenario study. 

 

As a builder of living and workspaces, we are mindful 

that people spend more than 90% of their time indoors 

on average8. It is our goal to step up our innovative 

technologies and solutions to enhance the health and 

wellness of building users through the way we design, 

develop and maintain these spaces in the years ahead.

Energy efficiency and the reduction of our carbon footprint 

will remain our top priorities. In line with our ambitious 

carbon reduction targets, the company has set our sights 

on joining the RE1009 initiative by 2021. In the next couple 

of years, we will aim to review our GHG reduction targets 

validated by SBTi, aligning our commitment towards 

Business Ambition for 1.5°C10.

CDL is honoured to have played a key role in spearheading 

the establishment of the Global Reporting Initiative 

(GRI) Regional Hub in Singapore last year. Being the first 

corporation to publish a dedicated sustainability report 

in Singapore using the GRI framework since 2008, we will 

continue to support the GRI’s mission to raise the standards 

of sustainability reporting and disclosure in Singapore and 

the region.

The rapid growth of responsible investing and sustainable 

finance will further enhance CDL’s organisational and 

financial capital. Going forward, CDL will continue to explore 

potential growth and investment avenues through green 

financing and business opportunities that are aligned with 

sustainable development.

With the completion of M&amp;C’s privatisation in October 2019, 

the management is looking into enhancing the alignment 

between M&amp;C’s ESG practices and CDL’s longstanding 

G R O U P  C E O  A N D  

E X E C U T I V E  D I R E C T O R 

S T A T E M E N T 

sustainability strategy. It aims to achieve greater synergy 

within the CDL Group, raising operational efficiency and 

capability to be future-ready for emerging challenges.

As 3P collaboration is key to expanding the ripple effect 

for climate action, CDL is committed to driving the industry 

and the community-at-large to adopt environmentally 

responsible practices. Creating positive alignment with the 

SDGs will remain a strategic focus in CDL’s business.

To conclude, I would like to thank our investors and 

key stakeholders for their faith and support of CDL’s 

longstanding commitment to ESG integration, even when 

climate change was not deemed as a mainstream business 

agenda. The management would not have achieved top 

world rankings in sustainability without the guidance and 

support of the Board, and the immense dedication of our 

colleagues. In recent years, the support from our customers, 

shareholders, business partners and supply chain has also 

been gaining strong traction. 

Building a sustainable future will require the commitment 

of the broader ecosystem. Through collaboration and 

partnership, we can accelerate changing the climate and 

changing the future.

“Companies and countries that champion transparency and demonstrate their responsiveness to stakeholders (...) 

will attract investment more effectively, including higher-quality, more patient capital.”

Source: 

Larry Fink’s Letter to CEOs, BlackRock, January 2020.






Sustainability integration lays the foundation on which 

our strategy rests on to create holistic long-term value 

for our business, stakeholders, and community.

CDL’s value creation business model is founded on our 

ethos of “Conserving as We Construct” since 1995. The 

model entails our role as a developer, an asset owner and a 

corporate citizen, and guides us in creating sustained value 

for our business and all our stakeholders. Our value creation 

model embraces the framework by the IIRC, which helps 

to make business and financial sense of ESG performance, 

as well as recommendations by the TCFD on voluntary and 

consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures. In 2019, 

we expanded our value creation business model to include 

SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), thus now aligning with 

14 relevant SDGs.

This is complemented by the CDL Future Value 2030 

sustainability blueprint, a detailed roadmap to help us 

achieve sustainable growth, while delivering on our purpose. 

Introduced in 2017, the sustainability blueprint sets long-

term ESG goals and targets towards 2030 – a milestone 

year for the SDGs, the Paris Agreement and green building 

movement. The interim targets are reviewed regularly 

to keep up to date with the latest developments. Since 

July 2017, we also voluntarily publish an online quarterly 

sustainability report that tracks, measures and updates 

stakeholders of our progress towards key goals and targets 

set under the sustainability blueprint.

Review of 2030 and Interim Targets Required 

Past targets were set before the recent changes of the 

company’s asset management portfolio and tenant mix in a 

few properties, e.g. Republic Plaza.

Performance in 2020 will be tracked and reported vs set 

targets subsequently.

Asset Management (AM)- Retail2:   

Reduce energy use intensity by 18% from baseline year4

Reduce water use intensity by 9% from baseline year4

Reduce waste intensity by 12% from 2016 levels5

Energy use intensity: 13% reduction 

Water use intensity: 8% reduction 

Waste intensity: 11% reduction

 

Performance of Retail, Office &amp; Industrial properties were 

tracked and reported collectively and the old targets were 

set before the opening of two key retail properties (City 

Square Mall and Quayside Isle). Retail malls consume more 

resources due to longer opening hours and higher footfalls 

that generate more waste. It is prudent to split the targets 

and performance data of Retail from Office and Industrial 

properties with shorter operational hours. 

Corporate Office: 

Reduce energy use intensity by 31% from 2007 levels

Energy use intensity: 28% reduction

Corporate office data was reported as part of CDL’s overall 

office building portfolio. For more prudent reporting, 

energy targets and performance data of corporate office 

will be tracked separately.

CDL’s Board Sustainability Committee considers 

sustainability issues as part of a larger strategy 

formulation for long-term value creation. Leadership 

by the Board Sustainability Committee has been 

critical in the delivery of CDL’s sustainability purpose, 

integration, and performance.

STRONG LEADERSHIP COMMITMENT  

TO SUSTAINABILITY

CDL has established the longest history amongst 

Singapore companies to have a dedicated Sustainability 

department. The Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) 

reports directly to the Board Sustainability Committee 

(BSC), which comprises three independent directors 

and CDL’s Executive Director and Group CEO. The BSC 

has direct advisory supervision on CDL’s sustainability 

strategy, workplans and performance targets, and 

typically meets biannually to review CDL’s sustainability 

plans in addition to receiving quarterly reports from  

the management.

The CSO chairs the Sustainability Committee, which 

comprises members across all departments and 

operational units in CDL. Heads of Departments 

(HODs) and their line managers are held accountable 

for their ESG performances, which are linked to their 

remuneration and appraisal.

2019 FOUR-STAGE MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

PHASE 1

Identify and define material risks and opportunities

PHASE 2

Stakeholder engagement to prioritise ESG issues

PHASE 3

Validation by Senior Management

PHASE 4

Approval by BSC

We first conducted an extensive horizon scanning exercise 

to determine the list of material risks and opportunities. 

Next, over 600 online surveys were sent out to key 

stakeholders and face-to-face interviews were conducted 

with strategic stakeholders to gain insights. Besides 

prioritising CDL’s material ESG issues according to their 

needs, our stakeholders provided different perspectives on 

how they viewed CDL’s ESG performance. At the validation 

workshop with CDL’s Senior Management, the material 

issues were assessed based on the following.

• Disruptive capacity (potential impact on CDL’s business);

• Proximity (period1 over which the material issue will 

likely have an effect); and 

• Adaptive capacity (CDL’s current preparedness to 

manage each material topic) 

I N T E G R A T E D  

S T R A T E G Y  F O R  

V A L U E  C R E A T I O N

Since 2014, we have engaged our stakeholders  

through materiality assessments to prioritise and  

respond to issues that arise from the dynamicity  

of our working environment.

STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF MATERIAL 

ESG ISSUES

In 2019, we undertook our third comprehensive biennial 

materiality study. Conducted by an independent external 

consultant, it helped us to identify key issues that impact  

our ability to create value for our stakeholders. 

Materiality Matrix 

Overall, the 2019 list of material issues is broadly similar to the 

results of the 2017 materiality study, with sustainable finance and 

waste management emerging as new material issues. The study 

also highlighted several material issues with notable increase in 

concern by internal and external stakeholders. This feedback will 

help us to evaluate and improve on our sustainability practices 

and disclosure to align with our stakeholders’ expectations.

Responses to Risks and Opportunities of the 15 Key Material ESG Issues in 2019

The table outlines CDL’s actions in addressing risks and capturing opportunities related to CDL’s top 15 material ESG issues. It is also mapped to 14 relevant SDGs and the four pillars of the 

TCFD framework. Most of CDL’s deliverables cut across several material ESG issues given that some are interrelated (e.g. “Innovation”, “Energy Efficiency and Adoption of Renewables” 

and “Climate Resilience”). These ESG risks and opportunities complement CDL’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, information of which can be found in the Risk Management 

Report in CDL’s Annual Report 2019.

CDL’S MATERIAL ESG ISSUES

RISKS/OPPORTUNITIES

CDL’S RESPONSES AND ACHIEVEMENTS

Innovation

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:  

To ensure that our services and products 

remain relevant in a fast-changing 

environment, CDL proactively adopts 

sustainable construction methods and 

integrates innovative technologies that 

will help drive our business to the next 

level and raise the bar of sustainable 

practices and ESG performance. 

Identified as the top material ESG issue since 2017, innovation has been a top priority in CDL’s growth and investment strategy.

In 2019, we embarked on a pilot project with the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore to integrate high efficiency BIPV 

modules with PPVC, using The Tapestry, our new residential development in Singapore, as a testbed.

In partnership with NUS, the NUS-CDL Tropical Technologies Laboratory and the NUS-CDL Smart Green Home were opened in 

2018 and 2019 respectively. Both labs will continue to conduct studies on smart features, green building technologies, and design 

for sustainable living.

In support of aspiring social innovators, CDL launched the Incubator For SDGs in September 2019 to provide rent-free co-working 

space at Republic Plaza to selected start-ups or social enterprises. The initiative offers an extensive network and mentorship 

programme to help aspiring social innovators to scale up and reach out to potential investors. 

Through a cross-department Enterprise Innovation Committee (EIC) formed in 2018, multi-disciplinary ideas to drive innovation 

and best business practices are explored and tested in CDL. 

Energy Efficiency and  

Adoption of Renewables

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:     

As energy consumption contributes 

to a significant portion of a building’s 

operating expenses, increasing the use 

of solar energy and neutralising carbon 

footprint has been a priority for us in 

developing and managing our properties. 

It will help mitigate operational risks as 

more stringent regulations and rising 

carbon tax are expected.  

Higher energy efficiency often contributes to lower operational costs. CDL achieved the 2019 CDP A List for climate action, recognising 

CDL’s robust climate strategy and carbon management. 

Since 2004, we have retrofitted all our existing commercial and industrial buildings. From 2012 to 2019, CDL achieved savings of 

more than $28 million in energy expenses amongst our eight commercial properties. 

 

100% of our commercial tenants have subscribed to our Green Lease Partnership Programme.

We were among the first developers and building owners to pledge our commitment in 2018 to achieve at least one SLE project in 

the next five years.

CDL partnered with BlueSG and Greenlots in EV sharing programmes by providing more carpark lots with charging stations at 

Republic Plaza, Tagore 23 Warehouse, Central Mall, and City Square Mall. In 2019, CDL was also one of the leading landlords to 

partner with SP Group to provide direct current fast chargers at Republic Plaza. 

CDL was Singapore’s first real estate company to procure RECs using SP Group’s blockchain-enabled platform in Singapore in 2018.

CDL’S MATERIAL ESG ISSUES

RISKS/OPPORTUNITIES

CDL’S RESPONSES AND ACHIEVEMENTS

Climate Resilience

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:     

The built sector contributes to some 40% 

of energy-related carbon emissions and is 

heavily reliant on natural resources for our 

operations. 

Regulatory transition risks such as carbon 

pricing, water prices and potentially 

stricter building design requirements will 

pose challenges to maintain profitability 

and sustained growth. 

Climate change not only physically affects 

properties but also threatens to leave 

assets stranded. In the face of climate 

change, climate-proofing the company’s 

buildings for a low-carbon future is key to 

CDL’s growth strategy. 

To optimise resources and cost-savings, sustainability considerations are factored into the entire development lifecycle. Since 

2009, we have voluntarily reduced our annual carbon emissions to net-zero for our corporate office operations including our data 

centre and 11 Tampines Concourse – the first CarbonNeutral® development in Singapore and Asia Pacific.

For close to a decade now, CDL has committed to achieving a voluntary target of Green Mark GoldPLUS certification for all new 

developments, two tiers above mandatory requirement. To date, 85% of CDL’s portfolio of owned and managed buildings, based 

on GFA, are rated Green Mark GoldPLUS and Platinum – the highest tier certification. 

In addition to building two zero-energy developments in Singapore, i.e. CDL Green Gallery at Singapore Botanic Gardens and 

SSA at City Square Mall, we have also adopted extensive solar energy in our commercial and residential developments, e.g. South 

Beach and D’Nest.

As part of CDL’s SBTi-validated carbon reduction targets, we are committed to raising the use of sustainable building materials.  

We have set target to reduce embodied carbon1 by 24% by 2030.  

In September 2019, CDL joined the pioneer batch of 87 global companies worldwide to pledge support of the UNGC’s  

Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign.2 

We commenced our second climate change scenario planning where a more stringent 1.5°C warmer scenario was studied, 

covering the financial impact of physical and transition risks of properties in major markets.

Product Quality and 

Responsibility

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:   

Delivering safe and high-quality products 

and services in CDL’s residential, office, 

commercial and industrial developments 

is fundamental to CDL’s branding and 

product differentiation. 

CDL’s developments have consistently excelled under the BCA’s Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) scheme, 

entrenching the company’s reputation as one of the highest scoring CONQUAS developers. 

To ensure compliance and prevent latent defects, we have a robust policy to identify design risks and assess the severity of EHS 

impacts throughout the construction stages of our developments.

 

Beyond product safety and quality, we encourage our employees and tenants to go green and stay healthy through participation 

in the BCA-HPB Green Mark for Healthier Workplaces scheme. 

Occupational Health,

Safety and Well-being3

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:    

As most activities at construction sites 

and managed buildings are carried out 

by our appointed contractors, CDL is 

exposed to safety and health risks if 

the management of contractors is not 

sufficiently stringent.

The safety, health and wellness of CDL’s employees and contractors’ workers have always been CDL’s priorities. Established since 

the early 2000s, our EHS policy and 5-Star EHS Assessment System have been enhanced in standard and scope over the years. 

Since 2017, we integrated our ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 EHS Management System across all our key operations in Singapore, 

to effectively manage the safety, health and well-being of our employees and workers, directly or indirectly hired. In 2020,  

CDL will be migrating from OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series to ISO 45001 Occupational Health 

and Safety.

CDL’S MATERIAL ESG ISSUES

RISKS/OPPORTUNITIES

CDL’S RESPONSES AND ACHIEVEMENTS

Ethical and Transparent 

Business

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:  

Bribery and corruption are amongst 

the highest risks for businesses that 

could lead to financial and reputational 

loss. Legal non-compliances will disrupt 

operations and affect business reputation. 

Our zero-tolerance policy towards fraud, 

bribery and corruption provides strong 

assurance to our stakeholders, including 

investors and customers.

Currently, we benchmark our practices with the voluntary SS ISO37001 Anti-bribery Management Systems to ensure that gaps 

are minimised and we operate in accordance to globally-recognised best practices. Refresher trainings on anti-money laundering 

practices are conducted annually for CDL’s employees.

CDL has been implementing clear and transparent policies and risk management systems, to continuously monitor and validate 

business processes, and benchmarks them against industry best practices. Within the company’s robust EHS Management 

System, applicable legal requirements are regularly monitored and evaluated for compliance. Incentives and penalties are also 

implemented to improve and tighten contractors’ site management. 

CDL adopts fair marketing practices that reinforce customers’ trust in CDL-branded properties. 

Economic Contribution  

to Society

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:  

Our financial performance impacts the 

vested interests of our employees, 

shareholders, investors and vendors. 

Through upholding high standards of ethical business practices, maintaining strong branding and delivering quality products, we 

have maintained profitability and optimum returns for investors in our fiduciary duty as stewards of capital, creating value for our 

stakeholders.

Responsible Supply Chain

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:    

The procurement of unsustainable 

building materials and methods 

can negatively impact CDL’s ESG 

performance. Usage of toxic building 

materials can also harm the health of 

building users and contractors’ workers.

CDL has built a supply chain that shares the company’s firm commitment to high EHS standards through the CDL 5-Star EHS 

Assessment System established since 2005. The CDL Green Procurement Guidelines, within the EHS Management System, also 

gives clear guidance to suppliers. 

For long-term business sustainability, strong suppliers’ support has helped CDL adapt effectively to challenges posed by climate 

change or shortage of resources.

To promote and enhance sustainable and responsible practices amongst our suppliers, we conducted a supply chain study in 2019, 

identifying and assessing the environmental (e.g. embodied carbon intensity) and social risks (e.g. forced or child labour) of our 

top suppliers and building materials.

CDL’S MATERIAL ESG ISSUES

RISKS/OPPORTUNITIES

CDL’S RESPONSES AND ACHIEVEMENTS

Cyber-readiness and  

Data Privacy

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:  

Strengthening CDL’s capabilities to 

protect and recover from cyber-attacks is 

vital to preventing theft of data, financial 

loss, and disruption of operations.

Given rising data privacy concerns both 

locally and globally, CDL needs to be 

mindful of compliance requirements 

for international and local data privacy 

protection laws.  

Besides establishing holistic IT governance structures and developing robust detection and mitigation measures to protect CDL’s 

critical business systems and data, the company’s IT response plans are tested by independent external and internal auditors and 

benchmarked against industry best practices.

CDL’s risk assessment framework has identified data privacy as a key risk, given recent developments in data privacy regulation 

and the increasing impact of potential data privacy breaches. In response, CDL has been carrying out various mitigating measures 

including staff awareness training and monitoring of local and international data privacy developments relevant to the company. 

Sustainable Finance (NEW)

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:  

Real estate and green technologies can 

be capital intensive. The rise of ESG 

investing and responsible banking, has 

unlocked alternative financing streams 

that can help lower the long-term cost of 

corporate borrowing and expand CDL’s 

pool of ESG-centric investors and lenders. 

In 2019, CDL implemented a Sustainable Finance Framework to be well prepared for opportunities in which sustainable financing 

can be used to fund projects that support CDL’s business strategy and vision. 

To accelerate the green building movement and low-carbon developments, we secured $500 million in green loans for new 

developments and pioneered a $250 million SDG Innovation Loan last year. This was an expansion from CDL’s pioneering issuance 

of a $100 million green bond by a Singapore company in 2017. 

Future-ready Workforce

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:  

A workforce that is ill-prepared to keep 

up with industry developments and 

technological trends will impact CDL’s 

human capital, operational efficiency, and 

sustained growth.

Building a workforce with skill sets that future-proof CDL’s business in a fast-changing and uncertain global economy is a 

priority. We actively foster a culture of continuous learning in our workforce, regardless of managerial level and gender, enabling 

employees to acquire holistic skills and competency to stay relevant and adapt effectively to changing job demands. 

Labour Conditions (NEW)

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:  

Creating a workplace that provides 

a decent work environment, fair 

remuneration, security in the workplace, 

freedom of expression, work-life balance, 

and career growth is key in building a 

sustainable work force. 

This allows CDL to strengthen employee 

loyalty, increase work productivity, 

strengthen teamwork, and increase the 

level of creativity.

We implemented the Workplace Anti-Harassment and Anti-Bullying Policy in 2019 to strengthen our commitment to maintaining a 

safe and harassment-free work environment for our employees.

In 2019, CDL joined the Sustainable Employment Pledge, a new initiative by Singapore Business Federation. We have pledged to 

make at least one improvement to our sustainable employment practices every 12 months.

Biennially, CDL conducts an employee engagement survey. From the results of the survey, each department’s nominated 

Engagement Champion facilitated meaningful focus group sessions on selected topics and monitored the progress of the action 

plans set out.

CDL’S MATERIAL ESG ISSUES

RISKS/OPPORTUNITIES

CDL’S RESPONSES AND ACHIEVEMENTS

Community Impact and 

Partnerships

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:  

Building goodwill in the community 

provides CDL with a strong social license 

to operate, strengthening CDL’s identity 

as a responsible company. 

Through working with like-minded 

partners, CDL has pioneered partnerships 

that create multiplier outreach and 

positive impact.

CDL’s strong community impact investment strategy covers key themes including promoting environmental awareness and zero 

waste, advocating best practices in sustainability, empowering youths and women, supporting local arts, and caring for the less 

fortunate. 

CDL’s extensive and varied 3P partnership programmes allow the company to raise awareness about climate change and the SDGs 

to a larger community, locally and abroad. This includes SSA that provides rent-free space to selected parties from public, private 

and NGOs who conduct activities that promote the SDGs and climate action. 

Human Rights4

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:   

We strongly believe in upholding 

fundamental principles of human rights 

along the value chain and in places where 

we operate.

We influence our value chain by engaging our builders and suppliers to abide by CDL’s fundamental principles and policies such 

as the Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy, and Universal Design Policy. Where we do not have a controlling interest, 

we encourage our stakeholders, including business partners, contractors, suppliers and joint venture partners to observe the CDL 

Human Rights Policy.

Water and Waste Management*

* Waste is a new material issue

Supporting SDGs:

TCFD Pillars:    

Singapore was ranked ‘most at risk of 

facing high water stress’ by the World 

Resource Institute in 2015. Water price in 

Singapore also went up by 30% between 

2017 and 2018. 

Waste management is a growing concern 

in Singapore as the country is expected to 

run out of landfill space by 2030. As such, 

more stringent regulations to manage 

waste can be anticipated.

CDL’s developments are designed with a strong focus on water sustainability and sound waste management throughout the 

lifecycle of any asset. We adopt technologies to raise water efficiency and minimise waste, such as rainwater harvesting and food 

waste digestors, which are implemented at many of our residential and commercial developments. 

The CDL Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint also sets out ambitious water and waste management targets, of which CDL 

is on track to meeting them. The company also collects high quality data internally to help drive water and waste management 

improvements. 

CDL achieved the 2019 CDP A List in water security, an affirmation of CDL’s robust water management strategy.

4 

This refers to considering potential human rights implications throughout a property’s lifecycle such as: design (e.g. accessibility of buildings), construction (e.g. workers’ rights, social and environmental impacts of selected construction 

materials), and property management (e.g. tenants and occupants’ digital  privacy and data protection rights).

CDL’s voluntary adoption of the TCFD framework since 2017 provides 

useful climate-related financial information for the investor community and 

complements our sustainability reporting.



ALIGNMENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF TCFD

As an early adopter of the IIRC’s integrated reporting approach in assessing  

our ESG impact through the financial lens, we have also utilised the TCFD framework 

since 2017 to better articulate climate-related risks that have financial impact. This 

section describes how CDL manages climate-related risks and opportunities, with 

reference to the four key pillars recommended by the TCFD. 

TCFD’S KEY PILLARS AND 

RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURES

CDL’S APPROACH

ADDRESSED IN THIS REPORT

Governance

CDL’s governance around  

climate-related risks and 

opportunities

• 

Our board-level BSC has oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities and typically meets biannually to 

review emerging climate-related issues and our low-carbon strategy and initiatives. 

• 

Our CSO leads the Sustainability team and reports directly to the BSC on all sustainability matters, including 

global and local climate-related issues.

• 

We have in place stringent climate-related policies and guidelines. Clear climate goals and targets are set under 

the CDL Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint. ESG performance is tracked regularly and reported in our 

online quarterly sustainability report, in addition to the annual sustainability report. 

Integrated Strategy for Value Creation, page 15

Reducing Environmental Impact, page 47

Shaping a Fair, Safe and Inclusive Workplace,  

page 68-71

Strategy

Proactive approach to identify 

and pre-empt potential impact 

of climate-related risks by setting 

ESG targets and practices to help 

business units to be future-ready 

for such risks. Strive to stay abreast 

of trends and highlight potential 

opportunities that may be unlocked 

by ESG best practices (e.g. green 

financing), innovative solutions to 

lower carbon footprint.    

• 

Mitigation: Our internal risk assessments have identified a list of material climate change risks and opportunities, 

which informed our sustainability strategy and forward-looking CDL Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint.   

• 

Materiality Analysis: In 2019, we conducted our third comprehensive materiality assessment, gathering insights 

from more than 200 stakeholders to prioritise our material issues. Innovation remained as the top material issue. 

Sustainable finance and waste management are newly-added material issues. This is aligned with CDL’s current 

approach in tapping on our ESG leadership to gain access to lowered cost of capital and wider pool of investor 

funds, and Singapore’s advocacy for a zero waste nation.    

• 

Climate Change Scenario Planning: In 2019, we extended our 2018 study to include a 1.5°C scenario to align 

with the findings of IPCC’s “Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C”. We assessed the financial impact of 

climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities to CDL’s core business operations in key markets. 

This is a step up from our 2018 study on 2°C and a business-as-usual 4°C scenario. The studies aim to give 

greater insight to the management to better prepare for the potential financial impact of both physical and 

transition risks of climate change.

• 

Low-carbon Economy: Raising the use of renewable energy will lower our carbon footprint. CDL will continue 

to procure RECs, following our 2018 pioneering adoption of RECs from a blockchain-empowered online 

marketplace.

CDL’S APPROACH

ADDRESSED IN THIS REPORT

Risk Management

The processes used by CDL to 

identify, assess, and manage  

climate-related risks 

• 

Climate change risks and related regulatory and raw material supply risks are identified as strategic business 

risks and managed under CDL’s ERM framework. 

• 

Our stakeholder-driven materiality assessment complements our ERM framework in identifying and assessing 

material ESG risks and opportunities. The assessment considered voluntary and regulatory requirements, 

including the Singapore Government’s pledge to the Paris Agreement and the imposed carbon taxation in 2019.

• 

Beyond managing climate-related risks and opportunities under the ERM framework, we also manage 

operational issues pertaining to climate change, energy, water and raw material supply through the ISO 14001 

Environmental Management System and ISO 50001 Energy Management System.

Metrics and Targets

The metrics and targets used to 

assess and manage climate-related 

risks and opportunities which are 

material to CDL’s business

• 

Since 2008, we have adopted the Ten Principles of UNGC and GRI reporting framework for our sustainability report. 

• 

In 2015, the IIRC framework was adopted to connect ESG performance with financial and business performance. 

• 

In 2016, CDL became the first real estate company in Singapore to embrace the SDGs in our sustainability 

reporting. In 2019, we continued to make progress, integrating and reporting on 14 relevant SDGs from the 

initial nine goals.   

• 

In 2017, CDL embraced the TCFD approach for our integrated sustainability reporting.  

• 

In addition to CDL’s core operations, we have been disclosing Scope 1, 2 and 3 of GHG emissions of CDL’s  

six key subsidiaries since 2015.

• 

Our environmental performance metrics are prepared in accordance to global standards including GHG 

Protocol and ISO 14064 for the quantification and reporting of GHG emissions and ISO 16745 for the disclosure 

of Republic Plaza’s carbon footprint. 

• 

In 2018, we became the first real estate company in Singapore to have our carbon reduction targets 

assessed and validated by SBTi. With that, CDL raised our targets, committing to reduce our carbon emission 

intensity across its Singapore operations by 59% by 2030 from base-year 2007. This aligns us with the agenda 

of keeping global temperature increase to less than 2°C, improving CDL’s set of robust, long-term targets 

for energy, water and waste reduction, as well as sustainable material use under our CDL Future Value 2030 

sustainability blueprint. 

• 

In 2019, CDL was amongst the pioneer batch of 87 global companies to join UNGC’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C 

campaign, pledging to set climate targets across our operations aligned with limiting global temperature rise  

to 1.5°C.

Our steadfast commitment to engaging stakeholders 

across our value chain catalyses change within the larger 

ecosystem, empowering us to build sustainable cities and 

communities for all. 

ENGAGING THE VALUE CHAIN TO EMBRACE 

SDGS, TCFD, IIRC, AND SASB

The CDL value chain management encapsulates how CDL 

embraces the relevant SDGs and harnesses the six capitals 

based on the IIRC framework. The activities, performance 

and value created through this integrated approach are 

connected and disclosed according to the four pillars under 

the TCFD recommendations. We are also aligned with SASB 

real estate sector-specific standards.

We have identified key areas along our value chain where 

we can create social and environmental impact, drawing 

reference from the “SDG Compass: The Guide for Business 

Action on the SDGs”, jointly developed by the GRI, UNGC, 

and WBCSD.

Leveraging our sphere of influence amongst stakeholders, 

we apply our core competencies, invest in innovations 

and engage our network to promote and contribute to 

the relevant SDGs (see diagram on the right). Underlying 

this value chain process is a proactive and continuous 

engagement with internal and external stakeholders through 

the lifecycle of asset development and management.

We support best industry practices and ESG commitments to uphold good corporate governance, conduct business with integrity, as well as promote fairness, responsibility and 

inclusivity along our value chain.     

BEST PRACTICES AND ESG COMMITMENTS

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER FINANCING TERRORISM POLICY

In 2016, CDL introduced the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing Terrorism Policy for our property business in line with URA’s guidance and the Monetary Authority of 

Singapore’s  mission to mitigate the risk of Singapore being used as a platform by global criminals and terrorist organisations to launder illicit funds. The Policy provides guidelines and 

procedures for our frontline sales and compliance function to detect and report such criminal acts.

BOARD DIVERSITY PLEDGE

In 2015, CDL supported the Board Diversity Pledge initiated by the Singapore Institute of Directors and SGX. By taking the Pledge, CDL commits to promote diversity as a key attribute of a 

well-functioning and effective Board. In 2017, the Board of CDL formally adopted the Board Diversity Policy, which sets out the policy and framework for promoting diversity on the Board.

CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

In 2016, CDL validated our corporate crisis management protocol which includes incident escalation, operational response and crisis communication. The effort culminated in a crisis 

simulation exercise where Senior Management was put through a series of rigorous crisis scenario-based tests and a mock media conference and interview.

As of 1 February 2020, CDL has released a Group-wide Incident Escalation and Reporting Framework to facilitate structured reporting and management of all incidents with a potential 

financial, operational or reputational impact on the Group.

EMPLOYERS’ PLEDGE OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

CDL is a signatory of the Employers’ Pledge of Fair Employment Practices with TAFEP. TAFEP works with employer organisations, unions and the Government to create awareness and 

facilitate the adoption of fair employment practices. The alliance is co-chaired by representing employer unions and National Trades Union Congress.

ETHICAL MARKETING PRACTICES

Since 2000, we have developed a set of internal procedures and an operational manual for marketing and leasing. These are reviewed annually to reflect changes in marketing practices, 

technology, regulation, and stakeholder expectations.

Marketing collaterals produced by CDL are compliant with the Singapore Code of Advertising Practice administered by the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore, an Advisory 

Council to the Consumers Association of Singapore. 

CDL’s marketing practices also comply with the URA’s Housing Developers Rules (HDR) and BCA’s Guidelines for Outdoor Signs at our construction sites. The HDR seeks to enhance 

transparency in the real estate industry, enabling homebuyers to make better informed decisions when buying a home, while the BCA guidelines prohibit cross-marketing of other products 

and services.

GREEN LEASE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMME

To support our commercial tenants’ efforts to lower their carbon footprint, we implemented the Green Lease Partnership Programme in 2014. Since end 2019, 100% of existing tenants 

have pledged their commitment to go green by signing a Green Lease.

CDL’s unwavering sustainability efforts have  

contributed to the transformation of the built landscape, 

driving innovation to deliver quality excellence and 

creating positive impact across the value chain. With  

10 years left to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 

Development, transitioning towards a climate-resilient 

economy aligned with the SDGs – particularly SDG 11 

(Sustainable Cities and Communities) – will remain  

a strategic focus in our business.

DRIVING INNOVATION TO DELIVER QUALITY 

EXCELLENCE 

Innovation has been a top priority in our growth and 

investment strategy, and we will continue to commit resources 

to scout for the latest technology and solutions that will help 

raise our ESG performance. Endorsed by the Management 

and supported by the Board, we have set the following 

targets to take our green building ambition to the next level: 

• 

Setting a minimum target for all new developments to be 

BCA Green Mark GoldPLUS certified, two tiers above the 

mandatory BCA Green Mark certification level (since 2011) 

• Investing 2% to 5% of the construction cost of new 

developments in green and healthy design and features

• Commitment to achieving BCA Green Mark certification 

for 90% of CDL owned and/or managed buildings,  

by 2030

• Commitment to reduce the embodied carbon of  

our construction materials by 24% as compared  

to conventional equivalents, by 2030

• 

Commitment to achieve at least one SLE building  

by 2023

(Details of how our green buildings have achieved 

significant energy and cost savings for us and building 

occupants can be found here.)

As CDL continues to expand our overseas property 

development business, we have applied the same best-in- 

class green expertise and standards for our overseas 

projects. In 2019, CDL acquired a site at Monk Bridge, 

Leeds in the UK and planning is underway to transform  

the original stonework viaducts into an elevated public 

green space designed in the style of New York’s famed  

High Line, which will have a transformative effect on  

the local community. CDL’s Chongqing Eling Palace 

received the highest-tier BCA Green Mark Platinum Award 

in 2017, a first for a residential project in China. With a 

wide array of energy and water-efficient features, the 

development is designed to be 36% more energy-efficient 

and 24% more water-efficient than other code-compliant 

buildings in Chongqing city, China.

As at 31 December 2019, we have 110 BCA Green  

Mark developments and office interiors¹, the highest 

amongst all local developers. The full list of our BCA 

Green Mark awards from 2005 to 2019 can be found  

on www.cdlsustainability.com.

NUS-CDL Smart Green Home. Officially launched on  

31 January 2019 by Mr Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime 

Minister and Singapore’s Minister for Finance, the  

NUS-CDL Smart Green Home is a test laboratory built 

like a two-bedroom apartment, and has been running 

trials for new building solutions such as energy-efficient 

ways to cool the interior of homes. Located at the School 

of Design and Environment Building 4, the flexible 

configuration of the laboratory allows ease of setup for 

experiments to be conducted.

NUS-CDL T2 Lab. Operational since early 2018, the 

107m2 laboratory aims to enable researchers to examine 





Through running trials such as the integration of solar panels and fast-growing farming systems into the NUS-CDL T2 Lab’s modular building façades, the Lab  

studies the impact on natural cross ventilation, daylight, and thermal comfort in buildings.



Towards Carbon Neutral 

CDL is committed to enhancing the environmental  

performance of our properties by investing in 

infrastructure enhancements when required. 

Leading by example, we voluntarily reduced 

our annual carbon emissions to net-zero for our 

corporate office operations including our data 

centre, and for 11 Tampines Concourse – the  

first CarbonNeutral® development in Singapore 

and Asia Pacific. Besides carbon neutralising  

the construction phase of 11 Tampines 

Concourse, we also annually offset emissions 

from its operations, including that of its tenants.

Investing in R&amp;D and Technologies for  

Low-carbon and Climate-resilient Buildings 

R&amp;D and technology are fundamental in improving the 

quality of the built environment, and raising the standards 

of building performance and construction methods. In 

partnership with NUS, the NUS-CDL Smart Green Home 

and NUS-CDL Tropical Technologies Laboratory (NUS-CDL 

T2 Lab) were opened in 2019 and 2018 respectively. Both 

laboratories  will conduct studies on smart features, green 

building technologies, and design for sustainable living.

integrated technology solutions for people-centric, climate-

responsive buildings of the future, particularly for intensified, 

compact urban environments like Singapore. The NUS-CDL 

T2 Lab has since intensified its research into the application 

of BIPV to replace conventional materials of a building’s 

envelope. It also explores the incorporation of solar panels, 

solar shading devices and food production on building 

façades, in line with the move towards self-sustaining 

buildings. The NUS-CDL T2 Lab also includes other research 

focusing on building materials and technologies such as 

tropical timber. This paves the way for the development of 

more inclusive and holistic buildings that will contribute to 

Singapore’s vision of becoming a biophilic and sustainable city.

Boosting Productivity and Design through 

Innovative Construction 

Leveraging our expertise in prefabricated construction since 

the early 2000s, CDL became the first developer in Asia 

to adopt the advanced concrete PPVC technology for The 

Brownstone, a large-scale 638-unit EC completed in 2017. It 

was also the world’s largest application of concrete PPVC for 

a large-scale private residential development. 

The PPVC method yields significantly higher productivity 

and enhances construction quality, while improving worksite 

safety and reducing waste. As prefabrication takes place 

offsite, fewer workers are required on-site, leading to less 

downtime, as well as cleaner worksites and less construction 

waste. In the case of The Brownstone EC, the use of PPVC 

raised construction productivity by over 40%, saved 55,000 

man-days, and resulted in waste generation that was 

significantly below CDL’s stringent internal waste targets. In 

recognition of our efforts to raise construction productivity 

through innovative technology, CDL was conferred the 

Platinum accolade by BCA in the 2017 BCA Construction 

Productivity Awards. 

We also partnered with the Solar Energy Research Institute 

of Singapore (SERIS)2 in a pilot project to develop and 

integrate BIPV with PPVC technology. The three-year pilot, 

which commenced in June 2018 at The Tapestry, tested 

the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility of future 

applications and deployment. 

2 

SERIS is supported by NUS, National Research Foundation, and Economic Development Board.

At Boulevard 88 and The 

Singapore EDITION, we 

adopted the use of virtual 

design and construction 

technology during the design 

development phase. Using 

an architectural 3D model, 

CDL was able to optimise 

the building orientation and 

make informed decisions 

on the façade shading, site 

ventilation and building layout. 

Productivity gain is expected 

to be approximately 50%, 

while heat gain is expected 

to be 20% less for these 

developments.

Driving Innovation – Enterprise Innovation 

Committee 

In this age of rapid evolution and disruption, CDL recognises 

that innovation is imperative to achieve a balanced triple 

bottom line and long-term sustainable growth. To foster 

creativity among CDL staff, the Enterprise Innovation 

Committee (EIC) was formed by CDL Group CEO  

Mr Sherman Kwek in 2018. Chaired by CDL Group Chief 

Strategy Officer Mr Kwek Eik Sheng, the EIC generates 

customer- and digital-centric ideas to support the 

advancement of CDL’s business, focusing on areas like 

energy analytics, video analytics, and digital twins. 

Anchored in value creation, the EIC innovation engine 

comprises three mutually reinforcing gears and its operating 

model was finetuned in 2019. Moving forward, CDL will 

continue to build innovation momentum by emphasising 

on: (i) value created on pipeline conversion; (ii) capability 

and awareness building amongst CDL staff; and (iii) robust 

repeatable process to manage innovation investments.

CDL INNOVATION STRATEGY

INNOVATION ENGINE COMPRISING  

THREE MUTUALLY REINFORCING GEARS

FINETUNED OPERATING MODEL IN 2019

KEY EXAMPLES

Pipeline

Generate, prioritise ideas and 

diagnose known problems. 

Further scope and execute 

innovation projects.

 

• 

Operationalised inaugural innovation 

KPIs to accelerate CDL-wide efforts to 

identify and capture value through executing 

innovation projects.

• 

Fostered stronger cross-department 

collaboration and executed pilots to 

elevate key customer experiences and raise 

productivity.

• 

Conducted Customer Journey Mapping (CJM) workshops to raise capability building 

amongst CDL staff, break down silo mentality, and foster stronger cross-functional 

collaboration. This valuable tool provided insightful outside-in and inside-out information 

for all levels across any department, improving understanding of the paths and channels 

customers take. It also enabled CDL to identify pain points and co-ideate solutions to 

enhance the customer experience.

• 

Installed smart lockers at The Brownstone EC, The Criterion, and Coco Palms, reducing the 

need for residents to wait at home for their parcels.

• 

Implemented new-to-CDL marketing tactics — launched a six-week Instagram photo 

contest and a pop-up interactive wall — to widen CDL’s brand exposure and drive 

awareness of new residential launch Haus on Handy.

People &amp; Culture

To be a learning organisation, 

take appropriate risk, and 

experiment and promote an 

owner’s mindset.

• 

Stepped up efforts to shape an innovation 

culture through organising knowledge-

exchange fireside chats and establishing 

platforms for employees to pitch ideas.

• 

EIC organised internal staff training sessions to generate greater awareness of the 

company’s innovation strategy, which aims to raise the odds of successful execution.

• 

EIC also distributed a fortnightly e-newsletter with information about global trends and 

building innovations, and put forth business challenges to crowdsource ideas company-

wide. Ideas generated by our staff through avenues such as the e-newsletters and CJM 

workshops were then captured in EIC’s Central Ideas Repository and assessed based on 

relevance and the value creation potential for CDL’s stakeholders.

• 

Start-ups and other innovative companies that were aligned with our business operations 

were invited to speak at EIC Fireside Chats, a series of informal knowledge-sharing 

generated organic cross-departmental discussions, opening doors for potential collaboration.

Investments

Invest in PropTech Venture 

Capital (VC) funds and  

start-ups (contributing to the 

pipeline), extract value from 

insights, partnership and 

potential returns.

• 

Continued to invest in synergistic 

PropTech, enabling CDL to keep a pulse  

on the latest innovation trends and leverage 

new technologies.

• 

Following a successful pilot with Gush using its mould-prevention paint at Nouvel 18, CDL 

invested $3 million in Gush, a Singapore start-up, which produces sustainable paint that 

purifies air, eliminates bacteria and regulates humidity.

• 

Invested in VC funds managed by established firms, such as US-based Fifth Wall and China-

based Dragonrise Capital.

Supporting Start-ups at Incubator For SDGs

In support of social enterprises with purpose that are aligned 

with one or more SDGs, the Incubator For SDGs was another 

initiative by CDL in 2019, in partnership with UNDP, raiSE, 

and Social Collider. Located at the basement of Republic 

Plaza, Incubator For SDGs provides rent-free workspaces for 

selected social enterprises and start-ups for a year. Currently 

occupied by eight social enterprises and start-ups, these 

companies will also be able to tap into an extensive network 

of management experts to help them scale up and reach out 

to potential investors and markets. To align with CDL’s low-

carbon vision, 70% of the fitting out materials were made 

from sustainable sources or recycled materials. 

Delivering Leading Quality Buildings and High 

Safety Standards 

Our developments have consistently excelled under the 

CONQUAS scheme, entrenching the company’s reputation 

as one of the highest scoring CONQUAS developers. In 

2019, our developments achieved an average CONQUAS 

score of 90.4%. Established in 1989, the BCA CONQUAS3 

is the industry benchmark for quality and workmanship 

standards of construction projects in Singapore. Although it 

is not mandatory for private sector projects to subscribe to 

CONQUAS, CDL has consistently pushed for all our projects 

to be assessed since the assessment system was introduced. 

In 2019, CDL emerged as the only developer to be conferred 

the Quality Excellence Award – Quality Champion (Platinum) 

for seven consecutive years, which is a testament to our 

steadfast commitment to delivering quality green homes 

and commercial spaces. This award recognises leading 

progressive developers and builders for their commitment 

and achievement in delivering high quality homes through 

workmanship excellence and quality assurance programmes.

To uphold good workmanship and meet the rising expectations 

of homeowners, CDL has started submitting all residential 

developments for the BCA Quality Mark assessment since 

its introduction in 2002. A voluntary scheme for developers, 

the Quality Mark measures the quality of workmanship in 

each newly completed residential unit, covering all internal 

finishes such as flooring, wall and ceiling finishes, architectural 

components and fittings, and mechanical and electrical (M&amp;E) 

fittings and switches. In 2019, 523 residential units developed 

by CDL applied for the BCA Quality Mark certification, the 

outcome of which is still pending at the time of this publication.

PUTTING PEOPLE IN THE HEART OF WHAT 

WE BUILD

Wellness and Health are Priorities in Green 

Spaces We Build 

Aligned with Singapore’s vision of being a “Biophilic City in 

a Garden”, CDL is a firm supporter of greening our urban 

spaces. This design approach is most relevant and appealing 

as it addresses the global trends on health and wellness 

in the built environment and higher expectation amongst 

homeowners. All our new residential developments devote 

more than 40% of the site area to landscaping and communal 

facilities incorporating innovative designs and features – many 

projects have often gone way above Singapore’s regulatory 

requirement. Some of these have become iconic features and 

a key differentiator for CDL’s residential projects, for instance:

- 

Amber Park: 65% of site area dedicated to facilities, 

lifestyle space and landscaping; features The Stratosphere, 

a 600m rooftop jogging track connecting three 21-storey 

towers and a rooftop recreational deck at 235 feet high

3 

BCA CONQUAS is the defacto national standard assessment system on the quality of buildings. The assessment consists of three main components: structural works, architectural works, and M&amp;E works.

523 residential units developed by CDL applied for the BCA Quality Mark certification, the outcome of which is still pending at the time of this publication.



Launched in May 2019 (Expected TOP: 2023), Amber Park has been designed 

with sustainability in mind. Notable green features include optimal building 

orientation that allows good natural ventilation while minimising heat gain, 

and sun shadings and performance glazing on the building façades to 

achieve maximum comfort for building occupants.

Supporting Tenants to Go Green through 

the Green Lease Partnership Programme 

CDL implemented the Green Lease Partnership 

Programme since 2014 to support our commercial 

tenants’ efforts to lower their carbon footprint. Since 

end-2017, 100% of existing tenants have pledged 

their commitment to go green by signing a Green 

Lease. Some Green Lease Partnership Programme 

activities are: 

• All new tenants receive kits comprising green 

guidelines and checklists to help them in fitting 

out works and operations.

• CDL annually conducts various end-user 

initiatives, e.g. conducting eco-themed movie 

screenings, and talks and workshops on 

environmental-related issues.

• 

In support of World Green Building Week 2019, 

CDL conducted a quiz reaching out to close to 

1,000 tenants on reducing their carbon footprint 

in the workplace and on the intrinsic links 

between green and healthy workplaces. 

- 

Coco Palms: 54% of site area features extensive lush 

landscaping and green features

- 

Tree House: 77% of site area dedicated to 

landscaping and greenery; made it into The Guinness 

World Records from April 2014 to June 2015 for 

the largest vertical garden on its 24-storey building, 

featuring aesthetically-pleasing greenery that also 

lowers energy needed to cool indoor spaces by up  

to 30%5

Engaging Tenants in our Green Initiatives 

Beyond investing in green infrastructure, we work closely 

with our commercial tenants, given that tenant and occupant 

activities within a building can account for close to 50%6 of the 

total electricity consumption of a building. Through our Green 

Lease Partnership Programme, we have shifted user mindsets 

and behaviour to jointly achieve progress for the worldwide 

green movement and dovetail nationwide efforts with BCA’s 

3rd Green Building Masterplan for Singapore’s future. 

As a result of dedicated landlord-tenant efforts, six of our 

commercial properties, constituting 78% of GFA, have been 

awarded the BCA Green Mark Pearl/Pearl Prestige Award, which  

are given to building owners with a substantial number of tenants 

who are certified under the BCA Green Mark occupant-centric 

schemes. To ensure that tenant engagement efforts stay relevant 

and impactful, CDL holds regular, internal taskforce meetings 

chaired by our Senior Management to review their progress. 

In recognition of our tenant engagement efforts, CDL’s Republic 

Plaza Tower 1 was conferred the BCA Green Mark Pearl Award 

in 2019. For example, one of its tenants, Distrii Singapore, 

adopted the use of 100% LED lighting and achieved more than 

50% improvement in lighting power density.

5 

Research conducted by NUS has shown that across the 48 west-facing bedrooms insulated by the vertical garden, heat absorption has been lowered by up to 3°C,  

reducing energy required to cool the indoor spaces. As a result, the condominium achieves air-conditioning energy savings of approximately 98,000 kWh/year.

Green Living Engagement

Since 2004, CDL has implemented the Let’s Live 

Green! eco-home initiative for our newly completed 

residential properties. As part of the initiative, 

homebuyers receive a Green Living Guide, designed 

specifically to provide eco-friendly tips for a green 

lifestyle and to encourage active usage of green 

features and facilities catered within the individual 

property units and in the common areas. In 2019, no 

green living guides were distributed as there was no 

projects that obtained TOP that year.

Longstanding Commitment to Support EV 

Adoption 

The transition to EV is accelerating in Singapore, particularly 

on the back of the Singapore Budget 2020 announcement  

to both create 28,000 charging points by 2030 and phase 

out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040. Since the 

early 2010s, CDL has been at the forefront of providing 

carpark lots with EV chargers, gearing up in anticipation 

of a growing EV trend and as part of our unwavering 

commitment towards a low-carbon economy. City Square 

Mall was the first shopping mall in Singapore to offer 

communal EV parking lots and chargers in 2012. 

In 2019, CDL was one of the leading landlords to partner 

with SP Group to provide direct current fast chargers for 

EV. With this initiative, Republic Plaza is the first commercial 

building in Singapore’s Central Business District (CBD) to 

have a direct current fast-charging point, bringing greater 

convenience to EV drivers. Tagore 23 Warehouse also joined 

SP’s growing network of EV charging points last year. 

We have also partnered with BlueSG and Greenlots in EV 

sharing programmes by providing carpark lots with charging 

stations at Republic Plaza, Tagore 23 Warehouse, Central 

Mall, and City Square Mall. 

Currently, under CDL Green Specifications, EV chargers are 

mandatory provisions at our new commercial properties, an 

extension of our pioneering efforts for City Square Mall and 

Quayside Isle. Going forward, we will look into expanding it 

to include residential developments, as well as explore the 

potential of EV chargers at existing properties managed by 

CDL. These efforts will help support the transformation of 

the local urban mobility scene.

Social Inclusion through Universal Design 

In line with our commitment to put users’ needs as a 

priority in the spaces we build, CDL instituted a company-

wide Universal Design Policy since 2011. Endorsed by 

CDL’s top management, the policy exceeds the mandatory 

requirements specified in the Code of Barrier-Free 

Accessibility by BCA to create an inclusive built environment 

in Singapore that caters to the varied needs of the public. 

The policy also contributes to SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities 

and Communities), which sets out to provide safe, accessible 

and green public spaces to every member of society.

In partnership with SP Group, the direct current fast chargers at Republic 

Plaza can charge a car in 30 mins, bringing greater convenience to EV drivers 

in the CBD.

City Square Mall was the first and only mall in 2018 to be 

conferred the BCA-MSF Universal Design Mark for Family-

Friendly Business. In 2019, Piermont Grand clinched the 

highest-tier BCA Green Mark Platinum, and the BCA 

Universal Design Mark GoldPLUS. Key Universal Design 

features include quality living spaces created through 

optimised block and unit design to maximise and facilitate 

flexibility with evolving needs of homeowners. In addition, 

innovative design and technology has been incorporated 

to support ageing-in-place, overcome undulating site 

conditions and/or mitigate space constraints. For example, 

the level difference between the development and the 

existing park connector has been mitigated through the 

provision of pedestrian and bicycle ramps. This allows 

residents to access the park connector easily, where both 

the young and old can take part in fitness activities.

To continue to raise standards, CDL aims to achieve at 

least BCA Green Mark GoldPLUS for the Universal Design 

certification of all its new developments to integrate 

user-centric philosophy into our design, operations and 

maintenance and contribute largely to an inclusive and 

barrier-free built environment.

Achieving High Customer Satisfaction 

To better understand customers’ expectations, identify 

areas for improvement, and enhance service quality, CDL 

frequently reviews customer satisfaction measurements 

through formal surveys. Our target is to achieve at least 70% 

satisfaction rate from homebuyers and at least 80% from 

office, industrial and retail tenants. 

For homebuyers, an online customer satisfaction survey 

is sent at least nine months after handover to measure 

their experience across various touch points. Feedback

and suggestions on project design, apartment features, 

as well as facilities and amenities are recorded for future 

reference and follow up. As part of the tenant engagement 

programme and continued efforts for improvement, tenants 

of commercial properties are surveyed annually on their 

levels of satisfaction on areas such as building and services 

management. In 2019, the office and retail sectors continue 

to exceed the targeted 80% tenant satisfaction rate. The 

decrease in industrial sector’s satisfaction rate could be 

attributed to the inconveniences caused by upgrading works 

of the buildings and nearby sites.

In 2019, a customer satisfaction survey was conducted for 

The Criterion. The homebuyers were surveyed on their levels 

of satisfaction, ranging from the property’s finishes and 

workmanship, overall construction quality, green features 

provided in the home, facilities and landscaping at common 

areas, and management of defects rectification. 74.2% and 

76.4% of the homebuyers who responded to the survey 

were satisfied with the management of defect rectification  

of the strata units and common areas respectively.

Since 2018, CDL relaunched the Homebuyer e-Portal that 

provides for homebuyers of each project, information on 

their property unit, the construction progress including 

updates of photos of project site and estimated TOP date, 

billing schedule, project payment status and booking of 

appointments for handover of their property units when  

the project has obtained TOP. With the “My CDL Home” 

mobile app launched in 2019, these information can now  

be readily available at the fingertips.

Data Privacy  

Information security materials are made available to better 

educate stakeholders on prevailing risks, especially in the 

handling of sensitive corporate data. Since 2014, we have 

implemented a Data Privacy Policy which informs stakeholders 

on how CDL manages personal data in compliance with the 

Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (No. 26 of 2012). 

Customers and business partners can get in touch with our 

Data Protection Officer by mail, email and phone on matters 

concerning their personal data with CDL. The Data Privacy 

Policy is made available to the public on our corporate website.

CDL’s Social Media Guidelines advocate employees’ 

responsibility on the use of social media, including taking 

precautions for the protection of information privacy.

In 2019, there were no substantiated complaints 

concerning breaches of customer privacy, theft, leak and 

loss of customer data or critical information.

The Singapore Sustainability Academy (SSA) –  

A Hub for Capacity Building, Knowledge Sharing, 

and Networking

Sustainability has always been deeply rooted in CDL’s 

heritage. Aside from embedding sustainability in our business, 

we also saw the opportunity to leverage our track record as 

a leading green builder to promote sustainability within the 

community. Tapping on our network of partners and expertise 

in green buildings, we designed and built the SSA, which 

opened on World Environment Day, 5 June 2017. 

The SSA is a BCA Green Mark Platinum building and was the first building in Singapore to have its construction materials, Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) and 

Glued Laminated Timber (Glulam), verified by the Nature’s BarcodeTM system as coming from responsible sources. As a zero-energy building, the SSA has 

installed over 3,200 square feet of PV panels, and a real-time energy tracker system to measure its solar energy yield. Over the first two years of operations, the 

PV panels generated an annual yield of some 60,000 kWh, exceeding the average energy consumption of about 50,000 kWh per annum.    



The SSA is the first ground-up initiative and zero-energy facility 

in Singapore dedicated to advocacy, thought leadership, 

collaboration, and capacity building for climate action and 

green causes. The academy embraced the SDGs with an 

extensive partnership involving six government agencies and 

15 industry and NGO partners including our operating partner, 

Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS).

Republic Plaza - CDL’s Flagship Office Building

Since its completion in 1996, Republic Plaza has 

continuously undergone several enhancements, including 

major retrofitting of chiller plants and installation of 

energy efficient lighting with motion sensors to improve 

the building’s energy efficiency. In 2019, Republic Plaza 

further enhanced its features, such as modernising 

its lifts and introducing the latest destination control 

system – both of which are estimated to reduce 

energy consumption by 18% and increase lift operation 

efficiency when upgrading works are completed.

Standing at 66 storeys and 280 metres high, Republic Plaza is one of 

the tallest skyscrapers in Singapore. 



The built sector accounts for some 40% of global 

energy-related carbon emissions1. Since embarking 

on our sustainability journey more than two decades 

ago, CDL has put in place a comprehensive suite of 

policies, processes and systems to measure our efforts 

in environmental protection and conservation. Our 

goal is to reduce carbon emissions, maximise energy 

and water efficiency, reduce waste disposal, and 

increase sustainable use of resources. With Singapore 

announcing its goal to halve its emissions by 2050 after 

its 2030 peak and aiming to achieve net-zero emissions 

as soon as viable in the second half of the century2, our 

longstanding environmental strategies will contribute 

to the nationwide transition to a low-carbon future.

CLIMATE AND CARBON MANAGEMENT 

STRATEGY

To support Singapore’s vision for a low-carbon and 

sustainable future and the global acceleration of net-zero 

carbon buildings, CDL is dedicated to strengthening 

our resource-efficient and climate-resilient portfolio to 

contribute towards carbon mitigation and environmental 

protection. Our goals of reducing carbon emissions, 

electricity, water usage and waste disposal are mapped 

out in our CDL Future Value 2030 sustainability blueprint, 

which was launched in 2017. We have taken proactive 

steps to continuously review our targets against global 

standards and best practices; and in 2018, we validated 

our carbon emissions reduction targets against the SBTi. 

Since 2009, CDL has stayed ahead of the curve by 

voluntarily reducing our annual carbon emissions to 

net-zero for our corporate office operations including 

our data centre, and 11 Tampines Concourse – the first 

CarbonNeutral® development in Singapore and the  

Asia Pacific. Energy efficiency and the reduction of our 

carbon footprint will remain our top priorities. Apart  

from installing solar and BIPV panels to increase the 

generation of renewable energy at selected investment 

buildings since early 2000s, we have also stepped up  

our participation in the RECs marketplace since 2017.  

To further lower our carbon footprint, we will continue  

to explore innovative carbon reduction initiatives  

and partnerships.

PHYSICAL RISKS

P1

Increased frequency and severity of climate events such as floods and heatwaves increase the risk of 

stranded assets. We regularly conduct climate resilience tests and review control measures for our managed 

buildings. In addition, due diligence studies are conducted on potential asset acquisitions. Moving forward, we 

plan to develop holistic climate risk assessments for potential new acquisitions. 

OPPORTUNITIES 

O1

Consumer activism is on the rise globally. More consumers are expressing preference for greener products 

and brands that are committed to responsible business practices. This will present new market opportunities. 

Committed to “Conserving as We Construct” since 1995, CDL has been at the forefront in investing in green 

buildings and innovations. This has sharpened our competitive edge in meeting the growing consumer preference 

for green and sustainable spaces. 

O2

Global shift to low-carbon growth is gaining steam. Advances in technology present a huge opportunity to 

reduce energy cost and transition towards a low-carbon economy. With early adoption of carbon neutrality, 

renewable energy, sustainable materials, and building technologies, CDL is in a strong position to raise the bar for 

energy efficiency and low-carbon performance for our business operations. 

O3

Pioneering adoption of green finance in Singapore. The rapid growth of responsible investing and sustainable 

finance globally provides significant opportunities for us to unlock alternative financing streams. Leveraging CDL’s 

strong ESG track record has helped lower our long-term borrowing cost and expand our pool of ESG-centric 

investors and lenders. Going forward, we will continue to explore potential growth and investment avenues 

through sustainable financing and business opportunities that are aligned with sustainable development.

CDL’S RESPONSES TO CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

Note: Priority levels are determined by the severity of impact and certainty of the risk/opportunity.

Climate Change Scenario Planning – Phase 2

Aligned with the recommendations of TCFD and IPCC, CDL 

expanded the scope of our climate change scenario planning 

that we embarked on in 2018. Phase 2 of the study aims to 

better prepare our business for the potential financial impacts 

of both physical and transition risks of climate change. 

CDL approached the extended study with two scenarios by 

2030 – one in which we assumed the world would decarbonise 

fast enough to meet the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting 

climate change to a global average surface temperature rise 

of 2°C and another in which a more ambitious 1.5°C above 

pre-industrial level rise was used. A systematic and cohesive 

approach was used to holistically assess and quantify all 

potential impacts on CDL’s selected portfolio from material 

climate-related risks and opportunities. 

TRANSITION RISKS

T1

Climate-related policy risks (e.g. increased carbon taxes and more stringent building standards) 

increase operating and construction costs. Through regular asset upgrading and enhancement efforts, 

as well as accelerated investment in green and low-carbon features and innovations in our development 

projects, we have been able to stay ahead of the curve and mitigate such risks.

T2

Water security risks increase operating costs and disrupt business continuity. Our developments 

are designed with a strong focus on water sustainability throughout the lifecycle of any asset. We will 

continue to explore adopting commercially viable water management solutions where possible. 

T3

Call for companies to take greater responsibility of their waste production, leading to increased 

operating costs. To meet rising expectations, companies are compelled to invest in sound and effective 

waste management systems, hence increasing waste management costs. CDL’s developments are 

designed with a strong focus on sound waste management throughout the lifecycle of any asset. Parc 

Emily, our residential project completed in 2008, was the first residence in Singapore to be equipped with 

the twin-chute pneumatic waste collection system. We went on to implement innovative waste solutions 

such as on-site food waste treatment system at Le Grove Serviced Residences and will continue to 

explore adopting commercially viable waste management solutions.

T4

Climate risks lead to higher insurance premiums, lower coverage, and expose uninsurable assets. 

In addition to continuing our efforts to develop green buildings, we can also explore influencing policy 

discussions and suitable platforms that can help shape the insurance landscape for the built sector.

TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS FROM CDL’S CORE OPERATIONS IN SINGAPORE (Tonnes CO2e)

Carbon Emissions Reduction 

Performance 

Our carbon performance is monitored 

against targets set under CDL Future Value 

2030 sustainability blueprint and interim 

targets adopted for the year. In 2019, we 

achieved a reduction in carbon emissions intensity of 38% as 

compared to the baseline year of 2007, achieving our interim 

target. In recognition of CDL’s rigorous climate strategy and 

carbon management, we have achieved the 2019 CDP A List 

for corporate leadership in climate action. 

Total carbon emissions in 2019 were lower compared to 

2018 (refer to the chart on Total Carbon Emissions from 

CDL’s Core Operations in Singapore). This was achieved by a 

multi-pronged approach including continued implementation 

of carbon reduction initiatives at CDL Managed Buildings 

and increased adoption of solar energy solutions.  

Reported as Scope 2 emissions, electricity usage forms 

the largest source of emissions for CDL’s core operations 

in Singapore, accounting for more than 71% of our carbon 

footprint in 2019. As such, our carbon mitigation strategy has 

been largely focussed on addressing Scope 2 emissions.

CDL also recognises the importance of addressing  

Scope 3 emissions, given that another source of a 

company’s emissions lie upstream and/or downstream 

of its core operations. Monitoring and reporting Scope 

3 emissions aids CDL in determining where emissions 

in our value chain concentrate and where to focus our 

carbon reduction efforts.

Notes (applicable throughout this chapter): 

• 

Figures stated in charts may not add up due to rounding of decimals.

• 

In accordance with GHG Protocol, Scope 2 emissions are calculated using both location-based and market-based methods. The figures for carbon emissions shown in brackets represent calculations using a market-based method and 

includes the reduction in emissions from the purchase of RECs.

• 

Corporate Office: CDL Corporate Office in Singapore occupied approximately 5,013 m2 across four floors in Republic Plaza, calculated based on monthly average area of the corporate office headquarters.

• 

Managed Buildings: In 2019, CDL managed nine office buildings, two retail buildings, and three industrial buildings in Singapore, with an average monthly net lettable area of 176,057 m2, 45,310 m2 and 36,308 m2 respectively. 

Intensity figures are now calculated using per unit net lettable area instead of the previously used per unit leased floor area, to enable more accurate tracking of resource consumption in our managed buildings. As such, intensity 

figures for managed buildings from 2015 to 2018 have been restated.

•

ENERGY REDUCTION AND MANAGEMENT 

STRATEGY

Electricity constitutes a significant proportion of our 

operational expenditure, and further impacts the total 

amount of Scope 2 emissions released through our business 

activities. CDL places great emphasis on improving our 

energy performance in a cost-effective manner to bring about 

reductions in carbon emissions and energy intensities.

With this priority in mind, we became the first developer in 

Singapore to achieve the ISO 50001 energy management 

system certification for the provision of property and facilities 

management services in 2014. We have since continued 

to set energy reduction targets for each of the investment 

properties we manage, while continually improving energy 

performance through careful review and implementation of 

energy management plans. 

Lifecycle Approach to Energy Management

Initiatives to maximise energy efficiency and increase energy 

conservation are applied across our key business units and 

at various stages in a building’s lifecycle. Each business unit 

adheres to guidelines that detail the strategic initiatives, 

performance standards, and specific requirements relating to 

energy efficiency and climate change mitigation measures. 

These guidelines are embraced through the various stages of

the development of a building from the design, construction 

to the operation of the asset.

Energy Reduction Initiatives

Since 2004, CDL has retrofitted all our managed buildings by 

upgrading chiller plants, introducing motion sensors, installing 

energy efficient lighting, and recladding facades. On average, 

these efforts have yielded an estimated annual energy savings 

of around 17.7 million kWh, equivalent to more than S$4.1 

million of cost-savings in 20194. We have also incorporated 

climate-resilient design and installations, such as green roofs 

and vertical green walls, into our investment properties to 

reduce heat gain and mitigate urban heat island effect. 

CDL actively engages our tenants to raise awareness  

and encourage adoption of energy conservation measures. 

In partnership with Tuas Power, we introduced the 

automated meter reading portal initiative in 2014  

for our tenants to monitor their electricity use on a near 

real-time basis. This empowers our tenants to keep tabs on 

their individual units’ energy consumption and formulate 

initiatives to achieve energy savings. In addition, incentives 

from both Tuas Power and CDL are granted to tenants who 

achieve substantial reductions in electricity consumption.

Accelerating Renewable Energy Solutions 

The adoption of renewable energy has always been integral in 

the design and construction of our projects. In addition to the 

installation of solar panels to generate solar power at selected 

investment buildings since the early 2000s, we also started to 

progressively participate in the emerging RECs marketplace 

since 2017. In 2018, we were the first Singapore developer to 

buy RECs using SP Group’s blockchain-enabled platform. This 

has enabled us to expand our renewable energy usage in line 

with our renewable energy sourcing strategy. 

By procuring locally-sourced RECs, CDL attributed 100% of 

the electricity consumed by our headquarters’ operations 

and part of our commercial buildings’ operations in 2019 

to renewable sources. This offsets 805 tonnes of carbon 

emissions, equivalent to powering over 450 typical 4-room 

HDB flats for one year. 

Energy Efficiency and Reduction Performance   

As part of our EHS and ISO 50001 Management Systems 

objectives and push for continual improvements in our 

energy performance, CDL has been tracking and reporting 

our environmental performance against our energy targets 

since 2007. 

In 2019, there was an increase in energy intensity for our 

managed buildings as compared to 2018 due to recent 

changes of the company’s asset management portfolio 

and tenant mix in a few properties such as Republic Plaza. 

As part of CDL’s holistic energy management strategy, we 

regularly review the energy reduction and efficiency plans for 

all our properties and introduce initiatives where areas for 

improvement are identified. For instance, plans are underway 

to incorporate more advanced energy efficient air handling 

units and upgrade instrumentation at selected properties. 

Generating Solar Power  

On-site at CDL’s Premises

At CDL’s mixed-use development 

South Beach, PV panels have been 

installed at the tower roof and louver 

modules, covering a total area of 

approximately 1,800 m2 with an energy 

yield of 219,000 kWh annually.

The Singapore Sustainability Academy 

(SSA) has a solar PV panel footprint  

of 3,200 square feet, extensively 

covering 4,300 square feet of the 

building. The PV panels are estimated 

to generate an annual energy yield 

of over 60,000 kWh, exceeding the 

building’s annual energy consumption, 

thus enabling the academy to be  

self-sufficient. Certified as a BCA Green 

Mark Platinum building, this zero-

energy facility has been recognised  

for its various energy-efficient design 

and features.

In 2019, CDL generated 143,523 kWh 

of solar energy in Tampines Grande, 

City Square Mall, King’s Centre and 

Quayside Isle. The amount of cost 

savings achieved is almost $34,000*.

In view of the recent changes to our asset management 

portfolio, we have reviewed and refined our 2030 and 

interim targets. We commit to reduce energy use intensity5 

by 45% from 2007 levels for office and industrial buildings, 

and 18% from base-year levels for retail buildings by 2030. 

Note:

• 

Electricity consumption attributed to renewable sources from the purchase of RECs has been excluded from purchased electricity to avoid double counting.

Performance in 2020 will be tracked and reported against 

interim targets accordingly.

For our construction sites, energy use intensity in 2019 was 

109 kWh/m2, which marginally exceeds the interim 2019 

target set of 105 kWh/m2. This is because most operational 

sites in 2019 were in the early stages of development, 

which involved energy-intensive equipment such as cranes 

and excavators.

CDL’s Water Sources

CDL draws both potable and NEWater (for non-potable use) from PUB’s utility network supplied through taps, 

and utilises the water in the management of our assets for building operational and maintenance activities. 

Majority of water usage in commercial buildings goes to cooling towers, toilets, pantries, water features, irrigation 

and washing activities. In our property development activities, potable water is used mostly by our builders for 

sanitation purposes.

WATER CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT 

STRATEGY

In water-scare Singapore where CDL’s headquarter is 

located, water supply to the company’s core activities 

is especially vital as our operations are water-intensive 

and highly dependent on an effective and reliable supply 

of water. As a small and efficient nation, the collection, 

production, distribution and reclamation efforts of water in 

Singapore are consolidated by PUB, Singapore’s national 

water agency. PUB’s Four National Taps strategy has created 

a robust and diversified water supply that has continued 

to serve the nation since 2005. Approximately 30% of 

Singapore’s water demand is currently met by water from 

local catchment areas and imported water; while NEWater 

and desalinated water make up the remaining 40% and 

30% respectively6. CDL takes a holistic approach towards 

water management to maintain and enhance the efficiency, 

resilience, desirability and long-term value of our assets  

and developments. Responsible water management 

practices also allow us to deliver value to our homeowners 

and tenants through water and cost savings.

6 

Singapore Water Story, PUB, Singapore’s national water agency. 

Notes:

• 

All potable water withdrawal comes from a single third-party water source supplied by PUB. The breakdown of water sources is based 

on PUB’s Our Water, Our Future report. 

• 

Based on PUB’s Our Water, Our Future report, all potable water and NEWater are categorised as freshwater with Total Dissolved Solids levels 

of ≤1,000 mg/L.

• 

Based on WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool, the entire area of Singapore is identified to be of high physical risk. The physical 

risk tool identifies areas of concern regarding water quantity (e.g. droughts or floods) that may impact short-term or long-term water 

availability. As such, all water withdrawal is from water stress areas.

Impact


To date, 12 of CDL’s buildings have been certified as 

‘Water Efficient Buildings’ by PUB for outstanding 

efforts in water conservation. Recognising that water 

conservation is a shared responsibility, CDL engages our 

customers through initiatives such as the CDL Green 

Lease Partnership Programme and Green Living Guide 

to promote good water conservation practices that 

complement CDL’s water-efficient design and features 

incorporated into our buildings. 

Lifecycle Approach to Water Management  

As part of its robust water management strategy, CDL 

focuses on effective management of water quality and 

usage across every project’s development and management 

lifecycle. For instance, CDL’s recently launched Piermont 

Grand EC, a BCA Green Mark Platinum and Universal Design 

Mark GoldPLUS awarded development, features a smart 

energy and water monitoring system that uses an advanced 

water leak detection algorithm to track and manage power 

and water usage in common areas more efficiently. Such 

features at Piermont Grand enable potential water usage 

savings of approximately 73,881 m3 annually. 

Water Reduction Initiatives

In addition to incorporating water-efficient fixtures and 

fittings (e.g. flow regulators, self-closing taps) holistically 

to maximise water efficiency, CDL annually performs an 

impact analysis on its utility bills to better understand 

the implications of higher water tariffs. Monthly water 

consumption for our key business processes are also closely 

tracked to ensure we are adequately prepared to continue 

managing our water usage effectively. Furthermore, the 

company uses NEWater wherever possible for operations 

that do not require potable water in order to reduce reliance 

on potable water.

In recognition of our significant contribution to Singapore’s 

water security and sustainability efforts, CDL was one of 

the first recipients of the inaugural Watermark Award by 

PUB in 2007. Since the inception of PUB’s Active, Beautiful, 

and Clean (ABC) Waters certification in 2010, CDL has also 

been a pioneer winner for several of our developments. Our 

H2O Residences was the first private development to be 

ABC Waters-certified due to its seamless integration with 

surrounding water bodies and park.

Water Efficiency and Reduction 

Performance  

Recognising that holistic water 

management maintains and enhances 

the efficiency, resilience, desirability 

and long-term value of our assets and 

developments, we have continuously implemented water 

conservation initiatives and tracked our water performance. 

CDL achieved the 2019 CDP A List for water security, an 

affirmation of CDL’s robust water management strategy.

We regularly review the water management plans for 

all our properties and introduce initiatives where areas 

for improvement are identified. For instance, plans are 



underway to upgrade to the latest water efficient toilet 

fixtures and fittings at City Square Mall. 

In 2019, there was an increase in water intensity for our 

managed buildings compared to 2018 due to recent 

changes of the company’s asset management portfolio and 

tenant mix in a few properties, such as Republic Plaza that 

saw an increased provision in toilet facilities. In view of the 

recent changes to our asset management portfolio and 

tenant mix, we have reviewed and refined our 2030 and 

interim targets. We commit to reduce water use intensity 

by 50% from 2007 levels for office and industrial buildings, 

and 9% from base-year levels for retail buildings by 2030. 

Performance against these targets will be tracked closely 

and subsequently reported.

In-sink Grinders and On-site Food Waste Digesters

In partnership with NEA, PUB and Zero Waste Solution (previously EcoWiz), CDL embarked on a three-year pilot 

project in 2018 to test the feasibility of a food waste treatment system. It consists of bladeless in-sink grinders and 

on-site food waste digesters at CDL’s serviced apartments, Le Grove Serviced Residences. 

Operational since Q4 2018, the system has treated more than 6,000 kg of food waste, effectively diverting the  

waste from the landfill. It has also presented useful learning points for involved partners to help pave the way for 

large-scale implementation in residential estates in the future.

WASTE REDUCTION AND MANAGEMENT 

STRATEGY 

As a real estate developer and manager, the bulk of our 

waste is generated by our builders and tenants. All of  

CDL’s generated waste at both the construction sites and 

managed buildings are disposed of in accordance with local 

waste regulations. Recyclable waste from our managed 

buildings and construction sites are collected by engaged 

vendors, who are NEA-licensed, to be treated and  

recycled accordingly.

In land-scarce Singapore, general waste is sent to the  

waste-to-energy incineration plant, where energy is recovered 

through this process. The resulting incinerated ash is then 

transported to our only landfill – Semakau Island for disposal.

Recognising that Semakau landfill is expected to run out 

of space by 2035 and that construction debris cannot be 

incinerated and is thus directly sent to the landfill, we are 

driven to effectively manage our waste generation. Come 

2030, CDL targets to reduce waste intensity for our office 

and industrial buildings by 16% from 2016 levels. CDL also 

targets to reduce waste intensity for our retail buildings by 

12% from 2016 levels.

We continuously invest, innovate, and adopt leading-edge  

technology, such as adopting PPVC, to significantly 

reduce construction waste.

Lifecycle Approach to Waste Management

CDL remains steadfast in managing our waste efficiently and 

seeks to reduce, reuse, and recycle our waste, whenever 

feasible, across every stage of our project lifecycle. Adopting 

the waste management hierarchy approach, we also focus on 

reducing waste before considering reusing and recycling. 

Waste Reduction Performance 

Aligned with our holistic management of environmental 

impacts at our managed buildings, we regularly review  

our waste minimisation and recycling initiatives for all  

our properties.

In 2019, around 3,944 tonnes of general, non-hazardous 

waste was disposed of in CDL-managed buildings. This saw a 

marginal increase in waste intensity at our managed buildings 

in 2019 compared to 2018 due to changes in tenancy mix for 

retail properties. 

In the same year, about 742 tonnes of recyclable waste 

was collected from our managed buildings, 88% of which 

was paper. Since 2017, 100% of our tenants have been 

consistently participating in our paper recycling programme. 

At our retail properties such as City Square Mall, recycling bins 

and facilities are provided extensively to encourage recycling 

of paper, plastic, metal, food and e-waste by shoppers and 

tenants. As such, City Square Mall reported a recycling rate of 

24% in 2019, which is above the currently reported national 

recycling rate for malls of 10.7%7.

In 2019, construction waste disposed of at all CDL 

construction sites amounted to 2,995 tonnes, with a waste 

intensity of 33kg/m2. This meets the 2019 waste targets set  

for Property Development, and is on track to achieve the  

2030 targets.

MANAGING IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT 

AND THE COMMUNITIES

CDL is dedicated to minimising and mitigating the impact of 

our developments on the environment and the surrounding 

communities. We are also committed to complying with all 

applicable EHS legal requirements enforced by local authorities, 

such as the BCA, NEA, PUB, MOM and SCDF. Through 

constant monitoring, evaluation, and auditing of our ISO 14001 

and OHSAS 18001 certified EHS Management System, CDL 

actively ensures that all our activities and operations comply 

with existing regulatory requirements.

Managing Water Discharge at Construction Sites  

The discharge of wastewater into the public sewerage system 

and open drains, canals and rivers are strictly regulated by 

PUB and NEA. CDL works closely with all our contractors to 

track the quality of water discharged to public sewerage and 

drainage systems and to ensure that Total Dissolved Solids and 

Total Suspended Solids (TSS) readings of the discharged water 

do not exceed the legal limit of 1,000 mg/litre and 50 mg/

litre respectively8. At all our construction sites, Earth Control 

Measures are implemented to prevent silt from polluting  

our waterways. 

In the incidence of exceeded TSS readings, prompt corrective 

actions such as lean concreting were taken to rectify the issue. 

CDL will continue to work with contractors to increase vigilance 

in the management of water discharge.

Managing Vector Control at Construction Sites 

To keep incidence of vector-borne diseases low, NEA has 

effective vector management systems, complemented by 

education, enforcement, and continuous research in place to 

achieve this goal. Recognising that construction sites, if not 

well-managed, could become environments for mosquito 

breeding and rodent infestation, CDL works closely with our 

builders to ensure that effective systems are in place to prevent 

pests, curb dengue transmission, and protect workers and 

residents around our work sites against dengue fever.

In addition to ensuring that our builders schedule and 

conduct regular housekeeping on-site, we also require that 

they maintain comprehensive pest surveillance and control 

programmes. We also actively engage our contractors and their 

workers through awareness building and educational talks to 

ensure effective vector control and minimise incurring fines for 

vector breeding.

Managing Impacts on Communities 

As a responsible corporate citizen, we provide avenues for 

the public to raise enquiries or complaints on EHS-related 

matters. Phone hotlines managed by our appointed builders 

are set-up and made publicly available at all construction 

sites. In 2019, we received two complaints across our seven 

ongoing sites regarding dust from construction activities 

affecting nearby residents. The contractor has since put in 

controls in the area surrounding the construction site to 

prevent further incidences of dust nuisance to the community. 

In Singapore, NEA regulates the noise levels from 

construction sites with a set of permissible noise limits that 

vary depending on the time of the day and neighbouring 

premises. To protect nearby residents, we place emphasis 

on our builders to comply with the construction noise limits 

at all our construction sites. To minimise noise-related 

complaints, our builders are encouraged to implement an 

active management programme and to take all necessary 

action to address related complaints. As part of our efforts 

to keep the community informed about construction status, 

schedules of the progress at each site are communicated 

to prepare the community about upcoming works that may 

affect them. 

Incidents of Non-compliance

In 2019, ten environmental fines were imposed on our 

builders across seven construction sites. One was due to 

exceeding surface water discharge limit for TSS, two for

vector breeding, and seven for performing construction 

activities above the noise limit. There were no fines issued 

to our managed properties in 2019. One stop work order 

was received from NEA for mosquito breeding and one stop 

work order was received from MOM for the fatal incident 

currently undergoing investigations.

To prevent future occurrences of non-compliance, we have 

reviewed and streamlined our current processes to improve 

and tighten our EHS practices. Since 2001, the CDL 5-Star 

EHS Assessment System – an independent audit tool used 

to assess, measure, and improve the main builders’ EHS 

management and performance, was put in place to ensure a 

comprehensive, audited, and appraised EHS approach.

RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN AND 

SOURCING STRATEGY  

CDL proactively influences and engages key stakeholders in 

our value chain to embrace safe and environmentally-friendly 

designs as well as operational best practices throughout 

the lifecycle of our developments. We achieve this by 

establishing clear procurement guidelines and specifications 

for our vendors to reduce the overall environment impact 

of our projects, such as using only sustainable and non-toxic 

building materials for our developments. 

Responsible Procurement 

Since 2008, CDL has had the Green Procurement Guideline 

in place with clear specifications for responsible sourcing 

along our supply chain. In line with our Corporate EHS 

Policy, which was introduced in 2003, the guidelines 

encourage the use of eco-friendly and recycled materials 

that have been certified by approved local certification 

bodies, such as SGBC and SEC. 

Our guidelines also indicate our preference for vendors that 

are ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001, ISO 45001, and/or BizSAFE 

Level 3 certified. In key operations like project development 

and property management, major suppliers and builders 

must meet the EHS pre-qualification criteria. All suppliers 

are required to sign a Supplier Code of Conduct, which 

provides comprehensive guiding principles for our vendors 

and suppliers to comply with CDL’s expectations of ethical 

standards, including health, safety and environment.

Notes:

• 

Value of fines stated is based on the fines invoiced as of 31 December 

of the year in which the fines were incurred.

• 

For incidents of non-compliance at construction sites, the warnings/

summons are issued by regulatory bodies directly to main contractors. 

The numbers stated are those reported by main contractors to CDL.

Embodied Carbon Strategy

As part of our SBTi-validated GHG reduction targets, CDL has committed to reduce the embodied carbon of our 

building materials by 24%, instead of their conventional equivalents, by 2030. Further, we anticipate carbon-intensive 

construction materials, such as steel and cement, will become increasingly costly. 

Hence we monitor and report embodied carbon performance of our projects against our adopted targets to enhance 

CDL’s supply chain management and encourage the use of low-carbon alternatives. 

An interim target of a 7% reduction has been set for all new projects awarded from 2018 onwards, in which the 

performance will be monitored closely towards 2021*. The embodied carbon footprint of our developments has 

been undergoing interim reviews, and projects that are due for completion in 2021/2022 have an average expected 

embodied carbon footprint of 0.55 tCO2e/m2, which puts us well underway to achieve our interim target set.

* 

Based on the lifecycle of CDL’s project developments, embodied carbon data for building materials is only available two or three years after a 

project has been awarded.

We have established a target to ensure 100% of appointed 

suppliers are certified by recognised EHS standards, by 2030. 

In 2019, 100% of our builders and consultants for property 

development obtained ISO 14001 and/or OHSAS 18001 

certifications. Prior to the awarding of a development project 

contract, CDL places considerable emphasis on the EHS culture 

and track record of potential suppliers and contractors. In 2019, 

85% of suppliers appointed by asset management department 

were certified by recognised EHS standards.10 Going forward, 

we will review our targets and deepen supplier engagement to 

progressively enhance our supply chain. 

 

Reducing Embodied Carbon Emissions   

Embodied carbon refers to the carbon emissions associated 

with the non-operational phase of a building, and 

includes emissions caused by extraction, manufacturing, 

transportation, assembly, maintenance, replacement, 

deconstruction, disposal and end-of-life aspects of the 

materials and systems that make up a building.

Together, building and construction are responsible for some 

40% of all carbon emissions in the world, with operational 

emissions accounting for 28%. The remaining 11% comes 

from embodied carbon emissions11. As such, calls for a shift 

to a lifecycle thinking have intensified, and embodied carbon 

has become an increasingly important area for all sectors of 

the built environment to address actively.

Globally, it has been recognised that cement and steel are 

two crucial sources of material-related carbon emissions in 

the built environment industry. Cement manufacturing is 

responsible for around 7%12 of global carbon emissions,  

with steel contributing 7-9% of the global total13, of 

which around half can be attributed to buildings and 

construction. As both materials require high temperatures 

during the production stage, manufacturing them 

is energy intensive, hence it is crucial to make these 

materials less carbon intensive. 

10 85% of suppliers newly engaged by the company for AM services in 2019 are certified by recognised EHS standards. 15% of new suppliers are certified to environmental standards such as ISO 14001.

11 Press release by World Green Building Council, 23 September 2019.

12 Technology roadmap: Low-carbon transition in the cement industry, International Energy Agency and Cement Sustainability Initiative, 5 April 2018. 

13 Low-emission steel production: decarbonising heavy industry, Stockholm Environment Institute, 11 April 2018. 

In CDL’s journey in reducing embodied carbon of our 

construction materials, we have used low-carbon, recycled 

alternatives as much as possible at our sites. We are also 

constantly on the lookout for innovative building materials 

and methods to facilitate the transition.

Supply Chain and Supplier Risk Analysis   

Supply chain risk management is essential to prepare 

businesses for events such as natural disasters, extreme 

weather conditions and health pandemics that can 

lead to transport or supply chain disruptions. To better 

understand CDL’s business risks from our supply chain, 

we commenced a Supply Chain Segmentation Study 

on our top 100 suppliers last year. Findings from this 

comprehensive study will enable the company to better 

prioritise supplier engagement efforts and enhance 

supplier management programmes. Based on preliminary 

findings, an estimated 19% of our top 100 suppliers, 

from whom we source our building materials from, fall 

into the ‘Priority’ category due to potentially high social 

risks and high leverage.14 Social risk scores are calculated 

based on factors which include human rights vulnerability 

and forced labour. Targeted to be completed in Q1 2020, 

the analysis will further identify the impacts of inherent 

environmental sourcing risks. 

The study is an expansion of the supply chain scenario 

planning conducted in 2017, which helped strengthen 

the company’s understanding of how emerging trends, 

such as automation and climate change, presented  

risks and opportunities to our supply chain strategy. 

Based on the outcomes of the 2017 study, CDL 

employed a shield-and-sword approach, allowing us 

to implement plans to protect and defend our current 

supply chain against immediate risks, while building our 

organisational agility and capability to optimise near and 

long-term opportunities.

Workplace


Upholding CDL’s business integrity and fair practices is 

closely interwoven with maintaining our stakeholders’ 

high levels of trust and confidence in our ability to 

achieve long-term growth. As an organisation committed 

to a fair, safe, and inclusive workplace in which our 

people can establish and develop enriching careers, CDL 

increases our human capital by building a sustainable and 

equitable future beyond the built environment. 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

CDL joined the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) 

and its partners since 2010 to demonstrate our commitment 

towards excellence in corporate governance. We have further 

improved our ranking on the Singapore Governance and 

Transparency Index (SGTI) from 7th position in 2018 to 5th 

in 2019. The SGTI assesses companies on their corporate 

governance disclosure and practices, as well as the timeliness, 

accessibility and transparency of their financial results 

announcement. For our full Corporate Governance Report, 

please refer to CDL Annual Report 2019.

Diversity on the Board 

Since 28 August 2015, our Board has supported the Board 

Diversity Pledge initiated by Singapore Institute of Directors 

(SID) and SGX-ST. In 2017, the board-level Nominating 

Committee adopted a formal Board Diversity Policy, which 

sets out its clear policy and framework for promoting 

diversity on CDL’s Board. 

The code provides guidance on issues such as:

• Conflicts of interest and the appropriate disclosures  

to be made.

• CDL’s stance against corruption and bribery.

• Compliance with applicable laws and regulations, 

including those relating to the protection of the 

environment and the conservation of energy and natural 

resources.

• Compliance with CDL’s policies and procedures, 

including those on internal controls and accounting.

• Protection and use of CDL’s assets, confidential 

information and intellectual property rights, including the 

respect of the intellectual property rights of third parties. 

• Competition and fair dealing in the conduct of CDL’s 

business, in our relationships with customers, suppliers, 

competitors and employees.

1 

Ms Tan Yee Peng and Ms Jenny Lim are independent non-executive female directors of CDL.

Demonstrating our Board’s commitment to promote gender 

diversity, female board representation in 2019 is at 25%1, 

exceeding the Nominating Committee’s target of having 

a 20% female board representation by 2020, which was 

recommended by the Council for Board Diversity.

BUSINESS ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE 

The Board and Senior Management remain steadfast in 

conducting business with integrity, consistent with the high 

standards of business ethics, and in compliance with all 

applicable laws and regulatory requirements. In 2019, CDL 

had no incident of non-compliance with socio-economic laws 

and regulations, including legal requirements of marketing 

and advertising practices, for which significant fines or 

non-monetary sanctions were issued to the Company. There 

was also zero incident of anti-competitive behaviour or 

monopolistic practices within CDL. 

Our business principles and practices regarding matters  

that may have ethical implications are embedded in an 

internal code of business and ethical conduct. The CDL Code 

of Business Conduct and Ethics provides a clear framework 

for staff to observe CDL’s principles such as honesty, 

integrity, responsibility and accountability at all levels of 

the organisation and in the conduct of CDL’s business in its 

dealings with customers, suppliers and colleagues.  

It is published on our Intranet and easily accessible by  

all employees.

The ARC is responsible for overseeing the procedure, 

which is administered with the assistance of the Head of 

Internal Audit. Arrangements are in place for independent 

investigation and for appropriate follow-up actions to be 

taken. Any improprieties involving the Head of Internal 

Audit (who is also the CDL Ethics Officer) may be reported 

to the Chairman of the ARC. 

As at 31 December 2019, there was zero incident of 

corruption, fraud, and money laundering activity across 

CDL’s business operations in Singapore.  

External Engagement and Due Diligence

With the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of 

Terrorism Policy introduced in July 2016 to our employees in 

frontline sales and compliance job functions, we worked on 

aligning our policies and guidelines with the external marketing 

agents for CDL’s properties. This ensures our business is 

reasonably guarded against the risk of property transactions 

being used to finance terrorism or launder illicit funds.    

As part of our due diligence, all direct suppliers of CDL’s 

core operations in Property Development and Asset 

Management are required to endorse their acceptance of 

and compliance with the ethical standards as outlined in our 

Supplier Code of Conduct.   

Cybersecurity  

With cyber-attacks becoming more prevalent, targeted 

and complex, we are adopting industry best practices and 

moving beyond technology defence towards a more holistic 

and risk-based cybersecurity framework. The objective is 

to establish a robust foundation to identify and protect our 

critical assets and more importantly, be able to detect and 

respond to threats. 

Using proven security solutions, we ensure sensitive data is 

encrypted to safeguard critical information. Data recovery 

strategy and measures, such as backup, are in place to 

minimise downtime and ensure critical information can be 

made quickly available for business continuity.

CDL has developed a Cybersecurity Framework to detect, 

protect against and respond to cyber-attacks and crimes, 

and the CDL Computer Security Policies and Standards was 

updated on cybersecurity compliance. Besides embracing 

the Next Generation Anti-Virus software, Advanced Email 

Security Protection solution, Enterprise Class Firewalls and 

Intrusion Protection System to protect our information 

assets, our Information Technology (IT) department has also 

deployed the User Behaviour Analytical solution to enable 

the identification of abnormal user computing behaviours 

or activities. In addition, IT puts in place a series of online 

cybersecurity training and conducts periodic phishing  

attacks to increase our employees’ vigilance.

Employee Training and Communication

Annually, 100% of our full- and part-time employees are 

required to complete a compulsory online declaration to 

acknowledge that they are aware of, have read, and are 

compliant with CDL’s corporate policies and guidelines. 

Available anytime, awareness bulletins are published on CDL’s 

intranet for a quick refresher on key elements of CDL’s stance 

against corruption. In 2019, CDL’s zero tolerance on corrupt 

business practices and extortion was communicated to 100% 

of employees. Fraud risk awareness training and assessments 

covering topics such as bribery and conflicts of interest were 

also conducted for selected front-line business units.

New hires, as part of their orientation programme, are 

required to learn about CDL’s Code of Business Conduct  

and Ethics, as well as other related corporate policies 

including Anti-Corruption, Fraud, Competition, and  

Whistle-Blowing. They are also required to complete a 

self-paced, interactive e-learning module (accessible to all 

employees as well) that provides information and guidance 

to recognise, address, resolve, avoid, and prevent instances 

of corruption. In 2019, 100% new hires were educated with 

anti-corruption knowledge. 

DEDICATION TO OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, 

SAFETY AND WELL-BEING

In line with our Corporate EHS Policy, KPIs are identified 

with targets established and reviewed annually to monitor 

our EHS performance. This is to ensure that we achieve a 

consistently high EHS standard across the organisation.

Beyond caring for our direct employees, we also recognise 

that workers at our construction sites and commercial 

properties are vital to our day-to-day operations. All workers 

at our construction sites and properties managed2 by CDL 

are subject to CDL’s stringent health and safety management 

policies and procedures. This is audited both internally by 

a trained CDL personnel and externally by an independent 

third-party.

2 

Workers at our managed properties are contracted to provide maintenance, cleaning, and security services.

In 2019, there was no incident of non-compliance  

with health and safety voluntary codes and standards  

such as OHSAS 18001 at CDL’s developments or 

managed properties.

Due to our excellent WSH performance and leadership, 

CDL continues to be recognised as a long-serving 

BizSAFE Mentor. We remain firmly committed in seeking 

continuous improvement in our health and safety 

management systems and practices, and will leverage 

industry best practices to incorporate elements from 

the new ISO 45001 occupational health and safety 

management system standard.

CDL’s Approach to EHS Risk Management 

EHS Working Committee. All CDL employees are 

represented in the EHS Working Committee through their 

department representatives. Staff can also highlight their 

concerns, including WSH issues, directly to the EHS team 

in CDL. Initiatives and activities planned by this committee 

are part of a continual process to ensure and promote 

health, safety, and well-being of all employees. The 

committee convenes at least once annually to review and 

discuss CDL’s approach to health and safety management.

EHS Working Committee members undergo risk 

management training to lead risk assessments for their 

respective operations. They also attend refresher sessions 

on a periodic basis to keep abreast with new developments. 

In response to the transition to the new ISO 45001 

management system standard, EHS Working Committee 

members attended a training session to better understand 

and implement the requirements of the standard. 

Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk Control. 

CDL conducts hazard identification, risk assessment and risk 

control exercises in line with ISO 45001 management system 

requirements and local legislation. 

As part of CDL’s risk management process, the trained EHS 

Steering Committee is tasked to lead these exercises within 

their department for routine and non-routine activities, 

and also conducts cross-departmental reviews occasionally. 

In consultation with the EHS department, the members 

recommend risk mitigation methods that commensurate with 

a hierarchy of controls for identified hazards. 

As employees who conduct site visits and inspections are 

exposed to slip, trip and fall hazards, we strive to improve 

our safety and precautionary measures by adopting industry 

best practices.

Responding to Incidents. Apart from the periodic 

reviews, any organisational changes, occurrence of 

incidents or employee feedback would trigger ad-hoc 

reviews of our risk controls. By applying robust risk 

controls, we are pleased to report that in the year  

under review there was no hazard that posed a risk of 

high-consequence injury3. 

CDL implements an established incident investigation and 

reporting procedure to promptly respond to health and 

safety incidents. When employees raise incident reports, 

an experienced group of personnel will investigate to 

determine the root cause of the incident and identify 

corrective and improvement actions.

As our employees’ safety is of utmost importance, 

employees are actively reminded to not engage in any 

unsafe work and to report any unsafe working conditions 

to either their representative or directly to the EHS 

department so that the issue may be resolved quickly and 

effectively. CDL views these as valuable feedback to drive 

safety enhancements in the workplace, and ensures that 

employees can provide input without fear of reprisal.

Training. In November 2019, CDL’s EHS Team organised 

a series of internal WSH Awareness Workshops to raise 

awareness and appreciation of occupational health and 

safety issues among employees. The workshops were 

attended by 183 employees, covering almost 50% of 

staff from our head office in Singapore. Topics covered 

included health and safety-related trends, legislative 

requirements, reporting of incidents, and safety issues  

on and off-the-job. 

3 

A high-consequence injury is a work-related injury that results in a fatality or in an injury from which the worker cannot, does not, or is not expected to recover fully to pre-injury health status within six months.

This forms part of CDL’s educational efforts to inculcate a 

holistic safety mindset in our employees. Real-life incidents 

are used as discussion material for employees to gain a better 

understanding of existing and predicted risks within their 

work activities. Apart from their annual training, employees 

are also provided with quarterly reminders on relevant health 

and safety topics such as good ergonomic practices and 

safety tips to observe when on vacation. 

Total Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) at 

Corporate Office

CDL places occupational safety and health at the forefront  

of all our business processes. In 2017, we voluntarily 

implemented an integrated EHS Management System 

that covers 100%4 of our key operations in Singapore and 

achieved the ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certifications.

In 2019, there was zero fatality, high-consequence injury, 

and occupational disease involving our employees in our 

corporate office. There was one reportable5 injury which 

occurred within CDL premises with loss of 108 man-days. 

Another employee was involved in an MOM-reportable 

vehicular accident.

Proactively tracking and taking accountability of reportable 

incidents helps to create awareness on the importance of a 

safe and healthy workplace to prevent future occurrences. 

CDL also implements a reporting system for Near-Miss and 

Off-The-Job incidents to promote a more holistic safety 

culture among our employees.

4 

100% of key operations encompass approximately 400 employees in 2019, who are covered under our health and safety management system.

5 

Reportable incident refers to work-related accident, workplace accident, dangerous occurrence and occupational disease that require statutory reporting 

to the MOM, as mandated by the Singapore WSH Act.

6  

As MOM has stopped publishing ASR figures since 2019, CDL no longer reports these numbers. However, we continue to report AFR in accordance with 

GRI standards. AFR refers to the number of workplace accidents per million manhours worked.

7  

There was one MOM-reportable incident that happened to a female employee outside CDL premises. This results in an overall AFR of 2.7 and Minor IR 

of 506 for MOM-reportable incidents that occurred within and outside CDL premises.   

8  

Major and Minor IR refer to the number of major and minor workplace injuries per 100,000 persons employed respectively. The definitions of major and 

minor injuries can be found on MOM’s website.

Creating Healthier Workplaces for Tenants

In 2019, we had increased the number of wellness 

activities which attracted more than 4,000 participants 

across seven CDL-managed buildings. Based on our 

tenants’ positive feedback, CDL will continue to curate 

meaningful programmes with the aim of creating 

healthier and happier workplaces for our tenants.

In 2019, City House, Republic Plaza, 11 Tampines 

Concourse, and 7 &amp; 9 Tampines Grande were each 

conferred HPB’s Healthy Workplace Ecosystem awards 

for championing workplace health and well-being.

Total WSH at Managed Properties

Facilities management and maintenance are vital to 

delivering efficient, reliable and prompt services expected 

by our commercial tenants and retail customers, as well as 

ensuring the operational efficiency of our managed assets 

that contribute to our bottom line. We therefore place 

great emphasis in influencing our contractors to uphold 

a safe and healthy work environment for workers in our 

managed buildings. We engage our contracted workers 

through monthly meetings with their representatives. At 

these monthly meetings, we discuss health and safety 

issues that affect our workers and tenants9 and develop 

solutions to eliminate or reduce the risks. Tenants also 

provide feedback on unsafe conditions that are addressed 

promptly once brought to our attention. 

CDL is proactive in assessing the risks present at our 

managed properties using our risk assessments, led by 

our trained personnel. Our suppliers are also required to 

perform risk assessments to mitigate safety risks, such as 

falling from height that may result in major bodily injury, 

or even fatality. One key training in managing this hazard 

is the ‘Working at Height Course’, which is mandatory for 

both supervisors and workers. 

Total WSH at Construction Sites

In 2019, over 1,900 construction workers worked at our 

developments. We strive to not compromise their health 

and safety in the pursuit of development. For close to two 

decades, as part of the tender shortlisting process, we 

require all our builders to have an accredited health and 

safety management system. We also actively engage our 

business partners on health and safety matters through 

risk reviews, starting from pre-construction all the way to 

completion and handing over stage. CDL uses a customised 

EHS risk register for each project to identify and mitigate 

EHS issues right from the design stage. To eliminate or 

reduce EHS risks downstream during construction, we also 

actively participate in determining the types of materials and 

construction methods adopted. 

During construction phase, high-risk activities, such as 

excavations and working at height can lead to injury or 

fatality. By applying robust risk controls such as soil erosion 

prevention and fall protection plans, these risks can be 

minimised or eliminated.

Our builders also take proactive steps to inculcate safety 

culture among the workers by briefing them on fatigue, 

heat stress, hearing conservation and respiratory protection. 

Where necessary, transportation is provided to take workers 

to their medical appointments with private and public 

medical practitioners. 

For the year in review, there was zero fatality, high 

consequence injury and occupational disease involving 

the workers of our key contractors10 at CDL-managed 

properties. There were three reportable injuries sustained 

by our contractors’ workers which resulted in a loss of 154 

man-days. We also noted one injury sustained by workers 

of our tenants at the common areas within our managed 

properties in 2019. (Note: Due to the high volume of people 

patronising our managed properties, including the public 

who often use our common spaces, it is challenging to 

determine the number of workers apart from our employees 

and term contractors who are covered by our health and 

safety management system.)

9 

Our scope of control for tenants is limited to common spaces only.

10 Key contractors in our managed properties provide cleaning, security services and mechanical and engineering support.

11 Working hours of ad-hoc contractors are not included in the statistics provided for CDL-managed properties.

SAFETY PERFORMANCE AT CONSTRUCTION SITES

Each development site has a dedicated workplace 

environment, safety and health committee, representing 

all workers on-site which include members from the main 

contractor’s construction workers as well as sub-contractors. 

CDL’s Project Manager actively tracks workplace safety, 

health and environment issues at meetings conducted 

on-site every two weeks with our main contractors and 

workers’ representative(s), among others. Through this, 

we maintain close oversight of issues on-site, ranging from 

technical challenges to workers’ welfare. These meetings are 

also a platform for site coordinators to report unsafe work 

conditions and action plans for risk mitigation. Some of our 

sites further incentivise workers to identify and report risks, 

with the aim of raising overall safety awareness. 

For every project development, we institute a monthly  

joint safety inspection that is carried out in the presence  

of the contractor, sub-contractors, consultants, site staff  

and CDL’s site representatives. The inspection highlights 

safety infringements and promotes better working 

conditions. Since 2001, on top of regulatory-mandated 

audits, CDL also monitors the performance of the 

contractor’s EHS management through our CDL 5-Star  

EHS Assessment System.

There was zero occupational disease at CDL’s construction 

sites in 2019. However, there was one fatal incident12 

involving one male worker from our sub-contractor, resulting 

in a fatal injury rate13 of 0.2. While the incident is still 

undergoing investigation by MOM at the time of publication, 

we have since further tightened our EHS Management 

System controls. Major and minor injury rates at our 

construction sites have remained significantly below the 

construction industry average, except for 2016 during which 

there were a total of 10 injuries reported.

12 There was no other high-consequence injury at CDL’s construction sites in 2019 aside from this fatal incident.

13 Fatal injury rate refers to the number of fatal workplace injuries per million manhours worked.

In December 2019, CDL organised the EHS Sports 

Challenge to raise awareness on workplace health 

and safety amongst construction workers. More than 

300 construction workers employed by four builders 

participated in the event. Compromising teams from 

Kajima Overseas Asia, Ssangyong Engineering and 

Construction, Unison Construction and Woh Hup, 

the participants competed in a series of telematches. 

In addition to the sporting activities, the participants 

also underwent basic medical screenings and 

participated in fringe activities and games at booths 

set up by MOM, NEA and SPF, to learn about 

workplace safety, SGSecure and dengue control. 

Workers enthusiastically cheering on for their teammates

HUMAN CAPITAL AND DEVELOPMENT

Through a three-pronged approach of developing, engaging 

and caring for employees, CDL is committed to drive 

productivity, employee satisfaction and talent retention for 

organisational excellence. Due to our proactive HR policies 

and practices dedicated to the creation of a nurturing 

and positive workplace, we were named one of the “Best 

Companies to Work For in Asia” in the HR Asia Awards 2019.

Since 2018, CDL has been the only real estate company in 

Singapore to be included in the sector-neutral Bloomberg 

Gender-Equality Index (GEI), and is one of five Singapore 

companies listed on the 2020 index.

CDL’s recruitment process adheres to the strict guidelines 

on non-discrimination and fairness, regardless of gender, 

ethnicity, religion, or age. Beyond providing jobs and 

caring for our direct employees through comprehensive 

benefits schemes, we also invest significantly in training and 

upgrading employees to equip them with relevant skills for 

the future.

Unless specified, the scope for this section on human capital 

and development covers CDL Corporate Office only. 

Job Creation and Employment 

CDL adheres to the Tripartite Guidelines on Managing 

Excess Manpower issued by MOM and its tripartite partners, 

Singapore National Employers Federation and the National 

Trades Union Congress. We support and share the similar 

philosophy as the Tripartite Guidelines, which strongly 

encourage companies to manage excess manpower and 

CDL 5-Star EHS Awards

The CDL 5-Star EHS Awards was launched in 2005 to 

recognise builders who have excelled in the CDL 5-Star EHS 

Assessment System over a one-year period. The Assessment 

System and Awards have been instrumental in influencing 

CDL’s builders and consultants to monitor and improve their 

EHS performance. 

The Awards comprise the CDL EHS Excellence Award and CDL 

Productivity Excellence Award, which were introduced in 2011 

in support of Singapore’s national productivity drive. In 2012, 

the CDL Workers’ Welfare Award was introduced as part of our 

continuous efforts to align business practices with ISO 26000. 

To recognise exemplary workers who are role models of the 

safety message and inspire fellow colleagues to be more 

vigilant, the Safe Worker Award was launched in 2014. In the 

same year, we launched the CDL EHS Cup soccer league to 

promote a healthy lifestyle and foster camaraderie amongst 

our builders’ workers. In 2019, CDL organised the EHS Sports 

consider reorganisation as a last resort. The Guidelines also 

suggest providing company retraining programmes for 

workers, redeployment of workers to alternative areas of 

work, implementing shorter work weeks, temporary layoffs, 

flexible work arrangements, and managing wage costs 

through a flexible wage system. 

In the past five years, there has been no major reorganisation 

that resulted in the loss of jobs.

In the event of termination or employee resignation, a minimum 

notice period of one to three months needs to be fulfilled, 

depending on the employee’s job grade. Due to operational 

requirements, middle and Senior Management are required to 

provide a notice period of two and three months respectively.

Our Employees.  As at 31 December 2019, CDL hired a total 

of 403 employees for our core operations headquartered in 

Singapore, where the majority of our business in property 

development and asset management is based. Close to 5.2% 

of our employees are hired on a temporary basis with tenure of 

more than one year.

CDL Diversity and Inclusion Task Force. Recognising 

that creating and expanding opportunities for women are 

fundamental to CDL’s sustainable growth and beneficial to 

society at large, the CDL Diversity and Inclusion Task Force was 

established in 2017 to promote diversity and inclusion within 

our workplace and the wider community. Under the leadership 

of our Group CEO, the Task Force is co-chaired by the 

Sustainability and HR departments.

Public Commitment to Women Empowerment. In 2017, 

our Group CEO joined over 1,600 global leaders in pledging 

CDL’s support for the Women’s Empowerment Principles.

Developed through a partnership between the UN Women 

and the UNGC, the principles offer practical guidance 

to the private sector on how to empower women in the 

workplace, marketplace and community. 

Our Group CEO is also a member of the Council for Board 

Diversity. Established by the Ministry of Social and Family 

Services, it advocates for an increase in number of women 

on boards of listed companies, statutory boards and non-

profit organisations. 

Global Recognition for Gender Equality. CDL’s efforts 

in advancing gender diversity at the workplace has led 

to its inclusion in the sector-neutral Bloomberg Gender 

Equality Index (GEI) for the third year running since 2018. 

CDL is the only real estate management and development 

company in Singapore and one out of five Singapore 

companies to be listed on GEI 2020.  

The reference index measures gender equality across five 

pillars: female leadership and talent pipeline, equal pay 

and gender pay parity, inclusive culture, sexual harassment 

policies, and pro-women branding, to allow investors 

to make better-informed decisions and help companies 

better understand their own progress towards gender 

equality. 

Racial and Disability Inclusion

CDL embraces an inclusive workplace in our multi-

racial workforce from diverse educational backgrounds. 

Our workforce is nonetheless heavier on the number 

of Chinese employees as a reflection of Singapore’s 

predominantly Chinese population. Where possible, 

we also provide fair employment opportunities for the 

less physically-abled. As at 31 December 2019, CDL has 

one wheelchair bound employee who has been with the 

company for 11 years. 

Anti-bullying and Anti-harassment 

To strengthen our commitment to maintain a work 

environment that is safe from harassment for our employees, 

the CDL Workplace Anti-Harassment and Anti-Bullying Policy 

was implemented in 2019. It communicates CDL’s stance 

for all employees to be treated with respect and dignity. No 

employee shall be subject to any physical, psychological, 

verbal or sexual abuse. Our employees should be culturally 

sensitive, tolerant and respectful towards each other, taking 

into consideration the workplace environment and multi-

culturalism. This policy also extends to dealing with incidents 

involving external customers and stakeholders who conduct 

themselves in a manner that constitutes harassment of the 

employees, within and beyond company premises. In 2019, 

CDL had no incident of discrimination.

Fair and Competitive Remuneration

Fair and competitive remuneration attracts and retains 

talents to build strong human and organisational 

capital that enable CDL’s business growth. Aligned with 

internal parity and market benchmarks, our equitable 

remuneration packages are based on employees’ 

performance and their scope of work. We use a well-

structured and open annual performance appraisal 

system, which is reviewed periodically and enhanced to 

encourage two-way feedback between employees and 

their reporting officers.

Performance-based Appraisal. As a company committed 

to meritocracy, CDL’s compensation and rewards policies 

are performance-based. Employees are assessed not only 

on what they achieved during the year of review, but also 

on how the outcomes were achieved. 

Competitive Remuneration. Remuneration is 

recommended by the HR Department and approved 

by the Group Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief 

Strategy Officer and the Remuneration Committee, which 

consists of members from the CDL Board of Directors. 

Salary benchmarking is conducted to ensure the relevance 

of CDL’s salaries with the industry and overall market. On 

a biennial basis, an external consultancy firm is engaged 

to conduct an Employee Engagement Survey to gather 

employees’ opinions and feedback, including their 

perception of CDL’s remuneration and reward system.

ESG-linked Remuneration. CDL recognises that inclusion 

of appropriate ESG issues within executive management 

goals and incentive schemes is an important factor in 

promoting greater recognition of and accountability in 

our sustainability practices. Since 2015, CDL established 

stronger linkages between employee and executive 

remuneration and our ESG performance. Performance 

indicators that are aligned with global standards such  

as ISO 26000, ISO 14001, GRI Standards and the  

SDGs, to name a few, have been incorporated in the 

individual goals settings of all employees, including  

CDL’s senior management.

Respect for Collective Bargaining Rights. CDL respects 

all employees’ fundamental rights to freedom of 

association and the right to be members of trade unions. 

Although CDL is not a unionised company, we are guided 

by the Industrial Relations Act which allows trade unions 

to represent our employees for collective bargaining, 

providing our employees with an avenue to seek redress 

for disputes.

Our key subsidiaries CBM Pte Ltd and The Tower Club 

are both unionised, providing their workforce with a 

channel for collective bargaining.

Benefits and Welfare

We care for our employees through comprehensive 

welfare and benefits schemes, including but not limited 

to insurance coverage, medical, and dental benefits for 

our full-time employees. Part-time employees also enjoy 

similar benefits on either a full or pro-rated basis, thereby 

promoting a conducive environment should employees 

decide to take on part-time arrangements to cope with 

their personal needs.

Pro-family Benefits. CDL provides benefits and adopts 

welfare practices in line with the Singapore Government’s 

pro-family legislation. Mothers and fathers whose children 

are Singapore Citizens at birth enjoy paid maternity 

leave of 16 weeks and paid paternity leave of two weeks 

respectively, as advocated by the Singapore Government. 

CDL also provides eligible employees with childcare leave 

and extended childcare leave. Male employees are entitled 

to shared parental leave whereby they can choose to share 

one week of the 16 weeks of maternity leave, subject to 

the agreement of the mother, if the mother qualifies for 

Government-Paid Maternity Leave. 

In 2019, five eligible female CDL employees utilised 

their maternity benefits and returned to work after their 

maternity leave. Five eligible male employees utilised their 

paternity leave benefits. 

71 CDL employees (27 male, 44 female) with at least 

one Singapore Citizen child under the age of seven were 

entitled to six days of paid childcare leave in 2019. In 

addition, 39 employees (12 male, 27 female) with at least 

one Singapore Citizen child between the ages 7 and 12 

were entitled to two days of paid extended childcare leave  

in 2019. 

Employee Health and Well-being 

Programmes 

To promote healthy living, active lifestyle and well-

being amongst CDL’s employees, our HR department 

and employee-led Workplace Health &amp; Wellness 

Committee organise an array of health and fitness 

programmes including:

• Free annual basic health screenings for all 

employees during work hours

• Weekly fruit distribution to promote healthier 

consumption habits

• Regular lunch-talks on fitness, physical exercise, 

mental well-being, and nutrition 

• Fitness classes including futsal, jogging, stair-

climbing, Zumba, and yoga

On emotional well-being for employees, CDL’s 

Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) provides 

support for issues concerning work, family matters, 

and interpersonal relationships. Employees can be 

assured of confidentiality when they call the EAP 

hotline manned by a third-party psychologist.

CDL also supports our employees in receiving 

sustainability-related training through EHS training 

and awareness programmes that cultivate a “Safe and 

Green” corporate culture. They are encouraged to 

attend relevant external conferences and workshops 

to strengthen their sustainability knowledge and EHS 

management skills. Over 57% of employees received 

sustainability-related training in 2019.

Pension Scheme and Contributions. In Singapore, 

the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is a comprehensive 

social security savings plan introduced by the 

Singapore Government to enforce savings by salaried 

workers, including Permanent Residents, for a more 

secure retirement. CPF funds can be used in several 

schemes including retirement, healthcare, housing, and 

investment. Details of the various CPF schemes can be 

found here.

Under the CPF scheme, CDL and our staff make monthly 

contributions to the staff’s CPF account in accordance 

with Singapore’s statutory requirement. CDL also 

adheres to the respective social security contribution or 

pension plan obligations of the countries we operate in.

Training and Development 

Our Competency Framework was reviewed in 2017  

to raise our employees’ learning and development 

capacity, yielding a capable and more agile workforce. 

We also carry out annual training needs analyses to 

ensure there are adequate training interventions to  

level-up competencies and professional knowledge.

It is mandatory for all new employees to attend the CDL  

On-boarding Program, which aims to induct and 

integrate new hires into the organisational culture. 

Training Hours and Investments. In 2019, CDL  

invested over $170,000 into training and development 

and its Corporate Office staff clocked over 16,000 

training hours. 100% of CDL Corporate Office’s 

workforce was provided the opportunity to attend 

training. An average of four training days was achieved 

across the workforce. 

Flexible Work Arrangements. To provide stronger support 

for employees who need to manage work responsibilities 

alongside personal commitments, we have four flexible work 

arrangements that an employee can choose from, subject to 

mutual agreement with the department head:

• Flexi Time

 

Flexible Start and End Times – Employees can opt to 

start work earlier or later than the official working hours.  

 

Flexible Lunch Hours – Employees can go for one-hour 

lunch break flexibly between 12.00pm and 2.00pm.

• Flexi Place

 

Telecommuting – Employees can work at alternate 

work locations, for up to two days a month, on a fixed 

schedule once every two weeks.  Since the introduction 

of this initiative, 49 employees have taken up this  

flexible work arrangement.

• Flexi Load

 

Part-Time Work – Full-time employees can convert to 

working part-time and enjoy similar benefits as full-time 

employees on a full or pro-rated basis. In 2019,  

4 employees worked on a part-time arrangement.

Flexible Benefits Scheme. CDL provides the Flexible 

Benefits Scheme for all regular and contract employees, 

affording them the flexibility to explore a range of health 

and wellness options covered under the company’s health 

insurance plan and select the ones that best suit their  

health needs and stage of life. 

In 2019, CDL was one of the early supporters of CXA Group’s 

collaboration with the National Volunteer and Philanthropy 

Centre, to donate unutilised employee flex dollars to charities.

In November 2019, CDL organised the 6th Hong Leong  

and CDL Group Annual Sustainability Forum for the Group’s 

Board of Directors, as well as CDL’s Senior Management 

and Sustainability Committee members. Titled “Climate 

Change &amp; SDGs: Challenges and Opportunities for 

Businesses”, the audience gained insights on climate 

change scenario planning, sustainability reporting, 

assurance, and green financing from sustainability experts 

of leading consultancy firms. Two representatives from the 

Group’s companies also presented their early experience in 

sustainability reporting. 

Leadership Development and Succession Planning. 

Through the structured CDL Leadership Programme, we 

develop high-potential employees by sharpening their 

leadership and management skills to enable them to 

become more effective leaders.

Today’s employees have high expectations of personal 

development and career growth. To meet these demands, 

there is a need to put in place a well-designed job rotation 

programme to enhance employees’ competencies, as well as 

to increase job satisfaction through job variation. Structured 

talent deployment within CDL is part of HR planning, and it 

plays a major role in the following areas:

• Career Development

 

By providing employees with either exposure to the 

various business operations, or by expanding their skills 

and knowledge, employees will be able to build both 

breadth and depth of experience and learning, hence 

maximising their potential and enabling them to be 

more well-rounded in their careers in CDL.

• Succession Planning

 

Job rotation serves as an effective tool in developing 

the identified successors for various critical leadership 

positions. It provides them with a holistic view of  

CDL’s business, thereby ensuring that they are more 

prepared for impending leadership roles.

• Talent Retention

 

Job rotation motivates employees as it broadens  

their skills set, adds diversity to their job roles, and 

rejuvenates their interest to keep learning through 

tackling different challenges.

Management Trainee Programme. As it is vital to develop  

a talent pipeline, the Management Trainee Programme  

was introduced in October 2016 to nurture young talents 

and ensure sustainability of leadership and management 

capacity in CDL. 

The 18-month programme provides opportunities for  

young graduates to learn about the Group’s various 

departments and respective operations through a series 

of attachments to each department. This helps them to 

establish and build relationships between departments. 

The programme structure also allows Management Trainees 

to participate in additional special projects or overseas 

assignments to enhance their career development. Upon 

completion of the programme, individuals will be posted to 

one of the departments. 

Education Sponsorships and Scholarships. CDL sponsors 

part-time courses relevant to the employee’s work, 

conducted locally by recognised institutions and universities. 

In 2019, we sponsored one employee for her Master’s 

degree and one employee for her Diploma.

Internships. CDL partners local tertiary education 

institutions to offer internship opportunities for students 

interested in the property industry. In 2019, there were 24 

interns assigned to various departments in CDL.

Political Contributions. Under our Anti-Corruption Policy, 

CDL takes a corporate stance against using the Company’s 

resources to make donations to political parties and  

political associations, or to candidates and/or election 

agents in a parliamentary or presidential election. 

Additionally, employees who intend to be involved in 

any political party are required to declare and seek top 

management’s approval. 

In 2019, as with previous years, CDL made zero direct and  

indirect political contributions using the Company’s resources.

Shaping an Innovation Culture. CDL’s Enterprise 

Innovation Committee (EIC) plays an active role in shaping 

the organisational culture by building problem-solving 

capabilities, promoting can-do mindsets and raising 

Proptech awareness amongst staff. For details, please  

refer here.

With the rise of the climate economy came the realisation 

that sustainable practices are no longer separate from 

a business’ social and financial performances. For over 

two decades, CDL’s sustainability integration saw the 

ripple effects of “doing well by doing good” reverberate 

throughout the company, creating positive impacts through 

decreased operating costs and increased productivity. This 

commitment has not only placed us in a prime position 

to utilise the growing global ESG investment and green 

finance streams, but has also created shared value for our 

business, employees, stakeholders, and community-at-large.

MARKET REVIEW AND PERFORMANCE 

Amidst the challenging macroeconomic environment, the 

CDL Group delivered a resilient set of results. For FY 2019, 

we posted revenue of $3.4 billion (FY 2018: $4.2 billion). 

The decrease was due to the timing of revenue recognition 

for the property development segment as the revenue for 

certain overseas projects and Singapore EC projects cannot be 

recognised progressively, but only upon completion in entirety.  

Despite lower revenue in FY 2019, earnings before interest, 

taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) remained 

strong at $1.13 billion (FY 2018: $1.19 billion). Net attributable 

profit after tax and non-controlling interest (PATMI) increased 

1.3% to $564.6 million (FY 2018: $557.3 million), supported 

by a portfolio with diversified income streams and boosted by 

substantial gains from the unwinding of the Group’s second 

Profit Participation Securities (PPS 2) structure. 

For FY 2019, the Group and our joint venture associates  

sold 1,554 units including ECs with a total sales value of  

$3.3 billion (FY 2018: 1,113 units with a total sales value of  

$2.2 billion). The Group launched a record number of six 

projects, emerging as one of the top-selling private sector 

developers in Singapore. 

The Group’s office portfolio remains resilient with a 

committed occupancy of 89.8% as at 31 December 2019,  

on par with the islandwide occupancy rate of 89.5%. 

In 2019, the Group successfully privatised our London- 

based hotel arm M&amp;C, in line with our focus to enhance 

recurring income. For the hotel operations segment, a  

loss of $6.6 million was reported for FY 2019 due to several 

factors, including impairment losses of $58.2 million  

(FY 2018: $94.1 million) made on hotels in US, Europe 

and Asia; transaction costs for the privatisation of M&amp;C; 

disruptions to operations following the closure of Millennium 

Hotel London Mayfair and Dhevanafushi Maldives Luxury 

Resort in 2018 for repositioning; and refurbishment works at 

Orchard Hotel Singapore.

As at 31 December 2019, the Group has strong cash reserves 

of $3.1 billion and Net Asset Value (NAV) per share of $11.60. 

Had fair value gains on our investment properties been 

factored in, the Revalued Net Asset Value (RNAV) per share 

would be $16.46. Post-M&amp;C privatisation, the net gearing 

ratio (including fair value gains on investment properties) is 

43% while interest cover remains healthy at 14.0 times.

SUSTAINABLE FINANCE

Companies showing ESG leadership are increasingly being 

awarded by investors and lenders. CDL’s strong ESG track 

record has enabled us to unlock alternative financing streams 

that can help lower the long-term borrowing cost and expand 

our pool of ESG-centric investors and lenders.

Building on CDL’s inaugural $100 million green bond issuance 

in 2017, CDL ventured into green and sustainability-linked 

loans in 2019 and received two green loans totaling $500 

million from DBS Bank and HSBC to finance new property 

developments. In September 2019, CDL also secured a 

$250 million SDG Innovation Loan, an innovation-focused 

sustainability-linked loan from DBS Bank. A first-of-its-kind 

financing concept pioneered by CDL, the loan aims to 

accelerate innovative solutions that are aligned with one or 

more SDGs. CDL will be eligible for a discount on the loan’s 

interest rate when sustainability-related performance targets 

on our implemented innovations are achieved.

Our Sustainable Finance Framework abides to leading 

frameworks such as the Green Bond Principles, Green 

Loan Principles and Sustainability-linked Loan Principles. 

In recognition of our leadership in sustainable financing, 

CDL was invited to multiple local and international thought 

leadership events on sustainable financing, such as the 

International Capital Market Association 2019 Green 

and Social Bond Principles Annual General Meeting and 

Conference in Frankfurt and Singapore Fintech Festival 2019. 

Moving forward, CDL will continue to tap on sustainable 

financing to realise our vision of building sustainable and 

climate-resilient cities and communities. 

COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS

Multiplying Positive Impact through 

Collaborations 

Besides contributing to the development of Singapore’s built 

environment, CDL also actively gives back to society and 

strives to build a cohesive, caring and vibrant community. As 

an industry leader and strong sustainability advocate, CDL 

is committed to making a difference in society by providing 

continuous support and amplifying positive impact through 

our outreach programmes in these key areas: 

• Promoting Environmental Awareness and Zero Waste

• Advocating Best Practices in Sustainability 

• Empowering Youths and Women as Sustainability 

Champions 

• Supporting Singapore’s Arts Scene 

• Caring for the Less Fortunate 

 

In line with good governance, CDL exercises due diligence 

in evaluating every request for donation, sponsorship 

or partnership. We assess the track record, quality of 

management, and organisational governance of charities 

and community partners via various channels, which includes 

their annual reports, websites and social media platforms. 

For accountability, all charities and community partners are 

required to report on the social and environmental impact of 

their programmes, as well as the use of funds and resources.

Two Decades of Active Employee Volunteerism 

CDL has been engaging stakeholders through active 

employee volunteerism to complement our community 

investment and deliver more meaningful impact. Volunteering 

is an opportunity for our employees to develop their 

leadership and soft skills. It also promotes a caring work 

environment by cultivating employees’ sense of identity and 

belonging to CDL.

Since 1999, CDL’s dedicated employee-led volunteering 

body, City Sunshine Club (CSC), has been actively reaching 

out to the less fortunate and underprivileged in society, 

providing an avenue for CDL employees to serve the 

community. CSC organises monthly food distribution drives 

where our employees distribute household necessities to low 

income elderly living in rental flats. During festive seasons, 

CSC organises outings and gatherings for our adopted 

beneficiaries, such as Arc Children’s Centre. In 2019, our 

employees contributed time and effort to support various 

community projects, achieving a participation rate of 88.1% 

and clocking close to 2,280 volunteer manhours.

PROMOTING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS AND ZERO WASTE 

7th Asia Environment Lecture 

featuring Dr Jane Goodall and 

Fundraising Dinner for Jane Goodall 

Institute (Singapore), November 2019

CDL supported the Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore) (JGIS) in fundraising through two events featuring Dr Jane Goodall in Singapore. The JGIS Fundraising Gala 

Dinner, held on 26 November 2019 at Grand Copthorne Waterfront, was attended by some 300 guests, comprising many C-suites of leading businesses and senior 

officials of public and international agencies. In partnership with NUS, CDL supported the 7th Asia Environment Lecture on 28 November 2019, where Dr Goodall shared 

her six-decade conservation journey to a 1,700-strong crowd at the NUS University Cultural Centre. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Mr Heng Swee Keat 

graced the lecture. 

EcoBank &amp; Fashion3R – An annual 

CDL and Eco-Business initiative, at 

City Square Mall, 1 to 3 March 2019

Launched in 2016, this annual initiative brings the 3P sectors together to break the typical ‘take, use and dispose’ cycle and promote a mindset of responsible 

consumption. Through EcoBank 2019, about 18.5 tonnes of pre-loved toys, clothes, books and household items were collected for a fundraising bazaar while unsold 

items were contributed to The Salvation Army and Embodhi Foundation to benefit donation recipients in Sri Lanka, India and Vietnam.

To raise awareness about pollution caused by the fashion industry, CDL partnered with The Fashion Pulpit to organise an eco-fashion runway as part of the EcoBank 

Bazaar opening on 2 March 2019. The event featured Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Dr Amy Khor as well as six lady eco-champions 

who wore upcycled outfits designed by The Fashion Pulpit and made from Ecobank donated clothing.

From 2016 to 2019, about 55 tonnes of pre-loved toys, clothes, books and household items were collected, reducing about 25,000 tonnes of carbon emissions by 

diverting these items from the incinerator or landfill. More than 1,300 volunteers have supported this meaningful cause.

‘Feed the City’ at City Square Mall,  

13 April 2019

CDL supported Food Bank Singapore’s inaugural “Feed the City” initiative which targeted to feed 1,000 food-insecure people in Singapore. It also launched “TangoTab”, 

a mobile app that donates to Food Bank Singapore to feed a hungry person every time a diner checks in to a partner establishment on the app. City Square Mall tenants 

Central Thai and LiHO were amongst the first F&amp;B outlets to sign on with TangoTab. 

Launch of Saving Glaciers Alliance at 

Singapore Sustainability Academy,  

10 October 2019 

The Saving Glaciers Alliance was initiated by CDL to highlight the importance of conserving the world’s polar regions and glaciers and called upon local business 

communities and the public to support climate action. At its launch, CDL hosted an exclusive conversation with Sir Robert Swan, renowned explorer and conservationist 

who is the first person to have walked to the North and South Poles. 

SDG City Challenge at South Beach 

and City Square Mall, 27 July 2019

About the Report

This is CDL’s 13th Sustainability Report. It replaces the CDL Integrated Sustainability Report 

2019 as our latest annual publication dedicated to providing information on financial, 

governance, social and environmental performance that are material to CDL’s business and 

stakeholders. 

This Report contains a full year’s data from 1 January to 31 December 2019 and focuses 

primarily on operations owned and managed by CDL’s Singapore headquarters, excluding 

that of our subsidiaries. The scope covers our principal business as a real estate management 

and development company, comprising operational functions such as asset management of 

commercial and industrial developments, our corporate headquarters in Singapore as well as 

project development.

Following the inclusion of carbon emissions data from our key subsidiaries since 2015, we 

have further expanded the reporting scope to include their energy and water usage data. 

These six subsidiaries are:

• CBM Pte Ltd 

• CDL Hospitality Trusts

• City Serviced Offices

• Le Grove Serviced Residences

• The Tower Club Singapore

• Hotels owned and managed by Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&amp;C)

Monetary values in this Report are presented in Singapore dollars, which is CDL’s 

functional currency. Where possible, we have provided up to five years of historical data 

for comparison. CDL voluntarily discloses the information as we believe in upholding the 

principles of corporate transparency, disclosure, and communication with our stakeholders. 

Any variance in data from the CDL Annual Report 2019 is due to updates following the 

external assurance of this Report. For additional information on our comprehensive initiatives 

on sustainability, please refer to our sustainability microsite: www.cdlsustainability.com.

Privatisation of M&amp;C

The Group’s London-based hotel arm, M&amp;C, is one of the world’s largest hotel chains,

with 156 hotels and 45,000 rooms worldwide, many in key gateway cities. It was delisted 

in October 2019 from the London Stock Exchange. Following the successful privatisation 

exercise by CDL, the management is looking into enhancing the alignment between M&amp;C’s 

ESG practices and CDL’s longstanding sustainability strategy. It aims to achieve greater 

synergy within the CDL Group, raising operational efficiency and capability to be future-ready 

for emerging challenges.

Report Content

In each reporting cycle, CDL’s Sustainability Committee 

reviews the content of the Report to determine its relevance 

to our business. Efforts are also made to ensure that current 

and emerging material issues pertaining to sustainability and 

the interests of our stakeholders are addressed.

Other operational committees oversee existing management 

systems and certifications such as the ISO 14001 

Environmental Management System, ISO 50001 Energy 

Management System, OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health 

and Safety Assessment System and Singapore Quality 

Class. Relevant targets and key performance indicators are 

established, tracked, and disclosed within this Report. In line 

with our steadfast commitment to align CDL’s environmental 

practices with international best practices, CDL became 

the first Singapore developer in 2016 to validate our GHG 

emissions data against the stringent ISO 14064 for GHG 

verification. In addition, CDL has released the carbon 

intensity disclosure report for its flagship building Republic 

Plaza, in which the carbon metric calculations have been 

externally assured to have been performed in accordance 

with ISO 16745-1 requirements. 

Our Report continues to integrate ISO 26000:2010 

Guidance on social responsibility, and the Company actively 

promotes compliance with internationally adopted standards 

and regulations in the fields of occupational standards, 

environmental protection, and the fight against corruption.

Reporting Boundaries and Standards

This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI 

Standards: Comprehensive option. Its Reporting Principles 

for defining reporting content are:

• Stakeholder Inclusiveness: Beyond identifying our 

stakeholders and responding to their expectations and 

interests, we engage our builders and suppliers in the 

rigorous reporting process in line with the GRI Standards. 

This helps to raise accountability of stakeholders along 

our supply chain;

• Sustainability Context: Presenting performance in the 

wider context of sustainability;

• Materiality: Focusing on issues that impact business 

growth and of utmost importance to our stakeholders; and

• Completeness: Including full coverage of material 

topics and boundaries that are of significant economic, 

environmental, and social impact to enable stakeholders 

to assess CDL’s performance in the reporting period.

For the Materiality Disclosures Service, GRI Services 

reviewed that the GRI content index is clearly presented 

and the references for Disclosures 102-40 to 102-49 align 

with appropriate sections in the body of the report. The GRI 

Content Index can be found on pages 115 to 123.

This Report adopts the International Integrated Reporting 

Council’s (IIRC) Integrated Reporting Framework by 

connecting ESG performance with business and financial 

impact for a more meaningful and all-rounded corporate 

reporting. Centered around six capitals – Financial, 

Organisational, Natural, Manufactured, Human, and 

Social and Relationship – this approach aims to present a 

holistic picture to our investors and stakeholders on how 

the interrelation between our business and sustainability 

performance leads to value creation in the long-term. In 

addition, the climate-related disclosures in this Report follow 

the recommendations of the TCFD launched in June 2017. 

Since 2005, CDL has been a signatory to the UNGC and  

has upgraded to ‘participant’ level in 2019. CDL is 

committed to the UNGC’s Ten Principles, which has been 

expanded to embrace the SDGs since 2016. This Report  

also serves as our Communication on Progress (COP) 

conducted by the UNGC annually, details are available  

at www.unglobalcompact.org.

This Report is also aligned with relevant performance 

indicators of key sustainability benchmarks such as CDP, 

DJSI, FTSE4Good, Global 100, GRESB, MSCI, as well as  

the SASB real estate sector-specific standards. To request 

more details of our disclosure, please contact us via the 

feedback channel.

Our carbon footprint is calculated in accordance with the 

World Business Council for Sustainable Development and 

World Resources Institute’s (WBCSD/WRI) GHG Protocol, a 

corporate accounting and reporting standard. This protocol 

is considered the current best practice for corporate or 

organisational emissions reporting.

In addition to the GHG Protocol, our carbon emissions are 

also calculated based on The CarbonNeutral® Protocol, 

a set of guidelines to meet the global standard for 

managing our offset-inclusive programmes. The Protocol 

includes requirements for GHG assessments, emissions 

reduction planning, carbon credit eligibility, management 

of carbon credits through registration and retirement, and 

communication of CarbonNeutral® programmes.

We use an operational consolidation approach to determine 

organisational boundaries. For example, our carbon and 

energy data include only the distribution impacts. Data is 

consolidated from a number of sources, including our project 

sites and fuel use information, and is analysed centrally. Our 

baseline year is 2007 and our emissions are independent of 

any GHG trades. 

External Assurance

This Report continues to be externally assured to validate 

the accuracy and reliability of its content. Ernst &amp; Young  

LLP (EY) was engaged to provide independent limited 

assurance of this Report against the GRI Standards for 

sustainability reporting and the Construction &amp; Real Estate 

Sector Supplement. The assurance covered figures and 

statements found in this Report that are related to the 

subject matters approved by CDL’s Chief Sustainability 

Officer and agreed as per the Assurance Statement.  

EY reviewed the underlying systems and processes that 

support the subject matters in this Report. The assurance 

is in accordance with ISAE 3000 Assurance Engagements 

Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 

Information. The assurance, including the scope of work and 

conclusions, can be found in the Assurance Statement on 

pages 105 to 114.

In line with our steadfast commitment to align CDL’s 

environmental practices with international best practices, 

CDL’s 2018 GHG emissions data continue to be verified 

against ISO 14064 by Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd. 

(LRQA) in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14064-1. 

LRQA’s Assurance Statement on the GHG report prepared 

by CDL, can be found on pages 102 to 104.

CBM and CSO are tenants within a building and hence do not have separate meters to track respective water usage within their facilities.

6 

Le Grove Serviced Residences was closed for renovation from December 2016 to July 2018.

7 

Figures have been restated from 2016 to 2018 due to an enhancement in reporting method which now includes waste generated from Republic Plaza 2.

8 

Scope 2 GHG emissions reflected from 2018 onwards are reported using a market-based method to account for the procured energy attribute certificates. Carbon emissions arising from the construction activity carried out by builders 

are under Scope 3 carbon emissions to align with sector classification of GRI Business Activity Group Descriptions as recommended by the SBTi.

2018 data has been restated based on the fine notification received in 2019.

10 While the incident is still undergoing investigation at the time of publication by the regulatory authority, Ministry of Manpower (MOM), we have since further tightened our EHS Management System controls.

11 AFR figure refers to MOM-reportable incident that occurred within CDL premises.

12 To provide more data granularity in 2019, we reported Major and Minor Injury Rates instead of previously reported Workplace Injury Rate.

data and records; 

• 

reviewed the GHG report for conformance with ISO 14046-1:2006;

• 

interviewed key personnel responsible for the management of 

GHG data and information and for the preparation of the GHG 

report at the above facilities; 

• 

verified, on a sampling basis, the historical GHG emissions data 

and records included in the GHG report back to source for the 

calendar year 2019; 

• 

verified the emission factors used that included ‘average 

operating margin for electricity grid’; fugitive methane 

emissions from transmission &amp; distribution losses upstream of 

electricity grid; water supply and water treatment; diesel; petrol; 

refrigerant gases; business air travel (excluding the influence 

of radiative forcing); hotel accommodation and employee 

commuting with the source reference and confirmed  

its appropriateness. 

LEVEL OF ASSURANCE &amp; MATERIALITY 

The opinion expressed in this Assurance Statement has been formed 

on the basis of a reasonable level of assurance and at a materiality 

of the professional judgment of the verifiers.

Building Energy Intensity

2.1. 

Identify the number and type of buildings, total annual energy consumption (in kWh) and corresponding floor 

area (in m2), or number of persons using or visiting the buildings.

2.2. 

Identify the method used to ensure that annual energy consumption and floor area, or numbers of persons, are 

consistent and accurate, thereby taking account of different landlord and tenant metering scenarios. In particular, 

where the reporting organization does not have all energy consumption data for a building, it is important to 

ensure that the result of the calculation of energy intensity by building is consistent and accurate, for example by:

 

- excluding such properties from the aggregation; 

 

- defining the floor area to cover only the building area serviced by known energy consumption; 

 

- or revising the overall consumption data to take account of unknown data.

2.3. 

Calculate, using data from 2.1: Building energy intensity = sum of annual kWh energy consumption/ 

sum of floor area (m2) or number of people

2.4. 

Report energy intensity of buildings in use (on unadjusted basis), based on calculation in 2.3: 

 

- kWh/m2/year; or

 

- kWh/person/year.

 

Energy intensity should be reported by meaningful segmentation, for example by building type, geographic 

location, portfolio and fund. Separately, adjustments consistent with a recognized methodology can also be 

applied to any of the following factors: 

 

- hours of operation or working days per week; 

 

- vacancy; 

 

- occupant density; 

 

- heating and cooling (weather correction); or

 

- special uses.

2.5. 

Report the methodology used to calculate the energy intensity of the building in use and any adjustments.

3. Climate Resilience

GRI 305-4

GHG emissions intensity

a. 

GHG emissions intensity ratio for the organization.

b. 

Organization-specific metric (the denominator) chosen to calculate the ratio.

c. 

Types of GHG emissions included in the intensity ratio; whether direct (Scope 1), energy indirect (Scope 2), and/or 

other indirect (Scope 3).

d. 

Gases included in the calculation; whether CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, or all.

2.7. 

When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-4, the reporting organization shall:

2.7.1 

Calculate the ratio by dividing the absolute    GHG emissions (the numerator) by the organization-specific metric 

(the denominator);

2.7.2 

If reporting an intensity ratio for other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions, report this intensity ratio separately from 

the intensity ratios for direct (Scope 1) and energy indirect (Scope 2) emissions.

Management’s and Board of Directors’ 

responsibility 

The Management is responsible for the preparation of the Subject 

Matter Information in accordance with the GRI Sustainability 

Reporting Standards. The Board has ultimate responsibility for the 

company’s sustainability reporting.

The Management is responsible for the collection and presentation 

of the information and for maintaining adequate records and 

internal controls that are designed to support the sustainability 

reporting process.  For the purpose of the Integrated Sustainability 

Report 2020, there are no legally prescribed requirements relating 

to the verification of sustainability reports. 

Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and other ethical 

requirements of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority 

(ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public 

Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), which is founded 

on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional 

competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.

Our firm applies Singapore Standards on Quality Control 1 of the 

Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and, accordingly, 

maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including 

documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with 

ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal 

and regulatory requirements.

We have the required competencies and experience to conduct 

this assurance engagement. Our professionals have experience in 

both assurance skills and in the applicable subject matter including 

environmental, social and financial aspects.

Auditor’s responsibility 

Our responsibility is to form a conclusion on CDL’s preparation of 

the Subject Matter Information based on our work. We performed 

our work in accordance with International Standard on Assurance 

Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) (Revised) – Assurance Engagements 

other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (the 

“Standard”). This Standard requires that we plan and perform our 

work to form the conclusion. The extent of our work performed 

depends on our professional judgment and our assessment of the 

engagement risk.

Our review was limited to the information on the select indicators 

set out within the Report from 01 January 2019 to 31 December 

2019 and our responsibility does not include:

• 

Any work in respect of sustainability information published 

elsewhere in CDL’s annual report, website and other publications,

• 

Sustainability information prior to 01 January 2019 and 

subsequent to 31 December 2019, and

• 

Management’s forward looking statements such as targets, plans 

and intentions.

Reporting criteria

As a basis for the assurance engagement, we have used the 

criterion of “Accuracy” as defined by the GRI Standards and specific 

criteria determined by CDL as being relevant for its sustainability 

performance. We consider this reporting criterion to be relevant 

and appropriate to review the Report.

Assurance standard used and level of assurance

Our limited assurance engagement has been planned and 

performed in accordance with the ISAE 30001 Assurance 

Engagement Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical  

Financial Information. 

A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries and 

applying analytical and other review procedures.  Our procedures 

were designed to provide a limited level of assurance and as such 

do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a 

reasonable level of assurance. 

The procedures performed depend on our judgement including the 

risk of material misstatement of the specific activity data, whether 

due to fraud or error. While we considered the effectiveness of 

Management’s internal controls when determining the nature and 

extent of our procedures, our review was not designed to provide 

assurance on internal controls. We believe that the evidence we 

have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 

conclusion.

What we did to form our conclusions

We designed our procedures in order to state whether anything has 

come to our attention to suggest that the Subject Matter detailed 

above has not been reported in accordance with the reporting 

criteria cited earlier. In order to form our conclusions, we undertook 

the steps below:

1. Inquiries with CDL’s Sustainability team to 

a. Understand principal business operations, 

b. Appreciate key sustainability issues and developments,

c. Map out information flow for sustainability reporting and the 

controls on information collation,

d. Identify data providers with their responsibilities, and 

e. Recognise the likelihood of possible manipulation of 

sustainability data.

2. Undertake site visits to two project sites, two CDL-managed 

properties, and CDL’s offices.

3. Conduct process walk-through of systems and processes for data 

aggregation and reporting, with relevant personnel to understand 

the quality of checks and control mechanisms, assessing and 

testing the controls in relation to the concerned subject matters in 

the Report

4. Interviews with employees and management (Sustainability 

committee, human resources, property &amp; facilities management, 

environment health &amp; safety, internal audit, enterprise risk 

management, projects) to understand key sustainability issues 

related to the select indicators and processes for the collection 

and accurate reporting of performance information

5. Obtain documentation through sampling methods to verify 

assumptions, estimations and computations made by management 

in relation to the concerned subject matters in the Report

6. Checking that data and statements had been correctly 

transcribed from corporate systems and / or supporting 

evidence, into the Report

7. Obtain various certifications, audit reports and financial 

statement report in relation to the concerned subject matters in 

the Report

Observations and areas for improvement

Our observations and areas for improvement will be raised in an 

internal report to CDL’s Management. These observations do not 

affect our conclusions on the Report set out below. 

Other matters

Our responsibility in performing our limited assurance activities is 

to the Management of CDL only and in accordance with the terms 

of reference agreed with them. We do not accept or assume any 

responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person or 

organisation. Any reliance any such third party may place on the 

Report is entirely at their own risk.

Conclusion

Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, 

nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 

information in the Report was not presented fairly and calculated 

in all material respects in accordance with the reporting criteria 

detailed above.
