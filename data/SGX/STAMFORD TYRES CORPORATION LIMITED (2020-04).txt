Board statement 

 

We reaffirm our commitment to sustainability with the publication of our sustainability report (“Report”) 

guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core option. For this Report, we provide 

insights into the way we do business, while highlighting our environmental, social, governance (“ESG”) 

factors and economic performance. 

 

Whilst mindful of our profit-oriented objective, we are committed to strike a balance between growth, profit, 

governance, environment, the development of our people and well-being of our communities to secure the 

long-term future of our Group. This commitment is reflected in our sustainable business strategy and the 

material ESG factors which are shown in this Report.  

 

A sustainability policy (“SR Policy”) covering our sustainability strategies, reporting structure, materiality 

assessment and processes in identifying and monitoring material ESG factors has been established and 

serves as a point of reference in the conduct of our sustainability reporting. Under this SR Policy, we will 

continue to monitor, review and update our material ESG factors from time to time, taking into account the 

feedback that we receive from our engagement with our stakeholders, organisational and external 

developments. 

 

The global economic outlook remains challenging as a result of the global oversupply of tyres, intense 

market competition and uncertainties arising from the Coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19” or 

“Pandemic”). To cushion the impact of the above developments and Pandemic, we deployed resources 

and implemented strategies to diversify our product offerings to adapt to the ongoing market changes. In 

addition, we have taken steps to (i) right-size our operations; (ii) grow our sales of tyres, SSW wheels, truck 

tyres and mining tyres; (iii) improve our sales productivity; and (iv) upgrade our value-adding business 

segments such as Stamford Tyres Mart retail chain and truck centres. 

 

Given the volatile nature of the Pandemic and the uncertain outlook, we will continue to engage our 

stakeholders through providing timely updates on business developments via announcements on the 

platform of Singapore Exchange Limited (“SGX”). In addition, we will provide more details on our 

sustainability strategy in relation to the Pandemic in our next Report when there is more clarity.

We experienced a loss mainly due to: 

▪ 

Lower revenue arising from increased competition 

and oversupply in the tyre market; 

▪ 

A one-time expense relating to the closure of a 

loss-making operation in Australia; and 

▪ 

Higher allowance for doubtful receivables as a 

result of delayed and non-payment of trade 

receivables when due from customers, inter alia, 

to the current Pandemic and the various 

government-imposed lockdowns in our key 

markets.  

 

Despite a challenging year, we declared and paid a 

dividend of 0.5 Singapore cent per share.

Reporting framework and market benchmarking 

 

This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Core option and 

published in pursuant to the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) listing rules 711A 

and 711B. We have chosen to report using GRI Standards: Core option as it is an internationally recognised 

reporting framework.  

 

As part of our continual efforts to align our sustainability reporting with relevant market standards, we have 

mapped our sustainability efforts to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which is adopted by all 

United Nations Member States in 2015 (“UN Sustainability Agenda”). The UN Sustainability Agenda 

provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At 

its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”), which form an urgent call for action by all 

countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. We have incorporated the SDGs, where 

appropriate, as a supporting framework to shape and guide our sustainability strategy. 

 

3. 

Reporting period and scope 

 

This Report is applicable for our financial year from 1 May 2019 to 30 April 2020 (“FY2020” or “Reporting 

Period”) and a copy of which can be found in our corporate website http://www.stamfordtyres.com. A 

sustainability report will be published annually in accordance with our SR Policy.  

 

This Report covers the key operating entities within the Group which contributed approximately 96% 

(FY2019: 94%) of the Group’s total revenue for the Reporting Period.

Policy, practice and performance reporting 

 

6.1 

Reporting structure 

 

Our sustainability strategy is developed and directed by the senior management in consultation with the 

Board of Directors. Our Sustainability Committee, which includes senior management executives, is led by 

our Executive Director, and tasked to develop the sustainability strategy, review our material impacts, 

consider stakeholder priorities and set goals and targets, as well as collect, verify, monitor and report 

performance data for this Report. 

 

6.2 

Sustainability reporting processes 

 

Under our SR policy, our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant factors. Relevant 

factors are then prioritised as material factors which are then validated. The end result of this process is a 

list of material factors disclosed in this Report. Processes involved are as shown in the chart below: 

6.3 

Materiality assessment 

 

Under our SR Policy, each sustainability factor is assigned a reporting priority that determines the actions 

required as illustrated in the table below: 

Reporting priority 

Description 

Criteria 

I 

High 

Factors with high reporting priority are reported on in detail. 

II 

Medium 

Factors with medium reporting priority are considered for inclusion in 

the Report. If it is decided that such factors are not material, they 

may be excluded from the Report. 

III 

 

Low 

Factors with low reporting priority may be reported to fulfil regulatory 

or other reporting requirements. They are not included in this Report 

if not material.  

The reporting priority is supported by a material factor matrix which considers the level of concern to 

external stakeholders (“Stakeholders’ Concern”) and significance of our impacts on the economy, 

environment and society (“Business Impact”).

Performance tracking and reporting 

 

We track the progress of our material sustainability factors by identifying the relevant data points (i.e. the 

information source of the relevant factor) and measuring them. In addition, performance targets that are 

aligned with our strategy are set to ensure that we maintain the right course in our path to sustainability. 

We seek to constantly enhance our performance-monitoring processes and data capture systems.  

 

7. 

Material factors  

 

Our materiality assessment performed for FY2020 involved the Group’s senior management in identifying 

sustainability factors deemed material to our businesses and our stakeholders so as to allow us to channel 

our resources judiciously to create sustainable value for our stakeholders.

We will update the material factors on an annual basis to reflect changes in business operations, 

environment, stakeholders’ feedback and sustainability trends. The details of each material sustainability 

factor are presented as follows: 

 

7.1 

Customer satisfaction 

 

Our strategies towards customer satisfaction are as follows: 

 

Cultivate a long-term and sustainable relationship with our partners 

With firm relationships established with our strategic partners, we are able to gain access to distribute a 

diverse range of products under the major brands of Falken, Dunlop, Continental, Bridgestone and Maxam 

to meet our customers’ needs and requirements. In addition, our volume purchases allow us to secure 

competitive pricing which we can then offer our customers with value-for-money products.  

 

Adopt market standards for the quality and safety of our products  

For products under our proprietary brands, they are manufactured by selected contracted manufacturers 

(“CMS”) located in Asia under internationally recognised quality standards. The adoption of such standards 

supports our ability to consistently provide products that meet customers’ needs and expectation.  

 

For product safety and consistency in quality, refer to section 7.7 for further details. 

 

Maintain presence and proximity to our customers  

We have established an international distribution network that spans Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, 

Indonesia, Hong Kong, India, Australia, South Africa, and Vietnam. Our extensive network brings us close 

to the markets we serve and more importantly, to our customers.  

 

Nurture a team of highly trained and experienced employees  

We are dependent on our highly trained and experienced professional staff to serve our customers on the 

products we distribute.  Our strategy to establish a global footprint is driven by a core regional team of 

trained and experienced professional staff.

Proactive anti-corruption practices 

 

We are committed to carry out business with integrity by avoiding corruption in any form, including bribery, 

and complying with the Prevention of Corruption Act of Singapore.  

 

An employee handbook is in place to provide guidance to our employees on areas such as conduct in 

workplace, business conduct, confidentiality of information and conflict of interest. 

 

We have implemented a whistle blowing policy to provide a mechanism for employees to raise concerns 

through accessible confidential disclosure channels about possible improprieties in matters of financial 

reporting and others. In FY2020, no complaints on a serious offence2 are reported (FY2019: None).

7.4 

Energy conservation 

 

We are committed to responsible usage of energy to preserve the environment in which we operate in. 

Our operations consume energy mainly for the following purposes:  

▪ 

Electricity for machineries used in the manufacturing of aluminium alloy wheels and equipment used 

in our offices  

▪ 

LPG for machineries used in the manufacturing of aluminium alloy wheels, specifically for wheel 

casting  

▪ 

Fuel for operating motor vehicles such as trucks and forklifts  

 

We believe that a responsible usage of energy resources results in lesser carbon emissions and thus 

helps to preserve the environment. It also reduces our costs and enhances returns to shareholders. Key 

initiatives on this front are as follows:  

▪ 

In April 2019, we entered into a Solar Power Purchase Agreement with Sembcorp Solar Singapore 

to install a solar photovoltaic system at our headquarters (“Solar Power Project”). Under this 

agreement, solar panels are installed on the rooftop of our headquarters to generate electricity. The 

solar panels also help to bring down the roof surface’s temperature and cool the facility. This project 

enabled us to generate clean energy and at the same time, reduced our utility cost.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

▪ 

A systematic maintenance program for operating equipment is in place to maintain energy efficiency  

▪ 

Energy consumption is regularly tracked, analysed and corrective actions are taken when unusual 

consumption patterns are observed 

 

Key statistics on energy usage during the Reporting Period are as follows:

During the Reporting Period, the decrease in electricity consumption is mainly due to a reduced 

production level at our wheel factory in Thailand (“Wheel Factory”). On the other hand, our LPG and fuel 

consumption increased mainly due to changes in product mix and level at our Wheel Factory.

Waste optimisation 

 

We are committed to environmental preservation through reuse and recycling to allow us to operate in a 

sustainable environment.  

 

The main waste materials generated from our operations are the aluminium chips from wheel production. 

All aluminium chips from production are collected for outsource recycling. During the Reporting Period, 89% 

(FY2019: 89%) of the aluminium chips generated from production is recycled.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition, we are actively involved in recycling of used tyres through our retreading plants located in 

Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The retreading plants serve to extend the life span of tyres, thus saving 

valuable natural resources used in the production of tyres. Whilst preserving the environment, we also 

ensure that all retreaded tyres are rigorously inspected to ensure quality and safety.

7.6 

Water conservation and wastewater treatment 

 

We recognise the importance to effectively 

manage water consumption as valuable water 

resources may be depleted and pollution may 

occur if water consumption and wastewater 

treatment are not managed properly. To achieve 

effective water management, we are committed 

to 

minimise 

consumption 

and 

manage 

wastewater quality. This factor is primarily 

applicable to our wheel manufacturing operations 

located in Thailand with details as follows: 

 

a. Water conservation

CuM 

0.7 

 

0.8 

 

Water consumption rate decreased in FY2020 mainly due to lesser business activities in our Wheel Factory 

and rectification of a leakage problem in the underground piping at our operating premises in Singapore. 

 

Water conservation measures adopted by our Wheel Factory include the following: 

▪ 

A systematic maintenance program is implemented for operating equipment to maintain water 

efficiency 

▪ 

Water consumption trends are regularly tracked, analysed and corrective actions are taken when 

unusual consumption patterns are observed 

 

b. Wastewater treatment  

Wastewater comprises coolant oil and paint sludge which are generated from the following manufacturing 

processes: 

Description 

Source 

Coolant oil 

Generated from the machining process, which is a mixture of oil, coolant chemical 

and water 

Paint sludge 

Generated from the painting process, which is a mixture of water, paint chemical, 

thinner, and other particles captured by the water curtains inside the painting booths 

 

During the Reporting Period, the Wheel Factory generated 16,941 tonnes (FY2019: 20,223 tonnes) of 

wastewater. The decrease in wastewater generated from our Wheel Factory is mainly due to a reduction in 

production level. 

 

Measures taken to manage water quality include ensuring that wastewater is processed by our own water 

treatment plants before it is released into the waterways and conducting sampling checks to inspect water 

quality. During the Reporting Period, 100% (FY2019: 100%) of wastewater generated from our Wheel 

Factory is treated by our own water treatment plant.

During the Reporting Period, there is no safety related defect which resulted in an accident that caused 

injury to a customer (FY2019: None). 

 

7.8 

Employee retention 

 

The continual success of our business relies on a team of professional, skilled and experienced staff and 

managers. We are committed to employee retention through the following efforts: 

 

a. Performance based rewards  

We recognise that employees are key to sustainability and therefore aims to reward capable and dedicated 

employees. Under our performance share plan for managerial level employees, rewards in the form of 

shares are granted to key employees to align their interests with that of the Group. The share plan is subject 

to review and approval by an independent Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors.  

 

b. Systematic internal human resource processes 

Human resource processes related to employee 

retention includes: 

▪ 

An employee handbook is in place to provide 

guidance 

on 

employee 

benefits 

and 

disseminate corporate culture  

▪ 

Employees are engaged regularly via various 

channels such as an appraisal exercise which 

allows employees to gain feedback on their 

career progress  

▪ 

In-house and external training courses are 

organised regularly for employees to improve 

their professional skills. For example, a 

systematic training program is in place in 

Thailand to equip sales staff with the necessary 

product and service knowledge 

 

We believe that a low turnover improves the sustainability of operations and allows us to contribute 

positively to the development of social and human capital in a wider community. As at 30 April 2020, 81% 

(FY2019: 67%) of the employees have more than 3 years of service with us. The increase is mainly due to 

the implementation of a hiring freeze to tighten our cost controls during these difficult times.  

 

7.9 

Equality and diversity in the workplace 

 

We are committed to the goals of diversity and equal opportunity in employment by providing a work 

environment for our employees that fosters fairness, equality and respect for social and cultural diversity, 

regardless of their gender, age and educational background. The total number of full-time employees within 

the Group as at 30 April 2020 is 847 (FY2019: 934). The decrease in the total number of full-time employees 

is mainly due to the rightsizing of our workforce during these difficult times.

On gender diversity, we view diversity on the Board level as an essential element in supporting sustainable 

development with two (FY2019: two) female Board members. The percentage of female to total permanent 

employees is 26% (FY2019: 26%) and about 38% (FY2019: 36%) of managers are females as at 30 April 

2020.  

 

On age diversity, matured workers are valued for their experience knowledge and skills. As at 30 April 

2020, 46% (FY2019: 40%) of our workforce is at least 40 years old.  

 

On diversity in educational background, we seek to create an inclusive environment for our employees 

from different educational background. The distribution of staff by educational level is as follows: 

 

Education qualification

Tertiary

To promote equal opportunity, we have implemented various human resource measures as follows: 

▪ 

Human resource policy and employee handbook are in place to recruit and promote employees based 

on merit and competency 

▪ 

Staff assessment is performed regularly to evaluate the performance of staff and provides staff with 

sense of self-awareness to undertake training that will improve their skills and abilities 

▪ 

Staff recruitment advertisements do not state age, race, gender or religion preferences as requirement

7.10 Safe working environment 

 

In our Group’s daily operations, the workers are required to handle heavy lifting equipment such as forklift 

to transfer inventories. For the Wheel Factory, workers also operate in a high temperature environment 

with the use of chemicals such as paints. Given the nature of activities and operating environment, we are 

committed to maintain a safety-conscious culture amongst our employees. 

 

The measures implemented to manage health and safety in the workplace environment are as follows:  

▪ 

A set of safety rules and regulations is in place 

▪ 

A safety committee is in place and safety 

inspections are performed regularly by safety 

officers and reported to senior managers 

▪ 

All new employees are briefed on safety 

procedures during orientation 

▪ 

Regularly track and monitor accidents at the 

workplace and corrective action plans are 

established to prevent recurrences of the accidents 

▪ 

A dedicated first-aid room is maintained at the 

Wheel Factory to provide immediate and effective 

medical treatment to workers or others who sustain 

injuries at the location 

 

We have recorded zero workplace fatality during the Reporting Period and 9 (FY2019: 12) non-fatal 

workplace injuries6, resulting 26 man-days lost (FY2019: 80 man-days lost) during the Reporting Period. 

The non-fatal workplace injuries mainly relate to finger, hand and wrist injuries. We will continuously work 

towards reducing both the occurrence and severity of workplace accidents. 

 

In light of the Pandemic, we put up posters and hand sanitisers at strategic areas of our premises to raise 

awareness amongst our employees on the safety precautions to be taken during the Pandemic and to 

facilitate sanitisation. In addition, employees and visitors are required to measure their temperatures before 

allowing entry into our premises. We also provide complimentary health screening for our Singapore based 

employees. 

 

 

6 A workplace accident is defined as one when an employee is injured in a work accident which resulted in (i) hospitalisation 

for at least 24 hours and/or (ii) medical leave of more than 3 days (regardless if the medical leave is consecutive)

7.11 Ongoing community engagement 

 

We recognise that the long-term success of our business is closely related to the health and prosperity of 

the communities that we operate in. Accordingly, we strive to constantly contribute to the community. During 

the Reporting Period, the following campaigns are initiated to help the community: 

 

a. Singapore Red Cross (“SRC”) 

Under an arrangement made with SRC, we have supported the servicing and change of tyres of 18 vehicles 

since August 2018. The vehicles typically make over 12,000 life-saving trips a year and are deployed all 

over Singapore.  The estimated retail cost of savings for the SRC will be in the region of SGD 15,000 per 

year. We are proud to partake in the noble mission of SRC.  

 

b. Malaysia International Search &amp; Rescue (“MISAR”) 

In March 2020, our Malaysia subsidiary sponsored tyres for MISAR and we are proud to be part of this 

programme. Our sponsorship to some extent helped MISAR’s Emergency Response Team in their mission 

to serve the nation in search, rescue, relief and emergency response to save life and anyone in needed.

c. Jane Goodall Institute of Singapore (“JGIS”) 

JGIS was founded in 2007 to continue Dr. Jane Goodall’s efforts 

in Singapore. Our Singapore subsidiary has participated and 

donated in this charity gala dinner to show support towards local 

wildlife conservation and public education on animal welfare and 

environmental protection.   

 

 

 

d. We supported #SGUnited: The Courage Fund 

During April 2020, we matched the sale of each tyre and rim with 

a dollar of donation and each servicing package with two dollars 

of donation to Courage Fund administered by the National 

Council of Social Service. 

 

 

 

 

 

e. Scholarship at Nakhon Ratchasima Province 

Our subsidiary in Thailand participated in a donation program organised by Revo Thailand which offers 

scholarships to students in the Nakhon Ratchasima Province.

7.12 Robust corporate governance framework 

 

We are committed to high standards of corporate governance and believes that a high standard of 

corporate governance is integral in ensuring sustainability of our business, as well as safeguarding 

shareholders’ interests and maximising long-term shareholder’s value.  

 

Our overall SGTI score assessed by National University of Singapore Business School is 76 for year 2020 

(year 2019: 62).  

 

The Board and Management firmly believe that the success of our quest for good governance lies in putting 

in place an effective framework of risk management and internal controls that is aligned with market 

standards and best practices. Refer to the Corporate Governance Report of the Annual Report 2020 for

Supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals  

 

We have incorporated the SDGs under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all 

United Nations Member States in 2015, where appropriate, as a supporting framework to shape and guide 

our sustainability strategy. The results shown below are how our sustainability factors relate to these SDGs: 

SDG

treatment) 

 

 

Ensure access to affordable, reliable, 

sustainable and modern energy for all 

We install a solar photovoltaic system at our headquarters and

operations. (Section 7.4 Energy conservation) 

 

 

Promote sustained, inclusive and 

sustainable economic growth, full and

satisfaction is essential to the continued success of our 

business. This in turn helps to contribute to economic 

growth as well as protection and creation of jobs. (Section 

7.1 Customer satisfaction) 

▪ 

We ensure compliance to market standards with regards to 

the quality and safety of our products as such factors also 

help us to maintain customer satisfaction and the continued 

success of our business. This in turn helps to contribute to 

economic growth and protection and creation of jobs. 

(Section 7.7 Commitment to quality products) 

▪ 

We contribute to economic growth through creating long-

term value for our stakeholders. (Section 7.2 Sustainable
