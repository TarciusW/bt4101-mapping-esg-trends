1. Highlights 

1.1 Corporate profile 

Jiutian Chemical Group Limited (九天化工集团有限公司) (‘Jiutian’ or the ‘Company’), together with its 

subsidiaries (the ‘Group’), are engaged in the manufacture and production of dimethylformamide (‘DMF’) and 

methylamine in the People’s Republic of China (‘PRC’). We are also involved in the processing and sale of 

consumable carbon dioxide and oxygen. 

The business is divided into three main business divisions: 

• 

DMF division producing DMF as its main product and methylamine as our secondary product; 

• 

Sodium Hydrosulfite division producing Sodium Hydrosulfite; and 

• 

Gas and Oxygen-18 division producing consumable carbon dioxide, Oxygen-18 and deuterium-

depleted water. 

We are located in Henan Province in the PRC. Whilst economic development and industrialisation in the PRC 

began on the eastern and southern coast, this process has begun to spread rapidly inland, including to Henan 

and its surrounding regions, where cost of labour, land and raw materials are significantly lower. 

As a result, industrialisation and urbanisation are occurring at a rapid pace in these regions, and the 

consequent establishment of factories producing a wide range of consumer products is driving the demand for 

chemicals such as DMF and methylamine. Being the only significant DMF producer in the Henan Province 

(within 500km from the plant), we are well-positioned to take advantage of this trend. 

In addition, our location in the PRC’s Coal Belt allows us to enjoy a cost advantage over other PRC DMF 

producers due to our secure and low-cost access to the coal-based raw materials that are used in the 

manufacture of our products. Our production efficiency and cost-effective supply chain management strategy, 

which include direct piping-in of raw materials from our main supplier, has provided us a relative cost advantage 

against our competitors. 

Henan Province is also on the Beijing-Guangzhou railway and its capital, Zhengzhou has one of Asia’s largest 

railway stations and network. Zhengzhou has been developed into a logistics central station for cargo 

transportation. This will further reduce the transportation and distribution costs of our products. Our customer 

base in China consists of customers in Henan, the surrounding provinces adjacent to Henan, namely Hebei, 

Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Anhui, and provinces in the Yangtze Delta Region, namely, Jiangsu and 

Zhejiang. 

Some of our customers are manufacturers of downstream products that use methylamine and DMF, while others, 

especially those located further away in the Yangtze Delta Region, are trading intermediaries that distribute these 

chemicals to customers that use these chemicals in their manufacturing processes. With our second 

DMF/methylamine facility of 120,000 annual ton capacity completed in late 2007, we have emerged as one of the 

world’s largest manufacturers of DMF with a total annual capacity of 150,000 tons of DMF and methylamine. 

Jiutian is currently listed on the Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited 

(‘SGX-ST’) under the stock code C8R.

1.2 Message to stakeholders 

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Jiutian Chemical Group Limited, I am pleased to present 

the Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2019 (‘FY2019’).  

As a leader in DMF and methylamine production in China, Jiutian is poised to take a leading role in the 

environmental, health and safety (‘EHS’) aspects to ensure sustainability of our operations and fulfil our 

responsibility towards our stakeholders. We continue to engage in constructive dialogue with our stakeholders 

and focus on our four key pillars of Quality Management, Production Safety, Environmental Protection and 

Employee Well-being. 

We are aware that the Chinese government’s emphasis on environmentally-friendly industrial operations will 

necessitate us in keeping abreast of related regulatory developments and consequently improving our 

operations to comply with these changes. This pro-active stance will in turn place Jiutian on a more sustainable 

growth trajectory. 

In FY2019, amidst rising trade barriers and tensions, most specifically the China-US trade war and economic 

uncertainties, business sentiments have been weighed down in the macroeconomic and domestic landscape, 

causing a general slowdown in China’s economy. Our performance took a hit from these snowballed effects. 

Despite our successful efforts and measures to readapt our operations in line with the tightening environmental 

regulations, which had paid off in FY2018, the capacity utilisation rate for DMF production decreased from 

70% to 62%, while the capacity utilisation rate for methylamine production teetered just slightly to 99% from 

the 100% utilisation rate year-on-year. Nevertheless, we will continue to focus on proper and ongoing 

maintenance and replacement of our facilities, without compromising the efficiency and safety of our 

operations.  

Towards the end of FY2019, the emergence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (‘COVID-19’) has created 

instabilities amongst the international economy and generated considerable negative impact. It will certainly 

have a significant impact on businesses and communities globally. In demonstrating our solidarity to join the 

authorities' efforts to control the pace of the spread of COVID-19, the Group has vigilantly complied with the 

directives from the Chinese government and local authorities in Anyang. In addition, the Group has instituted 

precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of its employees. As the current COVID-19 situation 

continues to develop, we shall keep a close eye on our operations, and announce any material changes to our 

business performance to shareholders timely, as and when appropriate. 

Lastly, we wish to confirm that the Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic 

formulation. The Board has determined the material environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) factors and 

overseen the management in monitoring these material ESG factors. 

As part of Jiutian’s commitment to sustainable development, we will continue to strive to do business in a 

responsible way.  

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors

1.3 Scope of sustainability report 

The scope of the report covers information on material sustainability aspects of Jiutian, namely the Group’s 

significant subsidiary, Anyang Jiutian Fine Chemical Co., Ltd (安阳九天精细化工有限公司) (‘Anyang Jiutian’), from 

1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 unless otherwise specified. This should sufficiently address stakeholders’ 

concerns in relation to sustainability issues arising from the major business operations of the Group. 

This report is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’) Standards: Core Option as it 

provides a set of an extensive framework that is widely accepted as a global standard for sustainability 

reporting. It also considers the Sustainability Reporting Guide in Practice Note 7F of the SGX-ST Listing 

Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist (‘Catalist Rules’). In preparing our report, we applied the GRI’s principles 

for defining report content and report quality by considering the Group’s activities, impacts and substantive 

expectations and interests of its stakeholders.  

The data and information provided within the report have not been verified by an independent third party. We 

have relied on internal data monitoring and verification to ensure accuracy. 

1.4 Restatements 

Environmental impact data relating to wastewater discharge, water consumption, and water recycling and 

reused for previous years have been removed as they were found to be erroneous. Anyang Jiutian has since 

installed new water meters to more accurately measure and report these statistics from FY2019 onwards. No 

other restatements were made from the previous report.  

1.5 Sustainability contact

3. Our performance 

3.1 How we measure our performance 

Our sustainability strategy is embedded into the appropriate parts of our business, with dedicated teams for 

each focus area, and coordination by our relevant departmental managers. 

Progress will be tracked in two key ways: measuring performance against metrics, and evaluating how well 

the programmes have advanced through a series of ‘commitments’. 

Metrics and targets 

We have established key performance indicators for each of the four focus areas outlined in our sustainability 

strategy. Periodically, we plan to introduce new metrics and update targets to ensure alignment with our 

strategy. 

Commitments 

To ensure we have a robust sustainability programme in place, we have included the key commitments for 

each area of our sustainability strategy. The progress we have made against each key commitment is indicated 

using the symbols shown in the table below. 

We track and review our sustainability programme with the Board of Directors at least once a year.

3.2 Quality management 

Overview 

Anyang Jiutian is primarily engaged in the manufacture and 

production of high purity DMF and methylamine to support 

the needs of our customers, mainly for their use as 

feedstock in the production of polyurethane (‘PU’). We 

have established comprehensive procedures to ensure 

quality throughout the production process. 

In addition, we believe that effective management of our 

supply chain can help us conserve resources, optimise 

processes, increase productivity and promote positive 

corporate values. We are dedicated to the consistent 

implementation 

of 

our 

procurement 

policies 

and 

procedures across our entire operation. 

Plant capacity utilisation 

In FY2019, despite our successful efforts and measures to readapt our 

operations in line with the tightening environmental regulations, which 

had paid off in FY2018, the capacity utilisation rate for DMF production 

decreased from 70% to 62%, while the capacity utilisation rate for 

methylamine production teetered just slightly to 99% from the 100% 

utilisation rate year-on-year.  

The main cause that had resulted in this overall decrease in capacity 

utilisation of both our plants was the scheduled maintenance shutdown 

of approximately 20 days (FY2018: nil) for both plants during the third 

quarter of FY2019. 

We will continue to track and report on the plant capacity utilisation rate 

for DMF and methylamine. 

Ongoing maintenance and repairs 

In FY2019, we conducted scheduled maintenance on the DMF and 

methylamine plants. Major maintenance on both plants will only be 

performed in the following year in FY2020. The last major maintenance 

was performed in FY2017. 

Regular maintenance and repairs continue to be carried out 

periodically, which does not affect the daily operations of the chemical 

plants. 

Such 

activities 

may 

comprise 

minor 

technological 

improvements, maintenance and repairs on piping, meters and 

insulation, and other structural reinforcements. These maintenance 

and repairs will improve production efficiency and quality, and ensure 

that the chemical plant will run smoothly during the harsh winter 

months. In FY2019, total expenditure on maintenance and repairs 

amounted to more than ¥8 million (FY2018: ¥15 million).

Even as the DMF and methylamine facilities have been in production for more than 10 years, the Production, 

Equipment and Technical Departments are always on the look out to improve the efficiency and effectiveness 

of the current production work flow through process improvement initiatives. In FY2019, total expenditure on 

process improvements amounted to close to ¥4 million (FY2018: ¥8 million). 

We will continue to track and report on maintenance and repairs and process improvements made at Anyang 

Jiutian. 

Stringent quality management 

We are totally committed to customer satisfaction with quality products delivered through our stringent quality 

management process. Effective from October 2018, Anyang Jiutian has been certified to be compliant with the 

requirements of ISO9001:2015 (Quality Management System). This certification has a validity of three years.  

The main raw materials for DMF and methylamine are methanol and liquid ammonia. Each incoming raw 

material shipment will be subject to stringent analysis and inspection by our in-house laboratory to ensure that 

the raw materials meet our production requirements for high purity chemicals. Shipments that cannot meet the 

purity requirement are entirely rejected and returned to the suppliers. Ongoing production are also subject to 

hourly quality inspection to ensure the consistency of DMF and methylamine production.  

Backed by our stringent quality management process, Anyang Jiutian achieved 100% product acceptance rate 

by our customers in FY2019. As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to achieve 100% product acceptance 

rate by our customers. 

Purchases from Anhua 

Commencing from 1 January 2005, Anyang Jiutian signed a 20-year raw materials and spare parts purchase 

agreement with our principal supplier and shareholder, Anyang Chemical Industry Group Co., Ltd. (安阳化学

工业集团有限责任公司)(‘Anhua’), including the supply of coal, distilled water, steam and electricity. We 

continue to enjoy a close working relationship with Anhua to ensure the quality and consistent supply of these 

essential raw materials and utilities to our facilities at a reasonable price. 

Supplier management 

Anyang Jiutian purchases entirely from reliable local suppliers. A secure and stable supply chain is very 

important to ensure the smooth and uninterrupted operation of our production activities. As such, we have 

established a set of Supplier Management Policies (供应商管理办法) to be applied to all our suppliers. 

Some of the areas covered by our policies include: 

• 

Supplier classification, 

• 

New supplier qualification and authorisation, 

• 

Supplier evaluation, 

• 

Supplier disqualification,  

• 

Supplier selection through fair competition, and 

• 

Inventory management.

3.3 Production safety 

Overview 

Safety is of paramount importance in the chemicals 

industry, and we have always stressed the importance of 

production safety in all our operations, especially when we 

deal with hazardous chemicals in each stage of our 

production process.  

We believe that one of the keys to improving safety is the 

creation of a more effective safety culture – one that does 

not emphasise production over safety. 

Inculcating an effective safety culture 

Safety in the chemical industry relies heavily on following correct 

procedures. Having an effective safety culture is hence very important. 

By building an effective safety culture, we can not only reduce injuries, 

we can also strengthen production, increase operational agility and 

move ahead on the journey to becoming a high-performance business. 

Anyang Jiutian is fully compliant with China’s production safety policy 

and has regularly renewed the requisite Production Safety License 

(安全生产许可证) on our production facilities. We enforce strict safety 

regulations and take stringent measures to ensure the safety aspects 

of our production facilities and processes.  

As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to be fully compliant with 

China’s production safety policy with zero production stoppage due to 

safety incidences and zero serious accidents. 

At Anyang Jiutian, our Safety Committee is headed by our General 

Manager, and supported by our Vice General Manager (Technical), 

Equipment Manager, Production Manager and Safety Manager.  

Daily safety briefings are held before each production shift with weekly 

and monthly safety meetings to summarise and incorporate lessons 

learnt. There are also periodic sharing sessions from each department 

to highlight on important safety aspects. 

New employees are required to attend company and departmental 

orientation trainings where safety features prominently in the topics 

which are covered. They are also required to familiarise themselves on 

all safety aspects in relation to their job scope. 

In June 2019, we kicked off a full month of activities in conjunction with 

the Production Safety Month to strengthen safety awareness and 

safety aspects in our daily operations. We also organise monthly safety 

competitions between different production shifts and reward the 

winning team with additional salary incentives. We believe that this is 

an effective motivational tool to improve production without 

compromising safety.

Production safety management 

We are totally committed to production safety and have established a set of Production Safety Management 

Policies (安全生产管理制度) that requires all employees to adhere to the relevant safety laws and regulations 

and company standards. Effective from October 2018, Anyang Jiutian has been certified to be compliant with 

the requirements of OHSAS18001:2007 (Health &amp; Safety Management System). This certification has a 

validity of three years.  

Our employees are required to familiarise themselves with and uphold safety standards in order to achieve 

“Safety First, Effective Prevention, and Comprehensive Management” (安全第一、预防为主、综合治理). 

Some of the areas covered by our policies include: 

• 

Effective safety culture, 

• 

Safety training and development, 

• 

Occupational health and safety, 

• 

Handling of hazardous chemicals, and 

• 

Fire safety and prevention. 

Emergency preparedness 

While we emphasise on preventing safety incidents, we also prepare the employees to handle and respond to 

emergencies, including potential explosions, fire and chemical spills. This is very important to reduce and limit 

the impact and casualty as a result of the any safety incidents that may happen in our line of work.  

In addition to departmental trainings and refresher courses, we also conduct annual fire safety and emergency 

preparedness drills involving company personnel and the local fire station.  

In November 2019, we kicked off a full month of activities in conjunction with the “119” National Fire Prevention 

Month to strengthen fire safety and emergency preparedness awareness within Anyang Jiutian and our local 

community, focused on the following areas: 

• 

Case studies on major fire incidents in recent years, 

• 

Response to emergency situations at work and at home, 

• 

Usage of fire safety equipment, and 

• 

Usage of gas masks.

3.4 Environmental protection 

Overview 

Environmental protection is fast gaining traction in China 

amongst policy makers and the public. This move has 

posed significant implications, especially to the chemicals 

industry. As one of the largest producers of DMF and 

methylamine in China, Anyang Jiutian is committed to 

ensuring our full compliance with national environmental 

regulations.  

Comprehensive policies are developed to ensure the 

Anyang Jiutian’s commitment towards environmental 

protection, 

reducing 

carbon 

emissions, 

preventing 

pollution, and minimising waste can be achieved during our 

daily operations. 

Environmental policy in China 

Environmental policy in China is set by the National People's Congress 

and managed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the 

People's Republic of China. The central government issues strict 

regulations for which the actual monitoring and enforcement is largely 

undertaken by the local governments. 

In January 2015, a new environmental law came into effect, covering 

land, water and air pollution. It contains strict penalties, including 

seizing of the property of illegal polluters, with company executives 

subject to prison sentences of 15 days. There is no upper limit on fines. 

More than 300 different groups will be able to sue on the behalf of 

people harmed by pollution. 

Anyang Jiutian is fully compliant with China’s environmental policy and 

has obtained the requisite clearance on its environmental protection 

facilities since November 2015.  

As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to be fully compliant with 

China’s environmental policy with zero environmental incidents and 

zero fines on contravention of environmental regulations. 

To address the increasingly stringent national environmental policy in 

China, Anyang Jiutian’s management requires all environmental 

matters to be addressed as high priority through the following steps: 

• 

Manage and analyse the root causes of environmental 

incidents in a timely manner, 

• 

Adopt a conscientious and persistent attitude towards the 

improvement of processes, and 

• 

Maintain an open mind towards the adoption of new and 

advanced technology and management methods.

Environmental protection management 

At Anyang Jiutian, our Environmental Protection Committee is headed by our General Manager and supported 

by our Vice General Manager (Technical), Equipment Manager, Production Manager and Safety Manager. 

They will oversee all environmental protection matters in the Company. 

We are totally committed to environment protection and have established a set of Environmental Protection 

Management Policies (环境保护管理制度) that requires all employees to adhere to the relevant environmental 

protection laws and regulations and company standards. Effective from October 2018, Anyang Jiutian has 

been certified to be complaint with the requirements of ISO14001:2015 (Environmental Management System). 

This certification has a validity of three years.  

Some of the areas covered by our policies include: 

• 

Source pollution management, 

• 

Air pollution monitoring, 

• 

Proper discharge of solid and liquid waste 

• 

Pollution management, and 

• 

Pollution management diagrams for our production of DMF and methylamine. 

Managing carbon emissions 

 

To determine the carbon footprint, we collect energy usage data from each our businesses and then calculate 

our total annual greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions. We follow the GHG Protocol established by the World 

Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the standard manual for 

measuring corporate GHG emissions. Using the “control method”, we include 100% of the emissions 

associated with businesses which we directly control. Our carbon footprint includes: 

• 

All fuels used directly by our companies (Scope 1 emissions) 

• 

All purchased electricity and steam used in our facilities (Scope 2 emissions) 

• 

Impact of business travel, and transportation of goods to our customers (optional Scope 3 emissions)

Carbon 

Emissions 


Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2019

In FY2019, Anyang Jiutian generated a carbon footprint of 956 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission (‘tCO2e’) 

with a carbon emission intensity of 4.10 kgCO2e per tonne of production, representing a 9% decrease from 

the previous year. The emission mainly arises from purchased steam used in the production process which 

accounted for close to 73% of the total carbon emission of Anyang Jiutian. 

The reduction in carbon emission intensity is mainly due to decrease in number of trips made to transport 

goods to our customers. A number of customers have started to self-collect the DMF and methylamine directly 

from our plants, resulting in the decrease.  

We recognise that reducing carbon emissions in our daily operations has a positive effect on climate change 

and have achieved our target of reducing our carbon footprint intensity by 3% from a FY2018 baseline. We will 

work towards ensuring that our carbon footprint intensity in future years continue to achieve this target. 

Energy efficiency 

Production facilities are energy-intensive structures and energy consumption, comprising of purchased 

electricity and steam, constitutes a significant proportion of our operating expenses. By investing in energy 

efficiency, we not only help protect the environment but can also lower our financial costs. 

To enhance our existing assets, we have allocated considerable resources to process improvement initiatives 

over the years. We have optimised eco-efficiency in our production operations to cut our energy consumption 

with the primary goal of reducing our carbon footprint. For example, we are improving the energy efficiency of 

our boilers through regular maintenance and refurbishment. Occasionally, we also introduce more extensive 

process improvements through our major maintenance exercise. 

Gaseous emissions 

DMF and methylamine production produce fumes containing hydrogen sulphide and ammonia respectively. 

These obnoxious fumes need to be securely collected and treated before they can be safely released into the 

atmosphere. 

Hydrogen sulphide gas from DMF production will undergo a desulphurisation process to remove the presence 

of sulphur to a level of less than 0.1 parts-per million (‘ppm’). On the other hand, ammonia gas from 

methylamine production is recovered, purified and recycled as feedstock for the production.  

As a result, the fumes released into the atmosphere will be able to meet the requirements of the gas emission 

standard of the Henan Province. As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to ensure that 100% of our gaseous 

emissions meet the local emission standards. 

Waste and wastewater management 

Waste materials from the production of DMF and methylamine are not significant. Any waste engine oils and 

materials recovered from maintenance of piping, meters and insulation will be aggregated in a locked and 

isolated container and disposed through proper biohazard disposal channels. 

Wastewater disposal is handled by Anhua on the Company’s behalf. Anhua’s facilities are able to handle up 

to 15,000 m3 of wastewater a day, through a set of parallel biological treatment tanks.  

As a result, the treated wastewater discharge will be able to meet the requirements of the water emission 

standard of the Henan Province. As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to ensure that 100% of our 

wastewater discharge meet the local emission standards. 

In FY2019, we installed new water meters to more accurately measure our wastewater discharge. Anyang 

Jiutian had a wastewater discharge intensity of 0.06 m3 per tonne of production. We will continue to strive to 

reduce wastewater discharge due to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in China.

Saving water 

In Anyang Jiutian, water is extensively used as a natural coolant to ensure that our reactor towers are 

maintained at the correct temperature during chemical production. Where possible, Anyang Jiutian already 

has procedures in place to utilise recycled water for its processes.  

In FY2019, we installed new water meters to more accurately measure our water consumption, and water 

recycled and reused. Anyang Jiutian had a water consumption intensity of 1.02 m3 per tonne of production. In 

addition, up to 33% of municipal water consumption is being recycled and reused. 

We will continue to track and monitor our performance on wastewater discharge, water consumption, and 

water recycling and reused. Progress and performance improvement will be reported every year.

3.4 Employee well-being 

Overview 

To increase productivity, we have a comprehensive 

performance appraisal programme and rewards system 

based on the result of the appraisal. The performance 

appraisal programme is essential for us to understand the 

skills level of the employees and appropriate training 

programmes can be designed to fill up the skill gaps.  

We emphasise on the career path and progression of our 

employees. To achieve this, the management builds 

several two-way communication channels to ensure the 

career development needs of the employee are taken into 

consideration whenever possible. Trainings opportunities 

are equal to all employees based on needs identified.  

Though these efforts, Anyang Jiutian is well-positioned to 

provide a constructive working experience to our 

employees and contribute to the economic development 

and skilled labour resources of the local community.

Skills competency and employee training 

To ensure that our employees excel, we emphasise on continuous learning in the workplace. Every employee 

has equal opportunities to upgrade and sharpen his or her skill set through formal and on-the-job internal 

training programs and inter-departmental competitions. 

In FY2019, Anyang Jiutian invested an average of 93 hours of training on each employee, representing a slight 

increase from the previous year. This is due to efforts by the Company to ensure employee’s skill competency.  

We have achieved our target of a minimum of 80 hours of training per employee and will work towards 

achieving the same target in future years. 

Performance appraisal  

To ensure that we achieve our goals, we have various performance appraisal methods in place to determine 

the performance of the Company as well as each individual employee.  

The employee performance appraisal comprises mainly quantifiable evaluation criteria. In addition, we actively 

collect performance information for each employee each month through inputs from direct supervisors and 

feedbacks, as well as periodical employee communication sessions.  

These collected information allow us to understand the performance and skills development needs of each 

team and individual employee from multiple aspects. This is crucial for the Company to develop annual training 

programs that are designed to enhance the skills of the employee and aims to improve the overall productivity.  

In FY2019, all of our employees are at least subject to an annual performance appraisal by their superiors. We 

seek to continue this practice in the coming year.

following the principles of equality and non-discrimination. Recruitment, remuneration, promotion, and benefits 

are required to be handled based on objective assessment, equal opportunity and non-discrimination 

regardless of gender, race, marital status, pregnancy, disability, age or family status.  

We attract talent through fair, and flexible recruitment strategy that includes recruitment application, job 

description, job applications, interview, selection, approval, and job offer. Promotion is based on performance 

and suitability.  

We offer competitive remuneration to attract and retain talented staff members. Remuneration packages 

(which includes the necessary social benefits) are reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with current 

employment market benchmarks. Dismissal also complies with employment laws and regulations relating to 

non-discrimination. 

In FY2019, female employees comprise 40% of our entire workforce, with female representation in 

management at 41%. We will continue to track and monitor female representation in our workforce and report 

these statistics every year.  

Encouraging work-life balance  

We organised a variety of employee activities to help them relax their mind and body, develop teamwork, 

explore their talent, so as to develop a positive attitude in both work and life.  

To enhance employee teamwork and cohesion, improve employee health and improve employee work-life 

balance, Anyang Jiutian has been organising periodic employee gatherings during major festivals and sports 

competitions. In addition, Anyang Jiutian organises free annual health checks for its employees and gives out 

monetary supports to its needy workers. 

Business continuity 

The emergence of COVID-19 has had a significant impact on businesses and communities globally. All the 

operations of the Group are situated in Anyang, PRC. 

In demonstrating our solidarity to join the authorities' efforts to control the pace of the spread of COVID-19, the 

Group has complied with the directives from the Chinese government and local authorities in Anyang. In 

addition, the Group has instituted precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of its employees. 

We have also initiated business continuity planning to protect our staff and mitigate the impact on the Group’s 

business operations.  

We will monitor the local situation and will put in place the above practices and any additional controls as 

required by the local governments (e.g. quarantine measures, stop work orders) where applicable.  

As the current COVID-19 situation continues to develop, we shall keep a close eye on our operations, and 

announce any material changes to our business performance to shareholders timely, as and when appropriate.
