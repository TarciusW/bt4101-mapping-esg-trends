which we operate on a day to day basis.From the adoption of
new work arrangements to scaling up our online presence to
sell our products,efforts have been undertaken to ensure that
the wellbeing, safety and needs of all our stakeholders are
addressed during these challenging times.
For FY2020,the Board and the Management reviewed the
ESG factors in the context of their relevance to addressing key
challenges posed by the pandemic. We determined that the
material ESG matters focused on remain relevant. The Board
will continue to closely monitor developments of the
pandemic, as well as,others that may have a material influence

concerns were directly addressed in the Group's response. Despite challenges,
the group has managed to successfully deal with the immediate impact of the
pandemic. Additionally, the Group has also begun to formalise its policies towards
dealing with future disruptions in a Business Continuity Plan.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS

our stakeholders and serves as a competitive advantage for the Group on matters such as
closing business deals and recruiting the best talent.
The Group ensures that relevant staff are constantly kept up to date on new regulatory
requirements. Staff are provided opportunities to attend training and workshops to gain a
better grasp of the compliance requirements. In addition,F J Benjamin works closely with
accredited external auditors and its legal advisors to ensure that all regulatory
requirements with SGX-ST listing rules and the various International Financial Reporting
Standards are adhered to.

OUR PEOPLE
Our employees are dynamic individuals with
diverse backgrounds who are key assets to the
Group. Where we stand today would not have
been possible without the dedication and
collaborative efforts by each of our employees

As of 30 June 2020, we have a total of 644 full-time employees on permanent
contract and 21 part-time temporary employees.During this challenging period,F J
Benjamin took the stance not to engage in any retrenchment exercise of full-time
employees,which is reflected in small decline of 7% in FY2020 from FY2019.There
was however a significant decrease of 87% of temporary part-time employees
compared to the previous reporting period due to reduced manpower requirements
needed for our stores due to temporary closure, reduced footfall and safe distancing
limitations imposed by the government.

Our employees can be broadly categorised into two different groups - frontline employees
overseeing our stores comprising sales associate, supervisor and manager and backend
employees comprising executive,manager and senior management. Due to the nature of our
business, a large portion (66%) of our employees are frontline employees who carry out the day
to day sales of brands under our Group

TALENT MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
Approach
Having employees equipped with the right skills and knowledge serves as a competitive advantage
for any business. In recognition of this,F J Benjamin has a well-developed system to manage our
talents. We have summarised our key initiatives taken, at every step of our employees' career, to
ensure that they are given the necessary resources to reach their fullest potential professionally in
Figure 11 below.

Talent recruitment forms the first pillar of our talent management system.F J Benjamin proactively
scouts for talent. In particular, frontline talent who are able to significantly contribute to the sale of our
products. Upon identification of talent, a rigorous process of interviews is in place by hiring managers
to ensure that we develop the right talent pool for effective sales of products for our brands.
Talent training forms the second pillar of our talent management system. Our employees undergo both
on-the-job training and attend external training classes to ensure that they remain up to date on
product knowledge and sales techniques.F J Benjamin takes an active role in providing support to all
our employees who are undergoing skills training.
Finally,F J Benjamin have talent performance reviews in place to ensure that employees obtain the
feedback that they need to improve on their work.
Performance
In FY2020, F J Benjamin was unable to meet our previously identified target of 35 hours of training
per employee on the front line. The onset of the pandemic has severely impacted training plans for
the year. Many of the training programmes were cancelled or rescheduled during the lockdown
period due to the core mode of delivery being face-to-face. Where there were alternatives such as
online courses, limitations in the medium (e.g. access to laptops; small sized classes) further posed
difficulties for some frontline employees to attend
In spite of these challenges,we manage to extend training to some employees covering
service-centric topics, professionalism and diversity at the workplace. At F J Benjamin, we also focus
significantly on on-the-job training to encourage mutual learning, as well as, sharing of knowledge
between our employees.
As F J Benjamin emerges from these challenging times, we will look into ways to improve our
employees' access to training and review the robustness of our system to ensure that our employees
acquire the right skillsets and knowledge to perform their jobs effectively.

OUR ENVIRONMENT
The Pandemic has placed issues related to
sustainability at the forefront for many
businesses and governments globally.Much of
the focus on recovery has been on long term
sustainability- including environmental
sustainability.As a business,F J Benjamin
recognises that it is important to reduce our
environmental footprint while enhancing our
adaptive capacity in taking advantage of
opportunities during times of adversity for the
sustainability of the business.
21

ENERGY AND GHG EMISSIONS
Approach
At F J Benjamin, our environmental footprint primarily stems from the use of electricity at our
retailstores, warehouses and offices. We constantly monitor the energy use within our facilities to
ensure that there are no unnecessary consumption of energy.While we have limited control over the
lighting and infrastructure of the stores we manage, we recognise that an avenue to manage our
energy use is through inculcating the right habits in our employees.F J Benjamin has implemented
several initiatives - switching off office lights during lunch period and when not in use after office
hours, placing reminders in our stores to remind employees of mindful energy consumption and
harnessing of teleconferencing technology at our offices to reduce need for air travel.
Performance
In FY2020, the Group used a total 2,507,401 KWh of energy which produced 1,509,246 Kg CO2 in
scope 2 emissions. This was a 19% decrease in energy use compared to the previous report period
This decrease was primarily attributed to the temporary closure of our stores in Singapore and
Malaysia in line with the regulations set by the government during the year to curb spread of Covid-19.
The increase in energy and emissions intensities are due to a decrease in the total floor area of
operations in FY2020

APPENDIXA:
ENVIRONMENTAL DATA
QUANTIFICATION METHODOLOGY
This section explains the calculation boundaries,methodologies
and assumptions used in the computation of F J Benjamin
energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Reporting Scope and Period
F J Benjamin adopts the Operational Control Approach,as outlined in the
GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, is used to determine organisational
boundaries.This attributes accountability for 100% of the GHG emissions
from operations over which the organisation has control.
Data for energy and GHG emissions consumption from the following
reporting periods have been included in the Sustainability Report FY2020
FY2019:1July 2018 to 30 June 2019
FY2020:1July2019 to 30 June2020
Energy and Carbon Intensity
Electricity consumption covers usage at our offices,warehouses and stores
in Singapore and Malaysia. Intensity metrics are calculated relative to
effective Gross Floor Area(GFA),expressed as kWh/sq m.
GHG emissions
Scope 2 emissions are calculated from the consumption of grid electricity
in Singapore and Malaysia,expressed in tonnes of CO2.
Emission Factors
Scope 2:Emission factors for the calculation of electricity consumption are
taken from the Energy Market Authority(EMA) for Singapore (0.4085 kg
CO2/KWh)and the Institute of Global Environmental Strategies(IGES)for
Malaysia(0.6448 kg CO2/KWh)
