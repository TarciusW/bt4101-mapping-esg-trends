OUR APPROACH



TO SUSTAINABILITY

At Cordlife, we believe considerations for ESG risks and opportunities will enable us to create value for our stakeholders in 

the long run. Guided by ESG factors that are most relevant to our business and stakeholders, we have formulated four key 

pillars that are imperative to our business sustainability.









Our business is 

rooted on governance 

excellence to be the 

one right choice for 

our customers. We 

uphold the utmost 

standards of integrity 

in our business and 

proactively monitor 

key risks to ensure 

business continuity.

Our business is built 

on the trust of our 

customers and we 

endeavour to meet 

their needs. We do 

so by safeguarding 

their privacy, by 

ensuring excellence 

in quality and by 

proactively engaging 

them through 

various channels 

and initiatives.

Our employees 

are instrumental 

to the success of 

our business. We 

work to safeguard 

our employees’ 

health and safety 

by providing a 

safe working 

environment.

We pay attention to 

the resources our 

operations require 

and we aim to do 

our part to minimise 

the environmental 

impact our 

operations may 

cause.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

Guided by the GRI Standards’ Materiality Principle, we conducted a materiality assessment to identify and prioritise the 

material ESG factors that are significant to our business and key stakeholders. We have taken a three-step approach to 

the materiality assessment process as shown below:

The following sources were considered in the process of identifying potential material ESG factors:

•	

ESG issues and trends pertinent to the healthcare industry

•	

ESG issues and concerns as identified by our peers

•	

Risks that most affect our operations and success

A total of 10 material ESG factors have been identified from the assessment, which has been reviewed and approved by 

the Board.

We will continue to review the list of material ESG factors annually to ensure their pertinence and priority to our business 

and our key stakeholders.

BEING THE ONE



RIGHT CHOICE

As a pioneer in private cord blood banking in Asia, we are 

committed to being the one right choice for our customers 

because they have only one chance to preserve their babies’ 

cord blood, cord lining and cord tissue. We uphold the 

utmost standards for compliance with laws and regulations, 

management of our operations and facilities and we adopt 

a forward-looking approach to understanding our markets 

in order to continue being the dependable choice for our 

customers. 

All of our policies and guidelines are developed and 

constantly being enhanced to comply with the relevant 

regulations. As a clinical laboratory licensed under the 

Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics (“PHMC”) Act by 

the Ministry of Health Singapore (“MOH”), all standard 

operating procedures (“SOPs”) for our work activities are 

in strict adherence to the code of standards as stipulated 

in the Act. Our Human Resources (“HR”) policies, including 

our Employee Handbook, are prepared in accordance with 

the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) Employment Act.

All our employees must adhere to company policies and 

guidelines and conduct business responsibly. Our Code 

of Conduct stipulates behaviours expected from our 

employees. Induction and on-the-job training related to 

regulations are conducted for all new employees upon 

commencement of their employment. A Whistleblowing 

Policy has also been put in place to provide well-defined 

and accessible channels for employees to raise concerns 

on matters relating to incident of improper conduct. 

We review our SOPs and related documents as well as 

conduct internal audits systematically on critical business 

functions, such as laboratory and operations every 

year to ensure strict adherence to the latest regulatory 

requirements. We also conduct quarterly quality training 

to keep our employees updated on the latest regulatory 

requirements. 

Any deviations from the stipulated processes and 

regulatory standards are captured in our Corrective and 

Preventive Action (“CAPA”) system, which serves as a 

centralised monitoring and recording platform to ensure 

that responsibilities and tasks are assigned to the relevant 

cross-functional team of process owners involved. Through 

our CAPA process, root cause analysis is performed and 

the final action plan is documented, executed and verified 

to prevent recurrence of the non-conforming issues. 

We have migrated our CAPA system online to facilitate 

continuous monitoring and automation of the entire CAPA 

process so that our team can address issues in real-time. 

As operational excellence can help to reduce administrative 

and operational costs, information recorded in our CAPA 

system also serves as operational intelligence. This 

real-time monitoring of non-conformances allows us to 

implement additional preventive actions efficiently to reduce 

compliance issues and streamline work flows for better 

operational efficiency throughout our facilities. 

In 2020, we have successfully completed a rigorous on-site 

inspection by MOH auditors. At the end of the inspection, 

we were determined to be in full compliance with the 

regulations under the PHMC Act and our licence was 

renewed in January 2021.

RIGHT CHOICE

2019 PERFORMANCE

2020 TARGETS

Patient safety is of utmost importance to us as our customers 

may need to use their stored cord blood, cord lining and/or 

cord tissue for medical treatment in the future. Therefore, we 

are committed to putting quality measures in place to safeguard 

our customers’ biological samples under our care until the unit 

is released for transplantation or infusion.

We adhere to internationally recognised best practices and 

stringent protocols. We also undergo voluntary accreditation by 

AABB and FACT, two of the leading international authoritative 

bodies that accredit organisations in the field of cellular therapy 

and transfusion medicine. These accreditations are testament 

to our unwavering commitment to quality. All of our policies 

and procedures, especially SOPs for critical operations of 

collection, processing, storage and release of cord blood, are 

in compliance with the standards set by these accreditation 

bodies. Our SOPs are reviewed and updated regularly to ensure 

continued compliance with the latest regulatory standards, 

accreditation standards and industry best practices. We have 

also conducted quarterly quality training in FY2020 to keep our 

employees updated on any change in our processes, policies 

or controls, relating to regulatory or standard changes.

We take our commitment to 

safeguard our customers’ cord 

blood, cord lining and cord 

tissue very seriously to uphold 

the trust our customers have 

placed in us. Our storage facility 

at A’Posh Bizhub has passed 

stringent audits conducted by 

MOH, AABB2 and FACT3. Our 

2 Formerly known as American Association of Blood Banks, AABB is an 

international, not-for-profit association representing individuals and organisations 

involved in transfusion and cell transplantation medicine.

3 The Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT), also a non- 

profit corporation, is the leader in international standards for cellular therapy, 

used in Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

SECURITY OF STORAGE FACILITIES

PRODUCT QUALITY AND RELIABILITY

laboratory is equipped with fire retardant walls and multiple 

backup systems to ensure uninterrupted operation at all times. 

Our storage tanks are designed to maintain optimal cryogenic 

storage temperatures for cell storage over long periods.

Access to the laboratory and storage areas are strictly controlled. 

Our Quality Manual for Safety and Facility Management and 

relevant SOPs dictate access restriction for specific areas of our 

facility. Each of our employee’s scope of access is determined 

by their roles in the company and the access system is updated 

immediately whenever there are movements in staff. The access 

authorisation list is also reviewed annually. Our storage tanks 

are monitored 24 hours a day year-round and are inspected 

on a monthly basis. Our laboratory and storage areas are also 

installed with CCTV to reinforce our monitoring efforts.

We have established laboratory SOPs and disaster recovery 

plans to ensure the security of our customers’ biological samples 

in the event of an emergency or disaster. All departments are 

required to create their respective disaster recovery plan for 

all identified disaster scenarios with varying levels of severity. 

Briefings of disaster recovery plans are conducted for all new 

staff with respect to their scope of work and responsibilities. 

We also conduct disaster recovery simulation testing annually 

to evaluate the robustness of the disaster recovery plans and 

our effectiveness in managing the simulated disaster scenarios.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020


As external stakeholders play a key role in executing part of 

our critical operations, we have established SOPs to ensure 

the same level of quality is being upheld. For instance, 

we have created SOPs that define trainings required 

for healthcare professionals as they are responsible for 

the collection of cord blood, cord lining, cord tissue and 

maternal blood samples. Regular training is provided for 

these healthcare professionals at the hospitals to reinforce 

their understanding and knowledge of their responsibilities 

during the collection of the biological samples. We 

continually monitor the competency level and performance 

of healthcare professionals to determine if re-training is 

necessary. We also conduct training annually for nursing 

staff and caregivers at all our collaborating hospitals.

We have developed a supplier management SOP that 

defines the procedure to qualify, review and select 

suppliers so as to ensure that we only work with qualified 

and reliable vendors. Stricter qualification requirements are 

applied to critical suppliers as they supply materials that 

can directly affect the quality of our products or services.  

Supplier reviews are performed annually to ensure our 

master list of approved suppliers is up-to-date and they 

continue to meet our standards.

 

As we believe all departments play a part in upholding 

product and service quality, they are required to establish 

their respective quality objectives for the financial year. 

Performance against quality objectives is tracked in the 

monthly quality report and discussed at the monthly quality 

meeting. Quality-related issues or any deviation from SOPs 

are recorded in the CAPA system to ensure corrective and 

preventive actions are implemented accordingly.

Shift in demographic trends, such as stagnant or 

decreasing birth rates, not only affect demand for our 

products and services, but also indicate potential shift in 

our customers’ needs. As such, we monitor demographic 

trends of our operational locations proactively through our 

risk management process to anticipate how we can better 

serve our customers to meet their needs. 

We assess and review our risk matrix for key risks annually. 

Demographic shift is one of the risks assessed and 

monitored. Our account managers collect and review birth 

rate data on a monthly basis, and our market intelligence 

team collates and monitors demographic data and 

intelligence on a quarterly basis. Trends and shifts in birth 

rate and demographic structure are reviewed and discussed 

to gain insights into potential shift in market, which serve 

as basis for us to adjust our strategies and tactics in 

approaching the market. Our corporate team leverages 

these trends to identify suitable healthcare products and 

services that can add value to the customers.

OUR CUSTOMERS

Our customers entrust us with sensitive personal information 

and we are committed to protecting their privacy. We 

have established a Privacy Policy in accordance with the 

Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”). The 

Policy outlines how we collect, store, use, transfer and 

manage our customers’ personal data4. All our contracts 

and lead acquisition programmes contain confidentiality 

terms to assure customers and prospects that their personal 

information is safeguarded. To ensure that our employees 

and our business partners uphold the same standards, we 

have included confidentiality obligations in employment 

contracts for our employees and service agreements for 

suppliers and third-party service providers.

In tandem with our policy and guidelines for customer 

privacy, we regularly monitor internal access to personal 

information and the effectiveness of our Information 

Technology (“IT”) system in protecting the personal data 

that we possess. We designate and restrict user access 

roles for our employees, which are reviewed annually, to 

mitigate the risk of excessive data access. We conduct IT 

general control (“ITGC”) audits annually to verify the integrity 

of the data and processes that our IT system supports. 

Our security software undergoes patch management 

monthly to address any vulnerability that could be exploited 

by hackers. The security of our servers is also reviewed 

regularly to ensure no breach of data.

Our mission is to provide reliable healthcare solutions through innovation, technological advancement and commitment to 

quality. We value the trust that our customers have placed in us, and we care for our customers by protecting their personal 

data, continuously engaging them, and keeping them informed on developments in stem cell utility.

network firewall, penetration tests for our web application 

and network. All risks identified during the checks have 

been addressed and fixed. We also provide periodic 

phishing awareness training for our employees to enhance 

our security awareness.

Furthermore, we conduct regular training on data protection, 

security awareness and risk management to ensure our 

employees understand relevant guidelines and impart good 

practices for handling personal data. During the year, our 

internal auditors also reviewed our business processes to 

evaluate the efficacy of our risk management procedures.  

To capture feedback related to data confidentiality, we 

have designated a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) for our 

customers to reach out to. All complaints and incidents 

related to customer privacy breach are logged into our 

CAPA system to ensure corrective and preventive actions 

are carried out to prevent similar incidents from recurring.

At Cordlife, customer satisfaction is regularly evaluated 

and monitored at several operational stages and customer 

touchpoints to ensure that we are meeting the needs of 

our customers. External stakeholders, including healthcare 

professionals are also surveyed regularly to assess their 

satisfaction level with various aspects of our operations. We 

implement a suite of satisfaction surveys to gather feedback 

from our key stakeholder groups, including customers and 

business partners. These surveys seek to acquire a better 

understanding of the perception and service journey of our 

stakeholders so that we can improve our service standards 

accordingly.

The results of the customer satisfaction surveys are 

reviewed at the monthly customer-centric meeting. All 

departments in direct contact with customers and external 

stakeholders are required to set and meet the respective 

Customer Delight Index (“CDI”) metrics and targets, 

which include target rating for the customer satisfaction 

surveys. Additionally, customer feedback and complaints 

are reviewed at the meeting to identify potential areas for 

improvement. The monthly customer-centric meetings 

seek to improve service provision standards across all 

departments for both our internal and external customers.

Other than establishing various customer feedback 

channels, we also conduct customer nurturing initiatives 

to engage and strengthen our relationship with customers. 

These initiatives include offering discounted paediatric 

vision screening, sending birthday cards and birthday 

vouchers as well as furnishing educational materials and

2021 TARGETS

•	 Continue to

utility of stem cells and 

ensure follow-up plans 

are carried out

Enhancing awareness and understanding of stem cell 

applications is one key way we engage with and care for 

our customers. We believe in keeping our prospective and 

existing customers informed so that they are aware of the 

potential treatments, which may be useful for them or their 

loved ones.

We provide regular updates on stem cell applications to our 

prospective and existing customers through the following 

channels:

•	

Weekly updates on cord blood, cord lining and cord 

tissue banking related news and other services via 

digital platforms

•	

Quarterly updates on stem cell utility development and 

relevant industry news

•	

Virtual events and seminars

In FY2020, we held 21 outreach initiatives with expectant 

parents to raise awareness about the benefits of stem cell 

banking and other related services. Most of these initiatives 

were conducted online due to the restrictions caused 

by COVID-19. At the same time, we continued to forge 

strategic partnerships with corporate entities by organising 

talks to introduce our services and offer corporate rates to 

their employees.

Furthermore, we engage with healthcare professionals 

through various initiatives to keep them abreast on the 

latest developments relevant to the products and services 

they are working with:

•	

Regular stem cell related topics for hospital staff

•	

Regular updates and detailing aids on latest white 

papers for doctors

•	

Annual or semi-annual medical education consisting of 

educational talks on topics related to stem cell utility or 

related Cordlife services for doctors

•	

Partnerships with hospital caregivers and medical 

institutions to conduct clinical trials to increase the 

applications of stem cells

We also hold similar educational talks and trainings within 

our company to keep our employees updated.

All of our external engagement activities are monitored 

for their effectiveness in key message delivery and reach 

to our targeted stakeholders. Digital outreach activities 

are evaluated by reports on prospect return rates. Our 

marketing and marketing intelligence departments tabulate 

prospect and lead surveys and analyse survey responses. 

We also obtain feedback from hospital caregivers regarding 

the educational initiatives we have provided. These results 

are discussed at our weekly taskforce meeting to help 

fine-tune our approach and tactics to further promote the 

awareness of stem cell banking.

CARING FOR



OUR EMPLOYEES

Our employees are the foundation of our business. 

We uphold the highest standards in ensuring that they 

are adequately trained and have a safe environment to 

work in.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

To ensure a safe working environment for our employees, 

especially our laboratory personnel, we have established 

policies and SOPs to manage occupational risks and safety. 

As stipulated in our Employee Handbook, we require all 

laboratory personnel to be vaccinated for Hepatitis B before 

they are allowed to work in the laboratory. Our Safety Manual 

encompasses the safety aspect of laboratory operations. 

We also have SOPs that stipulate the safety measures for 

specific work procedures, such as the handling of liquid 

nitrogen and any spillage, as well as the relevant first aid 

measures.

Our Safety Committee oversees and regularly reviews risk 

assessments and safety-related issues, and updates the 

Safety Manual as necessary. Our risk assessment team 

and safety team are responsible for the implementation 

of risk assessments and safety exercises. 

Safety incidents are reported in the monthly quality meeting 

for review and logged into our CAPA system to ensure 

that corrective and preventive actions are implemented. 

Additionally, any case of needle prick incident is to be 

reported to MOM accordingly and follow-up checks as well 

as medical reviews are to be performed.

Other than putting relevant governance mechanisms and 

policies in place, we also conduct trainings to prevent 

accidents from occurring. Risk assessment plans and 

safety instructions are introduced to all employees during 

induction training. All trainings completed are recorded, 

reviewed and endorsed by the respective heads of 

departments. Laboratory personnel are trained on the 

safety aspects of their work during on-the-job training, 

which are recorded and reviewed. In FY2020, we have 

also conducted relevant safety courses for our safety team, 

including risk assessment training to help them identify 

hazards, evaluate risks and implement appropriate risk 

control measures in our day-to-day operational activities. 

We will continue to conduct relevant safety courses for new 

members of the Safety Committee in the coming year.











































































































































FY2021, we aim to maintain the record of zero health and safety incidents at our workplace.

CARING FOR



THE ENVIRONMENT

We are mindful of the environmental impact of our business and we are committed to doing our part by reducing our 

GHG emissions.

We conduct regular and timely maintenance for all our 

equipment, laboratories and electrical facilities to ensure 

that they are in optimal working condition and continue to 

be energy efficient. We also monitor our facilities’ electricity 

consumption on a monthly basis to identify abnormal spikes 

or increase in usage trends so that we can analyse, investigate 

and remediate any possible inefficient use of energy.

10 Diesel consumption is computed based on the amount of diesel consumed by our emergency generator during its 10-minute annual  

    maintenance exercise. During the annual maintenance, the generator runs at 100% Prime Running Power (PRP) setting, which consumes  

    0.377 litre of diesel per minute.

11 Conversion factor to kWh is derived from 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

12  GHG emissions for diesel consumption are computed based on emission factor derived from 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse

   Gas Inventories and GHG emissions for electricity consumption are computed based on electricity grid emission factor published in  

    Singapore Energy Statistics 2018.

EMISSIONS

Energy supply is key to our business continuity. We work to 

ensure that our operations are energy efficient and resilient 

to outages. As such, our Code of Conduct requires all 

employees to participate in environmental conservation 

and that all facilities as well as equipment are used in the 

most energy efficient manner.
