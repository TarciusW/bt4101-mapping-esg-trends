CHAIRMAN WELCOME

 2 BUMITAMA AGRI LTD. • SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

Dear friends and partners,

It gives me great pleasure to 

introduce our second sustainability 

report, which covers the financial 

years 2015 and 2016.

Our first report was launched 

simultaneously with our Sustainability 

Policy, which set out our focus areas 

and ambitions, and committed us to 

the objectives of no deforestation, no 

peat and no exploitation in line with 

leading peers in our industry. This 

report provides an overview of our 

progress, successes and challenges 

in implementing this policy.

It has always been my personal 

view that Bumitama should be 

a good citizen in the region and 

country where we operate, and 

contribute to the greater global 

goal of looking after our planet. 

But we must also provide people 

with good livelihoods and respect 

the rights and aspirations of both 

our own employees and our local 

communities. It is a critical part of 

my vision for the company that we 

are a force for prosperity, providing 

opportunities for the people who are 

affected by our operations and on 

whose support we will always rely.

We cannot achieve these objectives 

without strong business performance. 

I am therefore pleased to report 

that we have received tremendous 

feedback on our progress from 

our commercial partners. Our 

increasingly focused approach to 

sustainability has been welcomed 

by our main customers, as well as 

by analysts and bankers. I also think 

that our improved transparency 

and accountability is helping us 

to become more visible in the 

marketplace and has strengthened 

our credibility and engagement with 

the financial community. In 2016, we 






BUMITAMA AGRI LTD. • SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016      3 

received seven Asiamoney Awards 

in the following categories: Best 

Managed Company in Singapore – 

Small Cap, Overall Best Company 

in 

Singapore 

for 

Corporate 

Governance, Best Disclosure and 

Transparency, Best for Shareholders’ 

Rights and Equitable Treatment, Best 

for Responsibilities of Management 

and the Board of Directors, Best 

for Investor Relations in Singapore 

and Best for Corporate Social 

Responsibility in Singapore.

The support we have received 

from civil society has also been 

encouraging. Building relationships 

with NGOs enables us to initiate 

bigger projects and deliver a greater 

positive impact. Over the past years, 

we have become more involved in 

conservation projects and have 

successfully partnered with both 

NGOs and governments. We are 

now excited to be embarking on 

an ambitious project that will see 

around 8,000 hectares set-aside for 

peat conservation, orangutan habitat 

as well as local community initiatives. 

I am also excited to announce that we 

are looking to expand our initiatives 

relating to children’s protection and 

education in partnership with a major 

children’s protection organisation.

Sustainability is a journey, and we 

are still working to improve our 

performance in many areas. One of 

the most difficult issues for us has 

been the constant quest to prevent 

and control fires in and around our 

operations. We have seen how badly 

fires affect people all over the region, 

causing health problems and putting 

lives at risk, and it is a priority for us 

to put in place every safeguard at 

our disposal. I believe we have made 

some progress in this area, but the 

issue will remain on our radar in the 

years to come.

Another big, albeit more positive, 

challenge is our determination to 

make the most of our current land 

holdings. We cannot keep growing 

in hectarage at our current rate: we 

need to invest in maintaining and 

improving what we have. We know 

that oil palm has the potential for 

much higher productivity. Our focus 

will therefore be on achieving better 

yields and extraction rates through 

significant investment in R&amp;D, 

including tissue culture, and through 

good agricultural practices.

We remain firmly committed to 

the Roundtable on Sustainable 

Palm Oil (RSPO) and to ensuring 

that all of our operations adhere to 

the RSPO Principles and Criteria 

(P&amp;C) and New Planting Procedure 

(NPP). We are deeply engaged in 

the 2018 revision process, which 

seeks to adjust the P&amp;C to reflect 

experience on the ground as well as 

the latest research and knowledge. 

From our perspective, this is a 

positive process, but also fraught 

with difficulties. I am concerned 

that processes such as the NPP 

are becoming increasingly complex 

and can now take up to a year to 

complete. This presents a very real 

risk that committed companies will 

walk away from many potential 

development opportunities, leaving 

vast land holdings to be taken 

over and developed by companies 

with either no – or very weak – 

sustainability commitments.

I am personally very happy with the 

progress that has been made here 

at Bumitama. I believe that we have 

come a long way in building valuable 

partnerships with civil society, 

continuing our strong engagement 

with communities and strengthening 

our relations with local government 

and business partners. The efforts of 

our internal team have been critical 

in achieving these successes, and I 

would like to thank each and every 

team member for their hard work. 

We look forward to continuing our 

journey and hearing feedback from 

all of our stakeholders.

Assurance statement

Bumitama Agri was one of the first 

oil palm growers in Southeast Asia 

to adopt a No Deforestation, No 

Peat and No Exploitation policy. 

Implementing such policy whilst 

developing and acquiring new land 

bank represents a major challenge. 

I 

congratulate 

the 

company’s 

management and its sustainability 

team for having made major strides 

forward despite numerous challenges.

Loosely referenced against GRI 

Standards’ Reporting Principles, 

I 

value 

Bumitama’s 

second 

sustainability report for offering 

adequate insight in its journey, which 

concerns many different aspects of 

sustainability that continue to evolve 

every day moreover.

Sustainability context is adequately 

provided, also bearing in mind that 

most stakeholders involved in the 

palm oil sustainability discourse are 

deeply familiar with the issues at 

hand. I hope that many among them 

will read this report: the company’s 

sustainability work deserves more 

recognition than it receives.

When it launched its sustainability 

policy in August 2015, Bumitama 

committed the Landscape Approach, 

one of the first palm oil growers 

to do so. With this approach, the 

company promotes conservation 

and sustainable development within 

the wider landscape surrounding 

its plantations in collaboration with 

other stakeholders. The company’s 

area set-aside for conservation 

nearly doubled during the reporting 

period. If the peat forest in Sungai 

Putri is included, then Bumitama’s 

conservation 

areas 

encompass 

some 36,500 hectares of carbon-rich 

ABOUT THE REVIEWER

Eric Wakker is Director of 

Corporate Sustainability at 

Aidenvironment Asia. He and 

his team partnered up with 

Bumitama Agri in May 2014 

at the invitation of Mr. Lim 

Gunawan Hariyanto. This 

assurance statement thus 

represents a second party 

point of view.

REPORT REVIEW: ERIC WAKKER






BUMITAMA AGRI LTD. • SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016      5 

natural forest and peat in West and 

Central Kalimantan. The company 

engages the local government and 

communities to create consensus 

over conservation and sustainable 

land use through Village-Level 

Land Use Plans. It works with the 

same stakeholders in and near its 

plantations to reduce fire outbreak 

and flooding, and it supports villagers’ 

food security, education and business 

development. This is not to mention 

the group’s support to smallholders, 

who supply over half of FFB milled 

and whom represent 26% of the 

group’s land bank, well beyond the 

government target. These are all 

impressive deliveries, many of which 

were realised just recently.

Materiality is satisfactory. The 

report addresses most stakeholder 

expectations, 

at 

general 

level 

and those related to Bumitama 

specifically. It is important to realise 

that stakeholder expectations in 

the palm oil industry are particularly 

wide ranging and the performance 

bar is continuously raised. Bumitama 

remains one of the few ‘pure growers’ 

that have committed themselves to 

implement, throughout the group, the 

most ambitious sustainability policies 

in the market, whilst still developing 

greenfields.

At one level, quantitative insight is 

given into the overwhelming range of 

auditing and certification ‘hoops’ that 

growers are expected to jump through 

(RSPO, ISCC, ISPO, ISO), whilst the 

company works to implement its own 

ambitious sustainability policy. This 

policy, it is worth noting, is still fully in 

line with the group’s most important 

buyers’ No Deforestation purchasing 

policies.

At 

another 

level, 

this 

report 

entertains in reasonable detail some 

stakeholders’ inquiries into specific 

cases and issues of concern. The 

explanations offered may not satisfy 

all stakeholders, whom now have 

direct access to the company’s 

management, Bumitama’s grievance 

and whistle-blower mechanisms and, 

if still deemed necessary, RSPO’s 

third party complaint system.

Having an ambitious policy does not 

assure that mistakes are no more 

made or that some past practise may 

have to be corrected. Of course, it 

should also be recognised that 

the company does not operate in 

isolation of other stakeholders who 

pursue valid interests. It is not always 

possible to represent such dynamics 

in a sustainability report.

Completeness 

– 

During 

the 

drafting of this report, various gaps 

were closed so that most matters 

of interest are covered, in overview 

and in detail. The benefit of regular 

monitoring and reporting on key 

indicators is already clearer in this 

second sustainability report. In 

future, the sustainability report 

ought to provide more detail about 

the base line, notably the group’s 

estate companies and land bank. 

The company has been increasingly 

responsive to its stakeholders in 

recent years, by filing documents 

to RSPO and giving external 

presentations, issuing statements 

publicly and the like. Consequently, 

sustainability information tended to 

become increasingly scattered, which 

represents the risk that stakeholders 

may use information that is no longer 

updated or that cannot be amended 

because it is posted on websites not 

under the company’s control. The 

revamping of the company’s website 

bumitama-agri.com is therefore a 

very welcome development. This 

website ought to serve as a clearing 

house for the group’s corporate and 

sustainability information.

TARGET




Bumitama Agri Ltd (Bumitama) is a 

young producer of crude palm oil 

(CPO) and palm kernel (PK) with 

oil palm plantations in Indonesia 

supported by more than 27,000 

employees. Bumitama has a total 

planted area of 175,243 hectares 

and 8,250 hectares of infrastructure 

area across the provinces of Central 

Kalimantan, West Kalimantan and 

Riau. Around 26% of our total planted 

area is set-aside for smallholders 

under our plasma programme. We 

also own and operate 13 CPO mills 

with an annual FFB processing 

capacity of 5.04 million tonnes.

OUR BUSINESS IN BRIEF

Our 2016 revenue increased by 

19.6% to IDR 6,630 billion (IDR 5,542 

billion in FY2015), with profit before 

tax growing 51.3% to IDR 1,516 

billion (IDR 1,002 billion in FY2015). 

This strong performance was driven 

by higher CPO and PK selling prices 

as well as increased production of 

CPO and PK.

We continue to explore opportunities 

to expand our land bank. However, 

we understand that appropriate land is 

a very limited resource and, given our 

commitments to avoid development 

on peat and High Carbon Stock 

(HCS) and High Conservation Value 

(HCV) landscapes, we recognise that 

our options are limited. Enhancing 

the productivity of our existing land 

through improvements in yields and 

extraction rates is therefore a priority 

for the future growth of our business.

Our agronomists are working together 

with the Research, Quality Control 

and Engineering Department on 

various means to increase yields, oil 

content and bunch weight. We do not 

use any genetically modified planting 

materials, but look to high-yielding 

seed to boost productivity.

Prolonged and severe dry weather 

in 2014 and 2015 affected yields 

and resulted in a significant drop in 

productivity in 2016. However, we 

believe that there is a positive outlook 

for 2017 as rainfall has increased 

across our production areas. We 

forecast a 15% increase in internal 

production volume for 2017.

SUPPLIERS AND TRACEABILITY TO PLANTATION

BUMITAMA AGRI LTD. • SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016      11 



We kick-started the first phase of 

the FFB traceability initiative in 2016, 

mapping the entire supplier base of 

our CPO mills based on purchase 

documents. We will follow up with 

the collection of additional information 

on our third party suppliers that 

will provide us with more accurate 

and detailed data for analysis and 

verification as we closely monitor our 

supply chain partners.

The initial socialisation of our No 

Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation 

Bumitama is an exclusive upstream 

producer. Our main FFB suppliers 

are cultivators that deliver fruit to our 

mills. There are three types of FFB 

supplier: associated smallholders 

working under a plasma scheme, 

larger outgrowers without a mill of 

their own or with excess fruit, and 

independent smallholders (defined as 

growers with less than 50 hectares 

of plantings). Most external fruit is 

delivered directly by smallholders 

and outgrowers. A small proportion 

is handled by FFB traders.

We have set a target date of December 

2017 to ensure that all FFB processed 

by our certified mills is traceable to our 

own estates and associated plasma 

schemes, and that all purchased FFB 

is documented and verified as being 

from legal and responsible sources. 

Achieving this important milestone 

will create greater transparency in 

our supply chain and, in the process, 

decouple our products from the risk 

of deforestation and exploitation. We 

are targeting to complete traceability 

of FFB of all mills by the end of 2018.

Policy (NDPE) policy and a growing 

awareness of the importance of ensuring 

legality and traceability has resulted in a 

pooling of interested smallholders into 

cooperatives or groups for productivity 

improvement, legality and certification 

projects in 2017.

We are also building our existing 

team to explain and socialise our 

policies among FFB suppliers. The 

team will reach out to independent 

smallholders, 

outgrowers 

and 

traders to help them understand 

how the traceability process works 

and how they can ensure that their 

fruit remains acceptable to us. The 

timeline to socialise has taken longer 

than anticipated, mainly because the 

initial programme of outsourcing this 

project was put on hold.

CUSTOMERS

All of our palm oil is sold domestically 

to refineries that convert CPO into 

a broad variety of refined products 

used in foods, oleo-chemicals and 

biofuels. Our mills do not have kernel 

crushers, so we sell our palm kernels 

to local crushing plants that process 

them into palm kernel oil (PKO). PKO 

is primarily used in the manufacture 

of personal care, household and 

confectionary products. We currently 

trade our RSPO-certified palm oil 

(Mass Balance) through the RSPO 

certificate trading system. As the 

proportion of our RSPO-certified CPO 

increases, we will consider setting up 

segregated mills.




 12 BUMITAMA AGRI LTD. • SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

Our vision is to be a world-class 

palm oil producer in terms of 

product quality, productivity and 

sustainability. Our mission is to 

seamlessly integrate sustainability 

into all aspects of plantation 

management and our long-term 

business strategy (4P: People, 

Planet, Product and Profit).

Operating principally as a grower 

in Indonesia, we appreciate that 

the palm oil industry can and must 

deliver on sustainability beyond the 

legal minimum in order to address 

legitimate concerns over the links 

between oil palm cultivation and 

deforestation, climate change and 

social injustice.

We launched our first comprehensive 

Sustainability Policy (SP) in 2015. 

This sets out our overall principles 

and commitments to produce palm 

oil sustainably and responsibly.

Our policy covers:

Forest 

conservation 

and 

sustainable land use: No peat; 

protection of High Conservation 

Values (HCV) and High Carbon 

Stock (HCS) landscapes; reduction 

of chemical fertiliser and pesticide 

usage; elimination of paraquat; and 

prevention of fire.

Respect for local community 

rights: Recognition of Free, Prior 

and Informed Consent (FPIC); efforts 

towards sustainable economic 

development models; and fair, 

transparent 

and 

accountable 

partnerships 

with 

plasma 

smallholders.

Respect for human rights in 

the workplace: Recognition of 

International Labour Organization 

(ILO) core conventions and the 

United Nations (UN) Universal 

Declaration on Human Rights, 

including a ban on forced and child 

labour, elimination of discrimination, 

provision of fair wages and working 

hours, and respect for freedom of 

association; the provision of a healthy 

and safe working environment; and 

ethical conduct, including efforts to 

eliminate corruption.

SUSTAINABILITY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION

Traceability and responsible 

sourcing: Tracking and monitoring 

land development in sensitive areas; 

ensuring that all FFB processed 

is traceable to our own estates,

ENVIRONMENT

BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION

NEW PLANTINGS AND 

DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORKS

We follow best practices in our land 

use planning procedure to avoid 

impacting existing ecosystems. All 

new developments must adhere 

to the RSPO NPP and undergo 

High Conservation Value (HCV) 

assessments, 

Social 

Impact 

Assessments (SIA) and High Carbon 

Stock (HCS) Approach assessments. 

Peat delineation tests and land 

cover, land use and land use change 

analyses must also be completed 

to identify locations with HCV, 

HCS and peat. These assessments 

and analyses provide guidance for 

developing planting plans for our new 

concessions to ensure that HCV, 

HCS and peat land are not planted 

with oil palm. We regularly monitor 

these sensitive areas through the use 

of the GIS data of the new plantings 

superimposed over the map of no-go 

areas, to ensure that we are alerted 

to potential risks of planting in our 

set-aside areas.

NPPs are posted for stakeholder 

consultation on the RSPO website, 

and our HCV assessments are 

undertaken in compliance with the 

HCV Resource Network Assessor 

Licensing Scheme (HCV RN) since 

early 2016. All newly acquired 

concessions with areas for planting 

like 

IKB, 

KBAS3, 

GMS 

and 

recently RSM have been reviewed 

or are undergoing review by HCV 

RN. We are also committed to 

following the HCS Approach peer 

review process, and have recently 

submitted our first assessment for 

review, GMS (brownfield acquisition). 

The assessment was conducted in 

2016 and covered 5,190 hectares, 

of which 1,473 hectares (28.4%) 

of the total area are set-aside for 

conservation as it contained either 

HCVs, peat and/or was classified 

as HCS.

CONSERVATION INITIATIVES

With our operations located in 

the midst of Indonesia’s rich and 

immensely varied ecosystems, it is 

vital that we play a part in preserving 

and enhancing the landscapes in 

which we operate. We do not and 

will not operate within protected 

areas and national parks, and we 

seek to protect and enhance the 

population of species deemed 

critically endangered, endangered 

or vulnerable under national laws 

of Indonesia and the IUCN Red 

List. We also ban hunting in all 

of our concessions and engage 

with communities to refrain from 

hunting of threatened species in 

the surrounding areas. In addition, 

Bumitama actively consults, invites 

participation from and engages with 

NGOs and local communities in 

our landscape planning processes, 

recognising that their invaluable 

insights will allow us to better identify 

cultural HCVs and local biodiversity.

In an effort to further support our 

wildlife conservation endeavours 

and to determine the density and 

distribution of orangutans in the 

PT Damai Agro Sejahtera (DAS) 

concession in the east of the Sungai 

Putri forest block, we have conducted 

a survey in partnership with YIARI 

(Yayasan International Animal Rescue 

Indonesia). Besides assessing the 

distribution of orangutans, our 

partnership will also comprise of 

development of conservation plans 

and Best Management Practices. We 

expect to expand this initiative in 

2017, to cover further areas within 

our PT Gemilang Makmur Subur 

(GMS) concession. This conservation 

initiative is a very large and daunting 

project to undertake where things 

can easily go wrong; it is therefore 

important to learn, understand and 

put up a plan to cover the scope and 

breadth of biodiversity management.

WILDLIFE PROTECTION  

AND ENHANCEMENT IN  

WEST KALIMANTAN

PT Gemilang Makmur Subur (GMS) 

is a management unit located 

in the Ketapang district of West 

Kalimantan, that was purchased by 

Bumitama on 13 September 2016. 

Although the larger part of this area 

was previously opened and planted 

by its previous owners, the elevated 

concern for the remaining forest 

land, constant threats of fire and 

consideration for local communities 

prompted the acquisition (although 

Bumitama had previously in August 

2014 terminated the management 

contract due to significant concerns 

raised over the environmental and 

legal permits relating to the land by 

international NGOs and our financial 

institutions).

In accordance with our Sustainability 

policy and RSPO Principle &amp; Criteria, 

we have conducted HCV and HCS 

assessments of the area prior to the 

acquisition. The results indicated that 

the majority of the unplanted area 

could serve as an interconnection 

link between the Sungai Putri peat 

swamp forest, the Protected Forest 

of Gunung Tarak and the Gunung 

Palung National Park.

To address these threats, we have 

launched the Bumitama Biodiversity 

and Community Project (BBCP). 

Co-funded with IDH, the Sustainable 

Trade Initiative and project managed 

by Aidenvironment (AE), BBCP 

combines wildlife protection with 

sustainable production as part of 

a collaborative and landscape-

based approach to ensuring that 

plantations, 

communities 

and 

biodiverse ecosystems can coexist. 

Initiated in October 2016 under 

IDH’s Initiative for Sustainable 

Landscapes (ISLA) programme, with 

a total budget of EUR 1.1 million 

(IDR 17.3 billion), the first phase of 

BBCP is scheduled to run for at least 

three years. Its main focus will be 

the Sungai Putri peatlands and the 

Gunung Tarak forest.

The BBCP’s first goal is the 

rehabilitation and management of a 

biodiversity corridor of approximately 

1,100 

hectares 

on 

our 

GMS 

concession, which is naturally 

connected to Sungai Putri ecosystem 

and needs to be connected to 

Gunung Tarak Protected Forest. In 

2016 it came to our attention via 

Aidenvironment that a neighbouring 

company started clearing plantation 

blocks in an area which is part 

of the Sungai Putri peat dome 

forest, containing deep peat and 

high conservation values including 

Orangutan habitat. As this area is 

just next to our planned corridor, we 

have approached the owners to seek 

their participation in the conservation 

project. The company was not 

interested in conservation and an 

offer was made to Bumitama to 

acquire the company. Our acquisition 

of the neighbouring DAS enhances 

the viability of the corridor; enlarging 

the 

potential 

conservation 

by 

additional 6,500 hectares (these have 

not been included into the set-asides 

total hectarage for 2016). However, 

since some areas in DAS had been 

cleared as part of estate blocking 

exercise prior to our acquisition but 

which has stopped upon completion 

of the acquisition. We will rehabilitate 

all estate blocking opened by the 

previous owners.

We are also identifying areas for 

rehabilitation and reforestation, 

planting nurseries and training 

conservation 

teams 

and 

local 

communities to help co-manage 

the project areas. Additional fire 

management training under the 

Desa Bebas Api programme has 

been conducted in nine villages with 

another six planned for 2018.

The second objective of BBCP 

is to drive social and economic 

development. Community growth 

in the region has previously been 

restricted due to low incomes, 

inadequate infrastructure and poor 

agricultural practices – all of which 

can also have a direct or indirect 

impact on the environment. This part 

of the project has been implemented 

in partnership with Aidenvironment 

and will be regulated through village 

level land use planning for nine 

villages surrounding the corridor. 

Agreements are being negotiated to

support alternative livelihood options, 

such as the harvesting of non-timber 

forest products (NTFP), as well as 

smallholder development.

The district government is a crucial 

stakeholder in these efforts as the 

required permits for set-aside areas, 

the integration of Village-Level 

Land Use Plans and governmental 

spatial plans, as well as the ongoing 

management of the areas, depend 

on its cooperation.

REFORESTATION IN CENTRAL 

KALIMANTAN

Our ASMR operation continues its 

reforestation efforts in the buffer 

area running along the Sekonyer 

River, where 107 hectares of forest 

were burnt in 2015. A nursery of 

40,000 natural forest species has 

been established in the area, both 

for our own operations and local 

communities.

The reforestation programme is also 

well underway on the other side 

of the river in Teluk Pulai Village, 

where the local community’s concern 

about the slow erosion and retreat 

of coastal land prompted the idea 

of revitalising the mangrove area by 

reforesting an experimental plot of 

150 hectares. Mangrove ecosystems 

play an important function in 

maintaining the integrity of coastal 

areas, dampening waves and wind, 

reducing 

abrasion, 

maintaining 

nutrients for marine life and providing 

nursery grounds for fish and shrimps. 

The team has started to tag the 

seedlings to capture data that will be 

used to improve the survival rate of 

the new plantings.

ASMR assisted in cleaning the 

channels and field and securing 

additional land for food source and 

provided technical assistance as an 

advisor since end of 2015. To raise 

awareness about the importance of 

maintaining a balanced ecosystem, 

school children and even regional 

government personnel were invited 

to help in the planting and an 

alternative crop, corn will be included 

into the yearly planting programme.

With continued success, Teluk Pulai 

may even become an area of interest 

for tourists, given a rich biodiversity 

now further enhanced by a resurgent 

mangrove ecosystem.








BUMITAMA AGRI LTD. • SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016      23 





In early 2017, we received a number 

of questions from an international 

NGO with regards to the legality 

and process surrounding the 

acquisition 

of 

PT 

Langgeng 

Makmur Sejahtera (LMS) in Central 

Kalimantan. The implied allegation 

was that Bumitama had sought to 

circumvent relevant legal permit by 

means of a sale through Bumitama-

linked intermediaries who clear the 

land and subsequent reacquisition 

by Bumitama. To clarify the matter, 

we would like to outline the course 

of events.

PT Hatiprima Agro (HPA) was a 

plantation concession owned by 

Bumitama that operated in Central 

Kalimantan based on a Location 

Permit (ILOK) and Plantation 

Business Permit (IUP) issued by 

the Bupati (Regent) of Kotawaringin 

Timur in an area relinquished from 

the forested area by the decision 

of the Ministry of Forestry in 2000.

In June 2012, we were informed 

by the Bupati that the Location 

Permit of 4,810 hectares would be 

revoked. On 1 July 2012, a RSPO 

complaint was lodged against HPA. 

The revocation was based on a 

decree from the Indonesian Ministry 

of Forestry from 2008 that revoked 

the forest relinquishment issued 

to HPA. Neither Bumitama nor the 

Bupati were aware of this in 2008, 

at the time the permit was issued, 

since the Decree of Revocation was 

mistakenly sent (i) to the wrong party 

(an unrelated third party, namely PT 

Sinar Agrotani Kalimantan) instead 

of to HPA, and (ii) to the wrong local 

government (the Governor of East 

Kalimantan instead of the Governor 

of Central Kalimantan).

Bumitama only learned of this 

Ministry decision, which was based 

on the aforementioned decree of 

the Kotawaringing Timur Bupati, 

who, being equally unaware of the 

Ministry decision, renewed HPAs 

ILOK and its IUP in 2009 and 2010 

respectively.

The matter became more complex 

when in 2011, before the ILOK was 

revoked, the very same Ministry 

of Forestry had re-designated 1.2 

million hectares of land including 

the land under the ILOK of HPA 

for non-forestry purposes (APL). 

The revocation of the ILOK by the 

Bupati had therefore no basis in law 

or fact and thus Bumitama decided 

to instigate legal proceedings to 

defend its position.

After being awarded the case 

twice at Regional and High court 

level, Bumitama ultimately lost the 

trial and surrendered the permit 

but not the buildings, plants and 

other objects located on the land. 

Bumitama had no other choice but 

to sell these assets to the new 

permit holder, LMS.

Bumitama received a financial 

compensation for the assets on 

the land in form of a deposit from 

LMS. However, LMS was unable 

to pay the remaining financial 

consideration of the Conditional 

Sale &amp; Purchase agreement from 

January 2015 and had not been 

able to manage the social issues 

in LMS. Bumitama therefore agreed 

with the LMS owners to acquire 

the company with its valid ILOK 

of 4,810 hectares and IUP in June 

2016. In January 2017, Bumitama 

received Hak Guna Usaha (HGU, or 

Land Use Rights Permit), the final 

legal title of this area.

We wish to highlight that both 

HPA and its later owners, LMS, 

operated with valid permits. It is also 

worthwhile to mention that we have 

lost the legal case to the Ministry of 

Forestry, the very same institution 

that has re-zoned the land HPA sat 

on for non-forestry purposes.

Throughout the process, Bumitama 

has been transparent about the 

case to the directors, investors/

shareholders, 

regulators 

and 

auditors, as well as the RSPO and 

civil society stakeholders. We made 

several public announcements as the 

matters unfolded and have kept all 

stakeholders updated accordingly.

We are currently in the process 

of gathering information for Land 

Use Change Analysis (LUCA) for 

LMS as per the RSPO Remediation 

and Compensation Procedure. This 

area will be sanctioned for clearing 

without an appropriate NPP as per 

the new NPP of 2015.

All fires are immediately reported to 

the relevant authorities.

Precautionary measures, such as 

the mapping of concession areas 

based on the level of potential fire 

risk posed by land cover types (peat 

or mineral, clear or scrub, areas 

along the boundary neighbouring 

community farms, forest conservation 

areas and water sources), enable us 

to give special attention to fire-prone 

areas.

We have, in addition, established 

a command and control centre for 

effective communication in the event 

of an emergency; carried out routine 

patrol activities by prioritising areas 

with potential hazards or a high 

degree of vulnerability; increased 

A strict zero fire policy is enforced 

within all our operations as we 

recognise 

that 

an 

increased 

incidence of fire is a major threat to 

our productivity, to our biodiversity 

conservation efforts, as well as to the 

health and safety of our employees 

and surrounding communities. Fire 

can also cause severe haze issues 

around the Southeast-Asia region as 

smoke is carried by the wind.

In 2015, extreme drought caused 

more than a thousand hectares 

of our land to be burnt, primarily 

in planted areas. We did not 

consistently record fires outside 

of our concessions, but have now 

improved monitoring to track fires in 

more detail. In 2016, we recorded 

21 occurrences of fire of which 

five occurred inside our plantations 

(13 hectares), while the remainder 

(40 hectares) occurred in community 

lands. While the incidence of fire was 

much lower than in previous years, 

fire prevention remains a critical 

focus area at Bumitama. Our task 

force continues to establish training 

programmes and local partnerships 

to address the root causes of fire 

and encourage effective responses. 

pond water conservation by planting 

vegetation, such as bamboo, that 

prevents excessive evaporation 

(saving water reserves in the ground) 

as well as constructed ponds to 

deliberately capture rainwater; and 

improved accessibility to water 

sources throughout our operations.

To further strengthen our response 

we have partnered with Manggala 

Agni, a fire brigade under the Ministry 

of Forestry that specialises in forest 

fire prevention and control. They 

have conducted 15 training sessions 

across our operations to train a total 

of 500 Bumitama employees and 500 

people from the local community.

Some of our CSR programme 

focused on community areas that 

had fire history. Initiatives include 

lending tractors to local communities 

so they can clear land without 

burning. Some villages have received 

manual clearing tools, following 

recommendation 

by 

regional 

government offices. We have also 

established the Desa Bebas Api 

programme, which to date has 

provided 35 villages with incentives 

to implement alternative land clearing 

measures. We will expand the 

programme under the BBCP project 

(see page 21), expecting to reach 

40 villages by the end of 2017.

We recognise that climate change, 

accompanied by fluctuating weather 

patterns, poses a major risk to the 

livelihoods and safety of communities, 

to fragile ecosystems and to 

agricultural supply chains. Being 

part of the solution and mitigating 

the impact of this major challenge 

are central to our sustainability 

strategy and we remain committed 

to 

progressively 

reducing 

our 

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

To establish a baseline we used 

the RSPO PalmGHG methodology 

to estimate our 2016 GHG emissions 

at our certified plantations. In 

2016, we estimated an emissions 

intensity of 1.6 tonnes of carbon 

dioxide equivalent per tonne of CPO 

produced (1.6 MT CO2e/MT CPO), 

which we believe to be comparable 

to peers in Indonesia, based on 

publicly available disclosures.

LAND COVER STRATIFICATION 

TO MINIMISE FUTURE 

EMISSIONS

To ensure that new developments 

are planted in low carbon areas, 

we are now doing a land cover 

stratification for all new plantings 

as part of our RSPO NPP. We 

have completed two analyses 

which have both yielded negative 

carbon balance: in other words, the 

sequestration from oil palm would be 

higher than the existing vegetation.

30% of our emissions are methane 

from palm oil mill effluent (POME). 

We are looking to reduce or 

eliminate POME emissions through 

methane capture facilities, with 

a potential of converting biogas 

methane into electricity that can 

be channelled back into the local 

electricity grid. We have partnered 

with waste treatment and integrated 

power solution providers to build 

two methane capture plants, in Riau 

and Central Kalimantan and expect 

these to be completed by the end of 

2018. We estimate that each facility 

will be able to reduce the current 

emissions from POME by 90% when 

fully operational.

MAPPING AND 

RESTORATION OF PEAT 

AREAS

27% of our emissions derive 

from peat oxidation from existing 

plantings. 

We 

stand 

by 

our 

commitment to stop new plantation 

developments on peat, to restore 

peatland where possible, and to 

apply best management practices 

in existing plantings. We have made 

considerable headway in reviewing 

our land maps and soil classifications 

in the past years. A review of our 

five concessions in 2014 identified 

2,682 hectares as peat, or roughly 

5% of the area. In addition, we 

have identified 1,431 hectares of 

peat as part of our NPPs. These 

are set-aside areas now. We will 

continue these mapping exercises 

to complete an overview of peat 

areas within our concessions over 

the coming years.

We are reviewing options for 

restoring and enhancing peatlands 

in GMS and DAS; patches of areas 

which had been burnt or opened 

as part of estate blocking prior to 

planting, as part of the Bumitama 

Biodiversity and Community Project;

Integrated pest management is an 

essential part of our agricultural 

practice and we are careful to 

minimise and mitigate the impact 

of chemical pesticides on the 

environment. Our preferred method 

is to deploy biological controls, 

using beneficial plants, natural 

predators and fungal pathogens or 

bacteria, alongside handpicking and 

biological traps. No prophylactic 

treatments have been adopted into 

our integrated pest management.

We make every effort to ensure that 

workers are not directly exposed to 

pesticides. All workers are provided 

with personal protective equipment 

and are required to shower after 

each 

shift. 

Workers 

handling 

hazardous chemicals are required 

to undergo extensive training on an 

ongoing basis. Hazardous chemicals 

are kept in separate locked storage 

facilities. We ensure that pregnant 

and breastfeeding women do not 

handle or conduct any work related 

to chemical usage.

We have made a commitment to 

eliminate highly toxic and pest 

resistant pesticides. We have phased 

out paraquat dichloride in 2016, the 

herbicide that was classified under 

World Health Organization (WHO) 

Class 1, which has caused concern 

among our stakeholders due to 

potential health risks associated 

with mishandling or lack of protective 

equipment.

In rare and urgent cases when 

attacks or threats occur, we use 

small volumes of rodenticides, 

insecticides and fungicides.

As part of our focus on reducing the 

use of chemicals, we have started 

measuring toxicity levels derived 

from herbicides per planted hectare. 

The cyclical nature of plantings 

results in fluctuating toxicity levels, 

and may increase on new plantings, 

so measuring toxicity in this way 

enables us to monitor the potential 

impact of different types, volumes 

and compositions of chemicals used 

in our operations over the long term.

We have adopted an environmentally 

friendly waste management policy 

for CPO production to reduce our 

reliance on inorganic fertiliser. Empty 

Fruit Bunches (EFB) are used as 

mulch, especially for sandy soils 

to reduce soil transpiration and 

to enrich soil organic carbon. The 

nutrients contributed from EFB 

enhance the productivity of palms. 

In future we have plans for partial 

composting of empty fruit bunch 

with the aid of POME to about 15 to 

20%, applied to the land by furrow 

or flat-bed systems.

Fertiliser usage is highly dependent 

on the age profile of plantations – 

with younger plantings and nutrient 

imbalance soil types requiring a 

higher nutrient input. The tested 

and careful recommendation from 

R&amp;D Department helped manage 

inorganic fertiliser usage.

Safe, clean water is vital for our palm 

oil mills, as well as for the health of our 

employees and local communities. 

Minimising the risk of surface and 

ground water contamination by 

fertiliser use and other field practices 

is included as a priority area in our 

Sustainability Policy. We have not 

started with collection of the detailed 

data on water risks in and around 

our concessions or formed plans 

to ensure minimal impact of our 

operations on surface and ground 

water quality and availability. We are 

looking to proceed with these works 

in 2018, through documenting, 

monitoring and mitigation of our 

activities.

In the next year, we will also be 

looking into a project focused on 

sustainable water management in 

the catchment area of probably  

river Pawan, in Ketapang district. 

This river, which runs through our 

concession PT Ladang Sawit Mas 

(LSM) as well as the recently acquired 

PT Sejahtera Sawit Lestari (SSL) has 

repeatedly flooded the surrounding 

areas managed by the communities 

and plantation companies alike. 

Worst affected are often the local 

people, who depend on the river 

for their food security, mainly from 

fishing and rice farming. We will look 

into ways of Improving the availability 

and quality of water resources, and 

develop sustainable and inclusive 

water management plans between 

the Ketapang district government, 

communities and companies in the 

Pawan river catchment area.

In our mills, we extract river water 

for use in processing and harvest 

rainwater, which is then stored in 

ponds for use in housing areas, 

communities 

and 

operational 

activities. We have been constantly 

making an effort to raise awareness 

about economical water usage, 

which has resulted in a 22% 

reduction in water consumption at 

our mills over the past five years.

Before land application, POME 

is treated in series of ponds.

FREE, PRIOR AND INFORMED CONSENT

PEOPLE

BUMITAMA AGRI LTD. • SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016      31 

Partnerships and good community 

relations 

are 

critical 

for 

our 

operations. In accordance with the 

RSPO NPP we have implemented 

a detailed Free, Prior and Informed 

Consent (FPIC) process incorporating 

participatory mapping and Social 

Impact Assessment (SIA) prior to all 

new developments. A management 

and mitigation plan is developed with 

all relevant stakeholders to ensure 

that land rights holders and their 

representatives are appropriately 

identified 

and 

that 

adequate 

information, including both benefits 

and negative impacts, are conveyed 

to the affected. These measures 

ensure that informed consent can 

be given or withheld in accordance 

with the wishes of the community.

In an extension of our FPIC process, 

we are working on a collaborative 

multi-stakeholder landscape project 

in the Ketapang district, called BBCP. 

It focuses on land use planning in 

nine villages in our concessions, 

exploring how land is used and how 

it could be more effectively zoned for 

protection, production and inclusion 

of the community. As part of the 

project, Bumitama has worked with 

the local government to develop 

Village-Level Land Use Plans as a 

fit-in model to government planning 

for villagers called Pembangunan 

Kawasan Perdesaan (PKP). These 

will expedite and improve the 

public service development and 

capacity building of the village 

communities through participatory 

development and finding the best 

option for conservation and livelihood 

development.

Launched in October 2016, the 

project aims to showcase how land 

use planning can support villages 

in efforts to form a strong basis for 

establishing legality, help against 

forest encroachment and fires, and 

be used to coordinate economic 

development initiatives such as NTFP 

at a landscape level.

LOCAL ECONOMIC 

EMPOWERMENT AND  

FOOD SECURITY

We 

endeavour 

to 

help 

the 

communities around our operations 

achieve economic progress and 

financial independence through 

our Local Economic Empowerment 

Programme. We focus on long-

term and self-sustainable solutions, 

such as helping local communities 

to start complementary businesses. 

This entails providing locals with 

training on business economics and 

equipping them to manage their 

enterprises sustainably. Bumitama 

plays an active role at every stage 

of the programme, providing seed 

capital, 

business 

management 

advice, microbanking facilities and 

guidance on the sale of products and 

produce. The programme has led to 

a number of successful projects and 

high participation rates.

We are continuing to build on our 

aquaculture, poultry and vegetable 

farming programmes, which have 

grown significantly, expanding from 

one community group to numerous 

groups in different districts and 

provinces. 

For 

example, 

our 

aquaculture project started with one 

community group in 2012 and has 

now grown to encompass to 13 

groups at the time of reporting. We 

have funded a booklet to showcase 

some of the projects, which will be 

made available online later in 2017.

Bumitama is proud to support 

the government’s push for food 

security. We continue to encourage 

communities in four locations in 

Central and West Kalimantan to plant 

paddy crop. At Teluk Pulai Village 

in PT Andalan Sukses Makmur 

(ASMR), Bumitama educated local 

farmers on good agricultural practices 



and composting methods. We also 

improved drainage and assisted in 

applications for seeds and additional 

land for planting, thereby enabling 

more families to join the farmers 

group. We are also teaching the 

benefits of crop rotation to prevent 

fires and provide additional income. 

For 2017, corn will be used as the 

rotational crop, and we are working 

on this programme in collaboration 

with 

the 

regional 

government 

supporting the food source agenda 

of the Agricultural Agency under the 

national programme of the Ministry 

of Agriculture. The success of the 

initiative has resulted in the Bumitama 

CSR team receiving an overwhelming 

number of requests for assistance 

from other farmer groups. Our CSR 

teams are also working with two other 

farmer groups in West Kalimantan.

RIGHTS OF WORKERS

Our 

operations 

depend 

on 

maintaining a productive, healthy 

and satisfied local workforce, and 

we ensure that we provide fair and 

competitive conditions for all of our 

employees.

We respect workers’ rights as set 

out in the ILO core conventions and 

are committed to the principles of 

the Universal Declaration of Human 

Rights. Our 2015 NDPE policy 

explicitly covers our own employees, 

as well as contract, temporary and 

migrant workers, and requires our 

suppliers and subcontractors to 

uphold the same standards.

WAGES AND TRANSPARENCY

All workers are paid above the 

local minimum wage and all have 

detailed contracts. Piece-rate work 

by harvesters, for example, is clearly 

identified on payslips.

In addition to wages, permanent 

workers receive benefits such as free 

accommodation, healthcare, free 

education, holiday bonus (Tunjangan 

Hari Raya), rice, electricity and clean 

water.

Overall we are reducing the use of 

temporary workers in most of our 

operations. However, we will still 

allow the use of temporary contracts 

for some seasonal tasks. Temporary 

workers receive benefits including 

some of the health insurance 

benefits

HEALTH AND SAFETY

The safety of our employees is our 

primary concern, and improvements 

in workplace safety have been at the 

forefront of our worker engagement 

activities over the past two years. 

We are developing new standard 

operating procedures across all 

plantations and mills, and have 

started to implement OHSAS 18001 

across our operations.

We are also working with suppliers 

and subcontractors to enhance 

standards throughout our sector; 

providing safety briefings and 

incorporating required health and 

safety standards into all contracts.

Despite these efforts, we saw 

increasing accident rates in 2015-

2016. This increase is attributed 

to more accurate and vigorous 

reporting, but we recognise that 

there is still significant work to do in 

this area.

It is with great sadness and concern 

that we recorded two work-related 

fatalities as a result of traffic 

accidents in 2016.

We are now analysing the types of 

accident from data we have collected. 

Focusing first on the most common 

circumstances, we will develop a 

dynamic and transformative strategy 

to tackle the current high accident 

rate. Beyond regular training, we are

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION

We respect the right of all our 

employees 

to 

join 

and 

form 

associations of their choice and 

to collective bargaining. Workers’ 

unions are present in all of our 

operations and union representatives 

meet with management quarterly. 

In most cases unions are internal, 

but some workers have opted for 

external representation. We do not 

interfere in the workings or setup of 

any of these unions.

BONDED LABOUR AND 

MIGRANT WORKERS

As we do not employ foreign 

or migrant workers, bonded or 

forced labour does not represent a 

significant risk to our operations. We 

do not withhold personal documents 

or any other form of collateral, which 

could impede the free movement of 

workers.

CHILD LABOUR

We have a strict ban on hiring 

employees below the age of 18, 

whether for permanent or temporary 

positions. However, we recognise 

the risk that local employees may 

bring children to the field during high 

crop seasons to help their parents. 

We expressly prohibit this and 

continue seeking to raise awareness

EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT AND

As the palm oil sector grows across

We provide good quality daycare and

focus on primary schooling, for older 

children, we have some initiatives, 

such as a vocational school.

In 2017, we will start work on a 

programme aimed at assessing and 

improving the rights of children on 

two of our pilot sites. These pilots 

would be used to benchmark our 

practices with our other plantations 

and with others in the industry. 

This programme is created under

NON-DISCRIMINATION

We have a zero tolerance policy 

towards 

gender 

discrimination 

and sexual harassment. Bumitama 

operates an anonymous sexual 

harassment reporting mechanism 

and 

investigates 

every 

report 

received.

Gender balance in our industry is 

generally very low. However, we 

wish to provide more opportunities 

for 

women 

in 

the 

company 

and are looking at ways to 

increase the proportion of female 

employees. Recent years have 

seen encouragement to participate 

in PAME (Pelatihan Ahli Madya 

Engineering – training designed to 

prepare candidates for mill officers) 

and PAJ (Pelatihan Ahli Juwana 

– training designed to prepare 

the prospective supervisors and 

administrative officers), opening new 

roles for women in our company. We 

will continue with this in the coming 

years.








BUMITAMA AGRI LTD. • SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016      39 

We believe this is in part due to our 

increased focus on our employee 

identity, as well as the strengthened 

training 

and 

development 

programmes we now extend to all 

employees.

Over the past years we have 

analysed and revised our Corporate 

Culture Values and have socialised 

these to our staff. We have launched 

a 

new 

employee 

orientation 

programme, and have introduced 

team-building activities for all staff 

with the involvement of management.

We established the Bumitama 

Academy in 2014 to focus on 

enhanced recruitment, competence 

development 

and 

leadership 

development at all organisational 

levels. 

The 

Academy 

will 

be 

transformed 

into 

a 

Corporate 

University in 2018 offering advanced 

learning programmes.

Since 2014, we have run a 

partnership 

programme 

with 

the Institute of Agricultural Stiper 

Yogyakarta (INSTIPER) to promote 

the improvement of managerial and 

leadership capacity among future 

unit leaders.

Overall, Bumitama offers employees 

three types of training:

– A 

basic 

programme 

for 

all 

employees 

to 

increase 

competencies, 

as 

well 

as 

performance coaching.

– Individual specific development 

programmes to fill competency 

gaps in accordance with employee 

specialisation.

– Workshops and meetings to keep 

staff up to date with the latest 

developments.

Since 2007 we have conducted 

training at our specialised Pundu 

Learning Centre, which has been 

ISO certified 9001:2008 since 2011. 

In 2013, we created an additional 

Learning Centre in the Kendawangan 

region. The training sessions held 

at these Centres are tailored to the 

needs of different employee groups. 

In 2016 we expanded our training 

platform to incorporate e-learning, 

thereby increasing both the reach and 

efficiency of our training programmes.

SMALLHOLDERS AND OUTGROWERS

cycle (whichever is earlier). We intend 

to renew the arrangement in the next 

replanting phase. Today, we have 

over 25,000 associated plasma 

scheme smallholders.

Since we provide direct agricultural 

assistance to plasma smallholders, 

and have exclusivity of their FFB, 

we 

can 

guide 

implementation 

of our policies and assist them 

in achieving RSPO certification, 

and its associated benefits, within 

three years of certification of the 

nucleus, or when all relevant permits 

are in place. Our current target to 

achieve RSPO certification for all 

plasma schemes is 2024, and we 

expect to complete certification of 

the first group by 2018. We are 

also conducting internal training at 

our mills with the aim of including 

two more mills in our certification 

programme in the coming year.

Beyond certification, the schemes 

are also playing an instrumental 

role 

in 

driving 

improvements 

and continue to yield social and 

economic progress. Starting at 

year-end 2016, we are now seeking 

to deepen the schemes further by 

introducing plasma cooperatives to 

More than half of the FFB processed 

in 

our 

mills 

is 

produced 

by 

smallholders – around 22% by plasma 

scheme smallholders, and a further 

29% by independent smallholders 

and outgrowers. It is therefore critical 

that we map, engage and support 

smallholders in our supply chain to 

ensure that all FFB originates from 

legal and responsible sources.

PLASMA SCHEMES

The 

Indonesian 

government 

mandates that a minimum of 20% of a 

concession’s planted area is allocated 

to smallholder schemes – commonly 

known as ‘plasma’ schemes.

To date, Bumitama has developed 

and allocated approximately 26.4% 

of our total planted area – 46,277 

hectares – to plasma schemes in 

Kalimantan and Riau. We enter 

into cooperation agreements with 

plasma members through their 

chosen representative and we help 

to develop the land and manage the 

plasma plantations. The development 

costs of the plasma plantations are 

initially funded by the company, 

before getting a loan from the bank. 

Plasma members enjoy a share in 

the profits of the plasma plantations 

after deduction of interest and loan 

instalments, plantation costs and a 

management fee.

In the financial year 2016, Bumitama 

distributed IDR 207 billion (around 

USD 1.5 million) in dividends to its 

plasma smallholders. Our current 

arrangement under the Plasma 

Programme lasts for 25 years, or 

until the end of the current planting 

an alternative livelihood programme 

known as the Plasma Advantage 

Programme which has been running 

successfully at the village/community 

level (see section on local economic 

empowerment).

INDEPENDENT SMALLHOLDERS 

AND OUTGROWERS

Some of the fruit we source from 

independent 

smallholders 

and 

outgrowers is purchased through 

third-party traders. The origin of the 

fruit changes daily, which makes 

traceability 

complex. 

Although 

challenging, we are putting our best 

efforts to trace the suppliers, to 

minimise concerns over the legality 

of fruit due to the occurrence of 

plantings in conservation areas 

or 

areas 

without 

appropriate 

environmental permits.

Our priority has therefore been to 

map independent smallholders, 

starting with those supplying to 

certified mills, and to complete 

this work by the end of 2017. By 

year-end 2016 we had made good 

progress, mapping 33 of the 54 

independent smallholders supplying 

FFB to these mills (61% of the 

total). We are currently analysing 

the feedback obtained during the 

socialisation events that supported 

the programme, and we will use this 

to help us define the appropriate 

next steps. We may need to consider 

engaging an external consultant on 

the below programme to meet the 

revised deadline.

INDEPENDENT SMALLHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

We have started tracing FFB 

supplies from mill to smallholder at 

the certified Pundu Nabatindo Mill 

(PNBM) in Central Kalimantan. This 

pilot project is part of our ‘supply 

shed’ approach to traceability.

We 

also 

work 

with 

the 

community 

to 

educate 

and 

encourage smallholders towards 

sustainable land use, legality, 

best 

management 

practices 

in the planted area and RSPO 

certification. In 2016 we met with 

an independent smallholder group 

called The TENERA Farmers Group 

(Tenera), which responded positively 

to the RSPO certification proposal. 

Tenera, which has an internal supply 

base of 970 hectares and an external 

supply base of 1,170 hectares, 

supplies between 50,000 tonnes 

and 60,000 tonnes of FFB to PNBM 

and other mills in the area annually. 

Tenera also acts as an FFB trader, 

collecting FFB from surrounding 

smallholders.

Bumitama 

is 

assisting 

this 

smallholders group with legality, 

best management practices and 

certification. The programme will be 

split into three phases:

(1) Phase 1 will cover the farmers 

in Tenera who have already 

secured or are close to securing 

legal permit for their land (230.5 

hectares).

(2) Phase 2 will cover farmers (Tenera 

and others) who are engaged in 

the process of applying/securing 

legal permit for their land (around 

300-450 hectares).

(3) Phase 3 will cover farmers 

(Tenera and others) whose land 

is still in the mapping stage of 

legal permit application (around 

350 to 450 hectares).

We operate in a part of the world 

– as well as in an industry – where 

stakeholders’ respect and business 

success is predicated on the 

upholding of the highest ethical 

standards and ensuring that business 

dealings at all levels are free from 

bribery and corruption.

At the end of 2014, our Board of 

Directors approved a detailed Code 

of Conduct designed to guide all 

employees in their dealings with 

business partners and regulatory 

bodies. The Code of Conduct covers 

all employees, as well as the Board 

of Directors and others working on 

behalf of the company, and covers 

among other areas:

ANTI-CORRUPTION &amp; ETHICAL POLICIES

• Legality and the imperative to 

ensure legal compliance in all 

dealings with stakeholders, 

including regulatory bodies, 

business 

partners 

and 

colleagues.

• A complete ban on corrupt and 

unethical practices, such as 

bribery, cronyism and nepotism.

• A ban on political contributions 

and activity on behalf of the 

company (but allowing for 

personal political activity outside 

of the workplace).

• Transparency 

and 

record 

keeping.

• Detailed guidance on the giving 

and receiving of gifts.

• Guidance on behaviour toward 

stakeholders, including sexual 

harassment 

and 

complaints 

mechanisms. 

The Code of Conduct has been 

socialised with both employees and 

contractors on an ongoing basis 

since its launch, and all employees 

and contractors are required to sign 

a confirmation that they will adhere 

to the Code.

The Code of Conduct was developed 

in Indonesian, as this is the native 

language of the vast majority of 

our employees and stakeholders. 

However, to ensure that international 

stakeholders can also scrutinise our 

standards, we are in the process of 

translating the document into English. 

This translation will be published in 

2017.

RSPO COMPLAINT CASES

and complaints can be raised 

effectively. In 2015, we introduced 

an enhanced grievance procedure 

to ensure a structured group-wide 

approach to complaints handling.

Having a relatively large footprint 

in our local communities, we 

understand that there will be 

grievances that need to be resolved. 

In some cases these are raised 

internally through our grievance 

procedures at the site-level, while 

some stakeholders choose to use 

the RSPO complaints process. In 

the 2015-2016 reporting period, 

two new complaints were raised. By 

liaising directly and constructively 

with all stakeholders, we were able 

to resolve and partially close one part 

of this case, related to gravesites, 

claims on termination of workers 

and asserted criminalisation of Bpk. 

Gusti Gelombang. The remainder of 

the allegations was registered with 

the RSPO as a new complaint in 

2016, on behalf of 15 community 

members from Central Kalimantan, 

who disputed the circumstances of 

land surrender for a plasma scheme 

and related cooperative issues. 

We have engaged with both the 

RSPO and the complainants and 

are currently undergoing a facilitated 

process arranged by the RSPO and 

agreed upon by all parties. As at the 

time of reporting the case remains 

outstanding2.

In addition to the formal RSPO 

complaints process, we also monitor 

complaints raised via other channels, 

for instance on social media or in 

NGO reports, through an in-house 

grievance tracker. Our policy is to 

engage proactively with stakeholders 

raising issues through the public 

domain. For details about our 

response to these grievances, please 

see report sections on legality (page 

43), communities and indigenous 

peoples 

(pages 

31–39), 

and 

biodiversity and wildlife protection 

(pages 18–19).

WHISTLE-BLOWING POLICY

Our 

whistle-blowing 

policy 

enables any stakeholder, including 

employees, customers, suppliers, 

contractors or local community 

members, to raise concerns about 

improprieties in financial reporting, 

unethical practices or other matters. 

The policy allows for confidential 

reporting without fear of reprisals. 

Anonymous disclosures are also 

accepted and anonymity honoured. 

The whistle-blowing policy and the 

procedures put in place to implement 

it have been reviewed and approved 

by our Board’s Audit Committee.

ABOUT THE REPORT

 62 BUMITAMA AGRI LTD. • SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016

REPORT CYCLE AND 

APPROACH TO ASSURANCE

This 

report 

is 

our 

second 

Sustainability report. We expect to 

publish Sustainability reports every 

year in accordance with the SGX 

requirements, where full sustainability 

report will alternate with  summarised 

sustainability report in a two-year 

cycle. Sustainability updates are 

also included in our progress report 

and annual report every year. In 

addition, stakeholders can review our 

progress annually via our RSPO annual 

communications of progress published 

each year in Q3 and accessible 

from www.rspo.org/members/2551/

BUMITAMA-AGRI-LTD.

We have not engaged third party 

assurance, as we believe that our 

multiple certification audit provides 

adequate 

assurance 

on 

our 

performance to our stakeholders at 

this stage. The majority of content 

is documented in our RSPO 

audit reports, which are prepared 

by PT Mutuagung Lestari and 

which can be downloaded from  

www.rspo.org/en/principles_and_

criteria_assessment_progress.

However, we will collate feedback 

from stakeholders on whether third-

party assurance is a priority area.

MATERIALITY, STAKEHOLDER 

INCLUSIVENESS AND 

SUSTAINABILITY CONTEXT

Report content has been determined 

based on ongoing stakeholder 

dialogue and a review of issues that 

are critical to Bumitama.

In developing our report content, 

we have worked with Helikonia, 

a 

consultancy 

with 

extensive 

experience in palm oil disclosure. 

Together, we have reviewed NGO 

and investor reports, as well as 

social media coverage. We have also 

engaged with our implementation 

partner 

Aidenvironment, 

a 

sustainability 

consultancy 

with 

close links to civil society, to 

help identify critical issues and 

expectations of Bumitama. We 

have also benchmarked our report 

content against disclosure platforms 

such as the Zoological Society of 

London’s (ZSL) Sustainable Palm 

Oil Transparency Initiative (SPOTT) 

and the CERES Reporting Guidance 

for Responsible Palm as we see 

these as a proxy to understand the 

indicators expected by a broad range 

of stakeholders. Finally, we have 

reviewed disclosures by peers in the 

industry to ensure that our report 

content meets best practice and is 

comparable to the sector leaders.

Based on this analyses, as well 

as 

internal 

discussions 

with 

management teams in Bumitama, we 

have reviewed our materiality matrix 

to reflect the changes in stakeholder 

expectations over the last two years.

With the exception of smallholders, 

boundaries were considered to 

be 

Bumitama’s 

organisational 

boundaries.

Throughout the report we seek 

to provide an appropriate context 

for our performance, particularly 

in relation to the unique social 

and environmental landscapes in 

Kalimantan and Riau, Indonesia.

GLOSSARY

BUMITAMA AGRI LTD. • SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016      63 

BIODIVERSITY

The diversity (number and variety of 

species) of plant and animal life.

BIOLOGICAL OXYGEN 

DEMAND (BOD)

The 

amount 

of 

oxygen 

used 

when organic matter undergoes 

decomposition by micro-organisms. 

Testing for BOD is done to assess 

the amount of organic matter in 

water.

CO2 EQUIVALENTS

Carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) 

provide a universal standard of 

measurement against which the 

impacts of releasing (or avoiding 

the release of) different greenhouse 

gases can be evaluated.

EFFLUENTS

Water discharged from one source 

into a separate body of water, such 

as mill process water.

EXTRACTION RATE

The amount of oil extracted from oil 

palm fruit at a mill. Crude palm oil 

(CPO) is extracted from the flesh; 

palm kernel oil (PKO) from the nut.

FREE, PRIOR AND 

INFORMED CONSENT (FPIC)

FPIC is the principle that implies that 

a community has the right to give 

or withhold its consent to proposed 

projects that may affect the lands 

they customarily own, occupy or 

otherwise use.

FRESH FRUIT BUNCH (FFB)

Bunch harvested from the oil palm 

tree. The weight of the fruit bunch 

ranges between 10 kg to 40 kg, 

depends on the size and age.

GLOBAL REPORTING 

INITIATIVE (GRI)

A multi-stakeholder standard for 

sustainability reporting, providing 

guidance on determining report 

content and indicators.

HIGH CONSERVATION 

VALUES (HCVS)

HCVs are biological, ecological, 

social or cultural values which are 

considered outstandingly significant 

or critically important, at the national, 

regional or global level.

HIGH CARBON STOCK (HCS) 

APPROACH

The HCS Approach is a methodology 

to avoid deforestation in land 

development, initially developed in 

a partnership between Greenpeace, 

TFT and Golden Agri-Resources. The 

approach stratifies the vegetation on 

an area of land into different classes 

using analyses of satellite images 

and field plot measurements. Each 

vegetation class is validated through 

calibrating it with carbon stock 

estimates in the above-ground tree 

biomass.

INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

According to the Listing Manual of 

SGX, an independent director is one 

who has no relationship with the 

company, its related corporations (i.e. 

a corporation that is the company’s 

holding company, subsidiary or fellow 

subsidiary), its 10% shareholders or 

its officers that could interfere, or 

be reasonably perceived to interfere, 

with the exercise of the director’s 

independent business judgement 

with a view to the best interests of 

the company.

INDEPENDENT 

SMALLHOLDER

Small growers with less than 50 

hectares, which are self-financed, 

managed, and equipped and are not 

bound to any one mill. They may 

deal directly with local mill operators 

of their choice or process their own 

palm oil using personal or community 

manual palm oil presses (more 

common in Africa).

INTEGRATED PEST 

MANAGEMENT (IPM)

IPM is the careful consideration of all 

available pest control techniques and 

subsequent integration of appropriate 

measures that discourage the 

development of pest populations 

and keep pesticides and other 

interventions to levels that are 

economically justified and reduce or 

minimise risks to human health and 

the environment. IPM emphasises 

the growth of a healthy crop with 

the least possible disruption to 

agro-ecosystems and encourages 

natural pest control mechanisms.

INTERNATIONAL LABOUR 

ORGANIZATION (ILO)

Is 

a 

tripartite 

world 

body 

representative of labour, management 

and government, and is an agency of 

the United Nations. It disseminates 

labour information and sets minimum 

international labour standards called 

“conventions”, offered to member 

nations for adoption.

of every nation.

MASS BALANCE

The Mass Balance system allows 

for mixing of RSPO certified and 

non-certified palm oil at any stage 

in the supply chain provided that 

overall company quantities are 

controlled. The mass balance model 

is constructed in such a way that 

volumes of RSPO certified product 

shipped will never exceed volumes 

received by the end-user.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

A board director who does not 

currently hold other employment with 

the company. Unlike an independent 

director, a non-executive can have 

significant financial interests or close 

personal ties to the company.

NON-GOVERNMENTAL 

ORGANISATION (NGO)

grassroots 

and 

campaigning 

organisations 

focused 

on 

environmental or social issues.

PALM OIL MILL EFFLUENT 

(POME)

By-product of processed fresh fruit 

bunch (FFB).

PEAT AND PEATLAND

decayed vegetation matter. Peat 

forms in wetlands or peatlands, 

variously 

called 

bogs, 

moors, 

muskegs, pocosins, mires, and peat 

swamp forests. 65% organic matter 

with depth of more than 50 cm is 

considered peatland.

PLASMA SCHEMES

assures that RSPO-certified palm 

oil and its derivatives delivered to 

the end-user come only from RSPO 

certified sources. It permits the 

mixing of RSPO-certified palm oil 

from a variety of sources.

STAKEHOLDERS

Any group or individual who are 

affected by or can affect a company’s 

operations.

SUSTAINABILITY

A term expressing a long-term 

balance between social, economic 

and environmental objectives. Often 

linked to sustainable development,
