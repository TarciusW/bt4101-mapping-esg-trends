HWA HONG CORPORATION LIMITED   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

This year, Hwa Hong Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries (“Hwa Hong, HHC, or Group”) embarked on its sustainability 

reporting journey for greater sustainable value creation in the areas of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”). 

This effort has led us to work on ways to improve our value chain, combining our own actions with those of our service 

providers and joint venture partners, to create positive impacts.

With the recent introduction of Singapore Exchange Limited (“SGX”) Listing Rule 711A, the Board of Directors  

(the “Board”) has placed greater importance on adopting a strategic approach in managing and overseeing the ESG matters 

which are significant to Hwa Hong as identified by the Board. The Board also reviewed the sustainability performance of 

the organisation and guided the Management on defining future priorities.

Together with the Management, the Board will continue to promote greater resilience and sustainability in its business 

operations whilst engaging with all stakeholders of Hwa Hong.

of ESG which are significant to the Group’s property investment operations in Singapore and UK1 (Figure 2). Unless 

otherwise stated, this sustainability report covers the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUSTAINABILITY

At Hwa Hong, sustainability matters are governed by the Board which is supported by the Audit and Risk Committee 

(ARC) (Figure 3). This committee is responsible for integrating sustainability principles and policies, which comprise of 

relevant policies and standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) throughout the Group. Compliance with these policies and 

SOPs is effected through periodic reviews by the Board.

WHAT’S IMPORTANT FOR HWA HONG?

As Hwa Hong commences its sustainability journey, the Management, together with the Board conducted a formal 

materiality assessment exercise in late 2016. An extensive list of ESG matters were evaluated and then ranked according 

to their importance from both internal and external stakeholders’ perspectives.  As a result, five ESG matters were 

identified as material in line with the Group’s sustainability strategy (Figure 4). This sustainability report will be focusing on 

the performance disclosures of these material sustainability matters (Figure 5)2.

SUSTAINABILITY AT HWA HONG 

2 

The Group did not identify any environmental matters such as energy and water consumption as material sustainability matters for its properties in Singapore 

and the UK as the usage of water and electricity are not within the Group’s control. The property managements in the Singapore properties are mainly carried out 

either by the Management Corporation Strata Title (“MCST”) or by the anchor tenant in its Paya Lebar property. In the UK, the commercial properties are leased 

on a full repair, insurance basis (“FRI”) whereby repairs and insurance are largely borne by the tenants and for the residential properties, repairs and maintenance 

costs are shared by all leaseholders.

HWA HONG CORPORATION LIMITED   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

FUNDAMENTAL

HIGH STANDARDS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

The Group recognises the importance of good corporate governance, accountability and transparency and believes that 

conducting business in a responsible and ethical manner is vital to the sustainability of the Group.

At Hwa Hong, the Board monitors the effectiveness of the Management and regularly reviews its corporate governance 

practices according to the principles and guidelines of the Singapore’s Code of Corporate Governance 2012 to maintain 

continual robustness of governance that is reflective of changes to existing environment. Additionally, the Management 

would engage the Company Secretary to conduct an annual review of the Group’s corporate governance practices to 

ensure that current practices are largely in line with the recommended best practices. 

The Group has improved its ranking in the Singapore Governance and Transparency Index (“SGTI”) from the 226th position 

in 2015 to the 96th position in 2016. While the position had declined to 100th position in 2017, the SGTI 2017 score 

remained the same as SGTI2016. The SGTI is aimed at assessing companies on their corporate governance disclosure 

and practices, as well as the timeliness, accessibility and transparency of their financial results announcement. The Group 

will continue to look into maintaining the timeliness, accessibility and transparency of the announcement results and target 

to maintain and improve the SGTI score going forward. 

To demonstrate its commitment towards excellence in Corporate Governance, the Group had joined the Securities 

Investors Association Singapore (“SIAS”) and its partners for the past few years in making the following public Statement 

of Support, which was reiterated at the 8th Singapore Corporate Governance Week 2017, organised by SIAS in 2017.

“As an Organisation, we are committed to upholding high standards of corporate governance to enhance shareholder 

value. We believe practising good corporate governance is central to the health and stability of our financial markets and 

economy.” 

 

One of the initiatives launched by SIAS which the Group participated in, includes raising key questions on the annual 

reports of SGX-listed companies on SGX Net to raise the quality of Annual General Meetings (“AGM”). This initiative 

was launched in 2016, designed to help shareholders to focus on critical areas, such as business strategies, financial 

performance and corporate governance practices, etc. for constructive discussions during AGM. In April 2017, SIAS 

had raised some queries on the Group’s 2016 Annual Report and the Group had promptly uploaded its responses in the 

SGX Net which had also been communicated to the shareholders during the 64th AGM held in April 2017. This further 

demonstrates the Group’s commitment in ensuring timely and transparent information available to its shareholders.

HWA HONG CORPORATION LIMITED   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

FUNDAMENTAL

RISK MANAGEMENT

A formalised risk management process has been established since 2006 where risks, control measures, risk tolerance 

level or limits and follow up actions are identified and monitored by the Management and reported to the Board for 

review and evaluation. During the risk management process, the Board determines acceptable levels of risk tolerance 

and policies to ensure that all identifiable material risks should be identified, understood, managed and monitored. The 

Group believes that effective risk management is the responsibility of all directors and managers, with the Board providing 

general oversight.  

Every year, the Management carries out a review of the Group’s risk registers to update and identify new risks that may 

adversely affect the Group’s operations. A risk management report highlighting high risk areas or new risks and measures 

to mitigate such identified risks is submitted annually to the ARC for review and discussion.  

For the year under review, the Management believes that the current framework for managing risks remains appropriate. 

Although risks cannot be completely eliminated, an effective risk management framework will reduce the uncertainties in 

achieving the Group’s business objectives and allow the Group to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. Please 

refer to the Corporate Governance Report and Risk Management and Control Environment sections of the Annual Report.

ANTI-CORRUPTION, ANTI-BRIBERY 

The Group recognises the importance of good governance, anti-corruption and anti-bribery and adopts an integrated 

Fraud Risk Management Framework, designed to identify and minimise fraud occurrences within the Group. The Group 

adheres to the Code of Corporate Governance 2012 and listing rules and regulations set out by SGX and MAS Securities 

and Futures Act, as well as all other applicable laws and regulations. 

In addition, the Group expects its business partners, such as joint ventures and suppliers, to approach issues of 

corruption and bribery in a manner that is consistent with the Group’s principles. The Group will use its influence to ensure 

that business partners meet high integrity standards. The Group will also ensure that the procurement procedures for 

appointing suppliers are open, fair and transparent. The selection of suppliers will be based on evaluation of merits, and 

not on personal recommendations.

Internal Policy

Most of the Group’s investments are in developed markets such as Singapore and UK where there is very strong rule 

of law including anti-corruption laws.  Where we have investments in emerging markets, the Group is careful that the 

investments are made with thorough due diligence. 

In support of an open and transparent communication culture, the Group has a whistle-blowing policy in place to provide 

an avenue for employees and external parties to raise concerns and offer reassurance that they will be protected from 

reprisals or victimisation for whistle blowing in good faith. The Group has zero tolerance to fraud and/or misconduct, 

encouraging all team members to report suspicious cases of fraud and/or misconduct, and spreading awareness amongst 

them on risks faced by the Group. In addition, the Group adheres with the corporate policies and SOPs established  

(Figure 6), to guide conduct of the team members as demonstrated in the unblemished record of zero incidents in  

this year.

HWA HONG CORPORATION LIMITED   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Any form of non-compliance could potentially damage the Group’s reputation and affect confidence levels of the 

shareholders. It may also result in penalties such as fines, public warnings or reprimands from the regulators. The Group 

also views that compliance with law and regulations is critical so as to uphold Singapore’s reputation as a fair and efficient 

economy and reliable marketplace.

The Group has established policies and SOPs to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and legislation. 

Regulatory management is monitored via regular self-testing, routine compliance checklists and reporting of regulatory 

breaches. Internal audits also cover the review and compliance of policies and SOPs with regards to compliance matters, 

to ensure that the Group is adhering to regulatory requirements. The Group has outsourced its internal audit function to 

independently examine and evaluate the activities of the Group, focusing on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal 

controls, risk management and corporate governance processes. The last internal audit on regulatory management was 

carried out in 2016 and no significant matters were noted.

In 2017, apart from one incident of non-compliance in the GST filing resulting from an omission with a penalty of $92.28, 

there was no other known incident of non-compliance with the codes, laws and regulations. The Group targets to achieve 

zero incidence of non-compliance going forward.

SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS GROWTH

SUSTAINING LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GROWTH AND PERFORMANCE 

Listed on the SGX-ST, Hwa Hong reports its financial performance on a quarterly basis. At the time of the release of this 

report, the most recent financial results released are for the financial year ended 31 December 2017.  Total revenue for the 

year was $14,500,346 and net profit $7,407,116.  As at 31 December 2017, Hwa Hong’s total investment properties were 

valued at $226,086,951 compared to $238,033,671 last year.  

Through a robust capital and asset management strategy, the Group focuses on investment opportunities which maximise 

shareholders’ value over the medium to long term (Figure 7).

Figure 7. Long term value creation points of focus

A good governance structure, access to capital and due consideration for broader economic and business environment 

in Singapore and UK are critical to the execution of this strategy.  

Hwa Hong aims to meet its commitment to its shareholders through the following strategic objectives:

1. Acquire properties with long term value given their location and type of use

2. Unlock value from properties or develop sites over time to create value

3. Optimise income from assets

4. Recycle capital

5. Maintain strong, and efficient balance sheet (including ensuring sustainable loans-to-values (“LTVs”) and interest cover)

HWA HONG CORPORATION LIMITED   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

The Group focuses on maximising the shareholder value and maintaining the ability to pursue future investment 

opportunities while striving to maintain a consistent dividend to shareholders.  Hwa Hong has a track record of paying 

consistent dividend to shareholders and the decision on whether to recommend a dividend is at the discretion of the 

Board of Directors.  In determining the dividend payout for a given year, the Board of Directors take into account, inter 

alia, the Group’s balance sheet position, operating results, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board of 

Directors deems relevant.

SUCCESSION PLANNING

A fundamental responsibility of the Board is to ensure that effective processes are in place to provide continuity of 

executive leadership and to assess if the potential leadership possesses sufficient depth and talent to execute the Group’s 

long term strategy whilst addressing both current and long term needs of the Group.

The Group’s sound corporate governance and Nominating Committee terms of reference provide the committee’s 

responsibilities on ensuring succession planning. These include ensuring effective processes at Hwa Hong to provide 

continuity of executive leadership and assessing potential leadership on his or her depth and talent to execute long term 

strategies through:

• 

Establishment of a process for identifying and assessing potential internal candidates; 

• 

Conducting periodic review and assessment of readiness;

• 

Implementing contingency planning for temporary absences of the Chairman and Group Managing Director due to 

disability or other unexpected event; and

• 

Ensuring long term continuity planning for succession to the Group Managing Director position.

In order to ensure continuing relevance to meet current and future challenges and opportunities, the Board will assess 

such processes with the committees on an annual basis. 

STRATEGIC


14

HWA HONG CORPORATION LIMITED   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

STRATEGIC

STRONG PARTNERSHIPS

From a geographical perspective, the Group continues to focus its property investments in the two key geographical 

markets of Singapore and the UK. Given the Group’s relative small size and limited capital availability, the Group operates 

in the UK primarily through partnerships.  As such, forging and maintaining strong partnerships for continued growth and 

sustainability is a key pillar of our sustainability strategy. 

The Group’s presence in UK has been longstanding and it continues to view London, and to an lesser extent, the UK, 

as a key overseas market for the Group.  The Group believes that the Group’s long operating experience, the depth and 

liquidity of the London property market  and the transparency and the rule of law in the UK make the market attractive for 

foreign investors.  Since 2013, the Group has broadened its UK partnerships and resources there and this has helped us 

to identify promising investment opportunities.  Over time, together with our UK partners, we have been able to identify, 

invest in and profitably exit property investment opportunities.  In addition, we have been able to identify opportunities to 

invest in properties for recurring income and potential long term value creation.

In broadening its partnerships, the Group assesses largely on these criteria:

1. Potential partner’s profile and track record; and

2. Potential partner’s previous partnership experience or reputation in the industry for new partnership.

 

In order to ensure a successful outcome from partnering, there are a few key process issues which are considered 

important to achieving optimal partnership outcomes. These process issues include:

1. Creating a shared vision on the investments;

2. Agreeing on terms upfront with robust and thorough legal agreements;

3. Regular monitoring of the investment; and

4. Ensuring that dispute resolution is agreed upfront.

The Group has been able to foster close, amicable, professional relationships with its partners and it is the Group’s belief 

that this will bring along opportunities for future investments.

INFLUENCING HWA HONG’S SUPPLY CHAIN 

Sustainability impacts occur at every aspect of the business, and extend beyond the Group’s own operations. Hwa Hong 

is committed to influence its value chain in sustainability matters. The Group’s main suppliers are the property and project 

management service providers and professional service providers. In areas where the Group is in joint operations with the 

joint venture partners, the Group has varying degrees of control and influence over its property and project management 

service providers.  

Where relevant and practicable, the Group engages property and project manager and related service providers, and 

collaborate with them to create a positive sustainability impact.  Together with the property operators, appropriate and 

adequate risk management procedures on sourcing and selection of materials/services are considered.  For example, 

the service providers who carry out maintenance work and fitting-out works in the Group’s properties have the required 

licenses and are in compliance with the relevant statutory requirements.

HWA HONG CORPORATION LIMITED   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS

All stakeholders are important to Hwa Hong’s long-term success. Hwa Hong recognizes that the Group’s operations 

may impact on others and similarly, the Group’s stakeholders may influence various aspects of Hwa Hong’s business. 

Recognising this interdependency has driven the Group to engage proactively with its key stakeholders, so that their 

feedback can be incorporated to improve the Group’s business. The Group seeks to engage stakeholders’ concerns 

through multiple forms of engagement, as outlined in Figure 8.

The Group’s turnover rate was low with one non-executive member resigning during 2017. During the year, the Group has 

also hired one executive member with relevant expertise and knowledge to support its business operations. 

At Hwa Hong, it is recognised that the future competitiveness of Singapore’s economy lies in nurturing the core of local 

talent. The Group therefore supports local employment to its utmost, while simultaneously keeping an open mind on 

hiring foreign talent for their specialised skill sets. In 2017, Singapore made up 95% of Hwa Hong’s total workforce which 

includes the new hire (Figure 12). 

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

The Group believes in fair and equal culture and adopts fair employment practices which are aligned with the Fair 

Consideration Framework of the Ministry of Manpower and the five key principles defined by the Tripartite Guidelines on 

Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP).

These five key principles are:

a) Recruit and select team members on the basis of merit (such as skills, experience or ability to perform the job), 

regardless of age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability.

b) Treat team members fairly and respectfully and implement progressive human resource management systems.

c) Provide employees with equal opportunities to be considered for training and development based on their strengths 

and needs, to help them achieve their full potential. 

d) Reward employees fairly based on their ability, performance, contribution and experience.

e) Abide by labour laws and adopt the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.


19

HWA HONG CORPORATION LIMITED   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017

ASPIRATIONAL

At Hwa Hong, the recruitment and career progressions follow a meritocratic approach. The Group remains highly committed 

in treating all team members fairly and equally. For example, the Group provides opportunities for senior citizens who have 

in turn, demonstrated good knowledge and loyalty to the Group.

As Hwa Hong has a lean workforce, the Group recognises that talent attraction and retention is an important aspect. 

Team members are identified as the Group’s most valuable assets and are continuously engaged. The Group views the 

importance of training, developing, growing and retaining its human capital through implementation of effective human 

resource policies and practices. The team members are encouraged to upskill themselves by getting trained for career 

growth and personal development. 

In addition, the Group offers competitive pay packages that are bench marked to the market and reward team members 

based on merit. The Group’s remuneration package generally comprises two components. One component is fixed in the 

form of a base salary. The other component is variable consisting of Annual Wage Supplement (“AWS”) and performance 

bonus. The variable component is largely dependent on the Group and individual performance, both in terms of financial 

and non-financial performance and creation of shareholder wealth.

Hwa Hong regards its team members’ well-being as its top priority because it creates job satisfaction, which in turn 

lowers turnover rates and increase productivity. The Group focuses on providing a safe, clean and balanced workplace
