BOARD 

STATEMENT 

The Board of Directors at CITIC Envirotech Limited (“CEL”) and its 

subsidiaries are pleased to present our inaugural Sustainability 

Report. 

 

CEL believes in contributing to society and being guided by a social 

mission. We strive to operate our businesses in a socially responsible 

manner while creating economic value for our shareholders. CEL 

does not aim to simply treat waste water, but to go beyond and 

contribute to cleaning up the aquatic environment and contributing 

to solving environmental problems globally. Our sustainability 

approach is premised on the recognition that environmental, social 

and governance (“ESG") risks and opportunities may have 

implications on our existing business model. As such, we are 

committed to responding through monitoring and managing our 

sustainability performance and delivering innovative solutions to 

address challenges in this sector. 

 

The Board specifically considered sustainability issues as part of our 

business strategic formulation, and oversaw the management of 

sustainability related risks, opportunities, practices and the 

development of the sustainability report. To effectively discharge its 

responsibilities, the Board is supported by the Sustainability Steering 

Committee, which comprises key executives from CEL. This year for 

the first time, we oversaw a materiality assessment that was 

conducted to identity the material ESG factors for CEL. This report 

describes how we manage our impacts in these areas as well as our 

performance and targets for the forthcoming year.
