PART I
ITEM 1.       BUSINESS 
Exxon Mobil Corporation was incorporated in the State of
New Jersey in 1882. Divisions and affiliated companies of ExxonMobil operate or
market products in the United States and most other countries of the world.
Their principal business is energy, involving exploration for, and production
of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacture of petroleum products and
transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.
ExxonMobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of commodity petrochemicals, including
olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a wide variety of
specialty products. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive research
programs in support of these businesses. 
Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and hundreds
of affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso,
Mobil or XTO. For convenience and simplicity, in this report the
terms ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil and XTO, as well as terms
like Corporation, Company, our, we  and its,
are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups
of affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question. 
Throughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing
measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air,
water and ground. These include a significant investment in refining
infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well as projects
to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas
emissions, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. Using definitions
and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s
2015 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and
remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenditures,
were $5.6 billion, of which $3.8 billion were included in expenses
with the remainder in capital expenditures. The total cost for such activities
is expected to decrease to approximately $5 billion in 2016 and 2017,
mainly reflecting lower project activity in Canada. Capital expenditures are
expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total. 
The energy and petrochemical industries are highly
competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other
industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial
and individual consumers. The Corporation competes with other firms in the sale
or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international
markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate
for such purposes. 
Operating data and industry segment information for the
Corporation are contained in the Financial Section of this report under the
following: “Quarterly Information”, “Note 18: Disclosures about Segments
and Related Information” and “Operating Summary”. Information on oil and gas
reserves is contained in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental
Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of
the Financial Section of this report.
ExxonMobil has a long‑standing commitment to the
development of proprietary technology. We have a wide array of research
programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments.
Information on Company‑sponsored research and development spending is
contained in “Note 3: Miscellaneous Financial Information” of the
Financial Section of this report. ExxonMobil held approximately 11 thousand
active patents worldwide at the end of 2015. For technology licensed to third
parties, revenues totaled approximately $158 million in 2015. Although
technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of
our Company, the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any
individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise or concession.
The number of regular employees was 73.5 thousand, 75.3 thousand,
and 75.0 thousand at years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional,
technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the
Corporation and are covered by the Corporation’s benefit plans and programs.
Regular employees do not include employees of the company‑operated retail
sites (CORS). The number of CORS employees was 2.1 thousand, 8.4 thousand,
and 9.8 thousand at years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The
decrease in CORS employees reflects the multi‑year transition of the company‑operated
retail network in portions of Europe to a more capital‑efficient Branded
Wholesaler model.  
Information concerning the source and availability of raw
materials used in the Corporation’s business, the extent of seasonality in the
business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of
contracts at the election of governments and risks attendant to foreign operations
may be found in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 2. Properties” in this
report. 
ExxonMobil maintains a website at exxonmobil.com. Our
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are made
available through our website as soon as reasonably practical after we
electronically file or furnish the reports to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Also available on the Corporation’s website are the Company’s
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, as
well as the charters of the audit, compensation and nominating committees of
the Board of Directors. Information on our website is not incorporated into
this report.

ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS
ExxonMobil’s financial and operating
results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and
petrochemical businesses. Many of these risk factors are not within the
Company’s control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and
operating results, or our financial condition. These risk factors include: 
Supply and Demand 
The oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are
fundamentally commodity businesses. This means ExxonMobil’s operations and
earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and
petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products. Oil, gas,
petrochemical, and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional,
and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant
commodity. Any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a
material adverse effect on certain of the Company’s operations, especially in
the Upstream segment, financial condition and proved reserves. On the other
hand, a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material
adverse effect on certain of the Company’s operations, especially in the
Downstream and Chemical segments.
Economic conditions. The demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with
general economic growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of
low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on
our results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world
or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of
civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate
fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals.
Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to
credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of
fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other
events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and
institutions also pose risks to ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of
our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to
fulfill their commitments to ExxonMobil. 
Other demand-related factors. Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas,
and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our results, include technological
improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the
demand for energy associated with heating and cooling; increased
competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not
been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies
or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel
choices, such as toward alternative fueled or electric vehicles. 
Other supply-related factors. Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a
number of factors affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the
development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance
recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent
such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand.
Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing
capacity tend to reduce margins on the affected products. World oil, gas, and
petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce
available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to OPEC production
quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters,
disruptions in competitors’ operations, or unexpected unavailability of
distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also
alter the relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and
gas and to manufacture petrochemicals. 
Other market factors. ExxonMobil’s business results are also exposed to
potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates, inflation,
currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions. We
generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures. 
Government and Political Factors 
ExxonMobil’s results can be adversely affected by
political or regulatory developments affecting our operations. 
Access limitations. A number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, or
may place resources off-limits from development altogether. Restrictions on
foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high
commodity prices, when national governments may have less need of outside
sources of private capital. Many countries also restrict the import or export
of certain products based on point of origin. 
Restrictions on doing business. ExxonMobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed
by the U.S. or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit
ExxonMobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain
countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. Such
restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be
subject to comparable restrictions. 
Lack of legal certainty. Some countries in which we do business lack
well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted clear regulatory
frameworks for oil and gas development. Lack of legal certainty exposes our
operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government
officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts. In
some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate
disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy may still
depend on the local legal system to enforce an award. 

2 



 

Regulatory and litigation risks. Even in countries with well-developed legal
systems where ExxonMobil does business, we remain exposed to changes in law
(including changes that result from international treaties and accords) that
could adversely affect our results, such as: 
  



·        
    


increases in taxes or government royalty rates
  (including retroactive claims);




·        
    


price controls;




·        
    


changes in environmental regulations or other laws
  that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business
  opportunities (including changes in laws related to offshore drilling
  operations, water use, or hydraulic fracturing);




·        
    


adoption of regulations mandating the use of
  alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components;




·        
    


adoption of government payment transparency
  regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive
  commercial information, or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure
  laws of other countries; and




·        
    


government actions to cancel contracts,
  re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations,
  renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets.



Legal remedies available to compensate us for
expropriation or other takings may be inadequate. 
We also may be adversely affected by the outcome of
litigation, especially in countries such as the United States in which very
large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur, or by government
enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or
regulations. 
Security concerns. Successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be
disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, and other local
security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for
security or to shut down operations for a period of time. 
Climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number
of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory
frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap
and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency
standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. These requirements
could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times,
and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward
relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas. Current and pending
greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs, such as for
monitoring or sequestering emissions. 
Government sponsorship of alternative energy. Many governments are providing tax advantages and
other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use
of specific fuels or technologies. Governments are also promoting research into
new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative
energy sources. We are conducting our own research efforts into alternative
energy, such as through sponsorship of the Global Climate and Energy Project at
Stanford University and research into liquid products from algae and biomass
that can be further converted to transportation fuels. Our future results may
depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to
adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy
products of the future in a cost-competitive manner. See “Management
Effectiveness” below. 
Management Effectiveness 
In addition to external economic and political
factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage
successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control. The
extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to
competition. For projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the
management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control. 
Exploration and development program. Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas
production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts.
Among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the
most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to
bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget. 
Project management. The success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical
businesses depends on complex, long-term, capital intensive projects. These
projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to
maximize efficiency. Specific factors that can affect the performance of major
projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint venturers,
partners, governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize
reservoir performance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through
long-term contracts or the development of effective spot markets; manage
changes in operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party
equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping; prevent, to the
extent possible, and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties
that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime; and
influence the performance of project operators where ExxonMobil does not
perform that role.

The term “project” as used in this report can refer to
a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same
meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. 
Operational efficiency. An important component of ExxonMobil’s competitive
performance, especially given the commodity-based nature of many of our
businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to
manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis. This
requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost
control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio,
and the recruitment, development, and retention of high caliber employees. 
Research and development. To maintain our competitive position, especially in
light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous
efficiency improvement, ExxonMobil’s research and development organizations
must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy
environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. 
Safety, business controls, and environmental risk
management. Our results depend on
management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and
petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities, and
to minimize the potential for human error. We apply rigorous management systems
and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other
adverse environmental events. For example, we work to minimize spills through a
combined program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing
upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and
surveillance. Similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new technologies
and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in
response to government requirements but also to address community priorities.
We also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a
controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework.
Substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our
management systems and controls do not function as intended. The ability to
insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable
insurance markets, which may not be sufficient. 
Business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity
breaches. If our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not
to be sufficient, ExxonMobil could be adversely affected such as by having its
business systems compromised, its proprietary information altered, lost or
stolen, or its business operations disrupted. 
Preparedness.
Our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters,
human error, and similar events. For example, hurricanes may damage our
offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in
vulnerable areas. Our facilities are designed, constructed, and operated to
withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety
factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties, including
those associated with wave, wind, and current intensity, marine ice flow
patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes,
extreme rain fall events, and earthquakes. Our consideration of changing
weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the
engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially
introduce. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends
in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as
our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity
planning. 
Projections, estimates, and descriptions of
ExxonMobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in Items 1, 1A, 2, 7
and 7A of this report are forward-looking statements. Actual future results,
including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures,
costs, and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things,
the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report.

1. Disclosure of Reserves 
A. Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves at
Year-End 2015 
The table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved
reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated
subsidiaries and equity companies. Gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis
at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. The Corporation has
reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period. When
crude oil and natural gas prices are in the range seen in early 2016 for an
extended period of time, under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC)
definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas could
temporarily not qualify as proved reserves. Under the terms of certain
contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also
increase proved reserves attributable to ExxonMobil. Otherwise, no major
discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since December 31,
2015, that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as
of that date.

In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and
equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation
operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has
for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries. 
The Corporation anticipates several projects will come
online over the next few years providing additional production capacity.
However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of
individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance;
performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact
of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on
production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital
investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and
other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the
requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous
technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis
of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure
declines. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for
projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made
toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably
certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered
can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development
projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals and significant changes
in projections of long-term oil and natural gas price levels. In addition,
proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which
could reduce the level of the Corporation’s capital spending and also impact
our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects.
When crude oil and natural gas prices are in the range seen
in late 2015 and early 2016 for an extended period of time, under the SEC
definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas, such
as oil sands operations in Canada and natural gas operations in North America
could temporarily not qualify as proved reserves. Amounts that could be
required to be de-booked as proved reserves on an SEC basis are subject to
being re-booked as proved reserves at some point in the future when price
levels recover, costs decline, or operating efficiencies occur. Under the terms
of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices
can also increase proved reserves attributable to ExxonMobil. We do not expect
any temporary changes in reported proved reserves under SEC definitions to
affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter our outlook for
future production volumes. 
B. Technologies Used in
Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2015 
Additions to ExxonMobil’s proved reserves in 2015 were
based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate
geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established
technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and
consistent results. 
Data used in these integrated assessments included
information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well
logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information,
production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data
utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect
measurements including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with
available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data
included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary reservoir
modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data analysis
packages. 
In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs
were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase
the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates. 
C. Qualifications of
Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves 
ExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves group that
provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization.
Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves
estimation process for compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the
reporting of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves. This group also maintains the
official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil’s proved reserves of crude
and natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil and natural gas. In addition,
the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation
and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The Manager of the
Global Reserves group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering
and reserves assessment and has a degree in Engineering. He is an active member
of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and previously served on the SPE
Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. The group is staffed with individuals that have
an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum
industry, including expertise in the classification and categorization of
reserves under the SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold
advanced degrees in either Engineering or Geology. Several members of the group
hold professional registrations in their field of expertise, and a member
currently serves on the SPE Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. 

6 



 

The Global Reserves group maintains a
central database containing the official company reserves estimates.
Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update
capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central
database. An annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal
audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical
evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer
review. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central
database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or
subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and
evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization. In
addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require
further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the
operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database.
Endorsement by the Global Reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a
mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews
are held with senior management for final endorsement. 
 2.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
At year-end 2015, approximately 6.8 billion oil-equivalent
barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved
undeveloped. This represents 27 percent of the 24.8 GOEB reported in proved
reserves. This compares to the 8.8 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves reported
at the end of 2014. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted development
activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of approximately
2.7 GOEB from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year-end. The
largest transfers were related to Kearl Expansion project start-up and drilling
activity in the United States. Mainly due to low prices during 2015, the
Corporation reclassified approximately 1 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves,
primarily natural gas reserves in the United States, which no longer meet the
SEC definition of proved reserves.
One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved
reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the
development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy
and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed.
Development projects typically take two to four years from the time of
recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production. However, the
development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years. During
2015, extensions and purchases primarily related to United States
unconventional and Abu Dhabi drilling added approximately 1.7 GOEB of proved
undeveloped reserves. Overall, investments of $19.4 billion were made by the
Corporation during 2015 to progress the development of reported proved
undeveloped reserves, including $17 billion for oil and gas producing
activities and an additional $2.4 billion for other non-oil and gas producing activities
such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related
facilities. These investments represented 76 percent of the $25.4 billion in
total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures. 
Proved undeveloped reserves in Australia, the United
States, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Qatar, and Nigeria have remained
undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity
of infrastructure, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, as well as the
time required to complete development for very large projects. The Corporation
is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the
timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including
completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory
approvals, and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price
levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or
more years, 84 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. The
largest of these is related to LNG/Gas projects in Australia, where
construction of the Gorgon LNG project is under way. In Kazakhstan, the proved
undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial development of
the offshore Kashagan field which is included in the North Caspian Production
Sharing Agreement and the Tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a
production license in the Tengiz – Korolev field complex. The Tengizchevroil
joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to
move to proved developed as approved development phases progress. In the Netherlands,
the Groningen gas field has proved undeveloped reserves related to installation
of future stages of compression. These reserves will move to proved developed
when the additional stages of compression are installed to maintain field
delivery pressure.

Average production prices have been calculated by using
sales quantities from the Corporation’s own production as the divisor. Average
production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the
divisor. The volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production used
for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section
3.A. The volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production
volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in section 3.A.
The natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those shown in
the reserves table in the “Oil and Gas Reserves” part of the “Supplemental
Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of
the Financial Section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared. Gas is
converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand
barrels.

B. Exploratory and Development Activities Regarding Oil and Gas
Resources Extracted by Mining Technologies 
Syncrude Operations. Syncrude is a joint venture established to
recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract
the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32
degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of
a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6
percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited. In 2015, the company’s share of net
production of synthetic crude oil was 58 thousand barrels per day and share of
net acreage was 63 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit. 
Kearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to
recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract
the crude bitumen. Imperial Oil Limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the
joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent.
Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and
a 100 percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of
six oil sands leases covering 49 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands
deposit. 
The Kearl project is located approximately 40 miles north
of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is extracted from oil sands produced
from open-pit mining operations, and processed through bitumen extraction and
froth treatment trains. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped
to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate
or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate
transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2015, average net production at
Kearl was 149 thousand barrels per day. The Kearl Expansion project was
completed and started up in 2015, adding additional capacity of 110 thousand
barrels of bitumen per day.

of which may specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity for
periods longer than one year. ExxonMobil also enters into natural gas sales
contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can
be a combination of our own production and the spot market. Worldwide, we are
contractually committed to deliver approximately 43 million barrels of oil and
2,800 billion cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2016 through 2018.
We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with production
from our proved developed reserves. Any remaining commitments will be fulfilled
with production from our proved undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases
as necessary.

ExxonMobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage
is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks and leases. The terms and
conditions under which the Corporation maintains exploration and/or production
rights to the acreage are property-specific, contractually defined and vary
significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure
that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before
expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to relinquish acreage
in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is
complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where
additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has
generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of
leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not
expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.

D. Summary of Acreage Terms 
UNITED STATES 
Oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired
from mineral interest owners through a lease. Mineral interest owners include
the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral interest owners.
Leases typically have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years, and
a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases.
Under certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term
even if production has not commenced. In some instances regarding private
property, a “fee interest” is acquired where both the surface and the
underlying mineral interests are owned outright. 
CANADA / SOUTH
AMERICA 
Canada 
Exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are
acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible.
These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or
leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and lease
agreements are held as long as there is production on the licenses and leases.
Exploration licenses in offshore eastern Canada and the Beaufort Sea are held
by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. They are valid for a
maximum term of nine years. Production licenses in the offshore are valid for
25 years, with rights of extension for continued production. Significant
discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped
discoveries, do not have a definite term. 
Argentina 
The Federal Hydrocarbon Law was amended in December 2014.
The onshore concession terms granted prior to the amendment are up to six
years, divided into three potential exploration periods, with an optional
extension for up to one year depending on the classification of the area.
Pursuant to the amended law, the production term for a conventional production
concession would be 25 years, and 35 years for an unconventional concession,
with unlimited ten-year extensions possible, once a field has been developed. 
EUROPE 
Germany 
Exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum
period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions of up to three
years each. Extensions are subject to specific, minimum work commitments.
Production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple
possible extensions as long as there is production on the license. 
Netherlands 
Under the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003,
exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are
issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on
the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is
issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the
Mining Law. 
Production rights granted prior to January 1, 2003, remain
subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for onshore and offshore
areas. Onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite; from
1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license,
ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976
were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued
for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years.

Norway 
Licenses issued prior to 1972 were for an initial period of
six years and an extension period of 40 years, with relinquishment of at least
one-fourth of the original area required at the end of the sixth year and
another one-fourth at the end of the ninth year. Licenses issued between 1972
and 1997 were for an initial period of up to six years (with extension of the
initial period of one year at a time up to ten years after 1985), and an
extension period of up to 30 years, with relinquishment of at least one-half of
the original area required at the end of the initial period. Licenses issued
after July 1, 1997, have an initial period of up to ten years and a normal
extension period of up to 30 years or in special cases of up to 50 years, and
with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the
end of the initial period.

 

19 



 

United
Kingdom 
Acreage terms are fixed by the government and are
periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the
first four licensing rounds provided for an initial term of six years with
relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the
initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. At the end of any
such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of
production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on
a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate
in all other areas. The licensing regime was last updated in 2002, and the
majority of licenses issued have an initial term of four years with a second
term extension of four years and a final term of 18 years with a mandatory
relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all
acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.

AFRICA 
Angola 
Exploration and production activities are governed by
production sharing agreements with an initial exploration term of four years
and an optional second phase of two to three years. The production period is
for 25 years, and agreements generally provide for a negotiated extension. 
Chad 
Exploration permits are issued for a period of five years,
and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. The terms and conditions
of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified in a
negotiated convention. The production term is for 30 years and may be extended
up to 50 years at the discretion of the government. 
Equatorial Guinea 
Exploration, development and production activities are
governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the State
Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy. A new PSC was signed in 2015; the
initial exploration period is five years for oil and gas, with multi-year
extensions available at the discretion of the Ministry and limited
relinquishments in the absence of commercial discoveries. The production period
for crude oil ranges from 25 to 30 years, while the production period for
natural gas ranges from 25 to 50 years. 
Nigeria 
Exploration and production activities in the deepwater
offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs)
with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC). NNPC typically holds the underlying Oil Prospecting License (OPL) and
any resulting Oil Mining Lease (OML). The terms of the PSCs are generally 30
years, including a ten-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase
that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an OPL. Upon
commercial discovery, an OPL may be converted to an OML. Partial relinquishment
is required under the PSC at the end of the ten-year exploration period, and
OMLs have a 20-year production period that may be extended. 
Some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by
joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an OPL. OPLs in
deepwater offshore areas are valid for ten years, while in all other areas the
licenses are for five years. Demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis
for conversion of an OPL to an OML. 
OMLs granted prior to the 1969 Petroleum Act (i.e., under
the Mineral Oils Act 1914, repealed by the 1969 Petroleum Act) were for 30
years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed, effective
December 1, 2008, for a further period of 20 years, with a further renewal
option of 20 years. Operations under these pre-1969 OMLs are conducted under a
joint venture agreement with NNPC rather than a PSC. Commercial terms
applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by the
Petroleum Profits Tax Act. 
OMLs granted under the 1969 Petroleum Act, which include
all deepwater OMLs, have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction for
onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12 months’ written notice,
for another period of 20 years. OMLs not held by NNPC are also subject to a
mandatory 50-percent relinquishment after the first ten years of their duration.

 ASIA
 
Azerbaijan 
The production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development
of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field is established for an initial period of 30
years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994. 
Other exploration and production activities are governed by
PSAs negotiated with the national oil company of Azerbaijan. The exploration
period consists of three or four years with the possibility of a one to
three-year extension. The production period, which includes development, is for
25 years or 35 years with the possibility of one or two five-year extensions. 
Indonesia 
Exploration and production activities in Indonesia are
generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a
production sharing contract (PSC), negotiated with BPMIGAS, a government agency
established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and gas activities. In 2012,
Indonesia’s Constitutional Court ruled certain articles of law relating to
BPMIGAS to be unconstitutional, but stated that all existing PSCs signed with
BPMIGAS should remain in force until their expiry, and the functions and duties
previously performed by BPMIGAS are to be carried out by the relevant Ministry
of the Government of Indonesia until the promulgation of a new oil and gas law.
By presidential decree, SKKMIGAS became the interim successor to BPMIGAS. The
current PSCs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended up
to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. PSCs generally require the
contractor to relinquish 10 percent to 20 percent of the contract area after
three years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more than 50
percent to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending
on the acreage and terms. 
Iraq 
Development and production activities in the state-owned
oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil companies of the
Iraqi Ministry of Oil. An ExxonMobil affiliate entered into a contract with
South Oil Company of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for the rights to participate in
the development and production activities of the West Qurna Phase I oil
and gas field effective March 1, 2010. The term of the contract is 20 years
with the right to extend for five years. The contract provides for cost
recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production above specified levels.

Exploration and production activities in the Kurdistan
Region of Iraq are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated
with the regional government of Kurdistan in 2011. The exploration term is for
five years, with extensions available as provided by the PSCs and at the
discretion of the regional government of Kurdistan. The production period is 20
years with the right to extend for five years. 
Kazakhstan 
Onshore exploration and production activities are governed
by the production license, exploration license and joint venture agreements
negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production operations have
a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993. 
Offshore exploration and production activities are governed
by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal periods for
each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes
development, is for 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with
the possibility of two ten-year extensions. 
Malaysia 
Production activities are governed by production sharing
contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company. The PSCs have terms
ranging up to 29 years. All extensions are subject to the national oil
company’s prior written approval. The total production period is 15 to 29
years, depending on the provisions of the respective contract. 
Qatar 
The State of Qatar grants gas production development
project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore North Field to
permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to
satisfy the gas and LNG sales obligations of these projects. 
Republic of Yemen 
The Jannah production sharing agreement has a development
period extending 20 years from first commercial declaration, which was made in
June 1995. Due to force majeure events, the development period has been
extended beyond its original expiration date by an additional 400 days, with
the possibility of further extensions due to ongoing force majeure events.

 

21 



 

Russia 
Terms for ExxonMobil’s Sakhalin acreage are fixed by the
production sharing agreement (PSA) that became effective in 1996 between the
Russian government and the Sakhalin-1 consortium, of which ExxonMobil is the
operator. The term of the PSA is 20 years from the Declaration of
Commerciality, which would be 2021. The term may be extended thereafter in
ten-year increments as specified in the PSA.
Exploration and production activities in the Kara, Laptev,
Chukchi and Black Seas are governed by joint venture agreements concluded with
Rosneft in 2013 and 2014 that cover certain of Rosneft’s offshore licenses. The
Kara Sea licenses covered by the joint venture agreements concluded in 2013
extend through 2040 and include an exploration period through 2020. Additional
licenses in the Kara, Laptev and Chukchi Seas covered by the joint venture
agreements concluded in 2014 extend through 2043 and include an exploration
period through 2023. The Kara, Laptev and Chukchi Sea licenses require
development plan submission within eight years of a discovery and development
activities within five years of plan approval. The Black Sea exploration
license extends through 2017 and a discovery is the basis for obtaining a
license for production. Refer to the relevant portion of “Note 7: Equity
Company Information” of the Financial Section of this report for additional
information on the Corporation’s participation in Rosneft joint venture
activities. 
Thailand 
The Petroleum Act of 1971 allows production under
ExxonMobil’s concession for 30 years with a ten-year extension at terms
generally prevalent at the time. 
United Arab Emirates 
An interest in the development and production activities of
the Upper Zakum field, a major offshore field, was acquired effective as of
January 2006, for a term expiring March 2026, and in 2013 the governing
agreements were extended to 2041. 
AUSTRALIA / OCEANIA 
Australia 
Exploration and production activities conducted offshore in
Commonwealth waters are governed by Federal legislation. Exploration permits
are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year
renewal periods. Retention leases may be granted for resources that are not
commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to become
commercially viable within 15 years. These are granted for periods of five
years and renewals may be requested. Prior to July 1998, production licenses were
granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and
thereafter “indefinitely”, i.e., for the life of the field. Effective from July
1998, new production licenses are granted “indefinitely”. In each case, a
production license may be terminated if no production operations have been
carried on for five years. 
Papua New Guinea 
Exploration and production activities are governed by the
Oil and Gas Act. Petroleum Prospecting licenses are granted for an initial term
of six years with a five-year extension possible (an additional extension of
three years is possible in certain circumstances). Generally, a 50-percent
relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial
six-year term, if extended. Petroleum Development licenses are granted for an
initial 25-year period. An extension of up to 20 years may be granted at the
Minister’s discretion. Petroleum Retention licenses may be granted for gas
resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but may
become commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15
years. Petroleum Retention licenses are granted for five-year terms, and may be
extended, at the Minister’s discretion, twice for the maximum retention time of
15 years. Extensions of Petroleum Retention licenses may be for periods of less
than one year, renewable annually, if the Minister considers at the time of
extension that the resources could become commercially viable in less than five
years.

Item 3.       Legal
Proceedings
As
reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2015,
following ExxonMobil Oil Corporation’s (EMOC) self-reporting of an air emission
event at the ExxonMobil Beaumont Chemical Plant, the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ) notified EMOC on September 17, 2015, that it was
seeking a penalty of $150,000 for exceeding provisions of the Texas
Administrative Code and the Texas Health and Safety Code. On December 15, 2015,
the TCEQ agreed with EMOC on the duration of the event, and the parties agreed
to an administrative penalty of $50,000, of which $25,000 was paid to the TCEQ
on January 7, 2016. The balance will be paid for a Supplemental Environmental Project
upon endorsement by the TCEQ.
Refer to the relevant portions of “Note 16: Litigation

intention to resume purchases of shares of its common stock for the treasury
both to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and
programs and to gradually reduce the number of shares outstanding. The
announcement did not specify an amount or expiration date. The Corporation has
continued to purchase shares since this announcement and to report purchased
volumes in its quarterly earnings releases. In its most recent earnings release
dated February 2, 2016, the Corporation stated it will continue to acquire
shares to offset dilution in conjunction with benefit plans and programs, but
does not plan on making purchases to reduce shares outstanding.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS 
 

Listed below are definitions of several of
ExxonMobil’s key business and financial performance measures. These definitions
are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation. 
Cash Flow From Operations and Asset Sales 
Cash
flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by
operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries,
property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources
of cash from both operating the Corporation’s assets and from the divesting of
assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review
process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the Corporation’s
strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these
objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular
nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider
proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating
activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and
financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Capital Employed 
Capital
employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of
how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes ExxonMobil’s net share
of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding
both short-term and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the
sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes
ExxonMobil’s share of total debt and equity. Both of these views include
ExxonMobil’s share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the
Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure
of capital employed.

Return on
Average Capital Employed 
Return
on average capital employed (ROCE) is a performance measure ratio. From the
perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings
divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and
end-of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil’s share of
segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed
definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation’s total ROCE is
net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of
financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation
has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the
best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive,
long-term industry, both to evaluate management’s performance and to
demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long
term. Additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make
investment decisions.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
Statements
in this discussion regarding expectations, plans and future events or
conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual future financial and
operating results, including demand growth and energy source mix; capacity
increases; production growth and mix; rates of field decline; financing
sources; the resolution of contingencies and uncertain tax
positions; environmental and capital expenditures; could differ materially
depending on a number of factors, such as changes in the supply of and demand
for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum and petrochemical products and
resulting price impacts; the outcome of commercial negotiations; the impact of fiscal
and commercial terms; political or regulatory events, and other factors
discussed herein and in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
The
term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different
activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government
payment transparency reports.
 
OVERVIEW 
The
following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil’s financial results, as well as
the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated
financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the
management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation’s accounting and
financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving
the extracting, manufacturing and marketing of hydrocarbons and
hydrocarbon-based products. The Corporation’s business model involves the
production (or purchase), manufacture and sale of physical products, and all
commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical
movement of goods. 
ExxonMobil,
with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and
technology portfolio, is well-positioned to participate in substantial
investments to develop new energy supplies. The company’s integrated business
model, with significant investments in Upstream, Downstream and Chemical
segments, reduces the Corporation’s risk from changes in commodity prices. While
commodity prices are volatile on a short-term basis and depend on supply and
demand, ExxonMobil’s investment decisions are based on our long-term business
outlook, using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most
attractive investment opportunities. The corporate plan is a fundamental annual
management process that is the basis for setting near-term operating and
capital objectives in addition to providing the longer-term economic
assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes. Volumes are based on
individual field production profiles, which are also updated annually. Price
ranges for crude oil, natural gas, refined products, and chemical products are
based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and are
utilized for investment evaluation purposes. Potential investment opportunities
are evaluated over a wide range of economic scenarios to establish the
resiliency of each opportunity. Once investments are made, a reappraisal
process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements
are incorporated into future projects.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 

BUSINESS
ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT 
Long-Term Business Outlook 
By
2040, the world’s population is projected to grow to approximately 9 billion
people, or about 1.8 billion more than in 2014. Coincident with this
population increase, the Corporation expects worldwide economic growth to
average close to 3 percent per year. As economies and populations grow,
and as living standards improve for billions of people, the need for energy
will continue to rise. Even with significant efficiency gains, global energy
demand is projected to rise by about 25 percent from 2014 to 2040. This
demand increase is expected to be concentrated in developing countries (i.e.,
those that are not member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co‑operation
and Development).  
As
expanding prosperity drives global energy demand higher, increasing use of
energy‑efficient and lower‑emission fuels, technologies and
practices will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and
emissions per unit of economic output over time. Substantial efficiency gains
are likely in all key aspects of the world’s economy through 2040, affecting
energy requirements for transportation, power generation, industrial
applications, and residential and commercial needs.
Energy
for transportation – including cars, trucks, ships, trains and airplanes – is
expected to increase by about 30 percent from 2014 to 2040. The growth in
transportation energy demand is likely to account for approximately 60 percent
of the growth in liquid fuels demand worldwide over this period. Nearly all the
world’s transportation fleets will continue to run on liquid fuels, which are
abundant, widely available, easy to transport, and provide a large quantity of
energy in small volumes.
Demand
for electricity around the world is likely to increase approximately
65 percent from 2014 to 2040, led by growth in developing countries.
Consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to remain the
largest and fastest‑growing major segment of global energy demand.
Meeting the expected growth in power demand will require a diverse set of
energy sources. Today, coal‑fired generation provides about 40 percent
of the world’s electricity, but by 2040 its share is likely to decline to about
30 percent, in part as a result of policies to improve air quality and
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the risks of climate change. From 2014 to
2040, the amount of electricity generated using natural gas, nuclear power, and
renewables are all likely to double. By 2040, coal, natural gas and renewables
are projected to be generating approximately the same share of electricity
worldwide, although significant differences will exist across regions
reflecting a wide range of factors including the cost and availability of
energy types.
Liquid
fuels provide the largest share of global energy supplies today due to their
broad-based availability, affordability and ease of transportation,
distribution and storage to meet consumer needs. By 2040, global demand for
liquid fuels is projected to grow to approximately 112 million barrels of
oil‑equivalent per day, an increase of about 20 percent from 2014.
Globally, crude production from traditional conventional sources will likely
decrease slightly through 2040, with significant development activity mostly
offsetting natural declines from these fields. However, this decrease is
expected to be more than offset by rising production from a variety of emerging
supply sources – including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids
and biofuels. The world’s resource base is sufficient to meet projected demand
through 2040 as technology advances continue to expand the availability of
economic supply options. However, access to resources and timely investments
will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable, affordable supplies.
Natural
gas is a versatile fuel, suitable for a wide variety of applications, and it is
expected to be the fastest-growing major fuel source from 2014 to 2040, meeting
about 40 percent of global energy demand growth. Global natural gas demand
is expected to rise about 50 percent from 2014 to 2040, with about
45 percent of that increase in the Asia Pacific region. Helping meet these
needs will be significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas ‑ the
natural gas found in shale and other rock formations that was once considered
uneconomic to produce. In total, about 60 percent of the growth in natural
gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources. However, we expect
conventionally-produced natural gas to remain the cornerstone of supply,
meeting about two‑thirds of global demand in 2040. The worldwide
liquefied natural gas (LNG) market is expected to almost triple by 2040, with
much of this supply expected to meet rising demand in Asia Pacific.
The
world’s energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through 2040. Oil is
expected to remain the largest source of energy with its share remaining close
to one‑third in 2040. Coal is currently the second largest source of
energy, but it is likely to lose that position to natural gas in the 2025‑2030
timeframe. The share of natural gas is expected to exceed 25 percent by
2040, while the share of coal falls to about 20 percent. Nuclear power is
projected to grow significantly, as many nations are likely to expand nuclear
capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and
environmental issues. Total renewable energy is likely to reach about
15 percent of total energy by 2040, with biomass, hydro and geothermal
contributing a combined share of more than 10 percent. Total energy supplied
from wind, solar and biofuels is expected to increase rapidly, growing close to
250 percent from 2014 to 2040, when they will be approaching
4 percent of world energy.
The
Corporation anticipates that the world’s available oil and gas resource base
will grow not only from new discoveries, but also from reserve increases in
previously discovered fields. Technology will underpin these increases. The
cost to develop and supply these resources will be significant. According to
the International Energy Agency, the investment required to meet oil and
natural 

41 



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 

gas supply requirements worldwide over the
period 2015‑2040 will be about $25 trillion (measured in 2014
dollars) or approximately $1 trillion per year on average.
International
accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering greenhouse
gas emissions continue to evolve with uncertain timing and outcome, making it
difficult to predict their business impact. For many years, the Corporation has
taken into account policies established to reduce energy‑related
greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term Outlook for Energy, which is
used as a foundation for assessing the business environment and business
strategies and investments. The climate accord reached at the recent Conference
of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris set many new goals, and while many
related policies are still emerging, the Outlook for Energy continues to
anticipate that such policies will increase the cost of carbon dioxide emissions
over time. For purposes of the Outlook for Energy, we continue to assume
that governments will enact policies that impose rising costs on energy‑related
CO2 emissions, which we assume will reach an implied cost in OECD nations
of about $80 per tonne in 2040. China and other leading non‑OECD
nations are expected to trail OECD policy initiatives. Nevertheless, as people and
nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will
continue to need practical solutions that do not jeopardize the affordability
or reliability of the energy they need. Thus, all practical and economically
viable energy sources, both conventional and unconventional, will be needed to
continue meeting global energy needs – because of the scale of worldwide energy
demand. 
The
information provided in the Long‑Term Business Outlook includes
ExxonMobil’s internal estimates and forecasts based upon internal data and
analyses as well as publicly available information from external sources
including the International Energy Agency.
 
Upstream 
ExxonMobil
continues to maintain a diverse portfolio of exploration and development
opportunities, which enables the Corporation to be selective, maximizing
shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil’s
fundamental Upstream business strategies guide our global exploration,
development, production, and gas and power marketing activities. These
strategies include capturing material and accretive opportunities to
continually high-grade the resource portfolio, exercising a disciplined
approach to investing and cost management, developing and applying high-impact
technologies, pursuing productivity and efficiency gains, growing profitable
oil and gas production, and capitalizing on growing natural gas and power
markets. These strategies are underpinned by a relentless focus on operational
excellence, commitment to innovative technologies, development of our
employees, and investment in the communities within which we operate. 
As
future development projects and drilling activities bring new production
online, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type
of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Oil equivalent production
from North America is expected to increase over the next several years based on
current capital activity plans, contributing over a third of total production. Further,
the proportion of our global production from resource types utilizing
specialized technologies such as arctic, deepwater, and unconventional drilling
and production systems, as well as LNG, is also expected to grow, becoming a
slight majority of production in the next few years. We do not anticipate that
the expected change in the geographic mix of production volumes, and in the
types of opportunities from which volumes will be produced, will have a
material impact on the nature and the extent of the risks disclosed in Item 1A.
Risk Factors, or result in a material change in our level of unit operating
expenses. 
The
Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few
years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will
vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups;
operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery
projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset
sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes
in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the
oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk
Factors.
The
upstream industry environment has been challenged throughout 2015 with abundant
crude oil supply causing crude oil prices to decrease to levels not seen since
2004, while natural gas prices remained depressed. However, current market conditions
are not necessarily indicative of future conditions. The markets for crude
oil and natural gas have a history of significant price
volatility. ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to
be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a
function of global economic growth. On the supply side, prices may be
significantly impacted by political events, the actions of OPEC and other large
government resource owners, and other factors. To manage the risks associated
with price, ExxonMobil evaluates annual plans and all investments across a wide
range of price scenarios. The Corporation’s assessment is that its operations
will exhibit strong performance over the long term. This is the outcome of
disciplined investment, cost management, asset enhancement programs, and
application of advanced technologies. 
 
Downstream 
ExxonMobil’s
Downstream is a large, diversified business with refining, logistics, and
marketing complexes around the world. The Corporation has a presence in mature
markets in North America and Europe, as well as in the growing Asia Pacific
region.

42 



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 

ExxonMobil’s fundamental Downstream
business strategies competitively position the company across a range of market
conditions. These strategies include targeting best‑in‑class
operations in all aspects of the business, maximizing value from advanced
technologies, capitalizing on integration across ExxonMobil businesses,
selectively investing for resilient, advantaged returns, operating efficiently
and effectively, and providing quality, valued and differentiated products and
services to customers. 
ExxonMobil’s
operating results, as noted in Item 2. Properties, reflect 23 refineries,
located in 14 countries, with distillation capacity of 5 million
barrels per day and lubricant basestock manufacturing capacity of 136 thousand
barrels per day. ExxonMobil’s fuels and lubes marketing businesses have
significant global reach, with multiple channels to market serving a diverse
customer base. Our portfolio of world-renowned brands includes Exxon, Mobil,
Esso  and Mobil 1.  
The
downstream industry environment improved in 2015. Growth in global demand,
stimulated by lower prices for crude oil and transportation fuels, resulted in
higher refinery utilization and margins, particularly in Europe and Asia
Pacific. Refineries in North America continue to benefit from lower raw
material and energy costs due to the abundant supply of crude oil and natural gas.
In the near term, we see variability in refining margins, with some regions
seeing weaker margins as new capacity additions are expected to outpace growth
in global demand for our products, which can also be affected by global
economic conditions and regulatory changes.
Refining
margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a function
of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials (primarily
crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced (primarily
gasoline, heating oil, diesel oil, jet fuel and fuel oil). Crude oil and many
products are widely traded with published prices, including those quoted on
multiple exchanges around the world (e.g., New York Mercantile Exchange and
Intercontinental Exchange). Prices for these commodities are determined by the
global marketplace and are influenced by many factors, including global and
regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, industry refinery
operations, import/export balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal demand,
weather and political climate. 
ExxonMobil’s
long‑term outlook is that industry refining margins will remain subject
to intense competition as new capacity additions outpace the growth in global
demand. ExxonMobil’s integration across the value chain, from refining to
marketing, enhances overall value in both fuels and lubricants businesses.
As
described in more detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors, proposed carbon policy and
other climate‑related regulations in many countries, as well as the
continued growth in biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the
Downstream business 
In
the retail fuels marketing business, competition has caused inflation‑adjusted
margins to decline. In 2015, ExxonMobil expanded its branded retail site
network and progressed the multi‑year transition of the direct served
(i.e., dealer, company‑operated) retail network in portions of Europe to
a more capital‑efficient Branded Wholesaler model. The company’s
lubricants business continues to grow, leveraging world‑class brands and
integration with industry‑leading basestock refining capability.
ExxonMobil remains a market leader in the high‑value synthetic lubricants
sector, despite increasing competition. 
The
Downstream portfolio is continually evaluated during all parts of the business
cycle, and numerous asset divestments have been made over the past decade. In
2015, the company divested its 50 percent share of Chalmette Refining, LLC, and
reached an agreement for the sale of the refinery in Torrance, California, with
change-in-control expected by mid-2016. When investing in the Downstream,
ExxonMobil remains focused on selective and resilient projects. In 2015,
construction continued on a new delayed coker unit at the refinery in Antwerp,
Belgium, to upgrade low‑value bunker fuel into higher value diesel
products. Funding was approved for the construction of a proprietary
hydrocracker at the refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands, to produce higher value
ultra‑low sulfur diesel and Group II basestocks. The company completed an
expansion of lubricant basestock capacity at the refinery in Baytown, Texas.
Finished lubricant plant expansions in China and Finland were completed, and an
expansion in Singapore is underway to support demand growth for finished
lubricants and greases in key markets.
 
Chemical 
Worldwide
petrochemical demand continued to improve in 2015, led by growing demand from
Asia Pacific manufacturers of industrial and consumer products. North America
continued to benefit from abundant supplies of natural gas and gas liquids,
providing both low‑cost feedstock and energy. Specialty product margins
improved in 2015, but continued to be impacted by new industry capacity. 
ExxonMobil
sustained its competitive advantage through continued operational excellence,
investment and cost discipline, a balanced portfolio of products, integration
with refining and upstream operations, all underpinned by proprietary
technology.
In
2015, we neared completion of the specialty elastomers project at our joint
venture facility in Al-Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Construction continued on a major
expansion at our Texas facilities, including a new world-scale ethane cracker
and polyethylene lines, to capitalize on low-cost feedstock and energy supplies
in North America and to meet rapidly growing demand for premium polymers.
Construction of new halobutyl rubber and hydrocarbon resin units also
progressed in Singapore to further extend our specialty product capacity in
Asia Pacific.

2015 
Upstream earnings were $7,101 million,
down $20,447 million from 2014. Lower realizations decreased earnings by
$18.8 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$810 million, including contributions from new developments. All other
items decreased earnings by $2.4 billion, primarily due to lower asset
management gains and approximately $500 million of lower favorable one‑time
tax effects, partly offset by lower expenses of about $230 million.  On an oil‑equivalent basis,
production of 4.1 million barrels per day was up 3.2 percent compared
to 2014. Liquids production of 2.3 million barrels per day increased
234,000 barrels per day, with project ramp‑up and entitlement
effects partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production of
10.5 billion cubic feet per day decreased 630 million cubic feet per
day from 2014 as regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline
were partly offset by project ramp‑up, work programs and entitlement
effects.  U.S. Upstream
earnings declined $6,276 million from 2014 to a loss of $1,079 million
in 2015. Earnings outside the U.S. were $8,180 million, down $14,171 million
from the prior year.
 
2014 
Upstream earnings were
$27,548 million, up $707 million from 2013. Lower prices decreased
earnings by $2 billion. Favorable volume effects increased earnings by
$510 million. All other items, primarily asset sales and favorable U.S.
deferred income tax items, increased earnings by $2.2 billion. On an oil‑equivalent
basis, production of 4 million barrels per day was down 4.9 percent
compared to 2013. Excluding the impact of the expiry of the Abu Dhabi onshore
concession, production decreased 1.7 percent. Liquids production of
2.1 million barrels per day decreased 91,000 barrels per day compared
to 2013. The Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry reduced volumes by
135,000 barrels per day. Excluding this impact, liquids production was up
2 percent, driven by project ramp‑up and work programs. Natural gas
production of 11.1 billion cubic feet per day decreased 691 million
cubic feet per day from 2013, as expected U.S. field decline and lower European
demand were partially offset by project ramp‑up and work programs.
Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $5,197 million, up
$1,006 million from 2013. Earnings outside the U.S. were
$22,351 million, down $299 million from the prior year.

Listed below are
descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided
to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
Entitlements - Net Interest are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of
production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining
factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production
Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically occur when cumulative investment
returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity
upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity
redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the
termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred,
it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil
prices.
 
Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of
production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational
volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices
or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of
contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending
variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes
attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are
required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from
period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and
natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net
interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.
 
Quotas are changes in ExxonMobil’s allowable production arising
from production constraints imposed by countries which are members of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Volumes reported in
this category would have been readily producible in the absence of the quota.
 
Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production
arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a
field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. 
 
Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational
and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may
affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not
limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities,
acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand,
natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect
entitlements.

Total
cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion at the end of 2015, $1.0 billion
lower than the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2015 were net income
including noncontrolling interests of $16.6 billion, the adjustment for the
noncash provision of $18.0 billion for depreciation and depletion, and a net
debt increase of $9.3 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for
additions to property, plant and equipment of $26.5 billion, the purchase of
shares of ExxonMobil stock of $4.0 billion, dividends to shareholders of $12.1
billion and a change in working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $3.1
billion. 
Total
cash and cash equivalents were $4.7 billion at the end of 2014, $0.3 billion
lower than the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2014 were net income
including noncontrolling interests of $33.6 billion, the adjustment for the
noncash provision of $17.3 billion for depreciation and depletion, a net debt
increase of $7.0 billion and collection of advances of $3.3 billion. The major
uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment
of $33.0 billion, the purchase of shares of ExxonMobil stock of $13.2 billion,
dividends to shareholders of $11.6 billion and a change in working capital,
excluding cash and debt, of $4.9 billion. Included in total cash and cash
equivalents at year-end 2014 was $42 million of restricted cash. For additional
details, see the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The
Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term
liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of
financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. On
December 31, 2015, the Corporation had unused committed short-term lines of
credit of $6.0 billion and unused committed long-term lines of credit of $0.4
billion. Cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the Corporation’s
immediate needs is carefully managed through counterparty quality and
investment guidelines to ensure it is secure and readily available to meet the
Corporation’s cash requirements and to optimize returns. 
To
support cash flows in future periods the Corporation will need to continually
find and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies
and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase
production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of
oil and gas fields eventually to produce at declining rates for the remainder
of their economic life. Averaged over all the Corporation’s existing oil and
gas fields and without new projects, ExxonMobil’s production is expected to
decline at an average of approximately 3 percent per year over the next few
years. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of
factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid
properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field.
Furthermore, the Corporation’s net interest in production for individual fields
can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms. 
The
Corporation has long been successful at offsetting the effects of natural field
decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project
execution. On average over the last decade, this has resulted in net annual
additions to proved reserves that have exceeded the amount produced. The
Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years
providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary
from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups;
operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil
recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial
terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing
contracts; and changes in the amount and timing of investments that may vary
depending on the oil and gas price environment. The Corporation’s cash flows
are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to
Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more complete discussion of risks. 

 
 

48 



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 

The Corporation’s financial strength
enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures. Capital and
exploration expenditures in 2015 were $31.1 billion, reflecting the
Corporation’s continued active investment program. The Corporation anticipates
an investment level of $23.2 billion in 2016. The Corporation is emerging from
several years of high capital expenditure levels that supported major
long-plateau production projects coming on line. Lower levels of capital
spending over the next few years, partly due to cost savings and capital
efficiencies, are not expected to delay major project schedules nor have a
material effect on our volume capacity outlook.
Actual
spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and
property acquisitions. The Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of
development projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the
overall political and technical risks of the Corporation’s Upstream segment and
associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength, debt capacity and
diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay
of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation’s
liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its
fixed commitments.
 
Cash Flow from
Operating Activities
 
2015 
Cash provided by operating activities
totaled $30.3 billion in 2015, $14.8 billion lower than 2014. The major source
of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $16.6 billion, a
decrease of $17.1 billion. The noncash provision for depreciation and depletion
was $18.0 billion, up $0.8 billion from the prior year. The adjustment for net
gains on asset sales was $0.2 billion compared to an adjustment of $3.2 billion
in 2014. Changes in operational working capital, excluding cash and debt,
decreased cash in 2015 by $3.1 billion.
 
2014 
Cash provided by operating activities
totaled $45.1 billion in 2014, $0.2 billion higher than 2013. The major source

Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 
2015 
Cash
used in financing activities was $7.0 billion in 2015, $10.9 billion lower than
2014. Dividend payments on common shares increased to $2.88 per share from
$2.70 per share and totaled $12.1 billion, a pay-out of 75 percent of net
income. During the first quarter of 2015, the Corporation issued $8.0 billion
of long-term debt. Total debt increased $9.6 billion to $38.7 billion at year‑end.

ExxonMobil
share of equity decreased $3.6 billion to $170.8 billion. The addition to
equity for earnings was $16.2 billion. This was offset by reductions for
distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $15.1 billion, composed of $12.1
billion in dividends and $3.0 billion of share purchases of ExxonMobil stock to
reduce shares outstanding. Foreign exchange translation effects of $8.2 billion
for the stronger U.S. currency reduced equity, while a $3.6 billion change in
the funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves increased equity.
During 2015, Exxon Mobil Corporation
purchased 48 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross
cost of $4.0 billion. These purchases were to reduce the number of shares
outstanding and to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit
plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced by 1.1 percent from 4,201
million to 4,156 million at the end of 2015. Purchases were made in both the
open market and through negotiated transactions. Purchases may be increased,
decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
2014 
Cash
used in financing activities was $17.9 billion in 2014, $2.4 billion higher
than 2013. Dividend payments on common shares increased to $2.70 per share from
$2.46 per share and totaled $11.6 billion, a pay-out of 36 percent of net income.
During the first quarter of 2014, the Corporation issued $5.5 billion of
long-term debt. Total debt increased $6.4 billion to $29.1 billion at year‑end.

ExxonMobil
share of equity increased $0.4 billion to $174.4 billion. The addition to
equity for earnings was $32.5 billion. This was offset by reductions for
distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $23.6 billion, composed of $11.6
billion in dividends and $12.0 billion of share purchases of ExxonMobil stock
to reduce shares outstanding. Foreign exchange translation effects of $5.1
billion for the stronger U.S. currency and a $3.1 billion change in the funded
status of the postretirement benefits reserves also reduced equity.
During 2014, Exxon Mobil Corporation
purchased 136 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross
cost of $13.2 billion. These purchases were to reduce the number of shares
outstanding and to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit
plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced by 3.1 percent from 4,335
million to 4,201 million at the end of 2014. Purchases were made in both the
open market and through negotiated transactions.

This
table excludes commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no
fixed or minimum price) which are resold shortly after purchase, either in an
active, highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts
with similar pricing terms. Examples include long-term, noncancelable LNG and
natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refinery products
at market prices. Inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in
assessing liquidity and cash flow, because these purchases will be offset in
the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions. The
table also excludes unrecognized tax benefits totaling $9.4 billion as of
December 31, 2015, because the Corporation is unable to make reasonably
reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing
authorities. Further details on the unrecognized tax benefits can be found in “Note
19: Income, Sales-Based and Other Taxes.”
Notes: 
(1)   Includes capitalized lease
obligations of $1,238 million. 
(2)   The amount due in one year is
included in notes and loans payable of $18,762 million. 
(3)   The fair value of asset retirement
obligations, primarily upstream asset removal costs at the completion of field
life. 
(4)   The amount by which the benefit
obligations exceeded the fair value of fund assets for certain U.S. and
non-U.S. pension and other postretirement plans at year end. The payments by
period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in 2016 and
estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years. 
(5)   Minimum commitments for operating
leases, shown on an undiscounted basis, cover drilling equipment, tankers,
service stations and other properties. Total includes $1,621 million related to
drilling rigs and related equipment.
(6)   Unconditional purchase obligations
(UPOs) are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable
only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure
financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or
services. The undiscounted obligations of $936 million mainly pertain to
pipeline throughput agreements and include $411 million of obligations to
equity companies. 
(7)   Take-or-pay obligations are
noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services other than UPOs.
The undiscounted obligations of $24,870 million mainly pertain to pipeline,
manufacturing supply and terminal agreements. 
(8)   Firm commitments related to capital
projects, shown on an undiscounted basis, totaled approximately $15.2 billion.
These commitments were primarily associated with Upstream projects outside the
U.S., of which $8.0 billion was associated with projects in Africa, United Arab
Emirates, Canada, Malaysia, Kazakhstan and Australia. The Corporation expects
to fund the majority of these projects with internally generated funds, supplemented by
long-term and short-term debt.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 

Guarantees 
The
Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently
liable at December 31, 2015, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and
performance under contracts (Note 16). Where guarantees for environmental
remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts
reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. These guarantees
are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 
Financial Strength 
On
December 31, 2015, the Corporation’s unused short-term committed lines of credit
totaled approximately $6.0 billion (Note 6) and unused long-term committed
lines of credit totaled approximately $0.4 billion (Note 14). The table below
shows the Corporation’s fixed-charge coverage and consolidated debt-to-capital
ratios. The data demonstrate the Corporation’s creditworthiness.

Management
views the Corporation’s financial strength, as evidenced by the above financial
ratios and other similar measures, to be a competitive advantage of strategic
importance. The Corporation’s sound financial position gives it the opportunity
to access the world’s capital markets in the full range of market conditions,
and enables the Corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in
the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value. 
 
Litigation and Other Contingencies 
As
discussed in Note 16, a variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Based
on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation
does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against
ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation’s
operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.
There are no events or uncertainties beyond those already included in reported
financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating
results or financial condition. Refer to Note 16 for additional information on
legal proceedings and other contingencies.

Capital
and exploration expenditures in 2015 were $31.1 billion, as the Corporation
continued to pursue opportunities to find and produce new supplies of oil and
natural gas to meet global demand for energy. The Corporation anticipates an investment
level of $23.2 billion in 2016. Actual spending could vary depending on the
progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.
Upstream
spending of $25.4 billion in 2015 was down 22 percent from 2014, reflecting key
project start-ups and capital efficiencies. Investments in 2015 included
projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, U.S. onshore drilling and
continued progress on world-class projects in Canada and Australia. The
majority of expenditures are on development projects, which typically take two
to four years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the
start of production. The percentage of proved developed reserves was 73 percent
of total proved reserves at year-end 2015, and has been over 60 percent for the
last ten years.
Capital
investments in the Downstream totaled $2.6 billion in 2015, a decrease of $0.4
billion from 2014, mainly reflecting lower refining project spending. The
Chemical capital expenditures of $2.8 billion increased $0.1 billion from 2014
with higher investments in the U.S.

decrease of $25.0 billion or 30 percent from 2014. Income tax expense, both
current and deferred, was $5.4 billion, $12.6 billion lower than 2014, as a
result of lower earnings and a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate
was 34 percent compared to 41 percent in the prior year due primarily to a
lower share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Sales-based and all other
taxes and duties of $52.5 billion in 2015 decreased $12.4 billion as a result
of lower sales realizations.
 
2014 
Income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $82.9 billion in 2014, a
decrease of $8.4 billion or 9 percent from 2013. Income tax expense, both
current and deferred, was $18.0 billion, $6.2 billion lower than 2013, as a
result of a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was 41 percent
compared to 48 percent in the prior year due primarily to impacts related to
the Corporation’s asset management program and favorable U.S. deferred tax
items. Sales-based and all other taxes and duties of $64.9 billion in 2014
decreased $2.1 billion.

Throughout
ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and
minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground. These
include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to
manufacture clean fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce
nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for
asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by
the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2015 worldwide environmental
expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including
ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenditures, were $5.6 billion, of
which $3.8 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital
expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to decrease to
approximately $5 billion in 2016 and 2017, mainly reflecting lower project
activity in Canada. Capital expenditures are expected to account for approximately
30 percent of the total.  
 
Environmental Liabilities 
The
Corporation accrues environmental liabilities when it is probable that
obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously
disposed. ExxonMobil has accrued liabilities for probable environmental
remediation obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified ExxonMobil as one of the
potentially responsible parties. The involvement of other financially
responsible companies at these multiparty sites could mitigate ExxonMobil’s
actual joint and several liability exposure. At present, no individual site is
expected to have losses material to ExxonMobil’s operations or financial
condition. Consolidated company provisions made in 2015 for environmental
liabilities were $371 million ($780 million in 2014) and the balance
sheet reflects accumulated liabilities of $837 million as of
December 31, 2015, and $1,066 million as of December 31, 2014.

Crude
oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in
response to changing market forces. The impacts of these price fluctuations on
earnings from Upstream, Downstream and Chemical operations have varied. In the
Upstream, a $1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized
price of oil would have approximately a $375 million annual after-tax effect on
Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings. Similarly, a $0.10 per kcf
change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $150
million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company
earnings. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will
be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, taxes and
other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas
contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly, changes in
benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of
changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period. 
In
the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings are
primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of
products sold. Refining margins are a function of the difference between what a
refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices
for the range of products produced. These prices in turn depend on global and
regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations,
import/export balances and weather.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 

The global
energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are
adverse to one or more of the Corporation’s businesses. Such conditions, along
with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times
associated with many of our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining
a strong financial position. Management views the Corporation’s financial
strength as a competitive advantage. 
In
general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell and/or
purchase products to/from other segments. Instead, where such sales take place,
they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of integrated
refinery/chemical complexes. Additionally, intersegment sales are at
market-based prices. The products bought and sold between segments can also be
acquired in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity and
transportation capabilities. About 35 percent of the Corporation’s intersegment
sales represent Upstream production sold to the Downstream. Other intersegment
sales include those between refineries and chemical plants related to raw
materials, feedstocks and finished products. 
Although
price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over
the short to medium term due to global economic conditions, political events, decisions
by OPEC and other major government resource owners and other factors, industry
economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and
demand. Accordingly, the Corporation evaluates the viability of all of its
investments over a broad range of prices. The Corporation’s assessment is that
its operations will continue to be successful over the long term in a variety
of market conditions. This is the outcome of disciplined investment and asset
management programs. 
The
Corporation has an active asset management program in which underperforming
assets are either improved to acceptable levels or considered for divestment.
The asset management program includes a disciplined, regular review to ensure
that all assets are contributing to the Corporation’s strategic objectives. The
result is an efficient capital base, and the Corporation has seldom had to
write down the carrying value of assets, even during periods of low commodity
prices. 
 
Risk Management 
The
Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the
complementary nature of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce
the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates, currency
rates and commodity prices. As a result, the Corporation makes limited use of
derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of such changes. With respect to
derivatives activities, the Corporation believes that there are no material
market or credit risks to the Corporation’s financial position, results of
operations or liquidity as a result of the derivatives described in Note 13.
The Corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or
derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with leveraged features.
Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated
by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the
quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The
Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization,
reporting and monitoring of derivative activity. 
The
Corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on its
short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating
interest rates. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates
affecting the Corporation’s debt would not be material to earnings, cash flow
or fair value. The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term
and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the
majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term
debt. Some joint-venture partners are dependent on the credit markets, and
their funding ability may impact the development pace of joint-venture
projects. 
The
Corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to
exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses, financing and
investment transactions. The impacts of fluctuations in exchange rates on ExxonMobil’s
geographically and functionally diverse operations are varied and often
offsetting in amount. The Corporation makes limited use of currency exchange
contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, and exposures
related to the Corporation’s limited use of the currency exchange contracts are
not material. 
 
Inflation and Other Uncertainties 
The
general rate of inflation in many major countries of operation has remained
moderate over the past few years, and the associated impact on non-energy costs
has generally been mitigated by cost reductions from efficiency and
productivity improvements. Beginning several years ago, an extended period of
increased demand for certain services and materials resulted in higher
operating and capital costs. More recently, multiple market changes, including
general commodity price decreases, lower oil prices and reduced upstream industry
activity, have contributed to lower prices for oilfield services and materials.
The Corporation works to minimize costs in all commodity price environments through
its economies of scale in global procurement and its efficient project
management practices.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 

RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is
required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. 
“Sales
and Other Operating Revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes
sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales transactions. When the Corporation
adopts the standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf
of third parties. This change in reporting will not impact earnings.
The
Corporation continues to evaluate other areas of the standard and its effect on
the Corporation’s financial statements. 
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
The
Corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its
straightforward business model involving the extracting, refining and marketing
of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based products. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Corporation’s accounting
policies are summarized in Note 1. 
 
Oil and Gas Reserves 
Evaluations
of oil and gas reserves are important to the effective management of upstream
assets. They are an integral part of investment decisions about oil and gas
properties such as whether development should proceed. Oil and gas reserve
quantities are also used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production
depreciation rates and to evaluate impairment. 
Oil
and gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves. Proved oil and gas
reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience
and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be
economically producible. Unproved reserves are those with less than reasonable
certainty of recoverability and include probable reserves. Probable reserves
are reserves that, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be
recovered. 
The
estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical
evaluations, commercial and market assessment, and detailed analysis of well
information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines. The estimation
of proved reserves is controlled by the Corporation through long-standing
approval guidelines. Reserve changes are made within a well-established,
disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering
professionals, assisted by the Reserves Technical Oversight group which has
significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by
senior management. Notably, the Corporation does not use specific quantitative
reserve targets to determine compensation. Key features of the reserve
estimation process are covered in Disclosure of Reserves in Item 2. 
Although
the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced,
the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors
including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory
approvals and significant changes in long-term oil and gas price levels. 
Proved
reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves. The
percentage of proved developed reserves was 73 percent of total proved reserves
at year-end 2015 (including both consolidated and equity company reserves), and
has been over 60 percent for the last ten years.
Revisions
can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of
proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of
(1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new
geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in prices and year-end
costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from
significant changes in development strategy or production equipment/facility
capacity. 
When
crude oil and natural gas prices are in the range seen in late 2015 and early
2016 for an extended period of time, under the SEC definition of proved
reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas, such as oil sands
operations in Canada and natural gas operations in North America could
temporarily not qualify as proved reserves. Amounts that could be required to
be de-booked as proved reserves on an SEC basis are subject to being re-booked
as proved reserves at some point in the future when price levels recover, costs
decline, or operating efficiencies occur. Under the terms of certain
contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also
increase proved reserves attributable to ExxonMobil. We do not expect any
temporary changes in reported proved reserves under SEC definitions to affect
the operation of the underlying projects or to alter our outlook for future
production volumes.
 

56 



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 

Impact of Oil and Gas Reserves on Depreciation. The calculation of unit-of-production depreciation is
a critical accounting estimate that measures the depreciation of upstream assets.
It is the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved reserves or proved
developed reserves (those proved reserves recoverable through existing wells
with existing equipment and operating methods), applied to the asset cost. In
the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable
allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative
such as the straight-line method is used. The volumes produced and asset cost
are known and, while proved reserves have a high probability of recoverability
they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability. While the
revisions the Corporation has made in the past are an indicator of variability,
they have had a very small impact on the unit-of-production rates because they
have been small compared to the large reserves base. 
Impact
of Oil and Gas Reserves, Prices and Margins on Testing for Impairment. The Corporation performs impairment assessments
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of its
long-lived assets (or group of assets) may not be recoverable through future
operations or disposition. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which
there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets for this assessment. 
Potential
trigger events for impairment evaluation include:
·        
a significant decrease in the
market price of a long-lived asset;
·        
a significant adverse change in
the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical
condition including a significant decrease in current and projected reserve
volumes;
·        
a significant adverse change in
legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
·        
an accumulation of project costs
significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;
·        
a current-period operating loss
combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and
·        
a current expectation that, more
likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of
significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
The
Corporation performs asset valuation analyses on an ongoing basis as a part of
its asset management program. These analyses and other profitability reviews
assist the Corporation in assessing whether the carrying amounts of any of its
assets may not be recoverable.
In
general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as a
trigger event for conducting impairment tests. The markets for crude oil,
natural gas and petroleum products have a history of significant price
volatility. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry
prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and
demand. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is
declining, but this is being offset by production from new discoveries and
field developments. OPEC production policies also have an impact on world oil
supplies. The demand side is largely a function of global economic growth. The
relative growth/decline in supply versus demand will determine industry prices
over the long term, and these cannot be accurately predicted. 
If
there were a trigger event, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted
cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying
amounts. Cash flows used in impairment evaluations are developed using
estimates for future crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, refining and
chemical margins, and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on
projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. These
evaluations make use of the Corporation’s price, margin, volume, and cost
assumptions developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are
consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment
opportunities. Where unproved reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted
amount of these reserves may be included in the evaluation.
An
asset group would be impaired if its undiscounted cash flows were less than the
asset’s carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds fair value. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing
exclude the effects of derivative instruments.
In
light of continued weakness in the upstream industry environment in late 2015,
the Corporation undertook an effort to assess its major long-lived assets most
at risk for potential impairment. The results of this assessment confirm the
absence of a trigger event and indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows
associated with these assets substantially exceed the carrying value of the
assets. The assessment reflects crude and natural gas prices that are generally
consistent with the long-term price forecasts published by third-party industry
experts. Critical to the long-term recoverability of certain assets is the
assumption that either by supply and demand changes, or due to general
inflation, prices will rise in the future. Should increases in long-term prices
not materialize, certain of the Corporation’s assets will be at risk for
impairment. Due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity
prices, and the relationship between industry prices and costs, it is not
practicable to reasonably estimate a range of potential future impairments
related to the Corporation’s long-lived assets.
Significant
unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation
allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated
economic chance of success and the length of time that the Corporation expects
to hold the 

57

properties. Properties that are not
individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on
development risk and average holding period. 
Supplemental
information regarding oil and gas results of operations, capitalized costs and
reserves is provided following the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Future prices used for any impairment tests will vary from the ones used in the
supplemental oil and gas disclosure and could be lower or higher for any given
year. 
 
Inventories
Crude
oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current
market value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method
– LIFO). If crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical product
prices continue in the range seen in early 2016, the Corporation could be
subject to a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment.
 
Asset Retirement Obligations 
The
Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values
of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which
is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair
value, the Corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of
settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. Asset retirement obligations
are disclosed in Note 9 to the financial statements. 
 
Suspended Exploratory Well Costs 
The
Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well
has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory
well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. The facts and
circumstances that support continued capitalization of suspended wells at year-end
are disclosed in Note 10 to the financial statements. 
 
Consolidations 
The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of those subsidiaries
that the Corporation controls. They also include the Corporation’s share of the
undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. Amounts representing the Corporation’s interest in the underlying net
assets of other significant entities that it does not control, but over which
it exercises significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting. 
Investments
in companies that are partially owned by the Corporation are integral to the
Corporation’s operations. In some cases they serve to balance worldwide risks,
and in others they provide the only available means of entry into a particular
market or area of interest. The other parties, who also have an equity interest
in these companies, are either independent third parties or host governments
that share in the business results according to their ownership. The
Corporation does not invest in these companies in order to remove liabilities
from its balance sheet. In fact, the Corporation has long been on record
supporting an alternative accounting method that would require each investor to
consolidate its share of all assets and liabilities in these partially-owned
companies rather than only its interest in net equity. This method of
accounting for investments in partially-owned companies is not permitted by U.S.
GAAP except where the investments are in the direct ownership of a share of
upstream assets and liabilities. However, for purposes of calculating return on
average capital employed, which is not covered by U.S. GAAP standards, the
Corporation includes its share of debt of these partially-owned companies in
the determination of average capital employed.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 

Pension
Benefits 
The
Corporation and its affiliates sponsor about 100 defined benefit (pension)
plans in over 40 countries. The Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits footnote
(Note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension
expense. 
Some
of these plans (primarily non-U.S.) provide pension benefits that are paid
directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of corporate cash flow rather than
a separate pension fund because tax conventions and regulatory practices do not
encourage advance funding. Book reserves are established for these plans. The
portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is expensed as services
are rendered. The portion attributable to the increase in pension obligations
due to the passage of time is expensed over the term of the obligations, which
ends when all benefits are paid. The primary difference in pension expense for
unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for funded plans also
includes a credit for the expected long-term return on fund assets.
For
funded plans, including those in the U.S., pension obligations are financed in
advance through segregated assets or insurance arrangements. These plans are
managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and
meet or exceed required funding levels as measured by relevant actuarial and
government standards at the mandated measurement dates. In determining
liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require
approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting purposes.

The
Corporation will continue to make contributions to these funded plans as
necessary. All defined-benefit pension obligations, regardless of the funding
status of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength
of the Corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate. 
Pension
accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term
expected earnings rate on fund assets, the discount rate for the benefit
obligations and the long-term rate for future salary increases. Pension
assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management.
These assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market
rates and outlook. The long-term expected earnings rate on U.S. pension plan
assets in 2015 was 7.00 percent. The 10‑year and 20‑year actual
returns on U.S. pension plan assets were 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively.
The Corporation establishes the long-term expected rate of return by developing
a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset
class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the
specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then
calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages
and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. A worldwide reduction
of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets would increase annual pension
expense by approximately $150 million before tax. 
Differences
between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not
recognized in pension expense in the year that the difference occurs. Such
differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are
amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of
employees. 
 
Litigation Contingencies 
A
variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has
regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside
counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these
contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16. 
The
Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the
incurrence of a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
These amounts are not reduced by amounts that may be recovered under insurance
or claims against third parties, but undiscounted receivables from insurers or
other third parties may be accrued separately. The Corporation revises such
accruals in light of new information. For contingencies where an unfavorable
outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation
discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the
possible loss. For purposes of our litigation contingency disclosures,
“significant” includes material matters as well as other items which management
believes should be disclosed. 
Management
judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of
litigation because both are difficult to predict. However, the Corporation has
been successful in defending litigation in the past. Payments have not had a
material adverse effect on operations or financial condition. In the
Corporation’s experience, large claims often do not result in large awards.
Large awards are often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal
or settlement.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 

Tax
Contingencies 
The
Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the
world. Significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income
tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to
predict. 
The benefits of uncertain tax positions
that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are
recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more
likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities.
For a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the
financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50
percent likely of being realized. A reserve is established for the difference
between a position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and
the amount recognized in the financial statements. The Corporation’s
unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in
Note 19.
 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The
method of translating the foreign currency financial statements of the
Corporation’s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars is prescribed by
GAAP. Under these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency
of these subsidiaries. The functional currency is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Management selects the
functional currency after evaluating this economic environment. 
Factors
considered by management when determining the functional currency for a
subsidiary include the currency used for cash flows related to individual assets
and liabilities; the responsiveness of sales prices to changes in exchange
rates; the history of inflation in the country; whether sales are into local
markets or exported; the currency used to acquire raw materials, labor,
services and supplies; sources of financing; and significance of intercompany
transactions.

MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
 
 
 

Management, including the
Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, and Principal
Accounting Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over the Corporation’s financial reporting. Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that Exxon Mobil Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the
effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2015, as stated in their report included in the Financial
Section of this report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
 
 


To the Shareholders of Exxon
Mobil Corporation: 
In our opinion, the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income,
Changes in Equity, and Cash Flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Exxon Mobil Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control –
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Corporation’s management
is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on
the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements and the supporting and supplemental material are the responsibility
of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. 
The
Corporation’s principal business is energy, involving the worldwide
exploration, production, transportation and sale of crude oil and natural gas
(Upstream) and the manufacture, transportation and sale of petroleum products
(Downstream). The Corporation is also a major worldwide manufacturer and
marketer of petrochemicals (Chemical). 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. Prior years’ data has been reclassified in certain cases
to conform to the 2015 presentation basis. 
 
1.
Summary of Accounting Policies 
Principles
of Consolidation. The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the
Corporation controls. They also include the Corporation’s share of the
undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. 
Amounts
representing the Corporation’s interest in entities that it does not control,
but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in
“Investments, advances and long-term receivables.” The Corporation’s share of
the net income of these companies is included in the Consolidated Statement of
Income caption “Income from equity affiliates.” 
Majority
ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which
subsidiaries are consolidated. However, certain factors may indicate that a
majority-owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. These factors occur where the
minority shareholders are granted by law or by contract substantive
participating rights. These include the right to approve operating policies,
expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and management compensation
and succession plans. 
The
Corporation’s share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment
for equity method investments is reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income. 
Evidence
of loss in value that might indicate impairment of investments in companies
accounted for on the equity method is assessed to determine if such evidence
represents a loss in value of the Corporation’s investment that is other than
temporary. Examples of key indicators include a history of operating losses,
negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil
and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee’s
business segment or geographic region. If evidence of an other than temporary
loss in fair value below carrying amount is determined, an impairment is
recognized. In the absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash
flows are used to assess fair value. 
Revenue Recognition. The
Corporation generally sells crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical
products under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. In some cases
(e.g., natural gas), products may be sold under long-term agreements, with
periodic price adjustments. Revenues are recognized when the products are
delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the
risks and rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. 
Revenues
from the production of natural gas properties in which the Corporation has an
interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of the Corporation’s
net working interest. Differences between actual production and net working
interest volumes are not significant. 
Purchases
and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in
contemplation of one another are combined and recorded as exchanges measured at
the book value of the item sold. 
Sales-Based Taxes. The
Corporation reports sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales transactions
on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statement of Income (included in both
revenues and costs). 
Derivative Instruments. The
Corporation makes limited use of derivative instruments. The Corporation does
not engage in speculative derivative activities or derivative trading
activities, nor does it use derivatives with leveraged features. When the
Corporation does enter into derivative transactions, it is to offset exposures
associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon
prices that arise from existing assets, liabilities and forecasted
transactions. 
The
gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are
recorded in income. In some cases, the Corporation designates derivatives as
fair value hedges, in which case the gains and losses are offset in income by
the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the underlying
hedged item. 
Fair Value. Fair value is the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy Levels 1, 2
and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value. Hierarchy Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy 

68 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that
are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy
Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market. 
Inventories. Crude oil,
products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market
value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method –
LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including
depreciation) directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its
existing condition and location. Selling expenses and general and administrative
expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost.
Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less. 
Property, Plant and Equipment. Depreciation,
depletion and amortization, based on cost less estimated salvage value of the
asset, are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or
the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking
obsolescence into consideration. Maintenance and repairs, including planned
major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements
are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired. 
The
Corporation uses the “successful efforts” method to account for its exploration
and production activities. Under this method, costs are accumulated on a
field-by-field basis. Costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a
property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory
well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a sufficient quantity
of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and where the
Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the
economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not
meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures,
including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred.
Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry
holes, are capitalized. 
Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a
unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas
reserves. Capitalized exploratory
drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable extractive
properties are amortized using unit-of-production rates based on the amount of
proved developed reserves of oil, gas and other minerals that are estimated to
be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods. Under
the unit-of-production method, oil and gas volumes are considered produced once
they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction
points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. In the event
that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation
of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative such as the
straight-line method is used.
Production
involves lifting the oil and gas to the surface and gathering, treating, field
processing and field storage of the oil and gas. The production function
normally terminates at the outlet valve on the lease or field production
storage tank. Production costs are those incurred to operate and maintain the
Corporation’s wells and related equipment and facilities and are expensed as
incurred. They become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. These costs,
sometimes referred to as lifting costs, include such items as labor costs to
operate the wells and related equipment; repair and maintenance costs on the
wells and equipment; materials, supplies and energy costs required to operate
the wells and related equipment; and administrative expenses related to the
production activity. 
The
Corporation performs impairment assessments whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets (or group of
assets) may not be recoverable through future operations or disposition. Assets
are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows
that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets for
this assessment. 
Potential
trigger events for impairment evaluation include:
·        
a significant decrease in the
market price of a long-lived asset;
·        
a significant adverse change in
the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical
condition including a significant decrease in current and projected reserve
volumes;
·        
a significant adverse change in
legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
·        
an accumulation of project costs
significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;
·        
a current-period operating loss
combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and
·        
a current expectation that, more
likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of
significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
The
Corporation performs asset valuation analyses on an ongoing basis as a part of
its asset management program. These analyses and other profitability reviews
assist the Corporation in assessing whether the carrying amounts of any of its
assets may not be recoverable.
In
general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as a
trigger event for conducting impairment tests. The markets for crude oil,
natural gas and petroleum products, have a history of significant price
volatility. Although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry
prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and
demand.



69 



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

On the supply side, industry production from mature
fields is declining, but this is being offset by production from new
discoveries and field developments. OPEC production policies also have an
impact on world oil supplies. The demand side is largely a function of global
economic growth. The relative growth/decline in supply versus demand will
determine industry prices over the long term, and these cannot be accurately
predicted. 
If
there were a trigger event, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted
cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying
amounts. Cash flows used in impairment evaluations are developed using
estimates for future crude oil and natural gas commodity prices, refining and
chemical margins, and foreign currency exchange rates. Volumes are based on
projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. These
evaluations make use of the Corporation’s price, margin, volume, and cost
assumptions developed in the annual planning and budgeting process, and are
consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment
opportunities. Where unproved reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted
amount of these reserves may be included in the evaluation.
An
asset group would be impaired if its undiscounted cash flows were less than the
asset’s carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds fair value. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing
exclude the effects of derivative instruments.
Significant
unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation
allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated
economic chance of success and the length of time that the Corporation expects
to hold the properties. Properties that are not individually significant are
aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average
holding period. 
Gains
on sales of proved and unproved properties are only recognized when there is neither
uncertainty about the recovery of costs applicable to any interest retained nor
any substantial obligation for future performance by the Corporation. 
Losses
on properties sold are recognized when incurred or when the properties are held
for sale and the fair value of the properties is less than the carrying value.
Interest
costs incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase of
multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of acquiring
the constructed assets. The project construction phase commences with the
development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed
assets are ready for their intended use. Capitalized interest costs are
included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service
life of the related assets. 
Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Liabilities. The Corporation incurs retirement obligations for
certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as
liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets
are installed. The costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as
part of the related assets and depreciated. Over time, the liabilities are
accreted for the change in their present value. 
Liabilities
for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have
been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities
are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties and projected cash
expenditures are not discounted. 
Foreign Currency Translation. The
Corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international
subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which
each subsidiary operates. 
Downstream
and Chemical operations primarily use the local currency. However, the U.S.
dollar is used in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in
Latin America) and Singapore, which predominantly sells into the U.S. dollar
export market. Upstream operations which are relatively self-contained and
integrated within a particular country, such as Canada, the United Kingdom,
Norway and continental Europe, use the local currency. Some Upstream
operations, primarily in Asia and Africa, use the U.S. dollar because they
predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into U.S.
dollar-denominated markets. 
For
all operations, gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency transactions
into the functional currency are included in income. 
Stock-Based Payments. The Corporation
awards stock-based compensation to employees in the form of restricted stock
and restricted stock units. Compensation expense is measured by the price of
the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite
service period.

2. Accounting Changes 
The
Corporation did not adopt authoritative guidance in 2015 that had a material
impact on the Corporation’s financial statements. 
In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is
required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018.
“Sales
and Other Operating Revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes
sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales transactions. When the Corporation
adopts the standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf
of third parties. This change in reporting will not impact earnings.
The
Corporation continues to evaluate other areas of the standard and its effect on
the Corporation’s financial statements.
 
3. Miscellaneous Financial Information 
Research
and development expenses totaled $1,008 million in 2015, $971 million
in 2014 and $1,044 million in 2013. 
Net
income included before‑tax aggregate foreign exchange transaction losses
of $119 million and $225 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and
gains of $155 million in 2013. 
In 2015,
2014 and 2013, net income included a loss of $186 million, and gains of $187 million
and $282 million, respectively, attributable to the combined effects of
LIFO inventory accumulations and drawdowns. The aggregate replacement cost of
inventories was estimated to exceed their LIFO carrying values by $4.5 billion
and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

5. Cash Flow Information 
The
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows provides information about changes in cash
and cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less when acquired are classified as cash equivalents. 
For
2015, the “Net (gain) on asset sales” on the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows includes before-tax amounts from the sale of service stations in Europe,
the sale of Upstream properties in the U.S., the sale of ExxonMobil’s interests
in Chemical and Refining joint ventures, and the pending sale of the Torrance
refinery. For 2014, the amount includes before-tax gains from the sale of Hong
Kong power operations, additional proceeds related to the 2013 sale of a
partial interest in Iraq, the sale of Downstream affiliates in the Caribbean
and the sale or exchange of Upstream properties in the U.S., Canada, and
Malaysia. For 2013, the amount includes before-tax gains from the sale of a
partial interest in Iraq, the sale of Downstream affiliates in the Caribbean
and the sale of service stations. These net gains are reported in “Other
income” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
In
2015, the “Additions/(reductions) in commercial paper, and debt with three
months or less maturity” on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes a
net $358 million addition of commercial paper with maturity over three months.
The gross amount issued was $8.1 billion, while the gross amount repaid was
$7.7 billion. 
In
2015, ExxonMobil completed an asset exchange that resulted in value received of
approximately $500 million including $100 million in cash. The non-cash portion
was not included in the “Sales of subsidiaries, investments, and property,
plant and equipment” or the “All other items-net” lines on the Statement of
Cash Flows. Capital leases of approximately $1 billion were not included in the
“Additions to long-term debt” or “Additions to property, plant and equipment”
lines on the Statement of Cash Flows.
In
2014, ExxonMobil completed asset exchanges, primarily non-cash transactions, of
approximately $1.2 billion. This amount is not included in the “Sales of
subsidiaries, investments, and property, plant and equipment” or the “Additions
to property, plant and equipment” lines on the Statement of Cash Flows.

7. Equity Company Information 
The
summarized financial information below includes amounts related to certain
less-than-majority-owned companies and majority-owned subsidiaries where
minority shareholders possess the right to participate in significant
management decisions (see Note 1). These companies are primarily engaged in oil
and gas exploration and production, and natural gas marketing in North America;
natural gas exploration, production and distribution, and downstream operations
in Europe; and exploration, production, liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations,
refining operations, petrochemical manufacturing, and fuel sales in Asia. Also
included are several refining, petrochemical manufacturing, and marketing
ventures. 
The Corporation’s
ownership in these ventures is in the form of shares in corporate joint
ventures as well as interests in partnerships. Differences between the
company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in
the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to
specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the factors
giving rise to the difference. The amortization of this difference, as
appropriate, is included in “income from equity affiliates.” 
The
share of total equity company revenues from sales to ExxonMobil
consolidated companies was 15 percent, 14 percent and 13 percent in the years
2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
In
2013 and 2014, the Corporation and Rosneft established various entities to
conduct exploration and research activities. Periods of disproportionate
funding will result in the Corporation recognizing, during the early phases of
the projects, an investment that is larger than its equity share in these
entities. These joint ventures are considered Variable Interest Entities. However,
since the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary of these entities, the
joint ventures are reported as equity companies. In 2014, the European Union
and United States imposed sanctions relating to the Russian energy sector. With
respect to the foregoing, each joint venture continues to comply with all applicable
laws, rules and regulations. The Corporation's maximum before-tax exposure to
loss from these joint ventures as of December 31, 2015, is $1.0 billion.

In the Upstream segment, depreciation is
generally on a unit-of-production basis, so depreciable life will vary by
field. In the Downstream segment, investments in refinery and lubes basestock
manufacturing facilities are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis
over a 25-year life and service station buildings and fixed improvements over a
20-year life. In the Chemical segment, investments in process equipment are
generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 20-year life. 
The
Corporation periodically reviews the estimated asset service life of its
property, plant and equipment. Effective January 1, 2016, the Corporation
revised the estimated asset service life of its investments in process
equipment in the Chemical segment to 25 years. This revision will not have a
material impact on the Corporation’s financial statements. 
Accumulated
depreciation and depletion totaled $195,732 million at the end of 2015 and $194,121
million at the end of 2014. Interest capitalized in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $482
million, $344 million and $309 million, respectively. 
 
Asset Retirement Obligations 
The
Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values
of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which
is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair
value, the Corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements;
discount rates; and inflation rates. Asset retirement obligations incurred in
the current period were Level 3 fair value measurements. The costs associated
with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and
depreciated as the reserves are produced. Over time, the liabilities are
accreted for the change in their present value. 
Asset
retirement obligations for downstream and chemical facilities generally become
firm at the time the facilities are permanently shut down and dismantled. These
obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil
remediation. However, these sites have indeterminate lives based on plans for
continued operations and as such, the fair value of the conditional legal
obligations cannot be measured, since it is impossible to estimate the future
settlement dates of such obligations. 
The following table summarizes the
activity in the liability for asset retirement obligations:

10. Accounting for Suspended Exploratory
Well Costs 
The
Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the
well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing
the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. The term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.
The
following two tables provide details of the changes in the balance of suspended
exploratory well costs as well as an aging summary of those costs.

Exploration
activity often involves drilling multiple wells, over a number of years, to
fully evaluate a project. The table below provides a breakdown of the number of
projects with suspended exploratory well costs which had their first
capitalized well drilled in the preceding 12 months and those that have had
exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than 12 months, which
includes the Rosneft joint venture exploration activity (refer to the relevant
portion of Note 7).

have drilling in the preceding 12 months or exploratory activity either planned
in the next two years or subject to sanctions. The remaining 37 projects are
those with completed exploratory activity progressing toward development.

13. Financial Instruments and Derivatives 
Financial Instruments. The fair value of financial instruments
is determined by reference to observable market data and other valuation
techniques as appropriate. The only category of financial instruments where the
difference between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term
debt. The estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized
lease obligations, was $18.9 billion and $11.7 billion at December 31, 2015,
and 2014, respectively, as compared to recorded book values of $18.7 billion
and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase in
the estimated fair value and book value of long-term debt reflects the Corporation’s
issuance of $8.0 billion of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2015. 
The fair value of long-term debt by
hierarchy level at December 31, 2015, is: Level 1 $18,584 million; Level 2 $208
million; and Level 3 $62 million.  
Derivative Instruments. The Corporation’s size, strong capital
structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the Upstream,
Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide
risk from changes in interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices. As a
result, the Corporation makes limited use of derivatives to mitigate the impact
of such changes. The Corporation does not engage in speculative derivative
activities or derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with
leveraged features. When the Corporation does enter into derivative
transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from existing assets,
liabilities and forecasted transactions.  
The
estimated fair value of derivative instruments outstanding and recorded on the
balance sheet was a net asset of $21 million at year-end 2015 and a net asset
of $75 million at year-end 2014. Assets and liabilities associated with
derivatives are usually recorded either in “Other current assets” or “Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities.” 
The
Corporation’s fair value measurement of its derivative instruments use either
Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. 
The
Corporation recognized a before-tax gain or (loss) related to derivative
instruments of $39 million, $110 million and $(7) million during 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively. Income statement effects associated with derivatives are
usually recorded either in “Sales and other operating revenue” or “Crude oil
and product purchases.”  
The
Corporation believes there are no material market or credit risks to the
Corporation’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity as a
result of the derivative activities described above.

14. Long-Term Debt 
At
December 31, 2015, long-term debt consisted of $19,217 million due
in U.S. dollars and $708 million representing the U.S. dollar equivalent
at year-end exchange rates of amounts payable in foreign currencies. These
amounts exclude that portion of long-term debt, totaling $558 million, which
matures within one year and is included in current liabilities. The increase in
the book value of long-term debt reflects the Corporation’s issuance of $8.0
billion of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2015. The amounts of
long-term debt, including capitalized lease obligations, maturing in each of
the four years after December 31, 2016, in millions of dollars, are: 2017
– $2,959; 2018 – $2,967; 2019 – $2,374; and 2020 – $1,602.
At December 31, 2015, the Corporation’s unused long-term credit lines were $0.4
billion.

long-term debt at year-end 2015 and 2014 are shown in the table below:

15. Incentive Program 
The 2003 Incentive Program provides for grants of stock
options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and other forms of
award. Awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and those
affiliates at least 50 percent owned. Outstanding awards are subject to certain
forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument. Options and
SARs may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on the
date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. The maximum number of shares
of stock that may be issued under the 2003 Incentive Program is 220 million.
Awards that are forfeited, expire or are settled in cash, do not count against
this maximum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does not have a specified term.
New awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the
Board terminates the plan early. At the end of 2015, remaining shares available
for award under the 2003 Incentive Program were 100 million.
 
Restricted
Stock and Restricted Stock Units. Awards totaling 9,681 thousand, 9,775 thousand, and 9,729 thousand
of restricted (nonvested) common stock units were granted in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Compensation expense for these awards is based on the price of
the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite
service period. Shares for these awards are issued to employees from treasury
stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their
changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. During the
applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold or transferred
and are subject to forfeiture. The majority of the awards have graded vesting
periods, with 50 percent of the shares and units in each award vesting after
three years and the remaining 50 percent vesting after seven years. Awards
granted to a small number of senior executives have vesting periods of five
years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years or retirement, whichever
occurs later, for the remaining 50 percent of the award. 
The
Corporation has purchased shares in the open market and through negotiated
transactions to offset shares issued in conjunction with benefit plans and
programs. Purchases may be discontinued at any time without prior notice.

As of December 31, 2015, there was $2,222
million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested restricted
awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 4.5 years. The compensation cost charged against income for the restricted
stock and restricted stock units was $855 million, $831 million and $854
million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The income tax benefit
recognized in income related to this compensation expense was $78 million, $76
million and $78 million for the same periods, respectively. The fair value of
shares and units vested in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $808 million, $946 million
and $1,040 million, respectively. Cash payments of $64 million, $73 million and
$67 million for vested restricted stock units settled in cash were made in 2015,
2014 and 2013, respectively.

16. Litigation and Other Contingencies 
Litigation.
A variety of claims have
been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a
number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews,
including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an
undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts
can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The
Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency
disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other matters
which management believes should be disclosed. ExxonMobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. Based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a
material adverse effect upon the Corporation’s operations, financial condition,
or financial statements taken as a whole.
Other
Contingencies. The
Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently
liable at December 31, 2015, for guarantees relating to notes, loans
and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation
and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect
management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure.

all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material
to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition. Unconditional purchase

that are noncancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions, and that
third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will

In accordance
with a nationalization decree issued by Venezuela’s president in February 2007,
by May 1, 2007, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan National Oil Company (PdVSA)
assumed the operatorship of the Cerro Negro Heavy Oil Project. This Project had
been operated and owned by ExxonMobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent
ownership interest in the Project. The decree also required conversion of the
Cerro Negro Project into a “mixed enterprise” and an increase in PdVSA’s or one
of its affiliate’s ownership interest in the Project, with the stipulation that
if ExxonMobil refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed
enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would “directly
assume the activities” carried out by the joint venture. ExxonMobil refused to
accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on June 27, 2007, the
government expropriated ExxonMobil’s 41.67 percent interest in the Cerro Negro
Project.
On September 6, 2007, affiliates of
ExxonMobil filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID Tribunal issued a decision
on June 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the basis of
the Netherlands-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty. On October 9, 2014, the
ICSID Tribunal issued its final award finding in favor of the ExxonMobil affiliates
and awarding $1.6 billion as of the date of expropriation, June 27, 2007, and
interest from that date at 3.25% compounded annually until the date of payment
in full. The Tribunal also noted that one of the Cerro Negro Project agreements
provides a mechanism to prevent double recovery between the ICSID award and all
or part of an earlier award of $908 million to an ExxonMobil affiliate, Mobil
Cerro Negro, Ltd., against PdVSA and a PdVSA affiliate, PdVSA CN, in an
arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. 
On
June 12, 2015, the Tribunal rejected in its entirety Venezuela’s October 23,
2014, application to revise the ICSID award. The Tribunal also lifted the
associated stay of enforcement that had been entered upon the filing of the
application to revise. 
Still
pending is Venezuela’s February 2, 2015, application to ICSID seeking annulment
of the ICSID award. That application alleges that, in issuing the ICSID award,
the Tribunal exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons on which the ICSID
award was based, and departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. A separate
stay of the ICSID award was entered following the filing of the annulment
application. On July 7, 2015, the ICSID Committee considering the annulment
application heard arguments from the parties on whether to lift the stay of the
award associated with that application. On July 28, 2015, the Committee issued
an order that would lift the stay of enforcement unless, within 30 days,
Venezuela delivered a commitment to pay the award if the application to annul
is denied. On September 17, 2015, the Committee ruled that Venezuela had
complied with the requirement to submit a written commitment to pay the award
and so left the stay of enforcement in place. A hearing on Venezuela’s application
for annulment, previously scheduled for January 25-27, 2016, has been
rescheduled for March 8-9, 2016.  
The
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered
judgment on the ICSID award on October 10, 2014. Motions filed by Venezuela to
vacate that judgment on procedural grounds and to modify the judgment by
reducing the rate of interest to be paid on the ICSID award from the entry of
the court’s judgment, until the date of payment, were denied on February 13,
2015, and March 4, 2015, respectively. On March 9, 2015, Venezuela filed a
notice of appeal of the court’s actions on the two motions. Oral arguments on
this appeal were held before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit on January 7, 2016.
The
District Court’s judgment on the ICSID award is currently stayed until such
time as ICSID’s stay of the award entered following Venezuela’s filing of its
application to annul has been lifted. The net impact of these matters on the
Corporation’s consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated.
Regardless, the Corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material
effect upon the Corporation’s operations or financial condition. 
An
affiliate of ExxonMobil is one of the Contractors under a Production Sharing
Contract (PSC) with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) covering
the Erha block located in the offshore waters of Nigeria. ExxonMobil's
affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25 percent interest under
the PSC. The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of
crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In
accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated arbitration in
Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On October
24, 2011, a three-member arbitral Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors'
position in all material respects and awarding damages to the Contractors
jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued
interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian federal court for enforcement
of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside.
On May 22, 2012, the court set aside the award. The Contractors appealed that
judgment to the Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial Division. In June 2013, the
Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in
order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if
necessary. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce, if necessary,
the arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that jurisdiction.
NNPC has moved to dismiss the lawsuit. Proceedings in the Southern District of
New York are currently stayed. At this time, the net impact of this matter on
the Corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably
estimated. However, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the
Corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the
Corporation's operations or financial condition.

For selection of the discount rate for
U.S. plans, several sources of information are considered, including interest
rate market indicators and the discount rate determined by use of a yield curve
based on high-quality, noncallable bonds with cash flows that match estimated
outflows for benefit payments. For major non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is
determined by using bond portfolios with an average maturity approximating that
of the liabilities or spot yield curves, both of which are constructed
using high-quality, local-currency-denominated bonds. 
The measurement of the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 4.5
percent in 2017 and subsequent years. A one-percentage-point increase in the health
care cost trend rate would increase service and interest cost by $88 million
and the postretirement benefit obligation by $963 million. A one-percentage-point
decrease in the health care cost trend rate would decrease service and interest
cost by $66 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by $764 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

The funding levels of all qualified
pension plans are in compliance with standards set by applicable law or
regulation. As shown in the table below, certain smaller U.S. pension plans and
a number of non-U.S. pension plans are not funded because local tax conventions
and regulatory practices do not encourage funding of these plans. All
defined benefit pension obligations, regardless of the funding status
of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength
of the Corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

The long-term
expected rate of return on funded assets shown below is established for each
benefit plan by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for
each asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real
return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of
return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset
allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.

The Corporation’s investment strategy for
benefit plan assets reflects a long-term view, a careful assessment of the
risks inherent in various asset classes and broad diversification to reduce the
risk of the portfolio. The benefit plan assets are primarily invested in
passive equity and fixed income index funds to diversify risk while
minimizing costs. The equity funds hold ExxonMobil stock only to the extent
necessary to replicate the relevant equity index. The fixed income funds are
largely invested in high-quality corporate and government debt securities. 
Studies
are periodically conducted to establish the preferred target asset allocation
percentages. The target asset allocation for the U.S. benefit plans and the major
non-U.S. plans is 40 percent equity securities and 60 percent debt securities.
The equity targets for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans include an allocation to
private equity partnerships that primarily focus on early-stage venture capital
of 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively. 
The
fair value measurement levels are accounting terms that refer to different
methods of valuing assets. The terms do not represent the relative risk or
credit quality of an investment.

18. Disclosures about Segments and Related
Information 
The
Upstream, Downstream and Chemical functions best define the operating segments
of the business that are reported separately. The factors used to identify
these reportable segments are based on the nature of the operations that are
undertaken by each segment. The Upstream segment is organized and operates to
explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas. The Downstream segment is
organized and operates to manufacture and sell petroleum products. The Chemical
segment is organized and operates to manufacture and sell petrochemicals. These
segments are broadly understood across the petroleum and petrochemical
industries. 
These
functions have been defined as the operating segments of the Corporation
because they are the segments (1) that engage in business activities from
which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (2) whose operating
results are regularly reviewed by the Corporation’s chief operating decision
maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to
assess its performance; and (3) for which discrete financial information
is available. 
Earnings
after income tax include transfers at estimated market prices.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

In corporate and financing activities,
interest revenue relates to interest earned on cash deposits and
marketable securities. Interest expense includes non-debt-related
interest expense of $100 million and $129 million in 2015 and 2014,
respectively. For 2013, non-debt-related interest expense was a net credit of
$123 million, primarily reflecting the effect of credits from the favorable
resolution of prior year tax positions.

(1)   In 2014, state taxes included a favorable adjustment of
deferred taxes of approximately $830 million. 
 
All other taxes and duties include taxes
reported in production and manufacturing and selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expenses. The above provisions for deferred income
taxes include a net charge of $177 million in 2015 and net credits of $40
million in 2014 and $310 million in 2013 for the effect of changes in tax laws
and rates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Deferred income taxes reflect the impact
of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities
recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax
purposes.

In 2015, asset valuation allowances of
$1,730 million decreased by $840 million and included net provisions of $681
million and effects of foreign currency translation of $159 million.  
Deferred
income tax (assets) and liabilities are included in the balance sheet as shown
below. Deferred income tax (assets) and liabilities are classified as current
or long term consistent with the classification of the related temporary
difference – separately by tax jurisdiction.

The Corporation had $51 billion of
indefinitely reinvested, undistributed earnings from subsidiary companies
outside the U.S. that were retained to fund prior and future capital project
expenditures. Deferred taxes have not been recorded for potential future tax
obligations as these earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for
the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015, it is not practical to
estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings
given the future availability of foreign tax credits and uncertainties about the
timing of potential remittances.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits. The Corporation is subject to income
taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. Unrecognized tax benefits
reflect the difference between positions taken or expected to be taken on
income tax returns and the amounts recognized in the financial statements. The

The gross unrecognized tax benefit
balances shown above are predominantly related to tax positions that would
reduce the Corporation’s effective tax rate if the positions are favorably
resolved. Unfavorable resolution of these tax positions generally would not
increase the effective tax rate. The 2015, 2014 and 2013 changes in
unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Corporation’s
net income. 
Resolution
of these tax positions through negotiations with the relevant tax authorities
or through litigation will take many years to complete. It is difficult to
predict the timing of resolution for tax positions since such timing is not
entirely within the control of the Corporation. In the United States, the
Corporation has various U.S. federal income tax positions at issue with the
Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2006-2011. Unfavorable resolution of
these issues would not have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation’s
net income or liquidity. The Internal Revenue Service has not completed its
audit of tax years after 2011.
It
is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could
increase by up to 20 percent in the next 12 months, with no material impact on
the Corporation’s net income.

subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction:

The Corporation classifies interest on
income tax-related balances as interest expense or interest income and
classifies tax-related penalties as operating expense. 
The Corporation
incurred $39 million and $42 million in interest expense on income tax reserves
in 2015 and 2014, respectively. For 2013, the Corporation’s net interest
expense was a credit of $207 million, reflecting the effect of credits from the
favorable resolution of prior year tax positions. The related interest payable
balances were $223 million and $205 million at December 31, 2015, and 2014,
respectively.

Oil and
Gas Exploration and Production Costs 
The amounts shown for net capitalized costs of consolidated
subsidiaries are $14,685 million less at year-end 2015 and $12,856 million less
at year-end 2014 than the amounts reported as investments in property, plant
and equipment for the Upstream in Note 9. This is due to the
exclusion from capitalized costs of certain transportation and research assets
and assets relating to LNG operations. Assets related to oil sands and oil
shale mining operations are included in the capitalized costs in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board rules.

Oil and
Gas Exploration and Production Costs (continued) 
The
amounts reported as costs incurred include both capitalized costs and costs
charged to expense during the year. Costs incurred also include new asset
retirement obligations established in the current year, as well as increases or
decreases to the asset retirement obligation resulting from changes in cost
estimates or abandonment date. Total consolidated costs incurred in 2015 were $21,887
million, down $7,228 million from 2014, due primarily to lower development
costs and property acquisition costs. In 2014 costs were $29,115 million, down
$4,508 million from 2013, due primarily to lower property acquisition costs and
development costs. Total equity company costs incurred in 2015 were $1,464
million, down $1,213 million from 2014, due primarily to exploration costs.

Oil and
Gas Reserves 
The following information describes changes during the
years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2013, 2014, and
2015. 
The
definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X. 
Proved
oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of
geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to
be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs,
and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government
regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to
operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain.
In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related
facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves. 
In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules, the
year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in
the following tables were calculated using average prices during the 12-month
period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined
as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for
each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in
calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the
standardized measure of discounted net cash flow. 
Revisions
can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of
proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of
(1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new
geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in average prices
and year-end costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. This category
can also include significant changes in either development strategy or
production equipment/facility capacity. 
When
crude oil and natural gas prices are in the range seen in late 2015 and early
2016 for an extended period of time, under the SEC definition of proved
reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas, such as oil sands operations
in Canada and natural gas operations in North America could temporarily not
qualify as proved reserves. Amounts that could be required to be de-booked as
proved reserves on an SEC basis are subject to being re-booked as proved
reserves at some point in the future when price levels recover, costs decline,
or operating efficiencies occur. Under the terms of certain contractual
arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase
proved reserves attributable to ExxonMobil. We do not expect any temporary
changes in reported proved reserves under SEC definitions to affect the
operation of the underlying projects or to alter our outlook for future
production volumes.
Proved
reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate’s participation
in proved reserves and ExxonMobil’s ownership percentage of the proved reserves
of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Gas
reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from
the gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These
liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas
liquids. 
In
the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves
are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company
reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies. 
Reserves
reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are
based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the
agreement. The production and reserves that we report for these types of
arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and gas price changes. As oil
and gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company
increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this
value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices
decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total liquids
and natural gas proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity
companies) at year-end 2015 that were associated with production sharing
contract arrangements was 10 percent of liquids, 10 percent of natural gas and 10
percent on an oil-equivalent basis (gas converted to oil-equivalent at 6
billion cubic feet = 1 million barrels). 
Net
proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in
which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the
cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are
expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing
wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
Crude
oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas production quantities shown are the
net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil’s oil and gas reserves. The natural gas
quantities differ from the quantities of gas delivered for sale by the
producing function as reported in the Operating Summary due to volumes consumed
or flared and inventory changes. 
The
changes between 2014 year-end proved reserves and 2015 year-end proved reserves
primarily reflect extensions and purchases in the United States and Asia, and
revisions in the United States and Canada. Due to low natural gas prices during
2015, the Corporation reclassified approximately 4,800 billion cubic feet of
natural gas reserves in the United States which no longer meet the SEC
definition of proved reserves.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Cash Flows 
As required by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
is computed by applying first-day-of-the-month average prices,
year-end costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10 percent
to net proved reserves. The standardized measure includes costs for
future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation obligations.
The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide
a reliable estimate of the Corporation’s expected future cash flows to be
obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or
of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves. The standardized measure is
prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including
first-day-of-the-month average prices, which represent discrete points in time
and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year
as prices change.
