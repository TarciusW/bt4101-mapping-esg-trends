checking and recording, safety distances, 

etc. had been drawn out and follow strictly

the country that the Group operates in.  

We are committed to run a responsible 

business which requires a delicate 

balancing of long-term interest of our 

planet, employees and business 

proﬁtability as identiﬁed on the materiality 

topic namely - Corporate Governance, 

Environmental, Economic and Social for 

our Sustainability Report, which can be 

found on page 12 of this report. We are 

actively monitoring and improving on our 

sustainability practices and working

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

Jadason Enterprises Ltd (the “Company”, 

together with its subsidiaries, the “Group” 

or “Jadason” or “we” or “us” or “our”) is 

pleased to release our fourth Sustainability 

Report, subscribing to the Global 

Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, in 

accordance with the Core option, and is in 

line with the guidelines released by 

Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) on 

Sustainability Report. 

The Group, which operates mainly in 

China, continue to focus and set its 

reporting boundary for FY2020 on the two 

plants situated in Dongguan, China. 

Classiﬁed under “Manufacturing and 

Support Services” in the Group’s business 

segment, the two plants provide PCB 

drilling services and PCB mass lamination 

to the PCB manufacturers in China, relied 

heavily on energy, water and material 

usage in their day-to-day operation. 

It had been an exceptionally challenging 

year for the operating environment in 

2020, having to deal with the escalating 

tensions between the two largest 

economies over trade and national 

security, and the Covid-19 pandemic, 

which caused signiﬁcant disruptions to 

economic activities and supply chains 

during the year. The Group saw a weaker 

demand in the PCB drilling services and 

PCB mass lamination at our plants in 

China in 2020. 

With the increasing tension between US 

and China on issues including trade, 

Covid-19 pandemic, technology and 

media wars that have hurt many 

businesses, it is unclear how the new US 

administration will recast on the 

relationship and handle on trade tariffs. 

Firms are looking to ensure that suppliers 

are closer to their home countries or 

consumer markets.

OUR PEOPLE

6 _____ JADASON ENTERPRISES LTD / Sustainability Report 2020

ur People, forming the backbone 

O

of Jadason of our identiﬁed core 

business segment - 1. Equipment 

and Supplies, and 2. Manufacturing and 

Support Services. Our People contributed 

endlessly in providing a high and reliable 

quality as well as good services to our 

customer across our distribution network 

across Asia. They are crucial to the growth 

and progress of Jadason. Without the 

contribution, commitment and effort of 

each and every employees that work with 

us throughout the years, Jadason will not 

come to be where we are today. 

 

4.1 Employment Profile

With the brewing tension between US and 

China, and the long-drawn-out COVID-19 

pandemic, the Group saw a weaker demand 

in  the business segment - Manufacturing 

and Support Services, on PCB mass 

lamination and PCB drilling services at our 

plants in China leading to the decrease in 

employment headcount for China. 

In FY2020, the Group total employment 

headcount had decreased 23% from 

FY2019, bring it to a total of 417 in FY2020. 

China alone had reported a decrease of 26% 

of the total employment headcount from the 

previous year, whereas other countries 

where the Group operates, reported 

minimum changes compared from the 

previous years. 

In FY2018, we had started to consolidate 

and report both total employee hire and 

turnover rate as well as diversiﬁcation 

proﬁle as a Group and is in line with GRI 

standard. 

In FY2019, we had started to report the 

growth and development of our employees 

as a Group instead of focusing only on the 

two plants in Dongguan, China. 

Whereas, FY2020, Jadason will not be 

implementing any changes to the reporting 

of our employees. 

 

In FY2020, Jadason saw an increase in the 

percentage of permanent contract workers in 

the Group compared to the previous 

reporting year. The percentage of permanent 

contract worker had being gradually 

increasing after the drop recorded in 

FY2018. The total number of temporary 

contract worker and supervised worker were 

further decreased from FY2019 in this 

reporting year.  

Similar to all our previous reports, in FY2020, 

China, being the country where the Group 

mainly operates in, had recorded the highest 

total number of employee in Jadason, 

following by Thailand and Singapore.

4.2 Diversification 

In Jadason, we value all our employees 

despite of their age, gender, religion, etc, and 

provide equal opportunity to each 

individuals. We hire our employees on the 

basis of value and competency instead of 

age, gender, religion, etc. 

We greatly believe that having a diversiﬁed 

group of employees working and learning 

together can aid with the growth of the 

organisation. The younger group tends to be 

more energetic, tech savvy and innovative 

white the older group tends to be more 

mature, reliable and possessed wealth of 

experience. This two group can learn from 

each other to bring the company to the next 

level. 

From the distribution table shown in this 

report, there is a signiﬁcant difference 

between the number of male and female 

employees hired in China, comparing to the 

other countries in the Group. Our PCB drilling 

and PCB mass lamination service, located in 

China, is traditionally leaning towards a male 

dominated industry due to the nature of the 

work being more physical demanding. As 

such, this does not stop us from hiring female 

employees whom are deemed as competent 

for the job. 

79.1% of the Group’s total employee is hired 

in China, being the major consistution of the 

Group’s headcount. Out of the 79.1%, 74.2% 

of the China’s headcount are male, resulting 

in the Group’s gender diversiﬁcation of the 

total employee being steered towards male 

dominant, despite other countries having 

higher female employees weightage. 

With the further decrease of headcount in 

China this year, the percentage of female 

worker in the Group had increase slightly to 

33.6% in FY2020. 

We started reporting the diversiﬁcation of our 

total employment headcount as a Group in 

FY2018. Thus, our historical data for this 

aspect is limited to FY2018 and after.

4.3 Growth and Development

Subtracting the business outlook around the 

world that will affect on the organisation, the 

growth and development of the employees 

may affect the organisation as well. With 

continuous training, learning and developing 

in view with the movement and changes in 

the business market around the world, be it in 

the skill of Information Technology (IT), 

Engineering, Technical, etc., the Group will 

be able to sustain and grow together. 

Continuous training provides employee with 

better understanding and expectation on 

task being assigned to them. This could help 

to employee to build up their conﬁdence 

when performing on daily work as well as 

business operation and further excelling 

them. Despite the global pandemic in 

FY2020, affecting business and trades, this 

did not stop the Group from providing training 

to the employees. 

4.4 Hire and Turnover

In FY2020, the hire and turnover rate had 

decreased by 56.5% and 51.8% from the 

previous reporting year respectively. Similar 

to the past reporting years, the major 

contribution for the hire and turnover rate for 

FY2020 is reported in China. 

China is the only country in the Group that 

hired new employee despite the challenges 

in FY2020. The turnover rate reported in 

FY2020 mainly contributed from China, while 

the rest of the country reported to a sum less 

than 1% of the Group. 

In 2020, the Group managed to clock a total 

of 8,449 hours of training. This ﬁgure is 

slightly higher than 2019. With the drop in the 

total headcount of the Group, the average 

training hour  for each employee had 

increased. We aim to maintain the training 

hours per employee for the coming year, 

despite the pandemic had crossed over to 

2021. 

Since the previous reporting year, 2019, we 

had started to record and report the growth 

and development of our employees as a 

Group. As such, the historical data for this 

aspect will be limited to 2019 and after. 

Employing and retaining of employees is still 

a challenge to the Group for our China 

factory despite on the challenges faced in 

FY2020. 

In FY2018, the hire and turnover rate was 

being consolidated and reported as a Group. 

Thus, our historical data for this aspect will be 

limited to FY2018 and after.

REACHING OUT IN DONGGUAN, CHINA

adason provides a “one-stop” 

J

service through the two plants in 

Dongguan, China to meet the 

outsourcing needs of PCB manufacturers 

operating in China. The two plants in 

Dongguan, China categorised as 

“Manufacturing and Support Services” 

business segment specialise in PCB, FPC 

drilling, laser drilling, PCB contour routing 

machine, drill pointing and PCB inner layer 

mass lamination. 

The daily operations in the two plants in 

Dongguan, China works around with 

energy, water and materials which 

accounted for the major usage in the 

Group. The Group is aware that such 

usage will put the environment to strain in 

the long-run. This will in turn affects the 

sustainability of our future generations and 

the Group’s business. 

6.1 Environmental

In Jadason, we integrate our sustainability 

practices into our business process of the 

two plants in Dongguan, China to manage 

the impact of our business operations and 

activities to the environment. 

The progressive investment in automated 

equipments and processes to reduce 

reliance of manpower and enhanced 

operation effectiveness, to prepare and 

support in the upswing of the business, will 

no doubt be adding stress to the environment 

due to the increase in energy and water 

requirement. With more environmental 

concern and the improve in technology, 

equipments and/or machines are moving 

towards energy saving criteria, which on the 

other hand maintaining on the energy usage 

despite having more equipments. 

The Group constantly review on its energy  

reduction plan in the plants to lighten the 

stress on the energy usage and to improve 

on the output productivity.

.

With the challenges faced in FY2020 - 

retaining of employees, lower volume of 

PCB drilling and PCB mass lamination job 

ﬂowing to China due to US-China trade 

war and Covid-19 pandemic, the total 

employment headcount recorded for the 

two plants in Dongguan, China had further 

decreased by 27% compared to the 

previous reporting year. 

The Group continuously review its process 

to reduce manpower requirement and 

expanding on the production capacity. 

Jadason had progressively invested in 

automation equipments and processes to 

reduce its manpower needs and enhanced 

on operation effectiveness while to 

prepare and support in the upswing of the 

business. 

Jadason aims to continuously 

drive operational excellence 

without compromising on the 

environment. 

Of the two plants in Dongguan, China, one of 

the plants is governed by ISO 14001 

guidelines  on the environmental 

management systems. We are committed to 

minimise the environmental impact of the 

business operation for both plants in 

Dongguan, China with our best effort. 

In FY2020, the two plants in Dongguan, 

China had reported two new suppliers that 

underwent screening based on the 

environment criteria.

6.1.1 Material

The business operation of our two plants in 

Dongguan, China requires high volume of 

materials of which majority are being procured 

across China. 

The category of materials being used in the two 

plants in Dongguan, China are namely “raw 

material”, “associated process material” and 

“materials for packaging”. Direct measurement 

methodology is being practiced in the two 

plants for data collection on the volume of 

materials being identiﬁed prior. 

We recognised that the volume of materials 

used in our business operation in Dongguan, 

China will inevitably create an impact to the 

environment. In the two plants, we practice on 

fully uitilising the materials before disposing 

them to minimise on the wastage of the material 

and to play our part in moving towards 

sustainability. 

Due to the undervalue ﬁgures collected in 

FY2017 for the category “Associated Process 

Material” and “Materials for Packaging”, shows 

a lower usage ﬁgures despite having the 

highest production yield since the start of our 

sustainability reporting effort. 

We aim to maintain or to have a lower increase 

in the material used in the upcoming years, 

when the production yield increase in the two 

plants. 

Due to Covid-19 pandemic, our plants in China 

has to shutdown for few months to curb the 

spread of the virus in the beginning of FY2020, 

leading to a much lower usage of materials as 

compared to the past years record. 

Jadason aims to minimise the 

impact to the environment

6.1.2 Waste

The waste materials that was generated by the 

two plants in Dongguan, China are disposed 

according to the China waste disposal 

regulatory requirement. We engaged licensed 

and certiﬁed third party waste treatment 

contractor for the collection and disposal of 

waste materials  for the two plants in 

Dongguan, China. 

The waste materials generated in the plants 

were stored and categorised in an easily 

understand manner in the plants to avoid 

mixing up with the other usable material. The 

third party waste treatment contractor will then 

drop by the two plants as scheduled to collect 

the waste material. 

Waste materials that were identiﬁed as 

renewable will be stored in a separate area from 

non-renewable waste. These renewable waste 

will then being sold to a third party collector in 

Dongguan, China for recycling process. 

The weightage of renewable materials had 

gradually increase in FY2020. We recognised 

that the high weightage of non-renewable 

materials used in the two plants put a strain to 

the environment. 

We aim to maintain the weightage of renewable 

material used even though the production yield 

increase in the next reporting year.

6.1.3 Energy Consumption

Our business operation in Dongguan, China 

generally works around machineries and 

equipments on a daily basis, consuming high 

amount of electric energy. We are well aware 

that the amount of energy consumption in the 

plants will create an impact to our environment 

and affect on the sustainability of our business 

in the long-run. 

Our electric energy is directly purchased from 

municipal electric supplier situated in 

Dongguan, China. Periodical checking and 

recording of the electric usage from electric 

meters for the two plants were arranged by the 

electric supplier follow by billing the usage 

amount to the two plants. 

In FY2018 reporting year, we had changed the 

recording measurement from “KWH” in FY2017 

to “TCE” in FY2018, and will be following this 

measurement unit from FY2018 onwards. The 

two plants in Dongguan, China subscribes to 

GB/T13234-2009 on the methodologies and 

assumptions used for calculation of energy 

consumption with the calculation method as 

follow:

REACHING OUT IN DONGGUAN, CHINA

16 _____ JADASON ENTERPRISES LTD / Sustainability Report 2020

The electric energy consumption of the two 

plants in Dongguan, China had dropped near 

50% in terms of “TCE” calculation compared to 

the previous reporting year. 

With the continuous improvement to the energy 

saving plans to obtain higher output with lower 

energy usage, and the Covid-19 pandemic that 

forces companies and businesses to shutdown 

in the early FY2020 to curb the spread of the 

virus, as well as the lower volume of jobs 

ﬂowing in, had resulted in a steep drop in the 

energy consumption in FY2020. 

We strictly adhere to the standards on electric 

energy consumption and reduction plan to 

achieve our energy reduction goal in FY2020. 

We continuously review our energy saving plan 

through monitoring, analysing, and optimising 

the energy consumption in the plants. 

We aim to achieve a 5% reduction of electric 

energy consumption from FY2018 “TCE” 

reporting ﬁgure  for our ﬁrst short-term plan that 

was set in FY2018.

We subscribed to the Five-Year Plan on energy 

savings from Dongguan Province, China for the 

two plants. Committed to achieve on our energy 

reduction target, we follow closely on our 

energy reduction plan found on the right. 

We continue to educate our employee on 

energy savings in the plants by (1) only to turn 

on the air-conditional half and hour after they 

start work, (2) maintaining the temperature at 

25 degree Celsius, and (3) to turn off the air-

conditional half an hour before they end work 

for the day. 

We strengthen our management in the 

production line on daily operation to better 

understand and utilise the equipments to 

increase output in the production line, in turn 

reducing the electric energy consumption 

generated from production line. With the 

upgrading of equipment to increase output with 

lesser time, thus increase in the productivity. 

“We are committed to the continual 

reduction of electric energy 

consumption plan in the plants without 

penalising our customer’s 

expectations.”

6.1.4 Water Withdrawal

Our two plants in Dongguan, China recorded 

substantially high amount of water withdrawal 

for our business operation and periodically 

machinery upkeep and maintenance. The main 

water supply source for our plants is from 

municipal water supplier situated in Dongguan, 

while other water supply source is from our own 

water recycle plant that is situated in one of our 

plants. 

In our water recycle plant, we subscribe to the 

PCB industrial water standard, methodology 

and assumption. This standard is relevant to 

our business operation of the plant where the 

water recycle plant is situated. 

The total water usage of the two plants is 

tabulated to an estimate of 152,400 tonnes of 

water withdrawn from both our municipal water 

supplier and our water recycle plant. The total 

water usage of the two plants had dropped 50% 

compare to the previous reporting year. 

With the continuous improvement to the 

equipment and process to obtain higher output 

with lower water usage, and the Covid-19 

pandemic that forces companies and 

businesses to shutdown in the early FY2020 to 

curb the spread of the virus, as well as the lower 

volume of jobs ﬂowing in, resulting in the drop 

on water usage in FY2020.

Similarly, the amount of recycled water being 

used in this reporting year, recorded a dropped 

of about 70% from the pervious reporting year. 

The total volume of water recycled in the plant 

had dropped near 60% from FY2019.

6.2 Employee Wellness

With the rapid growth in China over the 

years, and more business setting up in the 

country creating more working opportunities 

for the people, it posses a challenge to the 

businesses in China to retain its manpower in 

the company, which does not exclude 

Jadason. 

Growing importance on employee well-

being, welfare, and incentives had surfaced 

over the years. It is believed that employee 

wellness leads to higher employee retention 

rate, which could affects the productivity of 

the workforce in the plants. 

The two plants in Dongguan, China provide 

full-time employees with beneﬁts consisting 

insurance (maternity, industrial injury, 

medical and pension/retirement, etc), 

housing provident fund, and leaves (annual, 

marriage, maternity, etc). Additional 

retirement plan is being drawn up for male 

and female employees above 60 years old 

and 50 years old respectively. Unlike full-time 

employee, our part-time and temporary 

employees do not enjoy most of the beneﬁts 

mentioned. 

Our employees are able to utilise places like 

the Reading Room, Entertainment Room, TV 

Room, etc during their spare time. We 

recognise on the importance for our 

employees to feel a sense of belonging with 

the company throughout their employment 

with Jadason. Activities such as basketball 

match, tug-of-war, table tennis or even other 

sports were organised for the employees, 

which could unite the employees, promote 

on team bonding and cultivating team work 

among the employees. 

Due to the pandemic, safe management are 

imposed in the plants with the wellness of our 

employees being the priority, following the 

guidelines released to companies and 

businesses operating in China.

6.3 Health and Safety

The health and safety of our employees is an 

important fact to us. Especially during this 

pandemic situation, we follow strictly to the 

guidelines issued by the government, having 

necessary safety measurement in place, and 

disinfection schedule in the plants.
