Best World International Limited is pleased to present our third Sustainability Report.

This year, on top of our operations in Singapore and Taiwan, we have included activities 

relating to our Tuas manufacturing facilities for this report, as more equipment were 

procured and skilled headcount added to familiarize and build up our capability to run 

production lines in preparation for the facilities’ completion in future.

We will work towards taking gradual steps to expand the reporting scope to include core 

entities of the Group in subsequent reports.

This report covers the Financial Year 2019 (“FY2019”) from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 

2019, with Financial Year 2018 (“FY2018”) from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 as the 

year of comparison.

Our report has been drafted in accordance with the internationally recognised framework, 

Global Reporting Initiatives (‘GRI’) Standards - Core option, and the Singapore Exchange 

Securities Trading Limited (‘SGX-ST’) Mainboard Listing Rule 711(B).

For this report, no external assurance was sought, but we will consider doing so for future 

reports.

Moving forward, Best World hopes to report on our non-financial performance annually 

and continue to strengthen our sustainability efforts.

We assessed the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters previously identified 

in 2017 and found them to be still relevant to our business and stakeholders. Back in 2017, we 

engaged an independent sustainability consultant and initiated a formal materiality assessment 

process to identify the ESG matters that greatly affect our business and stakeholders. Both internal 

and external stakeholders were taken into consideration for the assessment. With the contributions 

from different representatives from relevant departments, we adopted a four-step materiality 

assessment process summarised in Figure 1 below:

The results of the materiality assessment are reflected in Figure 2. Six material ESG matters were identified.

For more comprehensive reporting, Best World has also chosen to include two additional ESG matters for 

reporting.

STEP 1 - Identification

∙ A preliminary list of ESG matters were 

 selected after conducting a desktop  

 analysis of Sustainability

∙ Reports published by leading industry 

 players and interviews with key personnel 

 across departments

STEP 2 - Prioritisation

∙ The identified ESG matters were rated 

 and prioritised through an anonymous 

 voting exercise by the representatives 

 from the various departments, taking 

 into consideration the perspective of 

 both internal and external stakeholders.

STEP 3 - Validation

∙ Material matters that were identified in 

 Step 2 were presented to the Board for 

 validation and approval

STEP 4 - Review

∙ Material matters that were approved 

 by the Board will continue to be 

 re-assessed in subsequent reporting 

 periods to ensure that reported topics 

 remain relevant and material.

Sustainability Governance

BUSINESS ETHICS

At Best World, we are dedicated to operating our business in an honest and transparent 

manner. During the process of expanding into rapid-growth markets, where the 

operations are dependent on its local businesses and suppliers, there is a greater risk 

of exposure to corruption. Our group has adopted a zero-tolerance approach towards 

all corruption practices and have strived to embed a culture of anti-corruption in 

all aspects of our operations. Our anti-corruption policies and reporting channels 

are available online to enhance communication to our stakeholders and act as a 

deterrence to corruption.

COMMUNICATING KEY 

BUSINESS ETHICS EFFECTIVELY

To 

enhance 

readership 

and 

our 

distributors’ 

understanding of key ethical business practices such 

as consumer rights, distributor’s responsibilities and 

obligations and the Company’s intellectual property 

rights, our Taiwan office rolled out a series of short 

comics on these topics to educate distributors. Refer to 

the link below for more information.

RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICE

Consumers lie at the heart of our business. 

Best World’s continued success depends 

on the trust and confidence that consumers 

place in our distributors and products. As 

well as conforming to respective countries’ 

consumer legislation, we also committed 

ourselves to the consumer Code of Practice 

set out by the Direct Selling Associations 

Singapore (DSAS).

DSA Codes of Conduct address the 

obligations of DSA members to direct 

sellers  as well as DSA members’ obligations 

to consumers. 

For instance, the Direct Selling Association 

in Singapore sets out detailed criteria for 

members, which include: -

• 

Fair Selling Methods

• 

Customer order cancellation 

 

rights – 7-Day “Cooling-off period”

• 

Respect for the rights and privacy of

Our Products

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION AND COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS

Every year, we invest a considerable amount of resources to develop new and 

innovative premium products for our customers. Intellectual property (IP) 

protection, hence, is critical to us as it safeguards our investments and allows us to 

reap its full benefits.

We begin to manage and protect our IP before we launch the product to the market 

we operate in.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Customers from all the markets that we operate in recognize our product brands as our 

unique identity and marks of premium quality. The protection of these intangible assets is 

one of the key elements of our business strategy.

We protect our brands through trademarks and other IP rights along with strict management 

of trade secrets. Our Intellectual Property Division (IP Division) focuses on establishing 

new brands and logos through trademarks registration and maintain registered marks 

from time to time to ensure that all logos and brands are properly protected.

Our logos and brands are widespread and well protected in many different jurisdictions. Till 

date, our IP Division has successfully registered more than 350 marks across the globe and 

is applying more than 150 new marks in Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, 

Thailand, UAE, Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Vietnam, India, United States of 

America, Europe, Canada and other markets which are not specifically stated herein.

To ensure that our business activities are consistent with our IP strategy, IP rights 

management comes under the care of the IP Division of HQ Legal Department.

Our corporate logos and brands are listed as follows:

INFRINGEMENT 

AND COUNTERFEIT MANAGEMENT

Best World takes a strict approach in handling 

counterfeit goods and infringement matters. 

In 2019, we strengthened our enforcement capabilities, 

establishing a worldwide watch notice on trademarks. 

This would ensure that identical or similar trademarks 

being registered will be quickly brought to our 

attention for the necessary action. We also enhanced 

our reporting channel, enabling suspected cases 

of infringement or counterfeit items to be directly 

reported to our HQ legal team, in a format that captures 

information essential for enforcement.

Our IP Division segregates different infringement 

matters into two groups.

Infringement matters which are not material and do 

not constitute material impact to the Group will be 

categorised as minor infringement matters. Our IP 

Division will resolve these matters by entering into 

negotiations with potential infringers and resolve 

these matters internally or by adopting Alternative 

Dispute Resolutions.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AWARENESS 

Best World works closely with global top tiers law firms 

and Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) to 

maintain the intangible assets of the Group across the 

globe.

We also actively attend and participate in events and 

courses organised by Singapore Corporate Counsel 

Association 

(SCCA), 

International 

Association 

for 

the Protection of Intellectual Property (AIPPI) and 

International Trademark Association (INTA) to keep a 

close tab on the latest developments in international 

and local IP laws.

Internally, our IP Division actively promotes IP 

awareness 

within 

the 

Group/subsidiaries 

and 

makes collective decisions with other Departments/

Divisions within the Group regarding the use of IP 

from a management perspective.

On the other hand, all major infringement matters 

will be handled directly by our IP Division with care 

where strict approach will be imposed while dealing 

with related infringers. In such cases, our Legal 

Counsels work closely with relevant local authorities 

and the police to enforce raids against the infringers 

and also file infringement suits against them. 

We have expanded our QR code printing initiative 

to cover all products in our DR’s Secret and Aestier 

range, allowing users to scan the product packaging 

to determine whether the product is authentic.

RESPONSIBLE LABELLING / ADVERTISING

Lapses in labelling and advertising can affect not just 

our brands and reputation as an organisation but 

potentially cause harm to our consumers as well. We 

care deeply about the people we serve. We recognise 

the consequences of mislabelling and biased 

advertising of our products. The lack of transparency 

in reporting all product ingredients used or the effects 

it may cause prevents consumers from making an 

informed decision about the product they purchased, 

which can lead to undesirable consequences. By 

upholding our business integrity in marketing of 

our products, we aim to achieve zero cases of non-

compliance with the Singapore Health Science 

Authority and Taiwan Food and Drug Administration’s 

labelling and product claim requirements. As such, 

strict practices are implemented to strengthen our 

labelling and advertising process. Labels are checked 

against the regional labelling requirements, product 

claim guidelines and code of advertising practices 

to ensure compliance by product development 

and management executives, content writers and 

regional product registration officers.

Our 

brand 

incorporates 

regional 

labelling 

requirements into our products, complying with 

the guidelines of the local regulatory bodies. 

Information on the country of origin, product 

ingredients and directions for use are required to 

be printed on all products. Only products approved 

by these regulatory bodies can be marketed. 

Claim substantiation is also performed to prevent 

mislabelling or false advertising. Going forward, we 

are looking to include the recycling symbol in our 

product labels for product packaging that can be 

recycled to encourage users to dispose them in an 

environmentally friendly manner. 

In 2019, we enhanced our artwork management 

process with the addition of artwork code onto our 

product packaging to track printed artwork versions. 

This initiative improved communication between 

stakeholders involved in the transition process while 

ensuring that only the latest, approved artworks 

are being printed, minimizing human errors which 

may result in additional printing costs and non-

compliance cases, at the same time supporting 

artwork proofing and regulatory compliance.



Our Customers

CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

At Best World, we are committed to product excellence and strive to ensure 

regulatory compliance for all of our products. Throughout the development of our 

products, from product concept design, formulation review, product stability and 

compatibility study, consumer product trial and product lab testing, we implement 

stringent quality standards and abide by regulations or guidelines enforced by local 

regulatory boards. We collaborate with external accredited labs regularly for quality 

assurance of our cosmetic and health supplement products. To further monitor 

the performance of our products. We instituted a coherent and systematic process 

for customers to provide feedback on the products. Regional centres will receive 

customer feedbacks via digital channels or physically and will compile the feedbacks 

received into monthly report for submission to HQ. The Quality department at HQ 

will keep track of incidence rate and conduct necessary investigation or corrective 

actions where required.

COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS

In partnership with SGS Taiwan, Taiwan’s largest and most diverse independent quality testing facilities. Best 

World was able to establish our very own quality assurance zone on the SGS Taiwan Safety Information Platform. 

Contaminant test reports for microbial, heavy metals, western drug and cosmetic steroid etc., related to our 

products are uploaded on their website for customers’ reference.

Our DR’s Secret Sunscreen #5 received the coveted certification from Taiwan’s Symbol of National Quality (SNQ), 

“2018 SNQ – Symbol of National Quality Certification” according to its excellent quality among a category of skin 

care products.

In 2019, our Dr’s Secret Cleanser #1 was awarded Fashion Guide Certification after going through the Fashion 

Guide Special Evaluation (FG特优评鉴), where our product was tested by a number of FG members and reviews in

Perpetual Target

FY 2019 Performance

Zero reported cases pertaining to consumer health and safety

Achieved













































































Under the care of our Product Development team and Quality team, we recorded zero reported case 

pertaining to consumer health and safety in 2019. We aim to continue to assess health and safety impact of 

all our products.

CONSUMER SATISFACTION 

Sustaining a viable business cannot be done 

independently. At Best World, we understand the 

importance of customer engagement and channel 

much resources to it. We begin by engaging our 

distributors, who directly interacts with our consumers. 

By conducting monthly surveys with distributors, 

we are able to garner their responses, have a better 

understanding of their feedback and concern, and 

make improvements based on the feedback received. 

Furthermore, regular trainings and events are also 

arranged by the local team to engage with distributors.

In FY2019, we managed to obtain 100% satisfaction rate 

(defined as a score of 1 to 2 out of a scale of 1 to 4), 

1 being the best on distributor satisfaction survey and 

member satisfaction surveys.



Perpetual Target

FY 2019 Performance

Achieve a satisfaction rate

survey 

Achieved

We continue to make investments to both our online 

platform and brick and mortar stores to ensure our 

distributors have the best support they need to succeed 

in a competitive market.

Our BWL Mobile app complements our physical stores, 

allowing orders to be placed 24/7 and products to be 

delivered to the customer. Additionally, our apps also 

include features such as product details, updated 

promotions and order tracking that communicate 

useful information to interested users. Our social 

media presence through Instagram and Line apps also 

effectively connect with the younger generation, sharing 

beauty, health and product knowledge.

Our DRs Secret experience centre at Cuppage Singapore 

was purposefully built so customers can learn more 

about our products and enjoy personalised service, 

customised to their skin condition in a comfortable 

setting. Customer touchpoints are enhanced with 

available technologies give a modern experience, 

aligning to multigeneration of consumers’ expectations.

Environmental Initiatives

WASTE DISPOSAL MANAGEMENT

Proper waste management is essential for the well-being of the environment. As a 

distributor of consumer products, waste in the forms of containers and plastics are 

inevitable in the packaging process. We seek to ensure that our waste is properly 

managed and disposed to ensure the safety of our community. We are only able to 

provide figures for waste we engaged waste disposal vendors to dispose. We are 

not equipped to measure the weight of waste that is generated during our day to 

day activities that are disposed via the building’s waste disposal system. The waste 

disposed by the building management consist of waste generated by all tenants and 

a split of those figures are unavailable to us.

SINGAPORE

Our Singapore operations are served by National 

Environment Agency registered waste collectors. No 

hazardous waste was disposed for FY2018 and FY2019. 

The drop in non-hazardous waste was mainly due to 

less disposal of expired products in FY2019 compared 

to the previous year.

TAIWAN

No hazardous waste was generated by our Taiwan 

operations in FY2018 and FY2019. The increase in non-

hazardous waste was due to disposal of some products 

that did not meet our quality control standards. The 

products were incinerated by a SGS approved vendor 

in Taiwan. 

Note: The figures for Taiwan in 2018 were wrongly published in the 2018 report due to an omission of decimal 

points resulting in for example, 13.91 being published as 1391. Please refer to the 2019 report for the accurate 

2018 comparatives.

In FY2019, there were no cases of improper waste disposal and we will continue to make efforts to maintain these 

standards. 

PRODUCTION LINE SETUP AT TAI SENG

As we endeavour to familiarize ourselves with the manufacturing process, we have set up a small scale production 

line in Tai Seng to produce certain products in the DR’s Secret range. The waste generated in 2019 was not significant 

as the production line was being set up and tested and was only operational in 2020.

Certain discharge cannot be directly released into the sewers due to its viscosity. At the moment, as a temporary 

measure, we are reusing an emptied intermediate bulk container we received when buying another product’s 

raw material to contain these discharge and will send it to a certified vendor for processing and disposal when it 

becomes full. In future, we will be building a water treatment plant at the Tuas manufacturing facility to process 

these waste before releasing it into the sewers to fulfil the National Environment Agency’s requirements.

Perpetual Target

FY 2019 Performance

ELECTRONIC 

WASTE DISPOSAL

Although not substantial, we are aware that electronic 

waste comprises many components and may contain 

heavy metals and substances of concern, which 

require specialised equipment to dismantle, process 

and extract the constituent materials that can then be 

turned into new products. Therefore, for both Taiwan 

and Singapore, we appoint certified vendors to help 

with disposal of electronic waste. At the same time, 

these vendors also make sure that any confidential data 

in the electronic devices are completely destroyed and 

irretrievable, thus preventing misuse.

GOING PAPERLESS 

AND TRANSITING TO DIGITAL INVOICES

Based on our estimation, there were 23,883 invoices 

issued in 2019 by BWL Singapore. If we switch to digital 

invoicing, we can save almost 48 reams of paper, which 

equals to about 2.8 trees. The benefits of adopting digital 

invoices will definitely cut costs for the business, speed 

up the payment process and save the environment at 

the same time.

OFFICE RELOCATION

To meet our expansion needs, we moved our headquarters to our current office at Changi Business 

Park while production and warehousing functions remained at Tai Seng. In designing our new 

office premise, much emphasis was placed on incorporating environment considerations into our 

decisions.







Reuse of our movable modular furniture

We have always believed in procuring 

items that are of high quality, which tend 

to have longer lifespan and in the long 

haul, we produce less waste on the whole. 

We were able to reuse most of our office 

furniture that we procured 9 years back 

when we moved into our Tai Seng office. 

Not only do we generate less waste, we 

were able to setup our office in a shorter 

time, compared to having to buy new 

furniture and wait for it to be shipped and 

installed.

Optimal use of space

Through the use of movable folding 

walls, we are able to use the same 

space for multiple purposes. In its usual 

configuration, the space is carved into 3 

meeting rooms of various sizes to facilitate 

discussions and a fully functional pantry 

with a sitting area to create a café like 

environment, which is useful for meeting 

vendors or for our millennial workforce 

who sometimes work more effectively 

in an informal setting. When required, 

we can reconfigure the space to host a 

townhall meeting or have staff gatherings 

to enhance cohesion. The company also 

provides proper cutlery and cups so that 

we can cut down on disposable cutlery. 

At the end of lunch hour, the used cutlery 

and cups are loaded into the dishwasher 

for thorough cleaning.

Segregation of recyclable waste

We are also inculcating in our staff 

the practice to recycle and segregate 

recyclable waste from general waste. 

Labelled bins are situated around the 

office to consolidate recyclable waste.



PACKAGING MANAGEMENT

Our 

commitment 

to 

environment 

sustainability extends to our packaging 

materials. On top of ensuring that the 

packaging materials we use can provide 

enough protection and are compatible with 

our products and brand image, we also strive 

to minimise its environmental impacts.

We adopted the use of eco-friendly ink on our 

carton boxes. The ink chemistry allows for 

more cost-effective and less energy intensive 

paper recycling, as it simplifies the usually 

tricky process of separating the ink from 

paper to obtain clean pulp.

In 2020, we are looking to change the 

product packaging of our best selling range 

of products – DR’s Secret to FSCTM (Forest 

Stewardship Council) certified paper. The FSC 

certification is considered a “gold standard” 

designation where wood is harvested from 

forests that are responsibly managed, socially 

beneficial, environmentally conscious, and 

economically viable.
