1. Highlights 

1.1 Corporate profile 

Yamada Green Resources Limited (山田绿色资源有限公司) (‘Yamada’ or the ‘Company’), together with its 

subsidiaries (the ‘Group’), is an agricultural food product processing group in Fujian Province, the People’s 

Republic of China (‘PRC’ or ‘China’).  

Serving a long-established customer base from Japan, Yamada has earned a strong reputation of providing 

high quality products to food distributors and wholesalers in Japan. Currently, Yamada’s food processing 

operations, which adheres to stringent safety standards and requirements, are carried out at its main factory 

where it employs close to 200 workers. 

Yamada has also made considerable investments into office and logistics properties in China and Singapore, 

following the disposal of its bamboo, eucalyptus and parts of its mushroom plantations over the past few 

years. Rental from these properties will become a new source of income for the Group over the next few 

years.

1.2 Message to stakeholders 

On behalf of our Board of Directors, it is my pleasure to present our Sustainability Report 

for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 (FY2021). 

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plays an essential role in the long-term success of our business. It is 

important that we align our interests with that of the communities in which we operate in order to gain the 

support of the local communities and government agencies.  

We share our customers’ commitment to the protection of our environment and we believe in the importance 

of caring for our planet and encouraging others to play their part. Being one of the leading companies 

involving in agricultural business, we recognise our obligation and commitment to create a better living 

environment for our current and next generation. 

Our Directors recognise the importance of being a responsible steward of the land we manage. With this 

objective, the Company has established a CSR policy which includes the review of the following areas of the 

Group’s activities: 

(a) to review and recommend the Group’s policy with regards to CSR issues;  

(b) to review the Group’s environmental policies and practices;  

(c) to review the social impact of the Group’s business practices in the communities that the Group 

operates in;  

(d) to review and recommend policies and practices with regard to key stakeholders (employees, 

business partners, customers, suppliers,); and 

(e) to review and recommend policies and practices with regard to regulators. 

In FY2021, we continue to engage in constructive dialogue with our stakeholders and focus on our four key 

pillars of Regulatory Compliance, Food Safety, Environmental Sustainability, and Social Contribution. We are 

aware that our carbon footprint arises primarily out of electricity consumption by our companies. As such, we 

will step up our efforts on improving the energy efficiency of our operations in the coming year, doing our part 

to contribute to the positive global action on climate change. 

However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to weigh heavily on the global economy since the outbreak in 

early 2020. Notwithstanding the progress due to lockdown measures and vaccine rollouts, we have seen 

resurgence of infection as a result of new and more virulent versions of the virus. The challenging market 

conditions in our key markets of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Japan arising from the COVID-19 

pandemic led to declines in both our domestic and exports sales. Meanwhile, revenue from our investment 

properties segment in PRC and Singapore increased as more space of the properties were leased out. 

Looking ahead, there is much uncertainty of how long the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to persist and 

operating environment is expected to remain challenging. Therefore, the Group has adopted a stance to 

conserve cash resources for long-term sustainability of our business operations and cope with any sudden 

and unforeseen changes. To complement sales initiatives, the Group will continue to exercise stringent cost 

management, build rapport and improve business relationships with existing major customers. We will also 

continue to actively market and promote the leasing of our investment properties to grow our source of 

recurring income. 

In addition, we wish to confirm that the Board has considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic 

formulation, determined the material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and overseen the 

management and monitoring of the material ESG factors. 

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors

2.4 Sustainability materiality 

Using a materiality index, we align our responsible business priorities with the Group’s principal business and 

operational risks, as illustrated in the diagram below.  

We have also developed metrics to help us measure our progress, as indicated in our sustainability 

scorecard in Appendix A. We will review and adjust the material issues and relevant metrices each year, as 

the external and business context changes.

3. Our performance 

3.1 How we measure our performance 

Our sustainability strategy is embedded into the appropriate parts of our business, with dedicated teams 

for each focus area, and coordination by our relevant departmental managers. 

Progress will be tracked in two key ways: measuring performance against metrics, and evaluating how well 

the programs have advanced, through a metric of ‘commitments’. 

Metrics and targets 

We have established key performance indicators for each of the four focus areas outlined in our 

sustainability strategy. Periodically, we plan to introduce new metrics and update targets to ensure 

alignment with our strategy. 

Commitments 

To ensure we have a robust sustainability programme in place, we have included the key commitments for 

each area of our sustainability strategy. The progress we have made against each key commitment is 

indicated using the symbols shown in the table below. 

We track and review our sustainability programme with the Board of Directors at least once a year.

3.2 Regulatory compliance 

Overview 

To maintain a fair, ethical and efficient business and 

working environment, Yamada strictly adheres to the local 

laws and regulations relating to corporate governance, 

risk management, and code of conduct (including anti-

money laundering, anti-corruption, fraud, and 

confidentiality).  

Corporate governance 

Yamada’s Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) recognises the importance 

of sound corporate governance in protecting the interest of the 

shareholders as well as strengthening investors’ confidence in the 

management and financial reporting of the Group. We are committed 

to ensuring and maintaining a high standard of corporate governance 

within the Group. Good corporate governance establishes and 

maintains a legal and ethical environment, which helps to safeguard 

the interests of the shareholders of the Group.

 

FY2021 Progress 

0

Incidents of bribery and 

corruption 

 

In FY2021, Yamada welcomed three new directors to the Board, replacing two directors who have resigned 

during the year. 

New Directors 

 

Resigned Directors 

• Mr. Tan Kah Ghee (Independent director, 

appointed on 1 January 2021 and 

redesignated as Lead Independent director on 

1 April 2021) 

• Mr. Liu Yi (Independent director, appointed on 

1 April 2021 and redesignated as Independent 

Chairman on 28 August 2021) 

• Ms. Chen Ying (Executive director, appointed 

on 14 May 2021) 

 

• Mr. Chua Ser Miang (Lead independent director, 

resigned on 31 March 2021) 

• Mr. Xie Yimin (Executive director, resigned on 14 

May 2021) 

Mr Liu Yi replaces Mr Chang Feng-Chang who had been an Independent Director for an aggregate period of 

more than 9 years and re-designated as Non-Executive Director. 

The Group, through its Company Secretary, will continue to update the Board on relevant new laws and 

regulations affecting the Company. From time to time, and through Board meetings and other meetings, both 

formal and informal, our CEO has been advising our Directors of the changing commercial and business 

risks faced by the Group. 

The Directors are also updated regularly with changes to the SGX-ST Listing Rules, risk management, 

corporate governance, insider trading and the key changes in the relevant regulatory requirements and 

financial reporting standards and the relevant laws and regulations to facilitate effective discharge of their 

fiduciary duties as Board or Board Committees members. New releases issued by the SGX-ST and 

Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) which are relevant to the Directors are circulated to 

the Board by the Company Secretary.  

The Directors are encouraged to attend seminars and receive training to improve themselves in the 

discharge of Directors’ duties and responsibilities. Changes to regulations and accounting standards are 

monitored closely by the Management. To keep pace with such regulatory changes, the Company provides 

opportunities for ongoing education and training on Board processes and best practices as well as updates 

on changes in legislation and financial reporting standards, regulations and guidelines from the SGX-ST 

Listing Rules that affect the Company and/or the Directors in discharging their duties. Such training costs are 

borne by the Company. 

As part of our strategy, we will continually seek to be fully compliant with corporate governance rules and 

regulations, including relevant laws and regulations in the countries that we operate in, in relation to bribery, 

extortion, fraud and money laundering that have a significant impact on the Group.

Business continuity management 

As a responsible company, we believe that comprehensive emergency preparedness and response 

capabilities and business continuity plans demonstrate good governance, and are necessary for 

sustainability. Our plans help us protect personnel, facilities and neighboring communities in the event of 

natural disasters, security incidents, operational disruptions and other incidents.  

COVID-19 Pandemic 

 

In view of the COVID-19 outbreak in FY2020, we have added pandemic preparedness to our business 

continuity plans since February 2020 to protect our staff and ensure that our business can continue with 

minimal impact to our operations.  

We have instituted precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our staff, and will continue 

to stringently observe and uphold safe distancing and personal hygiene measures dictated by the 

governments and do our part in curbing the spread of the virus. As the global situation on COVID-19 

remains fluid, we will continue to monitor the local situation and will put in place the above practices and 

any additional controls as required by the local governments (e.g. quarantine measures, stop work orders) 

where applicable. 

To mitigate the impact on the Group’s business operations, we have also formulated plans to ensure 

product safety, stable production and smooth sales to ensure business continuity should the situation 

become more challenging in future.  

As we look forward to the next financial year, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to stand out as the most 

pressing challenge. Therefore, the Group has adopted a stance to conserve cash resources for long-term 

sustainability of our business operations and cope with any sudden and unforeseen changes. To 

complement sales initiatives, the Group will continue to exercise stringent cost management, build rapport 

and improve business relationships with existing major customers. We will also continue to actively market 

and promote the leasing of our investment properties to grow our source of recurring income.  

We shall keep a close eye on our operations, and announce any material changes to our business 

performance to shareholders on a timely basis, as and when appropriate. 

Risk management 

As a responsible business, we view risk management as one of our most important responsibilities to our 

customers, suppliers, employees, and regulators. We are committed to developing the appropriate systems, 

policies, procedures, arrangements and controls to ensure effective risk management is exercised and 

promoted within our Group culture. We believe in appropriate training of our staff and communication with 

our clients as requisite to fulfilling our risk management goals. 

Our risk management practices cover strategic, financial, operational, compliance and information 

technology risks associated with the Group. 

We view our risk management policies and procedures as dynamic in response to the evolution of our 

business strategies, the development of our business and the innovation within our industry. We will strive to 

improve our risk management capabilities and processes to stay abreast of market best practices. We 

believe effective risk management is crucial to the long-term success of our business. 

Our four cornerstones of effective risk management and sound internal controls are – 

• 

The role of the Board in its oversight of risk management policies and their implementation; 

• 

The role of Senior Management in ensuring that sound policies, effective procedures and robust 

systems are in place; 

• 

The presence of sound risk management processes and operating procedures that integrate prudent 

risk limits with appropriate risk measurement, monitoring and reporting; and 

• 

The presence of competent personnel in the firm’s compliance, controls, risk management, and audit 

functions.

Preventing bribery and corruption 

The Group prohibits all forms of bribery and corruption. The Group requires all employees to strictly abide by 

professional ethics and eliminate any corruption and bribery. All employees are expected to discharge their 

duties with integrity, to act fairly and professionally, and to abstain from engaging in bribery activities or any 

activities that might exploit their positions against the Group’s interests. 

Whistle-blowers can report verbally or in writing to the senior management of the Group for any suspected 

misconduct with full details and supporting evidence. The management will conduct investigations against 

any suspicious or illegal behaviour to protect the Group’s interests. The Group advocates a confidentiality 

mechanism to protect the whistleblowers against unfair dismissal or victimisation. Where criminality is 

suspected, a report is made to the relevant regulators or law enforcement authorities when the management 

considers necessary.

3.3 Food safety 

Overview 

Food safety and quality are core to our commercial 

reputation and consumers’ expectations. We are 

committed to responsible sourcing as it helps assure 

safety and quality of our end products.  

Production quality and food safety 

We are deeply committed to production quality and food safety. This 

is evidenced by the ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System and 

ISO 22000:2005 Food Safety Management System certifications over 

our production facilities.  

We are also expected to comply with relevant regulatory 

requirements under the Food Safety Law (食品安全法), Measures for 

the Administration of Export Food Hygiene (出口食品卫生管理办法), 

and Provisions on the Administration of Hygiene Registration and 

Filing of Export Food Producing Enterprises (出口食品生产企业卫生

注册登记管理规定). 

Our quality control teams are committed to hygienic and safe 

production. The teams undergo regular food safety management 

training to maintain awareness and management of food safety risks, 

and are responsible for ensuring quality control of our products.  

Our operations are audited regularly to monitor management and 

performance relating to hygiene, sanitation and ‘good housekeeping’. 

We recorded no incidents of non-compliance with regulations and 

voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of 

products. High standards of manufacturing help minimise exposure to 

risks that may affect product quality.  

When we manufacture our products, we adopt stringent process 

controls to ascertain product quality and prevent contaminants from 

entering the production process. All our products passed the tests 

required by the Chinese national food safety standards. 

In FY2021, we have zero food safety incidents and non-compliance 

with laws and regulations on food safety. As part of our strategy, we 

will continually seek to continue this track record in the coming years.

and the ingredients and nutritional values of each of our branded products sold domestically is provided on 

the food label printed on the packaging.  

In FY2021, we have zero non-compliance with laws and regulations on product and service information and 

labelling, and marketing communications. As part of our strategy, we will continually seek to continue this 

track record in the coming years.

Sustainable supply chain 

Close to 100% of our purchases are from reliable local suppliers in the PRC. We believe that a secure and 

stable supply chain is very important to ensure the smooth and uninterrupted operation of our production 

activities. To further ensure that our supply chain is primed for long-term food security, community resilience, 

and environmental sustainability, we actively work with our partners to achieve the following: 

 

 

Securing long-term supply 

Since 2008, we have entered into the necessary leases to secure our shiitake 

mushroom cultivation bases to ensure the supply of self-cultivated shiitake 

mushrooms. 

We also entered into agreements with the respective farm contractors to procure 

individual farmers to provide the following labour services for our shiitake mushroom 

cultivation bases:  

(i) farming (mainly daily maintenance, harvesting, sorting, transportation, etc.);  

(ii) construction of cultivation tentage outer structure; and  

(iii) installation of shading net.  

Under the terms of the agreement, the farmers will be remunerated based on the 

volume of all the harvested shiitake mushrooms from their farmland. 

 

Zero fertiliser 

As part of our environmental protection initiatives and for the purposes of ensuring 

the natural taste of our self-cultivated shiitake mushrooms, we do not use fertilisers in 

the cultivation of our shiitake mushrooms. As a testimony of our above efforts, we 

have received the certificate of “Organic Product” for fresh self-cultivated shiitake 

mushrooms. 

 

Natural irrigation 

We select locations such as mildly sloping small valleys or similar geological 

structures surrounded by mountains to establish our shiitake mushroom cultivation 

bases which allow for natural irrigation. The irrigation system in our cultivation bases 

is built with furrows located between the rows in the field where the synthetic logs are 

placed. Irrigation water flows along the furrows down the slope throughout the field.  

The irrigation system in our cultivation bases is customised to receive natural spring 

water for irrigation while minimising the environmental impact. 

 

Developing win-win partnership 

In order to ensure the quality of our shiitake mushrooms, we have developed 

genetically improved mycelia by collaborating with Fujian Agricultural and Forestry 

University (Mycological Research Centre)(福建农林大学菌物研究中心). Mycelia will 

be inoculated into the synthetic logs, the substrate on which shiitake mushrooms 

grow. We will only procure synthetic logs that meets our quality requirements and 

specifications.  

As part of our quality assurance policies, we will conduct pre-cultivation briefings to 

representatives of the individual farmers procured by the respective Villagers’ 

Committees to familiarise them with, among others, key stages in the growing 

process of our shiitake mushrooms and necessary techniques involved throughout 

the whole process. Individual farmers are required to closely control and monitor 

conditions such as temperature, humidity, ventilation and lighting during the growing 

process of our shiitake mushrooms.  

Meanwhile, our cultivation technicians will provide technical training and guidance to 

the individual farmers and conduct regular as well as random quality checks on our 

cultivation bases.

Emergency preparedness 

While we emphasise on preventing safety incidents, we also prepare the employees to handle and respond 

to emergencies, including potential accidents and fire. This is very important to reduce and limit the impact 

and casualty as a result of the any safety incidents that may happen in our line of work. Emergency response 

procedures is an important part of our Safety Management Policy.

3.4 Environmental sustainability 

Overview 

Environmental protection laws are strictly enforced in 

China. As one of the leading suppliers of fresh and 

processed agricultural products in China, we are 

committed to ensuring our full compliance with national 

environmental regulations.  

Comprehensive policies are developed to ensure our 

commitment towards environmental protection, reducing 

carbon emissions, preventing pollution, and minimising 

waste can be achieved during our daily operations.  

Environmental policy in China 

Environmental policy in China is set by the National People's 

Congress and managed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection 

of the People's Republic of China. The central government issues 

strict regulations for which the actual monitoring and enforcement is 

largely undertaken by the local governments. 

In January 2015, a new environmental law came into effect, covering 

land, water and air pollution. It contains strict penalties, including 

seizing of the property of illegal polluters, with company 

executives subject to prison sentences of 15 days. There is no 

upper limit on fines. More than 300 different groups will be able to 

sue on the behalf of people harmed by pollution. 

Yamada is fully compliant with China’s environmental policy. As 

part of our strategy, we seek to continue to be fully compliant with 

China’s environmental policy with zero environmental incidents 

and zero fines on contravention of environmental regulations.  

Emissions reduction 

The corporate culture of protecting the environment is reflected in 

every operation undertaken by the Group. 

We are committed to positive action on climate change and are 

dedicated to reducing the carbon emission in our daily operations. 

Employees are reminded to save electricity and fuel consumption 

through regular internal communications.  

To determine the carbon footprint, we collect energy usage data from 

each our businesses and then calculate our total annual greenhouse 

gas emissions.  

In FY2021, the Group generated a carbon footprint of 2,303.5 tonnes 

of carbon dioxide emission (tCO2e) with a carbon emission intensity 

of 49.8 kgCO2e per square metre of factory floor area, representing a 

15% decrease from the previous year. The emission mainly arises 

from purchased electricity used in the production process, which 

accounted for more than 84% of the total carbon emission of the 

Group. 

The decrease in carbon footprint intensity is mainly due to decreased 

production activity during the year, and greater awareness amongst 

our staff to reduce electricity consumption.

We follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol 

established by the World Resources Institute and 

the World Business Council for Sustainable 

Development, the standard manual for 

measuring corporate greenhouse gas emissions. 

Using the “control method”, we include 100% of 

the emissions associated with businesses which 

we directly control. Our carbon footprint includes:  

• 

All fuels used directly by our companies 

(Scope 1 emissions) 

• 

All purchased electricity used in our 

facilities (Scope 2 emissions) 

• 

Impact of business air travel, and 

transportation of goods to our customers 

(optional Scope 3 emissions) 

We recognise that reducing carbon emissions in our daily operations has a positive effect on climate change. 

As such, Yamada has committed to maintain our carbon footprint, from a FY2019 baseline.  

Energy efficiency 

Due to our production activities, direct fuel and electricity constitutes a significant proportion of our operating 

expenses. By investing in energy efficiency, we not only help protect the environment but can also lower our 

financial costs. 

To ensure the effective use of electricity, the Group conducted the following practices: 

• 

Using energy-saving vehicles and equipment 

• 

Regular maintenance of production equipment, especially boilers, to maintain high energy efficiency 

• 

Turn off lights, computers and air conditioning system before clocking out  

• 

Place energy saving reminder labels next to switches  

• 

Clean office equipment (such as refrigerator, air-conditioner) regularly to maintain high efficiency  

Wastewater management 

Wastewater is passed through an in-house wastewater treatment facility fitted with biological treatment 

tanks. In addition, the municipal environmental protection bureau obtains wastewater samples from the 

facility at least four times a year to ensure that discharge standards are met. As a result, the treated 

wastewater discharge will be able to meet the requirements of the water emission standard of the Fujian 

Province.  

In FY2021, the Group had a wastewater discharge intensity of 4.2 m3 per square metre of factory floor area. 

As part of our strategy, we seek to continue to ensure that 100% of our wastewater discharge meet the local 

emission standards.  

Saving water 

Water scarcity is a growing concern around the world and a serious global challenge that we must work 

together to address. This is even a greater concern to us, given that water is also an essential input in the 

food industry, from cleaning and sanitation to manufacturing.  

In FY2021, the Group had a water consumption intensity of 5.0 m3 per square metre of factory floor area. 

Where possible, the Group already has procedures in place to reduce water usage in our production lines. 

Our employees are also reminded of the importance to save water in their daily activities. 

We will continue to track and monitor the performance on the wastewater discharge and water consumption. 

Progress and performance improvement will be reported every year.

3.5 Social contribution 

Overview 

Employees are the integral part of our competitive 

advantage and our sustainability agenda. We strive to 

invest in training and create an enjoyable working 

environment to our employees. Our human resources 

team develops, evolves and champions our human 

‘capital’ through training, evaluation, remuneration, and 

engagement.  

Through our people, we are also committed in making 

positive contributions to our community by giving back to 

the society and helping the less privileged. 

Skills competency and employee training 

To ensure that our employee excel, we emphasise on continuous 

learning in the workplace. Every employee has equal opportunities to 

upgrade and sharpen their skill sets through formal and on-the-job 

internal training programs.

workforce

The Company also emphasises on internal leadership development, and places great importance on 

developing a network of new-generation leaders who would play an important role in driving the business in 

the future. 

In FY2021, the Group invested an average of 12 hours of training on each operational staff. We seek to 

continue this practice in the coming year. 

Performance appraisal 

To ensure the Company achieves its goals, we have various performance appraisal methods in place to 

determine the performance of the Company as well as each individual employee.  

The employee performance appraisal comprises mainly quantifiable evaluation criteria. In addition, we 

actively collect performance information for each employee each month through inputs from direct 

supervisors and feedbacks, as well as periodical employee communication sessions.  

These collected information allow us to understand the performance and skills development needs of each 

team and individual employee from multiple aspects. This is crucial for the Company to develop annual 

training programs for employees that are designed to enhance their skills and improve overall productivity.  

In FY2021, all of our employees are at least subject to an annual performance appraisal by their superiors. 

We seek to continue this practice in the coming year. 

Equal opportunity 

We have always been an equal opportunity employer to provide a fair workplace for employees, following the 

principles of equality and non-discrimination. Recruitment, remuneration, promotion, and benefits are 

required to be handled based on objective assessment, equal opportunity and non-discrimination regardless 

of gender, race, marital status, pregnancy, disability, age or family status.  

We attract talent through fair, and flexible recruitment strategy that includes recruitment application, job 

description, job applications, interview, selection, approval, and job offer. Promotion is based on performance 

and suitability.

We offer competitive remuneration to attract and retain talented staff members. Remuneration packages 

(which includes the necessary social benefits) are reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with 

employment market. Dismissal also complies with employment laws and regulations relating to non-

discrimination. 

In FY2021, female employees comprise 62% of our entire workforce. We will continue to track and monitor 

female representation in our workforce and report these statistics every year. 

Encouraging work-life balance 

To enhance employee teamwork and cohesion, improve employee health and improve employee work-life 

balance, the Group has been organising periodic employee gatherings during major festivals and sports 

competitions. This helps the employees relax their mind and body, develop teamwork, explore their talent, so 

as to develop a positive attitude in both work and life.
