CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

At YHI, the Board oversees the Group’s 

sustainability performance, practices and 

initiatives and its compliance with SGX 

guidelines on corporate governance and 

sustainability reporting. It has played a 

key role in determining and re-evaluating 

the material environmental, social and 

governance factors examined in this report.







DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

On behalf of the Board and management of YHI International 

Limited (“YHI” or the “Group”), I present our fourth annual 

sustainability report (the “report”). This report compiles 

our sustainability strategy and initiatives as we continue to 

evolve and improve on our sustainability journey. At YHI, we 

aim to create a positive impact on the environment and the 

community by paying close attention to the issues that are 

material to our stakeholders. 

In recent years, there has been an increase in social 

awareness towards waste issues and the need to conserve 

resources. At YHI, we are aware that our manufacturing 

operations generate waste, and we endeavour to reduce our 

contribution to waste through reduced use of raw materials 

and recycling more waste. Through our Kaizen initiatives, 

our various subsidiaries constantly challenge themselves 

and innovate to find new ways of reducing wastage and 

improving operational efficiency.

At YHI, the Board oversees the Group’s sustainability 

performance, practices and initiatives and its compliance 

with SGX guidelines on corporate governance and 

sustainability reporting. It has played a key role in 

determining and re-evaluating the material environmental, 

social and governance factors examined in this report, and 

considers sustainability an important part of our strategy 

formulation. As a listed company, YHI is committed to 

the Code of Corporate Governance of Singapore, which 

provides an important framework for controls and checks 

that help the Board govern with transparency and integrity.

During the reporting period, the COVID-19 pandemic 

has spread across the globe and led to an outbreak that 

severely impacted communities and industries all over the 

world. Economies have slowed down, supply chains have 

been disrupted, and many businesses have had a hard time 

recovering from the pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 

outbreak, many governments and business were prompted 

to re-evaluate their priorities and strategies. At YHI, the 

pandemic has reinforced our belief in the importance of 

thinking long-term and making decisions that ensure the 

sustainability of our business and protect our stakeholders, 

including our shareholders, employees and customers. We 

will continue to keep abreast of the situation and make 

strategic decisions accordingly.

We hope this report will provide our stakeholders with 

valuable insights on our sustainability efforts.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS  

AND REPORTING APPROACH

OUR COMMITMENT

The coronavirus outbreak has made us rethink our lives in the modern society and how vulnerable we are. The pandemic 

harshly reminds us that we cannot take whatever we enjoy today for granted and assume that tomorrow will always be the 

same. We have learnt in the pandemic that our modern livelihoods are built on known conditions and numerous presumptions 

and they are more delicately intertwined and fragile than we know. For example, we will never forget how easily the supply 

chains for food and daily necessities were disrupted during the pandemic and how panic ensued when people were informed 

of supply chain disruptions or just the possibility of it. The pandemic and the supply chain episode showed that in modern 

society, there is no clear demarcation between “present” and “future” as any problem that may happen in the future can 

impact us today in various forms.

 

At YHI, we believe that it is our responsibility to continuously create and achieve greater economic value for our shareholders, 

and we endeavour to benefit the economy and society through our business activities. We also believe that this value creation 

journey is never a zero-sum game, as we can only be sustainable if the well-being and development of the environment, 

society and our people are not unfairly compromised and the resources used for our activities are not irresponsibly depleted 

or wasted. To ensure sustainability, there is no better way than the consistent monitoring of resource input and output of our 

commercial activities and the proper balancing of respective stakeholders’ interests.

We firmly believe in recognising our responsibility to the environment, society, the market, as well as our employees. We have 

been incorporating and managing sustainability as part of our corporate policies, business strategy and risk management 

practices over the years. We learned from our experiences that with proper planning and implementation, our business 

practices can simultaneously maximise economic value creation and achieve sustainability objectives.

Measures taken by YHI during coronavirus pandemic

We take precautionary measures to safeguard the health and well-being of our employees in various countries and we 

acknowledge the importance of adhering to the rules and guidelines issued by local governments to prevent the spread of 

the COVID-19 virus and mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on local communities and economies. 

Our employees and visitors are required to be scanned for body temperature before entering our offices and their contact 

details are dutifully recorded. Hand sanitisers and face masks are provided in offices for the use of employees and visitors 

and social distancing signs are prominently displayed to remind them the importance of maintaining physical distance. 

Employee sitting arrangements in certain offices are also redrawn to ensure adequate physical distance between employees. 

In certain countries where face mask is mandatory, our employees are constantly reminded the importance of wearing the 

face mask properly. 

We abide by the work-from-home rules and guidelines issued by local governments to minimise the number of people in the 

workplace. In countries where lockdown orders are issued, our employees are instructed to work from home and approvals 

are required before they can enter the office. Even after the rules are lifted by local governments, we still cautiously control 

the number of employees and visitors in our offices.      

 

OUR REPORTING APPROACH

We adopted a phased approach in preparing and publishing our sustainability reports:

• In our first sustainability report we provided an overview of the identified material ESG factors, how we are addressing 

these factors, and the data reflecting our performance.

• In our second sustainability report we provided further information in relation to the identified material ESG factors, our 

approach, and our performance. We also provide our targets for the material ESG factors.  

• From our third sustainability report onwards we continually report on our material ESG factors and our performance 

against the targets. We also revise our presentation of performance data and targets when there are changes in the 

applicable GRI Standards or business environments (such as the impacts arising from the coronavirus pandemic) in our 

fourth report.

GOVERNANCE OVER SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS

Our Board of Directors oversees YHI Group’s sustainability matters. The Board is supported by YHI’s Enterprise Risk 

Management Executive Committee, which comprises members from senior management and is headed by the Executive 

Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. On behalf of the Committee, the Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer 

report to the Board of Directors on all matters concerning sustainability.

Our senior management and heads of subsidiaries are tasked to manage YHI Group’s sustainability matters and promote 

sustainability culture. They are also tasked to keep abreast of the sustainability topics and trends and to ensure that YHI 

Group’s sustainability policy is effective and relevant to the current business environment.    

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Stakeholder engagement is at the core of our business operations and sustainability strategy. We engage with our stakeholders 

in a fair, trust-based and responsible manner through hard work, dedication and commitment. Feedback from our stakeholders 

forms a crucial part of our strategic and business planning and is viewed as a valuable insight for us to plan and improve upon 

our sustainability policies and practices. Our stakeholder engagement mechanisms are outlined in Exhibit 2 below:

MATERIAL ESG FACTORS

Material ESG factors are areas that impact our business and that we impact through our activities. We conducted our 

first formal material ESG factor identification and evaluation when preparing our first sustainability report in 2017 with 

the guidance of external consultants and GRI Standards was recommended as our sustainability reporting framework. Our 

material ESG factors were identified and determined through the following four steps: 

STEP 1: 

Conduct 

stakeholder 

engagement

STEP 2:

Identify 

potential 

material 

ESG factors

STEP 3:

Material 

ESG 

factors

YHI INTERNATIONAL LIMITED   Sustainability Report 2020

We first gathered our key internal stakeholders to identify YHI’s important sustainability issues and potential ESG factors 

through workshop and online survey. Stakeholders’ inputs and survey results were then collated and analysed to identify a 

short list of material ESG factors. More in-depth evaluations were conducted until material ESG factors were prioritised and 

determined. We also determine YHI’s distribution subsidiaries and factories to be included in the reporting by evaluating 

their significance and readiness. Essentially, we determined our material ESG factors by reviewing the entire value chain and 

the practices of our distribution and manufacturing business. 

Every year we critically assess the relevance of our material ESG factors and evaluate other potential factors. We also 

critically evaluate all our distribution subsidiaries and factories to determine whether the existing reporting boundaries 

should be expanded to include some other subsidiaries. 

For this report, we find our material ESG factors and reporting boundaries remain relevant. We made some revisions in our 

reporting of performance data for some of the ESG factors in accordance with the relevant new requirements under the GRI 

Standards. Our material ESG factors and performance targets are provided in Exhibit 3 below:

MATERIAL ENVIRONMENTAL TOPICS

As one of our key corporate policies, for many years, we have embraced the Japanese business philosophy and practice of 

“Kaizen”, which can be translated as “improvement”. To stay competitive, our subsidiaries are aware of the importance of 

continually reviewing their existing business and operational practices to identify areas for improvement. Improvements can 

be delivered through innovation, enhancing productivity or reducing waste. In addition to Kaizen, our “3R” policy of reducing 

stock-holding, accounts receivables and operating costs also assists us in minimising resource consumption and waste.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION &amp; EMISSIONS

We consume a significant amount of energy to manufacture and distribute our products. Our distribution subsidiaries’ 

offices and warehouses primarily consume electricity, whereas our factories rely on both electricity and natural gas.

Our energy consumption level is generally aligned with our business activities. An increase or decrease in the storage and 

shipment of goods, or an increase or decrease in the production level has a direct impact on the distribution segment or our 

factories’ energy consumption. Besides, many other factors can affect the energy consumption level and new factors may 

emerge due to changing business environments and operational conditions. 

For example, our manufacturing segment will normally experience increase in energy consumption level when manufacturing 

new product models. The transfer of production orders between factories can also affect the factories’ average energy 

consumption level and such transfers are common in recent years primarily due to our customers’ allocation of orders to 

different factories as a result of USA and China trade war.

YHI consistently strives to increase efficiency and minimise energy consumption. Over the years, we have implemented 

various energy efficiency and energy conservation policies and guidance for both business segments. For example:

• For factories, energy consumption is closely monitored and systematically assessed for potential savings. Specific energy 

saving initiatives were also being worked on in the past so as to reduce the consumption level.   

• For warehouses and offices, we have a clear policy that we should turn off lights and air-conditioners while not in use. Where 

feasible, we will opt for individual workspace lighting instead of centralised lighting in order to conserve energy. Energy-saving 

LED lighting or light control switch and motion sensors have also been installed so as to reduce the consumption level.

The total electricity consumption by the five major distribution subsidiaries and the three factories in 2020 is provided 

in Figure 1-1(a) and Figure 1-1(b) respectively. The scope 2 emissions in CO2 equivalent associated with the electricity 

consumption is also provided. The total natural gas consumption by the three factories is provided in Figure 1-2.

For 2020 as compared with previous years:

• The five major distribution subsidiaries recorded a lower level of electricity consumption due to decrease in business 

activities and warehouse operations during the coronavirus pandemic. All the five subsidiaries had experienced lockdowns 

in their country of operations.  

• Similarly, the factories recorded a lower level of electricity and natural gas consumption due to the overall decrease in 

production and supply chain activities during the coronavirus pandemic.

WATER, EFFLUENTS &amp; WASTE MANAGEMENT

At Manufacturing Segment

Our factories produce wastewater and waste materials during the manufacturing process. The waste materials primarily 

include aluminium dross, sludge, paint waste, waste coolant and non-reusable packaging materials. While our factories’ level 

of effluents and waste discharge or disposal is aligned with production activities, other influential factors include varying 

product design requirements and the discharge or disposal quota imposed by the local regulators.

We endeavour to minimise water and resource consumption at our factories to reduce effluent and waste output and 

continue to practise recycling and/or reusing where feasible. For example:

• Both Suzhou and Malacca factory practise water recycling and reusing:

 -  As the amount of wastewater discharge is limited by the discharge quota imposed by local authority, Suzhou factory 

strives to maximise its recycling and reusing of wastewater through water treatment. If wastewater discharge is 

needed, Suzhou factory will adhere to the discharge quota and the pollution limits (such as the level of chemical 

oxygen demand contained in the wastewater) set by the authority.

- There is no wastewater discharge at Malacca factory as wastewater produced will be chemically treated for recycling 

and reusing.

• All factories closely monitor the amount of aluminium consumed and the amount of production scraps produced. Excess 

aluminium trimmed off during alloy wheel moulding and refining process is put together and evaluated for possible 

reusing. Packaging waste is minimised through efficient consumption of packaging materials.

• Wood or plastic pallets for factory and warehouse storage use are purchased in accordance with forecasted usage. Pallets 

are reused until damaged beyond repair. Some factories also recycle their scrap metals by giving the scraps to external 

contractors to weld and build into storage racks and shelves for reuse. Some of our factory workers turned damaged 

wooden pallets into office furniture and garden trellis.   

Non-recyclable or reusable effluents and waste are discharged and disposed of in accordance with local regulations. For example:

• If wastewater discharge is required, Suzhou factory will discharge the water to an external wastewater treatment plant 

designated by the local authority in compliance with the discharge quota and the pollutant limits imposed; whereas, Taiwan 

factory’s wastewater is chemically treated in accordance with local regulations before being discharged to public sewer.

• Waste materials are disposed of by factories to waste disposal collectors in compliance with the respective local 

regulations. Similarly, damaged tyres and batteries are also disposed of by the distribution business to waste disposal 

collectors in compliance with local regulations.

The amount of water discharge by quality and destination for the three factories between 2017 and 2020 are provided in Figure 2-1.

For 2020 as compared with previous years:

• Suzhou factory discharged more water than the quota set by the local authority as southern China experienced heavy 

rainfall during summer of the year. As at the date of this report, the Suzhou factory is still liaising with the local authority 

on whether additional discharge fees will be levied. The Taiwan factory recorded an increase in water discharge due to 

the higher production level achieved by the factory in 2020.     

• The factories recorded reduced amounts of hazardous and non-hazardous waste primarily due to their continuous control 

of material planning and consumption and prompt actions taken to reuse or recycle certain materials.

There were no incidents of non-compliance with the relevant water discharge or hazardous waste handling regulations 

between 2017 and 2020. YHI aims to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance in 2021.

AT DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT

We do not find the water consumption and the amount of wastewater produced by our distribution business to be material.

The waste produced at our distribution subsidiaries primarily includes scrap tyres and batteries. Scrap batteries are classified 

as hazardous products in certain countries while tyres are classified as non-hazardous. All our scrap tyres and batteries are 

disposed of through external scrap collectors.

Starting from this report, we will provide the quantity of scrap tyres and batteries disposed by our five major distribution 

subsidiaries. As the unit of measurement for disposals may vary by countries due to different local rules or commercial 

practices, for the purpose of aggregation and standardised reporting, we will convert and report the disposal quantity in 

“pieces” of tyre and battery disposed. The total pieces of tyre and battery disposals in 2020 are provided in Figure 2-3.

five major distribution subsidiaries in 2020

Note:  Estimation and conversion is made for certain subsidiaries to derive the total pieces of 

disposals as the disposal quantity may be originally measured by weight

Generally, our tyre distribution business does not dispose tyre products as the possibility of receiving faulty tyres from 

manufacturers is low. Majority of the disposed tyres were worn-out tyres disposed by one of YHI Singapore’s business 

divisions which provides vehicle repair and tyre replacement services for commercial trucks and passenger cars. The tyres 

were owned by YHI’s customers and disposed by YHI Singapore after performing tyre replacement services. Similarly, most 

of the scrap batteries were replaced after performing batteries replacement services. The batteries were disposed by YHI at 

customers’ requests.  

From 2017 to 2020, there were no incidents of non-compliance with the relevant hazardous waste handling regulations. YHI 

aims to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance in 2021.

EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT

Our employees are key to the success of our business. Without them, we would not have been able to achieve the business 

growth we have experienced. It is stated in our corporate mission that we treat our employees with care, consideration, 

respect and provide them with the growth opportunities they seek in order to have long, successful careers at YHI. The 

core values of YHI also specifically promote “teamwork”, “mutual respect”, “integrity &amp; honesty”, “quality of work” and 

“commitment”.

At YHI, we are committed to providing equal job opportunities in the countries we operate in, regardless of gender, age and 

race. We are also committed to recruiting locals or residents to run and manage the operations in our overseas subsidiaries 

and accordingly close to 100% of the management of our overseas subsidiaries are hired from the local communities. As a 

global distributor with business operations in various countries, we believe that it is important for us to be an open-minded, 

fair and responsible employer. 

We also place emphasis on fair and equal remuneration and employee development to improve their employability. We 

believe these measures help us attract and retain our talent pool and prepare them for leadership roles. We also regularly 

benchmark against industry peers to monitor and improve our employee remuneration and benefit packages.

We promote work-life balance for our employees and encourage them to organise a variety of activities such as holiday trips 

and festive gatherings. The activities are open to all employees and subsidized by YHI. Some of the activities such as family 

days are also open to the employees’ children.

At end 2020, the total headcount of the five distribution subsidiaries was 408 and the total headcount for the three factories 

was 1,181. The gender, geographical location and age breakdown of the employees for each busines segment are provided 

in Figure 3-1(a). The number of our non-permanent employees is not significant and is therefore immaterial for this report.

In 2020, the major distribution subsidiaries and the factories recorded a total of 88 and 466 new hires respectively, 

representing hire rate of 22% and 39%, whereas the distribution subsidiaries and the factories recorded a total of 100 and 

511 employee turnovers, representing turnover rate of 25% and 43% respectively. New hire rate is calculated by dividing 

new hires with total employee headcount at year end, whereas turnover rate is calculated by dividing employee departures 

with the average number of employees for the year.  Breakdown of new hires and employee turnovers by gender, age group 

and region in 2020 are provided in Figure 3-1 (b) below.

For 2020 as compared with previous years:

• For distribution business, the hiring and turnover was aligned with respective distribution subsidiaries’ sales revenue and 

business forecasts.

• For factories, the hiring and turnover of production workers was aligned with the industry norms in respective countries, 

labour supply conditions and business forecasts.

The hiring and turnover for both segments in 2020 were also affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  

All our subsidiaries are encouraged to conduct annual employee satisfaction surveys and review the results to identify areas for 

improvement. It was YHI’s initial goal that by 2021 the employee satisfaction survey and review will become a routine annual 

exercise for all subsidiaries. However, due to the pandemic and its uncertainty, the achievement timeline is changed to 2025.   

EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND EDUCATION

To stay competitive, it is important to ensure that our employees are adequately trained and equipped with the knowledge 

and skills required by their roles. Our subsidiaries’ management teams are tasked with identifying employee training needs 

and training schedules in accordance with operational and business development plans. Certain job functions in both the 

distribution and manufacturing businesses also require supervised on-the-job training.

For both the distribution and manufacturing businesses, training topics provided to employees include product and quality 

knowledge, machine operations, relevant ISO standards, workplace health &amp; safety policies, sales and management skills, 

self-development skills, information technology, data analytics, relevant financial reporting standards and tax regulations. 

The trainings are either delivered by in-house personnel or external trainers. In 2020, some of the trainings were conducted 

virtually by the trainers. 

Figure 4-1 shows the average hours of training per employee from 2017 to 2020, including the average hours of training for male 

and female employees in 2020. The average hours of training for each employee category in 2020 are provided in Figure 4-2.

For both distribution subsidiaries and factories, there were no significant changes in the average hours of training per 

employee in 2020 as compared with previous years.    

Using 2018 as the base year, YHI has initially targeted to increase the annual average hours of training for each employee 

by at least 20% by 2021. However, due to the pandemic and its uncertainty, the achievement timeline is changed to 2025.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

We would not be able to fulfil our business obligations to customers without the hard work and dedication of our employees. 

We are conscious of our employees’ wellbeing and strive to ensure their safety at all times. Management teams of respective 

subsidiaries are also required to ensure compliance with relevant local workplace health and safety regulations.

While the specific policies developed by subsidiaries may vary in accordance with local work environment and regulations, 

all such policies entail workplace risks and hazard identification and the formulation of effective measures to minimise them. 

Following the latest reporting requirements under GRI standards on occupational health and safety, we made some changes 

to our reporting of data in this Report.  

There were zero incidents of work-related fatalities between 2017 and 2020 for the five major distribution subsidiaries 

and the three factories. YHI aims to maintain zero work-related fatalities in 2021. There were also zero incidents of high-

consequence work-related injuries in 2020.   

The total number of recordable work-related injuries, injury rate per 200,000 scheduled man-hours and total number of 

man-hours between 2017 and 2020 are provided in Figure 5-1(a). Total number of lost days arising from the work-related 

injury cases and lost day rate per 200,000 man-hours are provided in Figure 5-1(b). 

Figure 5-1(a): Total number of recordable work-related injuries, injury rate per 

200,000 scheduled man-hours and total man-hours from 2017 to 2020 

Figure 5-1(b): Total number of lost days arising from the work-related 

injury cases and lost day rate per 200,000 man-hours

The above data is compiled by respective subsidiaries following relevant local regulatory requirements. For 2020 as compared 

with previous years:

• For the distribution business, the number of recordable injury cases and injury rates were on par with previous years. 

However, some injury cases had resulted in more lost days.    

• For the manufacturing business, there was a decrease in the number of recordable injury cases and lost days. 

Cuts, bruises and fractures are the common types of injuries. Lessons from the work-related accidents are shared across YHI 

to prevent recurrence and we will continuously work towards reducing the occurrence of workplace accidents.

MATERIAL GOVERNANCE TOPICS

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

The operating environment in FY2020 was the most challenging that YHI 

has encountered in recent memory. The COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 

December 2019 and progressively spread to every continent, eventually 

engulfing the whole world and devastating the global economy. Despite 

little prior experience with pandemics, we moved swiftly and decisively 

to implement our business continuity plans to mitigate the impact on our 

businesses. 

We focused on strengthening our resilience in preparation for a drawn-

out crisis. Fortunately, we have a “3R” strategy of reducing stock-holding, 

accounts receivables and operating costs in place. Our efforts to implement 

this strategy over the years have paid off in the form of greater resilience in 

times of challenging business environment and uncertainty. Thanks to the 

decisive pandemic measures implemented, the culture of sacrifice and esprit 

de corps manifested by management and staff working together in unity, 

YHI was able to deliver a positive performance in FY2020. 

The direct economic value generated and distributed by YHI Group as a 

whole in 2020 and by various significant segments is provided in our Annual 

Report 2020. A softcopy of our Annual Report can be found on our website 

on www.yhigroup.com. An extract of YHI Group’s key financial indicators on 

business operations and return to shareholders from 2017 to 2020 from the 

Annual Report 2020 are provided in Figure 6.

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR

We are proud of our progress from our humble beginnings as we have maintained honour and integrity at every step of the 

way. We strongly believe in our corporate values and constantly strive to uphold them in all business decisions and through 

our operations. If we were to violate them, we would risk losing the trust of our stakeholders.

Employees are given Code of Conduct handbooks upon joining. As supply chain is an integral part of YHI’s overall operations, 

YHI also has a Group Management Policy covering ethical conduct in purchasing and procurement. This policy outlines the 

responsibilities of purchasing personnel, including clear and transparent dealings with principals/suppliers, no bribery or 

corruption, and vetting of suppliers to be certain that they are in compliance with governing regulations.

A Group Whistle-Blowing Policy has been put in place and communicated to all employees. The Policy provides employees with 

clearly defined processes and channels through which they can raise their concerns or complaints regarding possible violations 

of the Group’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct or suspected irregularities to the Audit Committee through the internal 

audit function.

There were zero incidents of anti-corruption, anti-competitive behaviour or anti-trust/monopoly practices reported between 

2017 and 2020. YHI aims to maintain zero incidents in 2021.
