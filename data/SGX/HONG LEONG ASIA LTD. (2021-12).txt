Governance

The Board of Directors is entrusted to provide 

transparency and visibility into HLA’s risk management 

practices as well as to ensure the reliability, adequacy 

and effectiveness of internal controls through the 

support and recommendation of the Audit and Risk 

Committee (“ARC”). 

This process starts with the identification, prioritisation 

and management of material ESG issues by the Group’s 

Sustainability Team. The team provides direction to 

each business unit’s Sustainability Working Groups 

and conduct performance progress reviews. The CEO 

oversees the overall effectiveness of this process as part 

of managing the internal control and risk management 

framework of the Group’s businesses and operations. 

The Group’s Sustainability Team provides regular 

progress updates to the ARC and presents annual 

guidance on the strategic direction. The ARC evaluates 

and reviews the reporting process and performance 

annually and ensures that all requirements for 

sustainability compliance are met before reporting to 

the Board.

Materiality Assessment  

HLA conducted its sustainability materiality assessment in 2021 to re-frame the ESG concerns from the respective business key stakeholders. These material issues have been 

updated accordingly.

To understand the sustainability concerns and identify relevant sustainability key topics, we followed the process as shown in Figure 3.

• 

Peer benchmarking, desktop research and collaborative working sessions with the HLA Sustainability  

Team were done to understand the ESG concerns and identify relevant sustainability topics for HLA  

and its businesses

• 

Interviews with senior management and online surveys conducted with employees (364 out of 596 

responses) to obtain feedback on what they see as the most important sustainability issues

• 

The process was repeated with interviews and online surveys for external stakeholders including  

consultants, customers, authorities, suppliers, contractors etc (93 out of 269 responses)

PILLAR 1 

DRIVING INNOVATION FOR  

A LOW CARBON 

&amp; CIRCULAR 

ECONOMY

Cities of the future must transition towards a low 

carbon economy, mitigating and adapting to climate 

change. They must also transition to a more circular 

economy that removes waste and maximises the value 

of limited resources.

We see these changes as opportunities to transform 

the business. We optimise our operations to reduce 

environmental footprint, and use natural resources 

more efficiently by replacing raw materials with more 

sustainable alternatives.

We partner with our customers and other players in the 

value chain to create sustainable and innovative urban 

solutions in the building and transport sectors.

HLA’s highest level of energy consumption is in Tasek 

Corporation’s (Tasek) cement production. Coal is 

currently the main source of fuel used in the kiln for 

clinker production while other key sources of energy 

include diesel and electricity. BMU Singapore’s 

operations also consume electricity and diesel for 

the running of offices, batching plants, silos and the 

transportation of products to customers. 

Across our operations, energy consumption is closely 

monitored and managed by the operations team on a 

daily basis and reported monthly to the Management 

of HLA Group. This data analysis helps to identify 

any anomalies which are then further investigated so 

that remedial actions can be taken. Tasek’s cement 

operations has an online power monitoring system that 

regulates and optimises electricity consumption to 

control the efficiency of major plant equipment during 

the production of clinker. This system was recently 

upgraded and integrated into the plant computerised 

control system. 

We also took migratory steps such as utilising lower-

emission factor alternative fuels (AF) to replace coal, 

and substitute materials like pulverised fly ash (PFA) and 

ground-granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) to reduce 

the carbon intensity of cement production. 

Our diesel engines operations use a considerable 

amount of electricity. To mitigate this, solar panels 

were installed to reduce electricity consumption. Other 

initiatives include voltage control and optimisation 

at the substation via reactive power compensation, 

changing electric heating pipe to heating with heat 

pump, and implementing heat-waste drying technology.

 2021 PERFORMANCE 

HLA’s overall energy consumption (Table 3) declined 

compared to previous years due to national lockdowns 

in Malaysia during the year. 

Diligent monitoring of heat and electricity consumption, 

throughput optimisation and equipment improvements 

also contributed to the decline.

(MT CO2/ Revenue in SGD) from 2016 levels

Report Scope 3 emissions on a comply or

reporting requirements by SGX

2025 TARGETS (HLA GROUP):

CO2 emissions (Table 4) also decreased due to the 

lockdowns. Around 20% is contributed by Scope 2 

emissions which is electricity consumed. The remaining 

80% is contributed mainly by Scope 1 emissions, 

including the combustion of fossil fuels and calcination 

of limestone, which is inherent in any cement production. 

HLA’s CO2 emissions recorded an overall downtrend 

with an 8% reduction in heat consumption and 5% 

increase in alternative fuel (AF) replacement since 2016. 

These achievements are a result of heat consumption 

performance monitoring initiatives and increased 

focus on AF consumption. BMU Singapore’s operations 

doubled its proportion of fly ash content from 15% to 

30% for CEM II type cement, directly reducing clinker to 

cement ratio by a further 15%. 

Meanwhile, Yuchai installed solar panels at factory 

buildings, resulting in 10% of electricity requirements 

being met by solar energy. 

HLA avoided emitting approximately 150,000 tonnes 

of CO2 yearly. This is equivalent to 32,622 passenger 

vehicles driven for one year.

 BUILDING MATERIALS SEGMENT

ALTERNATIVE CEMENT AND 

CONCRETE PRODUCTS 

Portland fly ash cement (PFAC) from our partner, Taiheiyo 

Cement Corporation (TCC) (see case study on pg. 17) and 

GGBS are used to manufacture lower-clinker cement for 

concrete products developed by Island Concrete (ICPL).

These products are certified by Singapore Green 

Building Product (SGBP), an industry certification under 

Building and Construction Authority (BCA) in Singapore.

Likewise, Tasek develops cement products with lower 

clinker content as specified under the Malaysian 

Standards Specification for Cement. The products have 

lower emissions and energy consumption profiles, and 

typically includes substituting clinker with PFA and 

GGBS. Currently, Tasek markets its lower clinker cement 

as a “CEM II” labelled product under the brand names - 

Green “Buaya”, Loceng, and Red “Buaya”.

A LOW CARBON &amp; CIRCULAR ECONOMY



 CASE STUDY  

TASEK INCREASING PRODUCTION OF GREENER BAG CEMENT  

In 2021, Tasek invested RM 4.7 million in a new palletiser to increase the production and offering of lower 

clinker-based cement. With the palletiser, more fly ash, limestone and other materials can be added to increase 

the offering of lower carbon cement products to our customers. This is anticipated to lower the clinker-to-

cement ratio in 2022 and contribute towards the circular economy.

 CASE STUDY  

ICPL’S JOURNEY INTO PFAC CONCRETE PRODUCTS 

PFAC standard certified concrete mix products are now our default proposed concrete mix products for all projects, 

with 70% of ICPL’s monthly average production being PFAC concrete products. This is our goal to produce and supply 

sustainable concrete products for the building and civil construction industry. 







Low-Heat Concrete Pour of Raft Foundation, CPF Tower (2018)



9000m3 3-metre Thick Raft Foundation, CPF Tower (2018)

In 2012, ICPL began developing  

PFAC concrete products by using 30.5% fly 

ash factory blend of PFAC. 

2012

The first key application of 

PFAC for low heat and durability performance 

was in the raft foundation of Singapore 

Cement Manufacturing Co.’s (SCMC) new 

cement silo structure. Performance was 

typical of low-heat Portland GGBS Cement 

(74% GGBS) concrete mix for a raft foundation.

2015

Now, our PFAC standard CEMII/A-V  

concrete products are CT06 certified  

for public and private sector use.  

They are amongst SGBC-certified  

green tick concrete mix products. 

NOW

2014

With promising results, BCA funded 20% of 

our research cost. We began supplying PFAC 

concrete products that conform to CEMII/A-V 

(12% – 15% Fly Ash). Our joint venture (JV) partner 

TCC also achieved its SGLC certified green 

cement status for its fly ash cement product.

Achieved first commercial success with large 

scale application at 79 Robinson Road CPF Tower 

Project by Shimizu Corporation. The project’s 

9000m3 3-metre thick raft foundation was 

casted using our low-heat PFAC Grade C35/34

DUST AND OTHER  

EMISSIONS MANAGEMENT 

Dust is emitted in the processing of raw materials and 

within our cement and ready-mix concrete batching 

plants. BMU’s operations are committed to ensure we 

have effective mitigating measures in place. 

The measures are in compliance with specific 

country requirements to minimise air emission and 

pollution for nearby communities. Our main pollution 

control equipment are bag filters or electrostatic 

precipitators which are installed in our plants and 

covers major equipment, transfer points and silos. 

These are inspected on a periodic basis and preventive 

maintenance is carried out to maintain optimum 

performance of the pollution control equipment. 

For our operations in Singapore, ambient air is 

monitored with regulatory measures to minimise dust 

emissions through zoning and land-use planning.

At Tasek, an online real time continuous emission 

monitoring system (CEMs) is installed and linked to the 

Department of Environment (DOE) in Malaysia. In rare 

occasions of a spike in dust emission due to unexpected 

breakdown or instability of certain plant processes, the 

operations team would take prompt actions to rectify the 

issue and notify the regulators accordingly.

Monitoring of emissions levels by an external third 

party is also carried out on a quarterly basis. A direct 

communication channel is provided for nearby 

communities to enable them to address any relevant 

environmental issue with the plant’s Safety, Health &amp; 

Environment (SHE) Manager for corrective action.

 2021 PERFORMANCE

BMU ensures its processes and maintenance of 

equipment are in good order to control dust emissions 

according to regulatory limits.

At Tasek, dust emission limits were reduced in 2019 

in accordance with the Environmental Quality (Clean 

Air) Regulation 2014 in Malaysia. The first phase of 

upgrading of dust collectors was completed in 2019. 

The second phase of upgrading our electrostatic 

precipitators system for the second kiln started in 

2020. It is expected to be completed in 2022 with the 

assistance of an external vendor. The targeted dust 

emission reduction in this phase will likewise comply 

within the allowable limit of 50mg/Nm3. 

We recorded zero fines from authorities on emissions, 

and zero complaints from communities surrounding our 

Singapore and Malaysia operations in 2021.

PRODUCT QUALITY AND  

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

All our building material operations are certified 

according to ISO 9001 requirements. This includes our 

cement plant and ready-mix sites. The laboratory in 

our cement plant in Malaysia is also certified ISO 17025 

compliant, which sets the main standards for testing 

and calibration. We conduct periodic testing of our raw 

materials, clinker, cement and concrete to ensure the 

quality is maintained throughout the supply chain.

Our cement and concrete products have their 

product certification licenses issued by the respective 

authorities and body – Standard and Industrial Research 

Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM), Construction and Industry 

Development Board (CIDB) for Malaysia, and BCA in 

Singapore. Major suppliers are evaluated at least once a 

year on quality of goods and services provided. Ad-hoc 

visits to our suppliers’ sites form part of the evaluation 

process, especially for new suppliers. 

Our Sales &amp; Marketing teams proactively engage with 

customers to ensure our products and services meet or 

exceed their expectations. These engagements enable 

our Sales &amp; Marketing teams to address issues promptly. 

This requires working closely with the technical and 

quality control teams to conduct site visits and review 

customer feedback to solve issues and align with any 

changing industry requirements and trends. 

Formal surveys are conducted to obtain customer 

feedback for our products and services. They are 

performed monthly, annually, or at the end of each 

project. The customer feedback enables us to gauge 

the level of customer satisfaction and identify areas  

for improvement.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND WASTE 

GYMCL uses the “reduce, reuse and recycle” approach in 

their operations in order to conserve natural resources. 

GYMCL has been using recycled sand rather than 

natural sand in the manufacturing process of engine 

blocks. Production water used for equipment cooling 

requirements are also recycled and used for the cleaning 

of water tanks in sewage treatment stations and ground 

surfaces to reduce overall water consumption. 

For product transportation, GYMCL has replaced 

wooden boxes used for packaging with reusable, lighter 

steel cage frames which reduces waste and emissions. 

GYMCL has recently applied environmentally friendly 

high-heat paint within the plant that is free of benzene, 

toluene, xylene and other heavy metals such as lead, 

mercury, chromium, cadmium. This reduces the volatile 

organic compounds (VOCs) found in traditional high-

heat paint by 80%.

HLA Contribution to Goal:

DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND  

TALENT MANAGEMENT 

We strive to ensure our employees are evaluated 

based on merits, competency and experience within 

the organisation. Training and reskilling of employees 

are our priorities to ensure optimal performance and 

engagement of our staff. For leadership training, we 

identify candidates through performance appraisals 

and succession planning processes. They are mentored 

directly by their supervisors with defined goals and 

career paths. This enables us to build a pool of talent for 

more senior roles in the business. 

Workplace diversity is vital to nurture inclusivity, 

promote innovation and support business sustainability. 

Our Code of Business Conduct (COBC) ensures 

that we create a fair, respectful and equitable work 

environment. The COBC is also shared with every new 

employee that joins the company. During townhall 

sessions and performance appraisals, our leaders and 

employees are encouraged to exchange ideas and 

inspire one another on being better role models. 

Encouraging regular dialogue between employee and 

supervisor also ensures we build healthy relationships 

in the workplace. Employees are free to voice any 

concerns and feedback to the Management, Heads 

of Departments (HODs) and unions. For more serious 



grievances, the Group’s whistleblowing channel offers a 

safe alternative.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT 

HLA’s entrepreneurial spirit is the basis for our core 

value “Create an Impact Beyond our Business”. We are 

committed to the overall well-being of our employees and 

their families and the local communities that we operate in. 

By developing sustainable and innovative programmes, 

we align ourselves more closely with our Sustainability 

Framework and 2025 Vision and promote lasting 

employee engagement, support for communities, and 

build sustainable value for our business.

 CASE STUDY  

“LIVE CONSCIOUSLY WITH HLA” 

CAMPAIGN

An eight-week campaign, “Live Consciously with 

HLA” was launched on 19 September 2021 to drive 

and reinforce sustainable practices 

in the daily lives of our employees. 

The campaign included student 

workshops with Dazhong Primary 

School, a tree-planting initiative, 

virtual talks with tips for a greener 

lifestyle, and competitions such as 

the susGain mobile app challenge 

and a “Do-It-Yourself” (DIY) 

Sustainability Hack competition. 

The feedback received was positive. 

Participants were inspired and were 

made aware of taking responsible 

actions for the greater good. Here is 

what we did. 

susGain Mobile App Challenge and DIY 

Sustainability Hack Competition

We tapped onto susGain, a mobile app start-up that 

drives green action by raising awareness on the 

impact of everyday choices to make more well-

informed decisions. More than 100 participants 

including HLA staff, Dazhong teachers and students 

recorded 465 eco- and 

socially-conscious activities 

on the susGain mobile app.

In Malaysia, our employees 

participated in a DIY 

Sustainability Hack 

competition that puts 

our skills to the test, and 

challenge each other 

on best daily habits and 

practices to bring positive 

change in our lives.





Tree-Planting in Biak Island, Indonesia

Together with non-profit organisation Eden 

Reforestation, we planted 510 mangrove trees in 

Biak Island, Indonesia, to help local villagers earn a 

consistent income while ensuring restoration efforts 

of the community’s mangrove forests and coral reefs.







Figure 1: Around 31% of our staff participated in the tree-planting 

initiative which HLA matched on a company level.

mentoring sessions at Dazhong Primary School. 

This initiative supported Dazhong’s Green Maker’s 

Programme which aims to equip 1,200 students 

with the awareness and skills to become green 

ambassadors of the future.

Among the activities was a partnership with an 

international youth organisation, VIVITA to mentor 

twenty Primary 4 and 5 students in a five-week 

workshop on how to reduce and reuse waste. 

Conducted on Zoom, the students were taught 

techniques to create new products out of recycled 

materials. By the end of the five-week programme, 

each student had developed five prototypes from 

waste products and learnt the value and uses  

of recycling.

ETHICAL CONDUCT AND  

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 

We conduct our business with the highest ethical 

standards and have zero tolerance towards fraud, 

corruption, bribery and money laundering. We expect 

our employees to exhibit high levels of professionalism 

and ethical behaviour in the Group’s day-to-day 

business and operations. This is guided and reiterated 

through our Core Value “Do the Right Thing”,  

HLA Group’s COBC and Anti-Fraud, Anti-Bribery &amp;  

Anti-Corruption (FCB) Policies.

Employees are required to read and declare their 

understanding and compliance of the COBC annually. 

The COBC governs aspects like conflicts of interests, 

compliance with legal and regulatory provisions, 

and ensuring proper internal controls within the 

organisation. Any breaches of COBC may result in 

investigation, disciplinary actions or termination of the 

employee, as guided by the respective country labour 

laws. This is managed and reviewed periodically by our 

HR Department and approved by the CEO. 

Whistleblowing procedures are in place so that 

employees can confidentially raise their concerns for 

matters such as improprieties in financial reporting and 

other malpractices and misconduct. The ARC oversees 

the whistle-bower complaint matters and is supported 

by the Head of Internal Audit. The whistle-blower is 

given appropriate protection against any reprisals if 

disclosures are made in good faith. More information 

about HLA Group’s Whistleblowing Policy can be found 

in the Corporate Governance Report published within 

the Annual Report.

CYBERSECURITY AND  

DATA PROTECTION 

HLA Group is in the process of digitalising our front and 

back-end processes and has set up remote working 

infrastructure for our employees as part of Business 

Continuity Planning (BCP). This transformation has 

invariably placed cybersecurity in the spotlight. 

Cybersecurity measures for Singapore and Malaysia 

operations include the regular roll-out of software 

updates and security patches, mail filters, physical 

restriction to servers and data back-up.  

 

There are also frequent communication with employees 

to improve cyber hygiene and the identification of 

possible cybersecurity events:

• 

Advocate 100% reporting culture on any unknown 

emails, phone calls, or suspicious activities to 

understand the security landscape and detect  

any possible social engineering activities against  

the company,

• 

Build cybersecurity awareness on techniques and 

types of phishing activities. 

Data of employees and customers requires protection 

under the Personal Data Protection and Commission 

Act. HLA is committed to preventing unauthorised 

access and disclosure to avoid data breaches that 

results in significant harm or impact to our employees 

or customers. Policies and statements on our personal 

data policy can be found at: 

•

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

At BMU Singapore, suppliers are evaluated yearly on 

quality, price, delivery and general service and support. 

Each criterion is given a weightage and scored from A to 

D, which translates to Outstanding, Good, Average, or 

Re-Qualification. 

This practice establishes the pre-qualification process 

for significant tenders particularly in the selection 

criteria including local regulations compliance and 

certified quality management systems. 

Ad-hoc visits to our suppliers’ sites are also part of the 

evaluation, especially for new suppliers. For those who 

do not meet the benchmark, warnings are issued and 

counselling provided. Those with serious lapses are 

immediately terminated.

Similarly, Tasek conducts supplier evaluation annually 

that includes contractors and transporters. The criterion 

covers quality, delivery, competency, housekeeping and 

HSE compliance, and suppliers are graded from A to D. 

Those graded D are removed from the approved 

supplier list. Anyone in non-compliance will have two 

points deducted for every NCR and penalty collected 

during the annual evaluation.

 2021 PERFORMANCE

BMU Singapore achieved the following ratings in their supplier evaluations over the last three years:

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH,  

SAFETY AND WELFARE 

Health and safety is a strategic priority in our business. 

A dedicated SHE Department ensures compliance 

within local rules and regulations, identification of 

health and safety hazards and the corresponding 

risk mitigating actions, conducting regular on-site 

inspections, as well as organising and conducting 

health and safety trainings for employees and 

contractors. 

New employees, contractors and visitors are given basic 

safety trainings as part of the induction programme. 

Refresher courses are conducted periodically for 

technical, engineering and operations personnel. 

Operational areas have been zoned with safety signages 

and appropriate personal protective equipment (“PPE”) 

are provided to our employees.

Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control 

(HIRAC) is conducted for all the operational activities to 

minimise or eliminate unacceptable high-risk activities. 

The SHE department carries out various programmes 

with operations personnel that includes inspections, 

audits, investigations of incidents, review of safety 

procedures and practices, yearly emergency drill, safety 

trainings, toolbox talk and dialogue with contractors 

and transporters.

Pre-employment health screening and annual 

occupational health surveys are also conducted for 

those in high-risk operational positions. 

Employees who violated health and safety measures 

are first given counselling, warnings and followed by 

disciplinary actions while contractors have a penalty 

system in place whereby repeat offenders will not be 

allowed to enter our sites. 

 2021 PERFORMANCE

All our manufacturing sites have a safety management 

system in place. In Singapore, our precast and ready-

mix concrete segments are certified BizSAFE STAR and 

BizSAFE Level 4 respectively, while operations in Malaysia 

are certified according to ISO 45001 requirements.

The number of incidents reported in Table 26 below 

refers to incidents that have happened within BMU. 

There were zero fatalities across our sites in 2021.

 CASE STUDY  

COVID 19 SAFETY MANAGEMENT

In April 2020, Singapore declared a national 

lockdown due to COVID-19. This resulted in BMU 

Singapore’s business functions scaling down and 

operational activities put on hold. 

When the Government announced the gradual 

resumption of our industry with strict criteria 

imposed, the teams from Health &amp; Safety (H&amp;S) and 

Operations had to manage a total of seven concrete 

batching plants to provide a safe workplace and 

accommodation for our workers.

As our batching plants have limited manpower 

resources, plant managers, supervisors and 

technicians doubled up as Safe Management 

Officers (SMOs) and Safe Distancing Officers (SDOs) 

on top of their demanding site works. BCA Officers 

were conducting frequent inspections to ensure that 

we were in compliance with 

the stringent criteria.

In August and September 

2021, Antigen Rapid Test (ART) 

and recording of employees’ 

vaccination status were 

made mandatory. Each plant 

appointed an ART Supervisor 

to oversee the implementation 

of procedures and processes. 

BMU Singapore was able 

to monitor, implement and 

run the Rostered Routine 

Testing (RRT) and ART regime 

successfully by collaborating 

with Human Resource, 

Purchasing, IT, Operations and 

H&amp;S departments.

CYBERSECURITY AND  

DATA PROTECTION  

CYI formulated a series of policies that include 

"Information Security Risk Management Policy" and 

“Cybersecurity Management Policy” which standardised 

the approach and management of information in 

the company. The policies are aligned with national 

regulations in China governing cybersecurity, data 

security and personal information protection. 

 2021 PERFORMANCE

GYMCL recorded zero incidents of cybersecurity 

breaches, network and data breaches related to 

customer data in 2021.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

Suppliers are required to pass ISO 9001 certification, 

or obtain IATF 16949 and Occupational Health and 

Safety Certifications. This check is conducted by the 

Purchasing Department in accordance with the “Parts 

Suppliers Assessment Procedure”.

Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, CYI is in 

compliance with the Conflict Minerals Regulation. CYI’s 

policy requires suppliers to obtain certifications that 

reflect their disuse of conflict materials in smelters and 

refiners, or disclose sources of the minerals used. 

Diligence on suppliers is conducted according to 

the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and 

Development (“OECD”) for Responsible Supply Chains 

of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas 

(“OECD Guidance”).

 2021 PERFORMANCE

After an evaluation, all 208 of GYMCL suppliers passed 

the ISO9001 or IATF 16949 quality system certification. 

All suppliers obtained the occupational health and 

safety certification.

The 2021 supplier assessment will only be completed at 

the end of H1 2022 and will be reported in our SR 2022. 

With regards to compliance with the Conflicts Mineral Regulation, CYI conducted a Reasonable Country of Origin 

Inquiry (RCOI) of its suppliers in 2020 using Version 6.01 of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition and the 

Global e-Sustainability Initiative Conflict Mineral Reporting Template (“CMRT”). The purpose is to determine whether 

any of the 3TGs (Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten and Gold) supplied for use in the manufacture of engines in FY 2020 are 

from recycled or scrap sources originated in the Covered Countries.

The RCOI requested these suppliers to obtain information through their supply chain regarding the country of origin 

of 3TGs and the smelters and refiners used in the supply of materials to CYI. In order to make this inquiry as complete 

as possible, these suppliers were requested to send the same CMRT to their suppliers (direct and indirect) for data 

collection. CYI sent the CMRT to a total of 225 suppliers and all responses to the RCOI using the CMRT were received 

as of March 31, 2021. 217 suppliers confirmed that the products they supplied to us in FY 2020 were DRC Conflict-

Free. The RCOI for financial year 2021 is currently in progress and will be reported in our SR 2022.
