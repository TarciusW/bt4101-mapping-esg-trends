We are pleased to present Sabana Shari’ah Compliant Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust’s (“Sabana REIT”) second 

sustainability report.

We have observed an increased emphasis on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters in the real estate sector 

and the investor community in Singapore. More and more financial institutions and real estate companies are looking 

into leveraging sustainable finance mechanisms, such as green bonds and green loans, to fund initiatives that will create 

positive environmental and social impacts. 

As a Shari’ah compliant REIT, we incorporate considerations for ethics and social responsibility in our business and 

investment decisions. This serves as a solid foundation for us to further advance our sustainability journey, including to start 

considering the sustainability attributes of potential assets we look at, as well as to continue to enhance our portfolio’s own 

ESG performance. 

In FY 2018, we have embarked on initiatives that will strengthen the management and governance of our ESG risks 

and opportunities in the long run. We have solidified the operations of the Sustainability Working Committee (“SWC”), 

comprising Sabana REIT Manager’s management team and key representatives from different business units. We have 

solicited our tenants’ feedback on ESG matters for the first time via a survey. We have also established a Safety Committee 

to oversee safety issues across our properties.

We have oversight of the Manager’s ESG strategies and policies. We continue to be supported by the SWC in integrating 

ESG considerations into our strategy formulation. The SWC also supports us in overseeing the management, implementation 

and reporting of these ESG strategies and policies as well as our material ESG topics. 

We have reviewed the process by which Sabana REIT’s material ESG topics were determined. We agree that the ESG topics 

determined and presented in this report are an adequate representation of the ESG topics material to Sabana REIT.

We look forward to continue sharing our progress along our sustainability journey with you.

SHARI’AH COMPLIANCE

Shari’ah compliance means adherence to Shari’ah investment principles and procedures, which are consistent with the 

tenets of Islamic law. Following Shari’ah’s objective to achieve justice and benefit for humanity, the Shari’ah investment 

principles and procedures place due consideration upon ethics and social responsibility.

 

As a Shari’ah compliant REIT, Sabana REIT is required to ensure that its financing, investment and deposit facilities, insurance 

coverage and risk management solutions are Shari’ah compliant, where commercially viable. Sabana REIT also needs to 

ensure that its total rental income from tenants engaging in non-permissible activities1 under the Shari’ah Guidelines does 

not exceed 5.0% per annum of the gross revenue of Sabana REIT’s portfolio of properties. As part of the due cleansing 

procedure, donation of non-compliant income, after deducting the relevant changes, are made to charitable causes 

(without tax benefits) on a quarterly basis, if any. In FY 2018, the amount donated from non-compliant income is less than 

0.1% of Sabana REIT’s total gross revenue. However for FY 2018, there was no donation in 2Q 2018.

To ensure Sabana REIT’s Shari’ah compliance, the Manager has appointed an external Shari’ah Adviser to advise on Shari’ah-

related matters, including recommending suitable candidates to serve as members of the external Independent Shari’ah 

Committee (“ISC”). Sabana REIT’s ISC comprises of three eminent scholars and experts. The ISC’s objective is to draw up the 

Shari’ah Guidelines for Sabana REIT, assess and ensure Sabana REIT’s continued Shari’ah compliance, and issue the Shari’ah 

certification upon completion of the annual audit.

Sabana REIT has successfully renewed its annual Shari’ah certificate, which is valid until 31 December 2019.

1 

Non-Shari’ah compliant activities include conventional financial and insurance services, gaming, non-halal food production, tobacco-related products, non-

permitted entertainment activities and stock-broking in non-compliant securities.

SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

As a Shari’ah compliant REIT, our approach to sustainability is built upon our considerations for ethics and social responsibility 

in our investment and business decisions, as well as our commitment to our key stakeholders. Through solid governance 

and sound management of material ESG topics, we aim to create sustainable value for our stakeholders and leave a positive 

impact in the environment and communities that we operate in.   

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE 

Our Board determines the direction of Sabana REIT’s sustainability agenda and oversees the management of our 

sustainability performance. The Board has appointed the SWC to support its efforts to govern sustainability-related matters 

at Sabana REIT. 

The SWC, led by the Manager’s Chief Executive Officer, is comprised of the Chief Operating Officer and key representatives 

from Asset Management, Property Management, Compliance, Human Resources and Investor Relations. The SWC is 

responsible for implementing Sabana REIT’s sustainability agenda, including identifying the material ESG factors, developing 

corresponding action plans, monitoring and reporting Sabana REIT’s ESG performance and setting ESG targets. The SWC 

reports Sabana REIT’s sustainability progress to the Board regularly.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

In line with the GRI Standards Reporting Principles and AA1000 Accountability Principles, we conducted a formal materiality 

assessment in 2016 to determine ESG topics that are material to our business and stakeholders. We adopted a four-step 

approach, which involves identification, prioritisation, validation, and review. 

In 2018, we conducted a materiality review with the guidance of an independent sustainability consultant to reassess the 

relevance of our material ESG topics. The SWC engaged with and collected feedback from both internal and external key 

stakeholders, and find that the 10 material ESG topics previously identified remain pertinent to our business operations and 

stakeholders’ interests. The 10 material ESG topics are reviewed and approved by the Board. We will continue to review 

and evaluate our material ESG topics annually going forward.  





Identification

We identified a list of potential 

ESG topics that may be material to 

our business and stakeholders by 

surveying our peers, key industry and 

sustainability trends, and ESG topics 

identified by sustainability reporting 

frameworks.





Validation

The Board reviewed and approved the 

list of material ESG topics.





Review

The SWC reassessed the material ESG 

topics’ relevance by reviewing current 

industry and sustainability trends, 

and collecting external stakeholders’ 

feedback through tenant ESG survey.





Prioritisation

The SWC prioritised the ESG topics 

according to their importance 

to Sabana REIT’s business and 

stakeholders.

Material ESG Topics 

Upon identifying our material ESG topics, the next step would be to manage them. To define our management approach 

towards the 10 material ESG topics identified, we first consider why each ESG topic is material to Sabana REIT and our 

stakeholders. We then identify the boundaries of the material ESG topics along our value chain, which is comprised of 

tenants, vendors and contractors, down to the local communities we operate in. We consider specifically where the impacts 

for a material ESG topic occur in our value chain, and our involvement with these impacts. These considerations will enable 

us to develop and enhance our management approach for the material ESG topics progressively. 

The table below describes the materiality of each material ESG topic, where significant impacts for each material ESG topic 

occur, and how we have caused or contributed to the impacts through our business relationships.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 

We view compliance with all applicable laws and regulations as essential to our business operations. Sabana REIT does 

not tolerate any wilful breaches of applicable regulatory laws and regulations. We comply with laws and regulations issued 

by SGX, Monetary Authority of Singapore and Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore as well as regulations, accounting 

standards, guidelines and directives affecting REITs in Singapore, as well as all regulations governing REIT Managers in 

Singapore.

In furtherance of the above, we have established internal policies and processes to minimise regulatory and compliance 

risk. Our enterprise-wide risk management framework defines how risks, including regulatory and compliance risk, should 

be monitored, managed, mitigated or eliminated. Additionally, all employees are required to strictly adhere to policies 

outlined in the Employee Handbook.

Moreover, we conduct regular screening and review of relevant laws and regulations to ensure we stay abreast of regulatory 

changes and developments. We also periodically review our internal policies and standard operating procedures to ensure 

they are up to date and comply with the latest laws and regulations. 

In addition to these legal frameworks, Sabana REIT is managed in accordance with Shari’ah investment principles and 

procedures. In the event of Shari’ah principles conflicting with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to Sabana REIT, 

such laws, rules and regulations prevail.

In FY 2018, there were no non-compliant incidents with relevant laws and regulations that resulted in significant fines or 

legal actions.

Our employees and tenants are cornerstones to our success. We are committed to providing a conducive workplace that 

nurture our people and prioritise the health and safety of both our people and tenants.  

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES &amp; TALENT RETENTION

Our employees are our greatest assets. We understand the need to attract, cultivate and retain talents with the right skill 

pool and experiences for us to deliver value to our stakeholders. To do so, we ensure that we empower our employees and 

treat them with respect and fairness. 

Diversity and Equal Opportunity

The Manager does not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices against race, religion, gender, nationality, 

age or the differently-abled. All decisions related to recruitment and career progression are based on merits, experiences, 

abilities and professional qualifications. 

The Manager’s Human Resources (“HR”) department has established various HR policies to ensure fair employment 

practices are upheld in all aspects of HR-related matters and that our workforce is managed effectively and fairly. 

• Recruitment Policy

• Employee Records Policy

• Salary Policy and Performance Review Policy

• Payroll Policy

• Training and Development Policy

• Cessation of Employment Policy

• Policy on Employee Insurance and Workmen Compensation 

• Employee Referral Scheme

• Employee Handbook

Employees with concerns about workplace discrimination are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their 

supervisors or utilise the whistle-blowing channel. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without the fear of 

reprisal. Engaging in any discriminatory behaviour is subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.

In FY 2018, there were zero validated cases of discrimination.

Training and Development

The Manager is committed to support our employees to pursue continuous education and job-specific trainings, including 

applications for membership in Professional Bodies and participation in conferences and seminars. We provide educational 

assistance with formal qualifications and professional development through short courses. Our training budget is allocated 

to allow each employee to take up to 5 days of study leave and up to 3 days of examination leave per calendar year. We 

also discuss and understand our employee’s training and development needs during their annual performance appraisal, 

which contribute to our annual training budget review process. 

In FY 2018, each employee benefitted from an average of 6.68 hours of training, with a breakdown of 6.22 hours and 7.31 

hours for our male and female employees, respectively. Training courses attended by our employees in 2018 include REIT 

management, risk management, water management and lease management. While our senior management and female 

employees completed more trainings in 2018 compared to 2017, our executives and male employees attended lesser 

trainings in 2018 compared to 2017.

Employee Engagement

We proactively engage our employees to understand their needs and expectations, as well as to monitor their level of 

satisfaction. Our annual performance reviews and planning sessions are designed for supervisors and employees to review 

their current job tasks, set goals, encourage exchange of ideas, recognise contributions and develop positive, purposeful 

approaches to achieving work-related goals. In 2018, excluding those under probation, 100% of our employees completed 

their annual performance review. 

Additionally, we hold various festive celebrations, informal staff gatherings, team-building events and monthly sports events 

to encourage further engagement between employees and foster team bonding. These events provide direct informal 

communication channels for us to receive and respond to feedback from our employees.

As an acknowledgment of our employees’ service and dedication to the organisation, we also provide tokens of appreciation 

to our employees on the occasion of birthday, marriage, five year service, maternity or paternity leave, as well as upon 

hospitalisation or compassionate leave.

Talent Retention

We recognise that welfare and career development contribute significantly to workplace satisfaction. We therefore regularly 

monitor our hiring and employee rate as one of the measures to assess our effectiveness in retaining talents. There is no 

change in the total number of employees between FY 2017 and FY 2018; 12 new employees were recruited while 12 

employees left during FY 2018, translating to a hiring rate and turnover rate of 31.58%.

TENANT SATISFACTION

As tenant satisfaction translates into our success as a REIT, we aim to provide the highest level of service to our tenants and 

achieve a high overall tenants’ satisfaction. We engage our tenants through regular communication, prompt responses to 

tenants’ feedback, monthly site visits, annual tenant satisfaction surveys, progressive upgrading of facilities, and AEIs. 

In FY 2018, we updated our tenant satisfaction survey to better capture our tenants’ feedback. The tenant satisfaction 

survey enquires our tenants’ satisfaction with regards to three main aspects, namely finance, building management and 

maintenance, and leasing and marketing services. We also salute tenants’ suggestions for improvement.

HEALTH &amp; SAFETY

We are committed to safeguarding health and safety across our properties. We strive to maintain and provide a safe working 

environment for our employees, vendors and contractors, tenants and guests. 

To better manage and address health and safety issues across our properties, a Safety Committee was formed by the 

Property Manager in April 2018. The Safety Committee meets quarterly to discuss any safety concerns and findings from 

safety audits, as well as on ad-hoc basis if needs arise. The Safety Committee also conducts regular safety inspections at our 

properties to identify any health and safety issues that need to be addressed. 

In addition to our quarterly Safety Committee meetings, we also conduct monthly safety meetings at the Manager’s office 

to share findings from our monthly safety inspections conducted at our properties, including potential safety hazards 

and health risks identified and potential preventive measures to implement. To ensure that our site teams, composed of 

technicians, security guard and cleaners, are attentive to potential occupational health and safety issues they may face, the 

Property Manager conducts toolbox meetings to help raise awareness on site. 

Finally, we conduct regular safety drills, such as the annual fire drills, to ensure the safety equipment at our properties are 

well-maintained. 

Employees

We hold safety briefings for all new on-boarding staff to help them understand how they could help maintain workplace 

health and safety for all. We also provide various health and safety related benefits, and implement employee wellness 

initiatives to help ensure the well-being of our employees.

• Personal accident, hospitalisation and surgical group term life insurance plans

•  Workmen’s injury compensation insurance policy

•  Travel insurance plans for business travel

•  Annual health screenings

•  16 weeks of paid maternity leave for female employees who completed three calendar months of service 

•  Monthly salad lunch

•  Team-building events and monthly sports events

We are pleased to report that there were zero workplace fatalities, reported workplace injuries, lost days, and occupational 

disease incidents in FY 2018. Therefore, our accident frequency rate1, accident severity rate2 and occupational disease 

incidence rate3 were 0% for FY 2018.

In terms of absenteeism4, our employees recorded an overall absentee rate5 of 2.80% in FY 2018, a slight decrease 

from 3.22% in FY 2017. For our female employees, we have observed an increase in absentee rate due to an increase in 

hospitalisation leave that is not work-related.

Accident frequency rate = total number of workplace injuries reported / total number of man-hours worked x 1,000,000.

2 

Accident Severity Rate = total number of man days lost to workplace injuries / total number of man hours worked x 1,000,000.

3 

Occupational disease incidence rate = total number of occupational disease incidents / total number of employees.

Absenteeism refers to workers being absent from work because of incapacity of any kind, not just as the result of work-related injury or disease, excludes permitted 

leave absences such as holidays, study, maternity or paternity leave, and compassionate leave.

5 

Absentee rate = total number of absentee days / total days scheduled to be worked by all employees. The total days scheduled to be worked by all employees is 

computed as follows: 5 days x 52 weeks x total number of employees as at 31 December 2018.

Tenants

While we work to maintain the safety features of our properties, we expect our tenants to also comply with relevant health 

and safety laws and regulations in their operations. We have therefore included clauses on compliance with health and 

safety laws and regulations in our tenancy agreements. 

Furthermore, to monitor construction activities that may potentially cause health and safety issues, all tenants need to apply 

for a Permit-to-Work (“PTW”) before carrying out any fit-out at the properties.

Vendors and Contractors

We strive to work with vendors and contractors that value health and safety. Before we engage a new vendor or contractor 

to work with us, we require our vendors and contractors to complete an on-boarding risk assessment, and submit the 

results to us to ensure that they have proper health and safety processes in place. 

Before the commencement of projects at our properties, all contractors are required to apply for a PTW which includes a 

risk assessment of their respective work scope, schedule of work and other relevant documents.

In FY 2018, there were no incidents of non-compliance concerning health and safety impacts arising from the use of our buildings.

In line with Singapore’s commitment 

to reduce its GHG emissions under the 

Paris Agreement, we have embarked 

on a journey to make our portfolio 

carbon-efficient 

to 

contribute 

to 

Singapore’s transition to a low-carbon 

economy.

We continued our efforts in installing 

energy-efficient 

lighting 

in 

our 

buildings in FY 2018. As a result, we 

recorded an improvement in our 

energy efficiency. Our total energy 

consumption and energy intensity 

have reduced by 4.18% and 5.01%, 

respectively, in FY 2018 from FY 2017 

levels. 

 

Going forward, we will continue to 

explore other energy-saving initiatives 

that we could implement at our 

properties.

WATER MANAGEMENT (USE AND REDUCTION)

While we have little control over the day-to-day behaviours of our tenants, we are mindful of the support we could offer 

to our tenants as landlords. We monitor water consumption at our properties on a monthly basis in order to identify and 

discuss abnormal spikes in water consumption with our tenants early on.    

We have also embarked on water efficiency initiatives in efforts to provide water-efficient properties to our tenants. Two 

of our buildings at 151 Lorong Chuan and 508 Chai Chee Lane are implementing Water Efficiency Management Plans as 

stipulated by the Public Utilities Board (“PUB”). We have reduced our total water consumption and water intensity by 18% 

and 19%, respectively, in FY 2018 compared to FY 2017 levels. We aim to continue to raise awareness among tenants and 

our employees, as well as to enhance the water efficiency of our properties.

We believe in being a responsible corporate citizen and building a lasting relationship with our communities is critical to 

the long-term viability of our business.

COMMUNITY IMPACT

Since its inception, Sabana REIT is driven by the Shari’ah’s goal of benefiting humanity and has been committed to 

contributing to communities we operate in. 

In compliance with Shari’ah investment principles, interest received from our properties’ rental charges has to be cleansed 

by donating the interest incurred quarterly to charitable organisations, known as the Ta’widh donation. We are therefore 

continually surveying CSR initiatives that we could partake in. We hope to support different beneficiaries each time we 

make a donation. 

To select a charitable organisation to donate to, we walk through an internal screening process to obtain approval for 

making a donation. 

1 

SKML originally provides social and financial assistance to the local Indian Muslim community but has now widened its outreach, working with national organisations 

such as Sinda, Yayasan Mendaki, MUIS, Jamiyah Singapore, and PA’s Narpani Pearavai, to help all Singaporeans.

2 

TEF provides financial assistance to persons with disabilities and supports efforts that enhance education and employment prospects of persons with disabilities.

3 

NYAAC is one of the premier youth development programmes in Singapore that strive to equip youths with personal qualities and skills to make a difference to 

themselves, their communities and their world.

During FY 2018, Sabana REIT has contributed S$48,236 from its non-Shari’ah income to several charitable organisations, 

namely Singapore Kadayanallur Muslim League (“SKML”)1, SG Enable – TODAY Enabled Fund (“TEF”)2 and National Youth 

Achievement Award Council (“NYAAC”)3. 

The Manager also collaborated with Singapore Management University’s (“SMU”) Rotaract Club as their main sponsor 

for the Club’s “Rotaract Camp 2018”. SMU Rotaract Club is a youth development club that places emphasis on service, 

outreach and fellowship. Chartered in 2001, SMU Rotaract comprises students keen to make a difference in the community, 

and to cultivate better relations with fellow schoolmates, Rotaractors and Rotarians. On 25 and 26 August 2018, senior 

management of Sabana REIT participated in activities organised during SMU’s Rotaract Camp 2018. The activities carried 

out were: (1) kite-building and kite-flying with children with special needs and underprivileged children; and (2) house 

painting and flat cleaning for underprivileged elderly communities to improve their living environments.
