Board Statement 

The latest media productions and new technologies bring audiences a new level of immersive 

experiences and entertainment. Likewise, it also showcases the limitless possibilities of what a 

sustainable future could be for future generations, it is our responsibility to contribute and work towards 

making this future a reality. 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Vividthree continue our commitment to sustainable growth, 

minimising our environmental footprint, and supporting others to advocate towards conservancy for the 

creation of a greener future on behalf of the younger generations who would inherit the world we live in. 

We continue to stay true to our vision in creating Next-generation experiences and entertainment for 

our audiences through reality-transforming content with the use of visual effects, design motion graphics 

and immersive media. As part of achieving the sustainability portion of this vision, we incorporate 

sustainability goals surrounding ESG factors as part of our strategic direction. 

FY2021 brought about both unique challenges and opportunities for the Group. COVID-19 and their 

associated lockdowns abroad and locally (Circuit Breaker) disrupted conventions and in-person events 

that were part of our Bread-and-Butter. To adjust, we arduously expanded our search for new 

opportunities through collaborations, initiatives, and branching out into new sectors. Some of our 

initiatives include Go-Karting events hosted by our subsidiary, V&amp;N Entertainment Pte Ltd and our 

partner Quebec Leisure International Pte Ltd  in November to December 2020, and new animation 

content projects with Mirage Works based in Malaysia. 

These collaborations not only increase the number of revenue streams for the Group by expanding our 

access to resources for growth, it also provides opportunities to increase our outreach and extend our 

audience. We were proud to have also been featured by IT.COM.SG as a Top 11 Animation Company 

1in Singapore. 

While we pursue our collaborations and projects, we continue to cautiously navigate through the on-

going COVID-19 pandemic. We manage our shareholders’ expectations on the impact of the pandemic 

through twice-yearly financial reporting and announcements of any material changes to business 

operations through the Group’s SGX announcements. For our valued employees, we continue to follow 

precautions recommended by the government such as adequate social distancing, requiring staff to 

work from home whenever possible, encouraging staff to get vaccinated, the enforcement of a mask 

mandate and safe-entry check in when at the office. 

Amidst the evolving pandemic, we remain committed in doing what is best for our stakeholders. This 

ranges from expanding revenue streams for shareholders, providing unique immersive experiences in 

virtual reality for our audiences, to providing safe and conducive work environments for employees.  

We look forward to sharing our achievements with you as we evolve in our journey in sustainable growth 

during these unpredictable times.

About Vividthree Holdings Ltd.  

 

Vividthree’s beginnings started in 2006 as a humble digital media company with six employees, with 

the goal of producing engaging digital content for a global audience.  

Headquartered in Singapore, Vividthree grew exponentially in the last 15 years into a SGX-ST listed 

company with regional networks abroad in Malaysia and China. Our business model includes digital 

content production and Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (“MICE”) experiences. 

Vividthree’s revolution in the digital space has fuelled the Group’s growth from a company with 6 

employees to 48 employees in FY2021 including digital specialists in cutting age virtual reality (“VR”), 

augmented reality (“AR”), and digital media technologies. 

Our products are mainly entertainment orientated, leveraging on cutting age technology and intense 

storytelling to provide immersive quality content to a global audience. Our strategy team also 

consistently seeks new synergetic collaborations with other organisations to further our reach and 

capabilities.

Vividthree Values and Principles 

Our mission is to leverage technology and our teams’ creative inputs to create the next generation of 

entertainment to entice and excite our targeted audiences. We incorporate creativity into all aspects of 

our business, from our storyboard development, filming, Computer Generated Imagery (“CGI”), visual 

effects, and virtual and augmented reality technology. 

Our vision is to become Asia's best immersive digital content producer, creating immersive and 

interactive experiences for consumers. As we continue developing our intellectual property assets and 

talent staff, we are also on the lookout for more collaborative opportunities to maximise our local and 

international reach. This is also aligned with the interest of major stakeholders, as our audience gain 

better content, employees gain a more diverse skill-set, and our business partners and shareholders 

gain more profit.  

Our principle to continue being an ethical and sustainable business remains steadfast.  We at Vividthree 

strive to continue our production of superior content, providing both online and offline experiences 

during and after the pandemic without sacrificing quality or safety of all stakeholders. Not only do we 

adhere to sustainable business practices, we are in regular communication with other stakeholders 

such as business partners that we collaborate with to ensure that they too adhere to our requirements 

regarding our projects and business conduct standards.  

Connecting with Local Talents 

Our management believes that developing local talents from the countries we operate in are vital for 

the continued success and growth of the local film industry. Vividthree supports local youths who are 

interested in entering post-production work through various initiatives and sharing sessions. When 

possible, we host sharing sessions online to provide them valuable insights, first-hand knowledge, and 

glimpses into the inner workings of the industry in hopes of inspiring youths to enter the industry after 

they complete their formal education.

Governance and Sustainability Approach 

Sustainability Governance Structure 

The Board of Directors renews our commitment to strengthening and expanding our efforts towards a 

sustainable future. The Board maintains broad oversight over the Group’s ESG activities, targets, and 

performances, including setting the tone from the top and the direction of sustainable development for 

the business units’ management to implement. This includes reviewing objectives set by business units, 

the strategies in-place to meet these objectives, and the progress made in the previous year towards 

these objectives. 

The Board is further supported by Board committees compromising of the Audit Committee, Nominating 

Committee, and Remuneration Committee. Together, they can more effectively deal with complex or 

specialised issues and make recommendations for action to the full board, which retains collective 

responsibility for decision making. 

Business Units are responsible for the review of and setting of initiatives building on the efforts in 

sustainability and progress made by the Group in the previous year. Business Units’ management 

tracks ESG factors highlighted in the Sustainability Report to ensure that the objectives are in line with 

the commitments to sustainable development before reporting directly to the Board. 

 

 

The Board 

is collectively 

resposible for the 

macro success of the 

Group's ESG 

initiatives.

Board Committees 

operate within their defined 

terms of reference to delegate 

the Board's sustainability 

initiatives and ensure good 

corporate governance within 

the Group

Business Units 

implement and 

monitor the 

initatives, ensuring 

consistant approach 

and reporting of 

performance to the 

Board.

Stakeholder Engagement 

Our Stakeholders are fundamental to our continued success and growth. At Vividthree, we understand 

the importance of continuously developing our relationship with our stakeholders. We undertake this 

through a multi-pronged approach. First, identifying our key stakeholder groups based on those affected 

by, have influence over, and or interest with the success of the Company. Next, we use multiple forms 

of engagement to connect with the stakeholders for better understanding of their interests and concerns, 

and to demonstrate efforts taken to address them. 

Stakeholder concerns received via these and other channels are taken very seriously. All feedback, 

queries or comments are individually looked at and we take every opportunity to use these to improve 

our current service offerings.  

The table below outlines our approach on stakeholders’ engagement with the six key stakeholder

Materiality Assessment 

Our sustainability approach for FY2021 is crafted around the feedback received from stakeholders. 

Management then assesses factors which have a significant impact on the economy, environment and 

society. Material factors identified by Vividthree are based on the GRI framework and their position in 

the chart below is based on the degree of significance on our stakeholders.  

After evaluating the insightful feedback from our stakeholders, we summarised their main concerns into 

six factors which should be prioritised by the Group. These topics and their corresponding policy, 

performance, obligations and targets continue to be reviewed periodically.  

 

The following material topics are reviewed on an annual basis, with the consideration of changing 

economic conditions and business objectives, in addition to feedback and concerns  from stakeholders. 

The material topics selected for FY2021 are as follows: 

1. 

Economic Performance – Monetary value generated by the Group’s activities during the 

financial year 2021. 

 

2. 

Energy Management – Our management and optimisation of electrical consumption for our 

business operation. 

 

3. 

Employment – Valuing employees through fair employment practices to attract, retain and 

develop top level talents for all our business segments. 

 

4. 

Corporate Governance - Our policies and practices in place to uphold real and perceived good 

corporate governance, including conflict of interest and whistle-blowing policies in the Group.   

 

5. 

Compliance – Our compliance to relevant and key laws and regulations including government 

COVID-19 regulations in locales we operate in. 

 

6. 

Intellectual Property Rights Protection – Measure in place to manage the Group’s 

intellectual property.

Economic Performance 

 

 

 

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, both locally and abroad including Singapore’s 

“Circuit Breaker” in response to slow the spread of the virus, had a profoundly negative impact on our 

business. Major consequences included the suspension of MICE events and content production due to 

social distancing requirements and closure of international borders. This caused a large fall in in 

revenue and profits for the Group in FY2021. Fortunately, the Singapore Government provided a large 

variety of financial support packages for businesses to dampen the economic impact of the pandemic. 

In FY2021, the Group received approximately $848,000 in government grants, amounting to over 14 

times more than the amount received in FY2020. These grants included the Jobs Support Scheme 

(“JSS”), SkillsConnect Absentee Payroll Funding, Jobs Growth Incentive (“JGI”), Productivity Solution 

Grant (“PSG”) for Intelli-Temperature Attendance System, and Traineeship Grant. In addition, under 

the Enterprise Financing Scheme, the Group obtained a $5 million bridging loan. 

With the rapid pace of vaccination locally and abroad, the Group is optimistic about emerging post-

pandemic with strong financial fundamentals that would assure our investors. The Group’s strategy is 

to continue our investments in emerging IPs and technologies to remain competitive in the digital sphere. 

We also continued growing our collaboration with business partners during the pandemic, expand our 

reputation and market capitalisation – with hopes that this can continue post-pandemic. Some of our 

recent partnerships include Quebec Leisure International Pte Ltd to host a Go-Karting event and jointly 

develop, curate, bid for and produce thematic experiential content and Mirage Works to co-produce two 

animation content projects.

The Group’s two (2) primary revenue streams, Post-production and Content production, saw a large 

decline in revenue, totalling S$4.11 million or 67%, primarily due to this COVID-19 pandemic and its 

associated adverse impacts of lockdowns locally and abroad. 

Post-production

 

Between FY2020 and FY2021, revenue decreased by S$1.53 million or 43.6%. The root cause was 

Singapore’s circuit breaker and other control measures implemented in the countries which the Group 

operates in such as Malaysia and China, which led to the disruption of the Group’s business operations 

continually. 

Content production

 

Content production saw record-low revenues in FY2021 of a miniscule S$41,640. In FY2021, the 

continuation of travel restrictions and social distancing measures across the countries the Group 

operates in have resulted in a number of MICE and tour show projects to be postponed and several 

customers have been taking ‘wait-and-see’ approaches to COVID-19. Hence, a vastly lower revenue 

has been recorded in this segment. 

Objective for FY2022: 

With the rapid rollout of vaccination, rapid-COVID-19 testing, travel bubbles, and the steady reopening 

of countries for global travel; the Group sees opportunities to recover the Content production segment 

with the hopes of benchmarking it to pre-COVID-19 levels, while at the same time creating new revenue 

streams through collaborations locally and abroad. The Group also aims to increase collaborations with 

Government-funded projects.

Environmental Protection

 

Record-high temperatures around the world caused by climate change continue to displace millions of 

people2. One minor effect of the lockdowns globally including the “Circuit Breaker” in Singapore to slow 

the spread pandemic, was a dramatic decrease in businesses’ electricity consumption and their 

associated carbon emissions. Please refer below to Energy Management for details. 

Energy Management 

 

Most energy consumed by the Group in Singapore was for daily operations, including air-conditioning, 

lighting, and the running of digital equipment and VR technology, used for the development and 

production of digital content. We have new energy saving initiatives to supplement current ones in place. 

Remote Working

 

Employees are currently encouraged to work from home where possible. This initiative started as a 

response by the Group to slow the spread of the pandemic. Upon review of the benefits of remote 

working, the Group is considering extending this initiative in the future to offer employees the option of 

partial remote working. Not only would this reduce energy usage in the office, employees would also 

conserve time and cost incurred by traveling to work. 

Continued usage of LED lighting

 

As conventional lights and LED lights burn out, the Group remains committed in replacing them with 

well-sourced, highly efficient and energy conservative LED lights.  

Maintaining air-conditioning temperature

 

With fewer employees in the office, employees are encouraged to maintain the air-conditioning 

temperature at 25-27°C to reduce the electricity consumption. Our air-conditioner units are also 

regularly maintained and the filter is either replaced or cleaned for optimal efficiency, thus reducing 

electricity consumption.  

Performance

 

We have been constantly reviewing our goals set for the previous year and promoting the 

abovementioned energy saving initiatives and monitoring our electricity consumption. We logged a 4% 

drop in electricity consumption in FY2021 as compared to FY2020, to a total usage of 142,694kWh. 

This decrease can be attributed to energy saving initiatives and employees working from home due to 

COVID-19 restrictions.

Vividthree Holdings Ltd.  

Sustainability Report 2021

Objective for FY2022:  

With record low energy consumption for FY2021 due to remote working, we aim to maintain electricity 

consumption below FY2020 levels through our initiatives and on-going research on cost-effective 

energy saving electrical devices. The cost and energy savings would benefit both investors and the 

environment.  

Employment  

 

Vividthree subscribes to the philosophy that developing employees also develops the business, and 

helps us remain competitive with skilled employees and lower turnover rates. We continue our 

commitment to attracting and supporting employees through these challenging times, through providing 

competitive and adequate salaries, promoting continuous skills upgrading, and maintaining a safe and 

conducive work environment for all employees.  

Below are examples of programmes undertaken by the Group in FY2021. 

Talent recruitment 

 

Vividthree needs talented employees with specialised skillsets relating to creativity and digital 

technology to grow the Group.  

We take a multi-pronged approach to attracting talent: 

1. We advertise on multiple employment portals to extend our reach. 

2. We are equal opportunity employers and use objective matrixes such as education level, skillset, 

and professional experience in the recruitment process. 

3. We offer competitive salaries to prospective employees. 

4. We provide hands-on training for all employees to familiarise them with our products. 

We manage our human capital investment by attracting and nurturing talent, as well as consistently 

engaging our employees in training programs to keep them abreast with technology advancements. 

We put in place workplace practices which include fair employment practices, open communication and 

open feedback channels to improve the working experience of our employees.  

Talent retention including Work-life balance

 

We want each and every employee to feel safe and valued. Some initiatives taken by the Group to 

support our employees include: 

1. Remote working options for employees, including online meetings when possible, to eliminate 

commute time for our employees and improve work life balance. 

2. Regular virtual team meetings for employees to build team cohesiveness and bond. 


Vividthree Holdings Ltd.  

Sustainability Report 2021

3. We encourage employees to apply for and to attend skills upgrading courses relevant to their 

job scope. 

4. We take COVID-19 precautions in the office seriously through enforcing a mask mandate in the 

office, social distancing between workstations, and providing hand sanitisation stations around 

the office. 

Equal opportunity

 

Vividthree follows local and international fair employment practices including the Singapore Tripartite 

Alliance for Fair Employment guidelines. We support diversity and open hiring processes to expand our 

talented workforce. We value all our employees, regardless of gender, race, marital status or age, and 

believe that they should be treated with dignity and respect. Furthermore, we also comply with 

employment laws and regulations relating to non-discrimination for dismissals.  

Harmonised with the above-mentioned values and principles, we aim to maintain or improve gender 

diversity in the workplace.  

The tables below show the make-up of the employees in the Group.

Employees by age group 

 

 

In FY2021, the number of employees within the Group remained relatively stable, despite the fall in 

revenue and lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management did their best to retain staff 

strength, which was greatly supported by Government Grants such as the Singapore’s Job Support 

Scheme, which subsidised a substantial portion of our staff’s salary during the Circuit Breaker period. 

The Group continues our search for talented employees, and we select employees based on their 

experience and skillset rather than age, gender or race.

As the COVID-19 pandemic situation continues to develop, the Group continues to follow and improve 

our pandemic strategies first imposed in FY2020. These include a freeze on non-essential overseas 

travel, safe distancing measures in the office and mandatory mask wearing. 

During FY2021, we are proud to highlight that there were zero reported incidents of discrimination 

recorded by the Group.   

 

Target for subsequent reporting:  

In addition to providing equal opportunities for all employees, and ensuring that we have a workplace 

that is free from discrimination, we have also taken additional measures to protect the well-being of our 

employees. Our philosophy is to recruit and retain employees, by gaining their respect and loyalty 

through our actions of promoting a positive workplace culture free from discrimination. The Group aims 

to preserve our record of zero reported cases of workplace discrimination for FY2022. 

Corporate Governance   

 

There is a direct association between best-practice Corporate Governance and improved corporate 

results and growth. Vividthree is committed to maintain a high standard of corporate governance 

through a culture of compliance and reinforce internal controls. This culture includes practices that 

promote transparency, accountability, and sound risk management for all business decisions 

undertaken by the Group. 

Vividthree has formalised corporate policies which communicate the vision and values of the Group 

towards the employees regarding the day-to-day operations.  These include workplace procedures that 

explain specific action plans to be taken for each procedure. Below are some policies that have assisted 

employees to uphold a high level of integrity in all business dealings. 

Conflict of Interest (“COI”) Policy 

 

To ensure the Group's transactions uphold its interests, and not any individual’s private benefit, the 

Group maintains a robust COI Policy which is made known to all employees to facilitate the reporting 

and management of any potential COI. All potential COI reports are referred to the Audit Committee for 

review and resolution, or mitigation of the potential COI. For FY2021, all staff have completed the 

declaration of conflict of interest and there was no conflict of interest declared. 

Whistle-blowing Policy

 

The Group does not tolerate dishonest or corrupt practices. To facilitate the reporting of such practices, 

the Group has in place a Whistle-blowing Policy. This includes providing an internal whistle-blowing 

channel for whistle-blowers to confidentially report any suspected misconduct. All information received 

will be treated with utmost confidence, and is restricted to designated personnel in charge of conducting 

the investigation.  

In FY2021, there were no reported whistle-blowing incidents or confirmed cases of corruption and 

actions taken against our management or employees.  

Target for subsequent reporting:  

Going forward, the Group targets to maintain and monitor our compliance with relevant laws and 

regulations and to maintain zero reported incidents of fraud, dishonesty or corruption.

Compliance   

 

The Group has confidence in competing on a fair playing field, through being ethical and principled in 

all business activities. The Group adheres to this principle through  observing local and international 

laws and regulations applicable to the Group, especially those in relation to the Group’s core business 

concerning censorship and classifications, and filming licenses and approvals. 

Censorship and classification 

 

As a significant portion of our business involves content creation and story-telling through script 

development, storyboarding and animation; we monitor the substance of the content produced for 

adherence to censorship and classification regulations and guidelines in the countries they are 

produced and distributed to. Two countries that we pay extra attention to are Singapore and Malaysia’s 

regulations, as we have a significant number of collaborations in both jurisdictions. 

Singapore: Except for certain categories, all movies, videos and video games distributed and exhibited 

must be submitted for classification and certification under the Films Act (Chapter 107) of Singapore. 

Malaysia: Regulations and licensing requirements imposed by the National Firm Development 

Corporation Malaysia (“FINAS”) for film-production and television commercial advertisements. 

Filming licenses and approvals

 

Necessary licences and approvals for filming outside the studio are required from the relevant 

government authorities or property owners on a per project basis, depending on the filming 

requirements of each project. Facilitation letters can be obtained from the local authority such as the 

Infocomm Media Development Authority (“IMDA”) in Singapore, as part of procuring location clearances.  

The Group’s content production’s business activities at times require filming to be performed at public 

locations for the scenic backgrounds. We are grateful to have employees with extensive relevant 

experience and knowledge regarding the necessary approvals and clearances needed to be obtained 

before the commencement of each project.  

In FY2021, there were no reported cases of non-compliance with the local laws and regulations.  

Target for subsequent reporting:  

Going forward, in line with the significance of compliance with laws and regulations in our daily business 

activities, we will continue to monitor changes and updates with laws and regulations, including COVID-

19 restrictions and mandatory safety rules by IMDA and to achieve zero incidents of reported non-

compliance.  

Intellectual Property Rights Protection 

 

The Group being in the digital production sphere, including the production of virtual reality, visual effects, 

and computer-generated imagery, relies heavily on the development and usage of digital intellectual 

property, copyrights, trademarks and contractual agreements to create a competitive advantage. In 

FY2021 Vividthree added an additional S$6.76 million of intangible assets including completing the 

acquisition of new IP, Silent Horror, of which $500,000 was paid as a deposit in FY2020. Vividthree 

utilises a combination of legal protections such as copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual 

protection, to establish and protect our ever-growing list of intellectual property rights. Furthermore, we 

have included confidentiality provisions in our employment contracts with our employees. As it is one 

of our core business practices, we have a dedicated corporate business development team handling 

intellectual property related matters. Our Group’s intellectual property include the following:

Sustainability Report 2021

Copyrights 

 

The Group owns the copyrights to the visual elements, story boards, characters and synopses that we 

create for our virtual reality products, based on their individual licensing agreements. 

Trademarks 

 

We have registered the “Vividthree Productions” trademark in Singapore, Malaysia, and China.   

Domain Names

 

The Group owns and maintains a list of Domain Names. We conduct periodic review on the list to 

ensure Domain Names owned by the Group are recorded, paid for, and aligned with our Group’s 

development. Due to the nature of the business, we are conscious that we are highly vulnerable to risks 

of being accused of infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. While our corporate business 

development team closely monitors intellectual property rights, we cannot be assured that we will not 

infringe any Intellectual Property Rights of third parties in the future. We believe that by registering our 

trademarks and copyrights, as legal documentation, the risk of being accused of infringement would be 

significantly reduced.  

In FY2021, there were no reported cases of infringement of Intellectual Property Rights made against 

the Group.  

Target for subsequent reporting:  

Going forward, our corporate business development team continues to monitor our intellectual property 

rights, the registration of trademarks in the respective countries we operate in or plan to expand to, and 

also to safeguard us against any infringement of third parties’ rights.
