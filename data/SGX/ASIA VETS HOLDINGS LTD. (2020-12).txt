OUR BOARD’S MESSAGE 

[GRI 102-1, 14, 50, 52] 

 

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) is pleased to present the second Sustainability Report (the 

“Report”) of Asia Vets Holdings Ltd. (“AVH”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) for 

the reporting period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 (“FY2020”). The Report further 

demonstrates AVH’s ongoing efforts on sustainability issues, management and collaborations 

with our business partners to achieve our economic, environmental and social objectives. 

 

Besides striving to be at the forefront of pet care in Singapore, one of the core values of the 

Group is to remain committed to be a trusted partner with professional ethics. We have 

considered the sustainability issues as part of our strategic planning. The material Economic, 

Environmental, Social and Governance (“EESG”) aspects of the Group are overseen and 

monitored by the management of the Group. 

 

There has been a significant impact to the Singapore economy caused by the spread of the 

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”). The COVID-19 pandemic has brought 

unprecedented changes in how veterinary clinics operate. The Animal &amp; Veterinary Service of 

Singapore has provided the animal and veterinary sector with operational guidelines on queue 

management, crowd management, safe-distancing measures and implementation of good 

hygiene practices. The management of the Group together with our professional team of 

veterinarians have overcome the challenges and continued to serve our community during this 

unprecedented period.  

 

The Board would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who have contributed to our 

sustainability efforts and we will continue to strive and improve while considering the economic, 

social and environmental impact to our stakeholders. The Board will continue to take a 

balanced approach in formulating strategies to enhance long-term values which are sustainable 

to our stakeholders.

This Report covers AVH’s approach towards the EESG factors deemed material to the Group.  

 

AVH has utilised the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards which are the most widely 

adopted global standards for sustainability reporting. This Report has been prepared in 

accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. GRI is the independent, international 

organisation that helps businesses and other organisations take responsibility for their 

sustainability impacts, by providing them with the global common language to communicate 

those impacts. No external assurance has been sought for this Report. 

 

As we seek to continually improve upon our sustainability efforts, any feedback is welcomed at 

general@asiavets.com. 

 

Headquartered in Singapore, the Group’s 

principal business activity is to provide 

veterinary services and sales of veterinary 

medicines and products through our 

subsidiary, AVH Animal Ark Pte Ltd. 

 

With our reputation of providing the 

highest level of pet care, equipped with 

experienced and competent team of staff, 

we are optimistic about our performance 

in the following years.

OUR EXPERTISE 

[GRI 102-2, 4, 6, 7] 

The Group is proud to serve our customers for all pet related needs. Our veterinary clinics 

prides itself on its team of highly experienced and motivated animal healthcare professionals. 

AVH currently operates two1 veterinary clinics in Singapore. Our veterinary clinics have a sturdy 

base of customers through quality service care and an established record in the performance 

of certain procedures such as endoscopy and laparoscopy. These services include the latest 

in surgical procedure, key-hole surgery as well as utilisation of natural killer cell and stem cell 

therapies in cancer treatments.  

 

Embracing a wider philosophy to wellbeing, we also offer veterinary acupuncture and 

Traditional Chinese Medicine (“TCM”) for a more holistic approach to health and healing for 

animals with conditions such as epilepsy, hepatitis, anaemia, arthritis and abdominal pains. 

The clinics also provide a comprehensive range of veterinary services which includes medical, 

surgical and dental care.  

 

Our Medical Director, Dr Eugene Lin, was among the first veterinarians to offer endoscopy and 

laparoscopy procedures. These minimally invasive surgical methods gained reputation due to 

its precision and smaller incisions on animals which could speed up the wound recovery 

process. The clinics also incorporated an interventional radiology which is a combination of the 

minimally invasive surgery techniques and fluoroscopy, which allow for real-time imaging of the 

small animals’ internal body structure.  

 

AVH also offers after-hours emergency hotline 

services which operates from 8pm to 9am the 

following day and throughout public holidays.  

 

All cases are first screened and triaged by the 

duty veterinarian over the telephone. If 

required, the duty veterinarian will then meet 

the customers at the assigned clinic. 

 

1 During FY2020, AVH operated three veterinary clinics in Singapore. With effect from March 2021, AVH has 

ceased operations at the TCM @ Tampines clinic. AVH continues to provide TCM services at the remaining two 

veterinary clinics.

OUR PROMISE 

[GRI 102-16, 103-1 to 3, 205-3] 

Our team is committed to educating our clients on how to keep their pets healthy all year round, 

with good nutrition and exercise. AVH stays on top of the latest advances in veterinarian 

technology and above all, remembers that all animals and pets need to be treated with loving 

care in every check-up, procedure, or surgery. 

 

Conflict of Interest 

To uphold the highest standards of 

corporate governance, the Group engages 

in responsible business practices and 

comply with applicable acts, laws, rules 

and regulations. All employees and 

governance body members are required to 

submit a Conflict of Interest Declaration as 

guided by AVH’s Conflict of Interest Policy.  

 

This 

ensures 

that 

employees’ 

and 

governance body members’ business 

judgement and decision making are not 

influenced by undue personal interests 

that creates a conflict of interest to the 

Group. The Group also requires its new 

suppliers to submit a Conflict of Interest 

Declaration prior to the start of their 

business relationship. Any activity that 

appears to present a conflict must be 

avoided 

or 

terminated 

unless 

management determines the activity is not 

harmful to the Group or otherwise 

improper. 

 

Bribery and Anti-corruption 

The Group is committed to the highest 

standards of ethical, moral and legal 

business conduct and has adopted a zero-

tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. 

In line with this commitment to open 

communication 

and 

good 

corporate 

governance, a Whistle-blowing Policy was 

implemented which provides employees and 

external parties with a platform to raise 

concerns in confidence on any wrongdoings, 

malpractices or possible irregularity within 

the Group. They are protected from reprisals 

or victimisation for whistle blowing in good 

faith and without malice. 

 

Our Whistle-blowing Policy is disseminated 

to all governance body members and 

employees which serve as a guideline in 

recognising and addressing any possible 

instances of corruption that they may face or 

witness. There have been no incidents of 

bribery or corruption reported during the 

reporting period (FY2019: NIL) and we 

envision to maintain this performance 

perpetually.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY JOURNEY 

[GRI 102-18, 46] 

We conducted our first materiality assessment last year with reference to the GRI Standards to 

identify and select stakeholders with whom to engage and determine the EESG factors that are 

material to them. We conducted a Focus Group Discussion with our very own Sustainability 

Reporting Champion Team to validate the assessment and gather feedback on the 

sustainability issues that are important to these key stakeholders. The key stakeholder groups 

and material factors are still deemed relevant and remain unchanged since last reporting 

period. We will continue to assess the identified material factors on a regular basis to ensure 

their relevance. The Group has adopted the 4-step approach below to identify the relevant 

topics for reporting. 

 

 

In accordance with the GRI Standards, we applied the four reporting principles to decide which 

content to include in the Report by considering the Group’s activities, impacts, and the 

substantive expectation and interests of our stakeholders.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN 

[GRI 102-9, 11, 103-1 to 3, 204-1] 

The Group strives to build a sustainable supply chain to seize value creation opportunities and 

offer significant competitive advantages. AVH engaged a total of 88 suppliers during the 

reporting period. Our vendors are mainly located in established countries with reliable medical 

care such as Singapore, Japan and the United States of America. This builds consumer 

confidence in the medical products used and sold at our clinics.  

 

The proportion of local spending in Singapore contributes to approximately 97% of the Group’s 

total expenditure during the reporting period and we target local spending in Singapore to be 

at least 95% every year. There are plenty of benefits from sourcing locally, as compared to 

sourcing internationally. These include shorter delivery lead time and efficient communication 

with suppliers due to quicker response time. 

 

With 20 years of experience in the veterinary practice, Dr Eugene Lin regularly conducts 

lectures and workshops to share his knowledge with other local and overseas veterinary 

professionals. The lectures and workshops on endoscopy and laparoscopy not only aid in 

raising awareness and knowledge on the availability of such diagnostics, but it also helps the 

Group’s clinics in obtaining referrals from other veterinary clinics.

Decreasing 

Energy 

Consumption 

OUR ENVIRONMENT 

[GRI 103-1 to 3, 302-1, 3, 307-1] 

At AVH, we each play our part to improve environmental sustainability through the reduction of 

energy consumption across our clinics. The Group did not identify any incidents on non-

compliance with environmental laws and regulations during the reporting period (FY2019: NIL) 

and we seek to maintain this performance perpetually. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Group’s only significant form of energy consumed is electricity. In our efforts to conserve 

the environment, AVH utilises energy saving lights and air conditioners. Our medical equipment 

is only switched on when required during medical procedures or surgeries. 

 

During the reporting period, the Group consumed a total of 67,207 kWh of electricity and 

reported a turnover of S$4.3 million. On average, 0.016 kWh of energy was consumed for every 

dollar earned. This was lower by 0.003 kWh of energy consumed for every dollar earned, as 

compared to the last reporting period, due to the Group’s efforts to consume lesser electricity 

and having reported a higher turnover for the reporting period. The Group will continue to 

monitor our energy consumption and strive to reduce the energy usage in the next reporting 

period.

The Group’s employee hiring rate and turnover rate was 33% (FY2019: 35%) and 24% 

(FY2019: 25%) respectively for the reporting period. The employee hiring rate and turnover rate 

remain fairly stable, as compared to the last reporting period. We seek to keep both rates below 

20% in the long term. Here at AVH, we believe in diversity. Regardless of gender, age and 

nationality, we provide our people with equal opportunities and employ them based on their 

merits. There have been no incidents of discrimination reported during the reporting period 

(FY2019: NIL) and we target to maintain this performance perpetually.

OUR PEOPLE 

[GRI 103-1 to 3, 404-1, 3] 

Professional Development 

In AVH, we strongly believe in continual learning, training and development for all. We 

encourage our employees to learn new skills and techniques to keep abreast with veterinary 

changes to provide quality care for our patients. This also aids the personal development of 

individual employees. All our new employees undergo a 3 months’ probation period during 

which their performance will be assessed. During the probation period, they are given on-the-

job training while shadowing a senior employee. This is to provide them with the opportunity to 

familiarise themselves with the operations. 

 

Employees 

are 

given 

ample 

opportunities 

to 

expand 

their 

competencies and optimise work 

operations of the Group through 

funding support from the Group for 

external development courses. During 

the reporting period, the Group 

reported an average of 5.0 training 

hours per employee, as compared to an average of 8.4 training hours per employee for the last 

reporting period. The decrease was attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic which restricted 

our plans for employee training. Moving forward, we target to increase the trainings provided 

to all employees.

AVH works closely with Ngee Ann Polytechnic to match suitable individuals who are within 

three years of graduation to undergo structured training programme at our clinics. The Work-

Study Post-Diploma (“WSPostDip”), which is a SkillsFuture Work-Study Programme benefits 

the individuals as they undergo structured on-the-job training and mentorship at AVH. They 

also benefit from well-structured career development pathways and guidance from mentors 

through our talent development plan.

OUR PEOPLE 

[GRI 102-11, 103-1 to 3, 404-1, 3] 

Performance and career development reviews are conducted during our annual appraisals for 

all employees. This serves as a platform for AVH and employees to improve performance in 

their current roles that brings a greater impact to the Group and to achieve their individual 

career aspirations. Together with clear individual development plans, we believe that effective 

motivation and encouragement enhances employee satisfaction, which correlates with 

improved organisation performance. 

 

Health and Safety 

In ensuring that there are no safety lapses at the clinics, employees are required to be skilled 

in handling equipment. In addition, an in-depth understanding of medical procedures is also 

expected of employees. Any lapses resulting due to the incompetency of employee may lead 

to undesirable consequences.   

 

Employees may also be exposed to risks if policies and procedures are not closely observed 

during administration of treatments or surgeries on animals. Any employee handling ionising 

irradiating apparatus must possess an L5 licence2. This licence is required for applicants 

intending to use, operate, energise or supervise the use of ionising radiation irradiating 

apparatus.  

 

With safety being our utmost priority, our clinics are staffed with skilled veterinary technicians 

with at least 5 years of experience.

OUR CUSTOMERS 

[GRI 102-11, 103-1 to 3, 416-2] 

AVH takes pride in the quality of our pet health care. The health, safety and wellbeing of our 

patients are of utmost importance to us. At AVH, we closely observe all regulations concerning 

health and safety of products and services that we offer. This is to ensure that we provide safe 

products and services to our customers. There are no instances of non-compliance to 

regulations concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services during the 

reporting period (FY2019: NIL) and we seek to maintain this performance perpetually. 

 

In Safe Hands 

A selection of educational media has been provided to the public, on our subsidiary’s website, 

from the case notes of our Medical Director, Dr Eugene Lin. We hope to raise awareness of the 

enhanced clarity, safety and precision achieved via laparoscopy and endoscopy procedures. 

This aids the owners of the pets (who are our customers) to better understand the surgical 

procedures to be performed and thereby putting them at ease. 

 

We seek to reassure the owners that their pets are in safe hands. As such, AVH operates as 

an open clinic. This means that our team welcomes owners to observe their pets during any 

medical procedure, whether a simple vaccination or a complex surgery.

[GRI 102-12, 103-1 to 3, 418-1, 419-1] 

Safeguarding Customer Privacy 

We place great emphasis on the protection and privacy of customer data against any breaches. 

The Group complies with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 to ensure customers’ privacy 

is safeguarded. We did not receive any complaints regarding any breaches of customer privacy 

during the reporting period (FY2019: NIL) and we target to maintain this performance 

perpetually.  

 

Social and Economic Laws and Regulations 

It is in our best interest to aim towards an all-sustainable operations. This includes the social 

aspect of sustainability which concerns the impacts we impose on social systems. We place 

emphasis on socioeconomic compliance in our operations. There have been no reports on non-

compliance of socioeconomic laws and regulations during the reporting period (FY2019: NIL) 

and we envision to maintain this performance perpetually. AVH is a committed partner whose 

main aim is to deliver highest level of care and professionalism. We strive to fulfil the needs 

and expectations of our customers and stakeholders.  

 

Taking precautionary measures in our business operations is very vital to ensure that we are 

fully aware of possible risks or side effects in any scientific administration to animals. Especially 

in our operations of evaluating and administering veterinary medicines and products to animals, 

it is essential that we uphold our precautionary principles.  

 

Giving back 

In AVH, we believe in giving back. Everyone has a role to play in making positive changes to 

the world. Whether in the social aspect or environmental aspect, all efforts matter. Here at AVH, 

we are actively involved in supporting the community through various Corporate Social 

Responsibility efforts. Apart from free talks given by our Medical Director, Dr Eugene Lin, to pet 

owners at pet events to raise the importance of regular health checks and dental hygiene, 

preferential rates are also given to dogs who have been adopted from Save Our Street Dogs, 

a volunteer-run organisation dedicated to the welfare of Singapore’s many street dogs.
