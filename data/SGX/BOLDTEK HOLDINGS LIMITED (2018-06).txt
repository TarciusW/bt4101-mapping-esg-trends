1 BOARD STATEMENT 

It gives me great pleasure to present our sustainability report for the financial year ended 30 

June 2018 ("FY2018”). In our first sustainability report, we highlight the progress and 

achievements of our organisation over the previous 12 months, with particular focus on our 

commitment to working alongside our valued stakeholders to build a sustainable business 

based on our resilience, adaptability and innovation.  

It is our belief that building a sustainable business is vital to our continued success and that 

we must be fully accountable for our impact on the environment, our customers, our people 

and our community as well as its financial performance.  

The delivery of sustainable results is a critical aspect of our ability to remain strong and 

financially stable. Acknowledging this helps to put into focus our commitment to principles 

laid out in our Corporate Sustainability Policy. Our responsibility to society is to ensure that 

sustainable practices are incorporated into every link of our value chain. We must meet the 

needs not only of our customers, employees and the community we operate in, but also 

those of our environment and our future generations.  

This report provides detail about how we have met our responsibilities with our key 

stakeholders during the FY2018 and beyond. 

 

2 ABOUT THE REPORT 

This sustainability report articulates our commitment to sustainability and transparency. This 

is our first sustainability report. The report is designed to provide a transparent and balanced 

view of Boldtek Holdings Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), to reflect 

the interests of our key stakeholders, and to address those interests pragmatically. This 

report aims to include comprehensive and accessible information on the Company’s strategy 

towards sustainability, key issues as well as data according to recognise standards.  

2.1 Report Scope 

The report covers the performance of our consolidated entities in financial year 2018 

(“FY2018”) from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018. The content of this report will focus on the 

sustainability performance, activities and initiatives that are under our direct control, 

including our Singapore offices and operations as well as any overseas activities directly 

associated with us. This report excludes joint ventures, if any, which are not directly under 

our control. Material issues and topics described in this report have been selected according 

to their level of significance within the Company boundaries, the sustainability context and 

the expectations of stakeholders which are reflective of our core business in a consistent 

manner for comparability of our performance indicators across time. In this respect, this 

report covers our general building in our material operational boundaries in Singapore. All 

material aspects disclosed in this report are relevant to activities in Singapore only. The 

scope of this report covers operations and initiatives within Singapore, where the Group is 

based. Nevertheless, our corporate governance and sustainability approaches are drawn 

from the policies and practices set at Group level. 

This sustainability report focuses on the Group’s sustainability strategies and practices whilst 

highlighting the economic, environmental, and social and governance aspects of our 

activities and developments. The report aims to provide an overview of our approach, 

priorities and targets, as well as a performance review for our key sustainability areas.

2.2 Report Methodology 

This report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

Standards Core option. We have chosen the GRI Standards reporting guidelines for its 

robust guidance which offers an international reference for the disclosure of governance 

approach and of the environmental, social and economic performance and impacts of 

organisations. This report also takes into consideration the primary components of the report 

content as set out by the Singapore Exchange’s (SGX’s) “Comply or Explain” requirements 

for sustainability reporting. Our data are reported in good faith and to the best of our 

knowledge. We will continue to improve our data collection processes.  

We did not seek external assurance for this report. 

2.3 Report Structure 

This sustainability report is structured to reflect the interests of our key stakeholders. We 

have identified five key stakeholder groups, namely, the environment and future generations, 

employees, customers, suppliers and communities. For each stakeholder group, we lay out 

our management approaches that govern how our material issues are identified as well as 

how the issues are prioritised and managed. Further, we will present our initiatives relating to 

sustainability in the areas of environmental, social and economic issues relevant to our 

aspects and boundaries. Finally, we will provide the information of our key performance 

indicators, performance targets and outcomes. 

The information regarding the basis for report boundaries and our materiality assessment is 

provided in section 4. 

Altogether, this report provides the basis for our responses and disclosures to the GRI-

Standards ‘In-Accordance’ - Core requirements. Relevant sections in the report are 

referenced in the GRI Content Index provided in section 7.

3 CORPORATE PROFILE 

3.1 Vision and Mission 

Vision: To be an admired well-diversified business group delivering superior building, design 

and maintenance solutions for our customers and community. 

Mission: Customers - We will leverage our construction core expertise by diversifying into 

supporting segments of sustained new growth. 

Investors - We will deliver sustained, risk-adjusted investor returns through our portfolio of 

core and supportive business activities. 

Team - We believe in nurturing future leaders to drive business continuity and high 

performance. 

3.2 Governance 

Our Board of Directors (the Board) oversees all corporate governance and operational 

matters relating to our business. For corporate sustainability, the Board is supported by the 

Corporate Sustainability Committee (CSC) which comprises Chairperson, Secretariat and a 

Member. CSC provides leadership and approval over corporate sustainability matters such 

as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plan, community investment and environmental 

initiatives. Supported by CSC, the Secretariat is our Governance Support Officer (GSO) in 

the area of corporate sustainability, and pro-actively raises awareness through education 

and training across the organisation. Through the Corporate Sustainability Work Group 

(CSWG), our GSO engages businesses and functions in collectively executing the CSR plan, 

identifying and managing the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Factors as well as 

engaging sustainability stakeholders. Businesses and functions provide back-to-back 

assurance over the quality of information for sustainability reporting.

3.3 Ethics and Compliance 

Being a listed company in the Singapore Exchange (SGX), we are managed to the highest 

standards of corporate governance as required in the listing rules. We strictly conform to 

local and international best practices. Our corporate governance framework covers ethics 

and compliance through a Code of Conduct as well as action guidelines which are to be 

adhered by the officers and employees across the organisation. Every new employee is 

introduced to our Code of Conduct and our policies on ethics and compliances. 

Communication channels, such as Whistle-Blower and Board escalation process, are in 

place to enable all employees and individuals engaged in business activities to report 

complaints of unethical behaviour. We have a dedicated officer who maintains a register of 

incidences regarding ethics and compliance issues and escalates to the management where 

appropriate. 

4 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS 

We believe corporate social responsibility is a key driver towards long-term sustainability. 

Such responsibility is pragmatically integrated into our business practices as one of the core 

values in our corporate culture. Embedding such responsibility into our management 

processes across the value chain allows us to establish credibility among our stakeholders. 

Through our action today, we play a part in influencing the environment for our future 

generations. Through integrating the notion of sustainability in our business, we ensure that 

our business strategy and operations are in line with a long-term vision towards a conducive 

and sustainability future. 

4.1 Sustainability Management Framework 

In July 2017, we took the initiative to establish our sustainability reporting framework. We 

performed an analysis on our business and operation models as the basis for our 

stakeholder mapping and materiality assessment. Through our analysis, we identified five 

key stakeholder groups within our sustainability context and their respective material issues 

are to be shown in this report. 

4.2 Key Stakeholders and Material Issues 

We have a regular review, assessment and feedback process in relation to Environmental, 

Social and Governance (ESG) topics. Key to this is our regular Risk Assessment and 

Control Self-Assessment exercise which entails the identification, assessment and 

documentation of material risks and corresponding internal controls. Such material risks 

include fraud and corruption, environmental, health and safety, and human capital risks 

which are ESG-relevant. We are continuously improving the adequacy and effectiveness of 

our Risk Assessment and Control Self-Assessment processes in response to changing 

business and operation environment. 

Through regular stakeholder engagement, we identify and review material issues that are 

most relevant and significant to us and our stakeholders. For external stakeholders, priority 

is given to issues important to society and applicable to us. Then, we prioritise our 

sustainability efforts and report issues that are most material to its business and 

stakeholders. Considering that specific stakeholders and material issues are specific in 

countries and locations, we are reporting the stakeholder engagement and material issues 

for our Singapore operations in this report.

4.3 Alignment with International Initiatives 

4.3.1 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 

Established in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations (UN), the General Assembly 

occupies a central position as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ 

of the United Nations. Comprising all 193 Members of the United Nations, it provides a 

unique forum for multilateral discussion of the full spectrum of international issues covered 

by the Charter. It also plays a significant role in the process of standard-setting and the 

codification of international law. 

On 25 September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the 17 Sustainable 

Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all 

as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to be 

achieved over the next 15 years. Although the SDGs are primarily aimed at governments, 

they represent an important opportunity for businesses to also act for a more sustainable 

world. We will use SDGs as one of the guiding principles for our sustainability initiatives. 

We acknowledge that our participation in reaching the SDGs has room for improvement. As 

we advance on our sustainability journey, we will continue to assess our alignment with the 

SDGs and, whenever possible, redirect our internal priorities and sustainability strategy to 

more effectively and comprehensively address the goals.

Our Participation 

 

13.3: Improve education, awareness-

raising and human and institutional 

capacity on climate change mitigation, 

adaptation, impact reduction and early 

warning. 

We have our own internal processes 

and environmental policies to reduce 

electricity and fuel consumption. Our 

approach to mitigate climate change 

includes staff training and implementing 

energy-efficient measures. We monitor 

and report our GHG emissions and set 

reduction targets. 

 

15.1: 

By 

2020, 

ensure 

the 

conservation, 

restoration 

and 

sustainable use of terrestrial and 

inland freshwater ecosystems and 

their services, in particular forests, 

wetlands, mountains and drylands, in 

line 

with 

obligations 

under 

international agreements. 

Papers 

used 

in 

our 

offices 

are 

environment certified such as Forest 

Stewardship Council (FSC) certified, 

made from KHAN-NA etc. We actively 

promote the use of such papers across 

our organisation. Through that, the 

Group supports efforts in mitigating 

global warming. 

 

 

 

 

 

The following SDGs are relevant to our 

business, operations and value chain. They 

are addressed in our various policies at 

Group level. Such goals are also embedded 

in various initiatives carried out across the 

organisation.

We do not believe these goals are relevant to 

our business or industry. They are not within 

our boundaries and scope of influence; 

therefore, we are currently unable to make 

noticeable contributions to such goals. 

 

 

 

 

 

4.3.2 United Nations (UN) Global Compact  

The United Nations (UN) Global Compact is a United Nations initiative to encourage 

businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies, and to report 

on their implementation. The UN Global Compact is a principle-based framework for 

businesses, stating ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and 

anti-corruption.

5 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

We believe that Corporation Social Responsibility (CSR) practice goes hand-in-hand with 

good corporate management practice. We also recognize that it is vital that our management 

approaches are adaptable to the dynamics of business and operation environment in such a 

way that we can continuously assess our impacts, develop sustainability objectives and 

respond in a proper manner to meet our stakeholders’ expectations. Our CSR framework is 

based on our approach to sustainability and includes policies and measurement 

mechanisms to monitor the impacts made by our businesses and operations. 

Key to the success of our sustainability programme is regular and up-to-date communication 

about our CSR policies and activities to all our stakeholders, and the provision of appropriate 

feedback mechanisms so that we can monitor and evaluate how we are doing and explore 

new possibilities stimulated by stakeholder responses. We see our sustainability reports as 

being a critical component of this continuous cycle of communication and evaluation. The 

overall sustainability context of the stakeholder engagements is managed through our CSR 

plan for our sustainability governance oversight.

5.1 Protecting Our Environment for the Future Generations 

5.1.1 Our Approach 

We are committed to comply with the environmental policies and standards. We continually 

seek new and innovative ways to reduce the environmental impact of our products and 

services while maintaining the highest levels of quality. We recognize our responsibility to 

protect the environment for the health and wellbeing of future generations.  

5.1.2 Reduction of Carbon Footprint 

We recognize that the effective management and monitoring of its carbon footprint can 

reduce operating costs, raise brand profile, create a competitive edge and increase 

stakeholder value. Our carbon footprint is measured in terms of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 

emission. However, GHG emission is an absolute measure of how much carbon dioxide 

equivalent (CO2e) is emitted. Our GHG emission is predominantly indirect (Scope 2) 

emission. We have insignificant direct (Scope 1) emission, and we do not include the GHG 

emissions generated by our suppliers (Scope 3). 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our 

GHG emission efficiency index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. To this 

end, we have set a target for GHG emission efficiency improvement of 10% from our 2018 

level by 2030. Our target for GHG emission improvement is 0.83% per year. Although 

various business lines and operations account for different percentage of GHG emissions 

across the organisation, they all support this target and have aligned our environmental 

objectives accordingly.  

FY2018 is our first year of sustainability reporting. FY2018 will be used as reference against 

which the performance will be measured in subsequent years.

5.1.3 Reduction of Paper Consumption 

All our employees are encouraged to minimise paper wastage at work. For example, lower 

gram paper is used for daily printing, and blank sides of unneeded single-sided copies are 

used for printing drafts. 

All waste paper from our own offices is collected for recycling. Further, we encourage all 

employees to adopt digital documents instead of paper documents with an aim to further 

reduce paper consumption. 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our 

paper consumption index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over time. To this end, 

we have set a target for a paper consumption improvement of 10% from our 2018 level by 

2030. Our target for paper consumption improvement is 0.83% per year. Although various 

business lines and operations account for different percentage of paper consumption across 

the organization, they all support this target and have aligned our environmental objectives 

accordingly.  

In FY2018, we consumed total of 7,266 kg of paper which are environment certified  such as 

Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified, made from KHAN-NA etc. Our paper 

consumption index standard at 102.4. 

FY2018 is our first year of sustainability reporting. FY2018 will be used as reference against 

which the performance will be measured in subsequent years.

5.1.4 Promoting Green Practices  

We have embraced various green practices in our business and operation such as New Soil 

Technologies, ISO 14001, and Green and Gracious Builder Award (Excellent) was 

presented to a Singapore subsidiary of the Group by Building &amp; Construction Authority 

(BCA). 

The ISO 14000 family of standards provides practical tools for companies and organisations 

of all kinds looking to manage their environmental responsibilities. ISO 14001:2015 sets out 

the criteria for an environmental management system and can be certified to. It maps out a 

framework that a company or organisation can follow to set up an effective environmental 

management system. It can be used by any organisation regardless of its activity or sector. 

Using ISO 14001:2015 provides assurance to our management and employees as well as 

external stakeholders that environmental impact is being measured and improved. 

BCA launched the Green and Gracious Builder Scheme in February 2009. The scheme was 

introduced to raise the environmental consciousness and professionalism of builders. It is 

also a benchmark of a builder’s corporate social responsibility to the environment and the 

general public. Apart from setting standards for green practices, it also sets standards for 

gracious practices. These gracious practices will improve the image of our builders and the 

construction industry particularly among neighbours and residents, some of whom may have 

been affected by construction activities near them. 

New Soil Technologies (NewSoil) converts excavated soft clay into local formulated dry 

cementitious soil stabilizer as an alternative source of material for reclamation fill and road 

works. NewSoil is a combination of in-situ marine clay, extracted from excavation, with 

formulated additive. Each individual soil batch is carefully formulated based on the in-situ soil 

properties, before being conditioned for each and every project so as to meet the specific 

requirement and need. In short, it is a clear-cut solution for un-usable in-situ soil by 

converting it into NewSoil. 

NewSoil is primarily an alternative source of Hard-core Aggregates. Furthermore, this 

technology can be employed effectively to harden any kinds of soil for use as Temporary 

Pavement in most construction sites. Therefore, this formula of turning unwanted raw 

materials into a usable product can eventually be applied in converting unwanted Marine 

Clay into usable hard-core aggregates as sub base, which acts as a stable processing of 

soft foundation for most road construction works. Lastly, conversion to engineered soil can 

also reduce all cost involved in marine clay disposal, which can be a form of cost savings in 

view of the limited available disposal sites.

Other Environmental Benefits include:  

• 

Facilitates reduction in energy usage (by eliminating reliance on vehicular 

transportation for disposal activities)  

• 

Encourages sustainable construction approach through material reuse/recycle usage 

(with a depleting natural resource in mind)  

• 

Reduces potential environmental impact (caused to our ecosystem by typical sea 

reclamation works)  

• 

Provides almost 20 percent cost savings as compared to high cost incurred using 

existing unwanted soil/marine clay disposal ways  

• 

Eliminates the need for marine clay disposal sites

5.2 Caring for Our Employees 

5.2.1 Our Approach 

Our people are our most valuable resource and investing in their professional and personal 

well-being is vital to our business sustainability. Our goal is to establish work ethics among 

our employees, which are in line with our core values and code of conduct. They are the 

foundation upon which we build all our business initiatives and conduct our day-to-day 

activities.  

We recognised that a motivated workforce will convey a positive and powerful message to all 

our key stakeholders, such as our customers, suppliers and the members of the community. 

By attracting, nurturing, empowering and rewarding our employees, we create an 

environment conducive for innovation and inspiration flourish to further boost our 

competitiveness. Such commitment to our employees promotes a corporate culture of 

passion, quality, excellence and trust within the organisation which reflect in our ability to 

create values to our stakeholders. 

Our Human Resource (HR) management principles and policies have been developed and 

established based on fair employment practices with the goal of attracting, supporting and 

maintaining a motivated workforce. Our HR policies cover key areas such as remuneration, 

benefits, health and safety, career development and training.  

Our business operates in an environment which comprises diverse races, cultures and 

geographic locations. With this in mind, our HR polices are implemented across the 

organisation within the principles with pragmatism, taking into consideration of the prevailing 

laws and regulations as well as local culture, norms and racial sensitivity. 

5.2.2 Employment Practices 

Our employment practices focus on maximising the strength of our employees by providing 

equal opportunities based on merits, and help our employees to develop strength through 

our comprehensive training and development programme. We regularly review the 

performance and development of our employees to effectively match their strength to their 

job specifications. Our performance-based reward scheme provides guidance and 

motivation to our employee to perform to their potentials in alignment with the objectives of 

the Company.  

5.2.2.1 The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices  

We proactively pursue and adopt best practices in HR management. Our HR practices are 

guided by the Singapore Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. 

The Singapore Tripartite Alliance comprises the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore National 

Employers Federation and National Trades Union Congress. The Tripartite Alliance has 

formulated guidelines on fair employment practice for adoption by Singapore employers, 

embracing the recruitment, training, treatment and reward of employees.

5.2.2.2 Communications  

As our Company grows, effective communications across the organisation are crucial to 

ensure continuous alignment of objectives of the employees and the organisational 

objectives. We achieve this through our various communication sessions customised based 

on target employees. Communication sessions for our managers are held on a regular basis. 

Agendas covered at these sessions are customized in appropriate to the target functional 

scope of the managers. For example, in monthly managers’ meeting, operational agendas 

such as leadership and operation issues may be discussed while at the quarterly sessions 

high level topics include strategic business directions, new service launches, ongoing 

developments and key project reviews.  

5.2.2.3 Employee Feedback  

We value our employee’s expertise in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their 

feedbacks are important in the improvement of overall management and operation of the 

organization. Through various established processes of employee engagement, such as 

employee objective setting, performance review as well as exit interview in the case of 

resignations, we gather such valuable feedbacks for the continuous improvement of our 

organisation. 

In addition, there are other feedback channels for areas specific to business and function, 

such as health and safety issues and compliance issues. Such feedbacks are managed by 

the leaders and managers of their specific business and function domain. We have also 

established reporting and escalation channel should the feedback requirements the attention 

of higher management. 

5.2.2.4 Career Development and Training 

We recognised that consistent and ongoing education is critical to maintaining a competitive, 

skilled, productive and motivated workforce. Employee career development and 

performance management established based on merits and contributing skill sets towards 

the organisation objectives through objective settings and regular performance reviews. We 

continue to review and improve our career development and performance review process in 

light of the changing business and operation environment. 

Our training programme covers a variety of areas catering for employees with difference job 

scopes and skills set requirements. Our core training curriculum and contents are developed 

guided by well-established industry and international standards such as ISO 9001, ISO 

14000, OHSAS 18001 and bizSAFE Star. In addition, specific training curriculums are 

developed based on the specific requirements of the specific businesses and functions. 

Training topics range from soft skills development in areas such as communications and 

leadership, to technical programmes covering project management and office productivity 

tools.

In FY2018, employees each received an average of 3 hours training. We recognised that the 

training requirements vary depending on the levels of management responsibilities. Each 

senior manager registers an average of 3 hours training while managerial and non-

managerial staffs receive an average of 8 hours and 3 hours of training respectively. In light 

of changing business requirements and opportunities in variety of training methodologies, we 

continue to revise our training curriculum and programme to align with organisation 

objectives and to strive for effectiveness and efficiency in our training approach. 

 

5.2.3 Workforce Diversity 

Our business thrives on diversity. As such, we leverage on a host of strengths and skills that 

can only come from a diverse workforce embracing employees from various ethnic groups, 

religion, age and gender.  

In FY2018, 27 of our employees were female and 299 employees were male. In terms of 

management function, 4 females held managerial positions compared to 14 males, while 23 

females and 285 males held non-managerial positions. From age profile perspective, there 

were 142 employees below 30 years old. The number of employees between 30 and 50 

years old was 157 as compared 27 employees above 50 years old. All members of our

In addition to the human resources we managed under our payroll internally, we also engage 

external contracted companies as our outsourced vendors which provide outsourced 

personnel, such as cleaners and security guards who might work within our premises. 

Although we supervise these people, they are employed by contracted companies and are 

not included in our head count. We do not employ other types of un-contracted workers. 

We expect that all the contracted companies we work with will share our core principles of 

HR management practices. In our vendor selection process, we take into consideration of 

their HR management practices as one of the key selections and performance criteria. We 

regularly review the performance of our vendors based on these criteria as a key basis to 

determine whether to continue to engage the vendors with their services. 

5.2.4 Employee Benefits 

All non-managerial employees in Singapore are covered by the Employment Act, which 

provides basic employment terms and working conditions including contract requirements, 

remuneration, hours of work, overtime, rest days and annual leave entitlement.  

In addition to the statutory benefits outlined in the Employment Act, we provide beyond-

compliance-level benefits to our full-time employees. Examples of these benefits include 

paternity leave and compassionate leave.  

5.2.4.1 Work–Life Balance  

While developing the talents of our employees and providing equal opportunities for them to 

excel are the key drivers for the Company, we also recognise that well-being and 

contentment of our employees pivotal to the success and sustainability of our business and 

performance. Our employees are our most valuable asset, and we appreciate that their 

overall well-beings need to be well looked after in order for them to sustain their performance 

and realise their full potential.  

To support our employees to strike a work-life balance, we aim to create an environment that 

allows our employees to achieve harmony in their personal and professional life. We achieve 

this through the adoption of a flexible approach to work arrangements.  

5.2.4.2 Retirement and Healthcare  

The Company has presence in various geographic locations where there are various local 

laws and regulations on pension and healthcare for employees. Our HR management 

practices comply with such laws and regulations. In Singapore, we participate in the Central 

Provident Fund (CPF) personal savings scheme, which helps employees fund their 

retirement, home ownership, healthcare and education. Under this scheme, monthly 

deductions from employees’ gross salaries are paid into their CPF savings accounts. The 

Company makes employer contributions to these accounts, according to rates stipulated in 

the CPF Act. For more information on the CPF scheme and contribution rates, please go to 

www.cpf.gov.sg.  

5.2.5 Safety and Health in the Workplace 

We are committed to Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) and take every precaution to 

prevent occupational injuries among employees. We believe that optimum work conditions 

not only make our employees safer, but also boost morale. As an essential requirement we 

are in compliance with the Ministry of Manpower’s Workplace Safety &amp; Health Act. In 

addition, we have attained certification for OHSAS 18001 and bizSAFE Star. These well 

recognised standards provide us with the frameworks to manage risks associated with safety 

and health in our workplace. 


 

 

Sustainability Report

5.2.6 Individual Rights  

Respecting and protecting basic human rights are fundamental to all our operations. Labour 

rights, the prohibition of discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, prohibition of 

forced and child labour, and workplace health and safety are all strictly observed within the 

work environment and discrimination and harassment of any kind is not tolerated at the 

Company.  

We also respect our employees’ rights to freedom of association as well as their 

membership of other professional bodies.  

In FY2018, no incidents of forced labour, child labour or young workers were identified 

across the organization, and no human rights-related grievances have been reported. 

 

5.3 Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs 

5.3.1 Our Approach 

Customer service, quality products and the highest level of product safety have always been 

our priorities, with customer satisfaction being the goal of all our corporate activities. 

Customer retention begins with trust, and we place the utmost importance on training our 

employees in customer service excellence as well as in continuously striving to improve the 

quality and safety of our products and services. 

Open and frequent communication and responsive feedback are ingrained into our daily 

activities with customer interaction. In addition to striving for excellence in product service 

and support, we attach enormous importance to data privacy. We have process and controls 

in place over confidential and sensitive data related to our customers such as contracts. 

We have been certified under the ISO 9001 standard for quality management systems. The 

certification has helped us increase the control of our internal processes and the quality of 

our services.  

5.3.2 Customer Feedback and Satisfaction 

We listen to our customers and take their opinions very seriously. We capture our customers’ 

comments for analysis and action. Customer compliments are also tracked so that we can 

monitor where we are getting things right and cascade positive feedback to our employees, 

to their superiors and to our CEO.  

5.3.3 Service Quality and Safety 

Reliability and quality of our products are of paramount importance to us. Health and safety 

of our customers is always our priority. To ensure product safety to our customers, we have 

in place a set of key quality assurance processes and standards, such ISO 9001, OHSAS 

18001, BizSAFE Star, BCA Green &amp; Gracious, to ensure compliance with regulations and 

international standards. Ultimately, we aim for total elimination of product safety incidents so 

as to foster a ‘Safety First’ culture through employee training and quality control.  

 

 


 

 

Sustainability Report

5.3.4 Data Safety and Privacy  

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of great priority to us. We have 

processes and controls in place for handling and communicating sensitive and confidential 

information of our customers such as contracts, customer orders and service delivery orders. 

We strictly observe all local laws and internal regulations applicable to personal information 

protection. 

For the collection and disposal of wastepaper, individual is responsible for the shredding all 

papers, including confidential documents. Such practice established within our office 

provides us with the confidence that sensitive information is protected during the whole life 

cycle of our documents. 

 

5.4 Partnering Our Suppliers 

5.4.1 Our Approach 

As a part of our ambition to realise sustainability throughout our value chain, we extend the 

application of responsible business practices to our local partners and suppliers. We 

recognise that we are only at the beginning of our journey to integrate sustainable business 

practice throughout our supply chain, and we commit in our pragmatic approach to 

continuous improvement. We aim to identify new opportunities for collaboration with our 

suppliers, gradually increase transparency and continue to build shared capacity to minimise 

our indirect environmental and social impacts. 

5.4.2 Supplier Selection 

Our key suppliers are carefully selected through our supplier selection process. When 

selecting our key suppliers, we examine criteria such as financial health, quality of products 

and services, as well as competitiveness of pricing. In addition, we also take into 

consideration of the overall sustainability policies adopted by our suppliers. Our final 

decision on supplier selection is based on the overall assessment which takes a balanced 

view across all selection criteria. 

5.4.3 Supplier Review  

We regularly review the performance of our key suppliers to determine whether to extend 

our partnership with them. During the key supplier review process, we engage with our key 

suppliers to communicate our expectations and mutual feedbacks. Such review process 

ensures alignment of our key suppliers’ services and products to our business requirements 

and sustainability objectives through pragmatic and continuous improvement in our 

partnership with our key suppliers.

6 PERFORMANCE TABLE 

6.1 Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions  

GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2); the underlying measures for direct and 

indirect CO2 emissions calculation are electricity consumption in kilowatt Hours (kWh) and 

fuel consumed. The electricity and fuel we purchase are both from non-renewable sources. 

Our business and function grow over time; the GHG emissions and electricity consumption 

vary. To ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity 

consumption measures over time, we create a GHG emission index and electricity 

consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions 

and electricity consumption for the size of our activities. We normalize the amount GHG 

emissions and electricity consumption by the amount of our revenues which we use as a 

proxy of the size of our activities. The GHG emission index is measured in t-CO2 per SGD 

million and the electricity consumption index is measured in kWh per SGD million.

6.2 Paper Consumption 

We capture the data for paper consumption by how many reams of paper used where one 

ream is equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across 

various paper sizes, such as A3 and A4 papers, we measure the paper consumption by the 

weight of paper used which is adjusted for the various sizes and quality of papers. 

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We 

devise a paper consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the 

paper consumption for the size of our activities. We normalise the amount of weights of 

paper consumed by the amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our 

activities. The paper consumption index is measured in kilograms per million SGD.
