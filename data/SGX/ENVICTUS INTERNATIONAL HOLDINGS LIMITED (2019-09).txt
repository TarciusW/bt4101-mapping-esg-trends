ABOUT THIS REPORT 

 

Our sustainability report has been prepared in accordance with the SGX-ST Mainboard Listing 

Rule 711(B), and in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, Core option, 

for the financial year ended 30 September 2019, which highlights the Group’s commitment to 

undertaking business responsibly and sustainably. We have chosen to report using the GRI 

Standards because it is an internationally recognised reporting framework that covers a 

comprehensive range of sustainability disclosures. Moreover, the structured framework 

promotes reporting a full and balanced picture of the Group’s material matters and the 

management of its impact. This report represents the industry practice for tracking 

performance on a range of economic, environmental, social and governance indicators. 

 

The scope of the inaugural sustainability statement covers material issues arising from the 

daily business operations of Food Services (Texas Chicken and San Francisco Coffee), 

Trading and Frozen Food (Pok Brothers) and Food Processing (Gourmessa and De-luxe Food 

Services) Divisions in Malaysia. It does not include the subsidiaries in New Zealand, Indonesia 

and Dairies Division in Malaysia.  

 

The statement offers an overview of the sustainability approach and initiatives made by the 

Group on how it creates economic value, protects the environment and pursues social 

development in the food and beverage sector.  

 

Given that this is the Group’s sustainability statement, the data collection remains limited to 

selected economic, environment, social and governance indicators that contribute to the 

sustainable development of the Group and are of interest to its internal and external 

stakeholders. The information and data disclosed in this statement were derived from internal 

reporting processes, systems, and records. While the report has not undergone full external 

assurance, due care was taken into the disclosure of the information presented here.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

 

The Group is committed to creating long-term value for the stakeholders. The sustainability 

strategy is to assess and manage the most material economic, environmental, social and 

governance impacts, risks and opportunities arising from the business operations to support 

the sustainable growth of the business. 

 

Materiality assessment is essential to the sustainability strategy. We performed a peer 

benchmarking assessment of sustainability-related disclosures to generate a list of potential 

material matters. Subsequently, each business and department head deliberated and 

prioritised on the most material sustainability matters.  

 

The sustainability focus areas identified as integral to our business are outlined in the table on 

the next page.

WASTE MANAGEMENT 

 

Waste prevention is the best way to manage waste. The Group strives to embrace 

environmental sustainability by managing environmental conservation through adopting 

“Reduce”, “Reuse” and “Recycle” (“3R”) practices. 

 

Pok Brothers 

 

To become more sustainable, we are taking appropriate measures to make our 

warehouse more eco-friendly.   

 

REDUCE the use of single-use Plastic Bags. 

 

Selangor Government initiatives to reduce the use of Single Use Plastic 

have created awareness among our customers. Customers are using 

reusable bag and carton boxes for their purchases. 

 

REUSE packaging materials and plastic pallets in our warehouse.  

By reusing, we can reduce solid waste disposal and the cost of purchasing 

packing materials.  

 

 

 

RECYCLE wooden pallets, broken pallets and other packaging materials 

to minimize solid waste. 

 

 

 

 

 

We have conducted a few on-jobs training to create awareness on the importance of 

recycling in our operations. We have nurtured the habit of sorting and segregating the 

recyclable in the warehouse. 

 

With the reduction in solid waste, we have savings in waste disposal expenses. We have 

recorded a savings of 15% in waste disposal services in FY 2019, compared to FY2018. 

 

The success of the 3R program could be used to convince stakeholders involved in 

waste management about the overall benefits of recycling and its influences on social 

and environmental sustainability for promoting and strengthening recycling activities 

within the organisation.

2019 to turn trash into cash. The amount of dry waste recycling for cash in FY2019 was 

RM2,588. 

 

De-luxe Food Services 

 

Perpetual Target 

Performance for FY2019 

To reduce food wastage to an 

average of 4.0% of total actual 

output. 

156 tons or 4.6% waste from the total output of 

3,385 tons finished goods, lower than FY2018 of 

5.0%. 

To reduce cartons waste cycle to 

0.35% of finished goods output. 

0.38% of finished goods output being recycle in 

FY2019, lower than FY2018 of 0.41%. 

To reduce plastic waste cycle to 

0.4% of finished goods output. 

0.4% of finished goods output being recycle in 

FY2019, lower than FY2018 of 0.7%.  

 

 

Our Waste Management Initiatives: 

 

- 

Food waste recycling: food waste is recycled into animal feed instead of sending 

directly to the landfill. The objective is to reduce the overall waste generation per ton 

compared to the previous year such that it does not exceed 4% of the metric tons 

produced. 

 

- 

Carton waste recycling: carton waste is originated from the finished goods 

packaging from various sources, eg: damage carton from the line or the warehouse. 

We will continue to minimise the carton waste by putting our efforts on operational 

control and quality of carton. 0.38% carton waste of finished goods output was 

recycled in FY2019. 

 

- 

Plastic waste recycling: plastic waste is originated from production line processes. 

There was a 0.4% waste from finished goods output being recycle in FY2019 as 

compared to FY2018 of 0.7% resulted in a satisfactory development. We are 

expected to maintain the current result for FY2020.

WASTE MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) 

 

Texas Chicken (Malaysia) (Continued) 

 

Our Waste Management Initiatives: 

 

- 

Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) - certified paper packaging: Our boxes and 

paper cups are made from FSC. This means that the paper has been sourced in an 

environmentally-friendly, socially responsible and economically viable manner. 

FSC-certified products go through a “chain of custody” from the forest to the 

manufacturer to the merchant and finally to the printer. During the financial year, we 

have purchased 30.8 million (FY2018: 22.3million) pieces of FSC - certified 

packaging for our restaurants nationwide. 

 

It also requires a “management plan” that outlines the scale and intensity of logging 

and renewal operations, in addition to long-term objectives for maintaining the health 

of the forest. 

 

- 

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (“RSPO”) - certified palm oil: The palm oil that 

we use for frying at restaurants is RSPO – certified. This means that the palm oil 

producer complies with good agricultural, social and environmental practice, as 

dictated by the RSPO. During the financial year, our restaurants nationwide used 

690,408 kg (FY2018: 583,000 kg) of RSPO certified palm oil. 

 

- 

Biodegradable plastic bags: We give out biodegradable plastic bags instead of 

regular plastic bags at our restaurants in the Federal Territories. Biodegradable 

plastics are proven to be more environmentally-friendly, as they are able to 

breakdown more quickly when exposed to the elements. During the financial year, 

we have given out 1.1million (FY2018: 752,000) pieces of biodegradable plastic 

bags at our restaurants in Federal Territories. The management aims to extend the 

usage of biodegradable plastic bags to our stores in other states in the year 2022.  

 

- 

Straws Upon Request Campaign – roll out the “straws upon request” campaign at 

all the restaurants in Klang Valley effective January 2019 in support of the 

government’s initiative in reducing plastic waste. During the financial year, our 

restaurants have reduced the usage of plastic straws by 49% compared to the usage 

in FY2018, despite the number of restaurants in FY2019 has increased by 21% 

compared to the previous financial year. 

 

San Francisco Coffee

be replaced with wooden and/or biodegradable items and paper-based materials for 

packaging items like cake boxes, sandwich boxes and takeaway boxes. 

 

No plastic straws: No plastic straws are given out in the store unless requested by 

customers started from January 2019. We target zero usage of plastic straws and 

convert them to biodegradable straws in FY2020. 

 

- 

Bring your own tumbler: RM2 discounts for customers who bring their own tumbler 

to encourage customers to cut down the usage of paper cup and plastic cups. 

 

-

Pok Brothers started the health and safety awareness programme in January 2018. This 

is part of the milestone to success as a company to initiate health and safety to all peoples. 

We are committed to a safe and healthy work environment for our employees, vendors 

and contractors, visitors and communities. We maintain a Zero Harm vision for our health 

and safety programs. 

 

We used a mixture of primary Indicators to assess health and safety performance. These 

indicators include of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) TRIFR and 

the Lost Time Injury ("LTI") based upon the number of incidents per 120 employees (or 

the number of incidents per 285,120 work hours) (FY2018: 120 employees; the number 

of incidents per 285,120 work hours). The key areas of focus and goals for Pok Brother’s 

health and safety programme are: 

 

• People - Create a culture where our people believe and demonstrate that zero harm is 

possible. Pok Brothers will support our people and develop an environment 

where they are healthy, well and safe. 

 

• Process - Develop policies, processes, and procedures and work to eliminate harm 

through proactive management of events and exposure to risk. 

 

• Plant and Equipment - Ensure a healthy and safe working environment, through 

attaining, design, management, maintenance and process 

safety, and critical risk. 

The accountability for performance extends from the management team to individual 

managers, workers and contractors, working on a target to reduce our TRIFR to below 

285,120 hours worked. We shall use the TRIFR of FY2019 as a benchmark for a 

reduction in FY2020. While we are pleased with this progress, we continue to seek 

further improvement by analysing events and sharing corrective actions.
