DEAR STAKEHOLDERS, 



We have always looked beyond productivity and 

profitability to focus on long-term sustainability 

as we endeavour to be a company dedicated 

to leaving behind the best legacy for our future 

generations. The foundation of our sustainability 

approach is an overall risk strategy framework 

for sustainability management with comprehensive 

measures in place governing environmental, 

social and governance matters. This overarching 

framework ensures our business practices adhere 

to our commitment to abide by the fundamental 

principles of sustainability. This commitment 

also matches our customers’ recognition of the 

importance of sustainability in their supply chains. 

As a result, this enhances our reputation and 

relationship among our stakeholders. It also places 

emphasis on embedding sustainability within the 

company that governs our responsible stewardship 

of the environment. Not only does this allow us to 

bolster compliance with all applicable environmental 

laws and regulations, it helps to provide for our 

employees’ welfare at the same time.

Our pledge to focus on sustainability begins in 

our initial production processes and reflects an 

on-going commitment to embed sustainability 

upwards and throughout the entire supply chain, 

by working alongside with relevant stakeholders 

to reduce environmental impacts and to promote 

employee prosperity and safety in the Group.

We believe that developing a strong foundation 

of environmental sustainability is contingent on 

effective planning and a responsible and efficient 

use of raw materials, thereby reducing waste. 

The Group’s success is also dependent on our 

employees; therefore their welfare, safety and 

security are our utmost priority. It is also vital 

that we empower and enable local communities 

in the regions we operate in, especially relevant in 

our low-cost based operations in some of ASEAN’s 

rapidly-developing economies, such as Vietnam. 

At its heart, this sustainability report highlights our 

commitment to ensure sustainability is integrated 

within the company. It outlines our approach to 

sustainability, from the implementation of our 

strategies in our business practices to how we 

encourage performance in the achievement of 

our targets, all while ensuring the safety and 

welfare of our employees. We are driven by our 

sustainability ambitions and remain focused on 

creating long-term sustainable value for all our 

key stakeholders. 

















Our business and our sustainability are based on the same 

fundamentals, an unwavering focus on optimal efficiency and 

superior quality that guarantees customer satisfaction while 

promoting the interests of all our stakeholders.

MESSAGE FROM 



THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS



NEW TOYO INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LTD

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

01




















New Toyo International Holdings Ltd (“New Toyo”) 

is a leading regional supplier and key player in 

the provision of high-quality specialty packaging 

materials to the tobacco, food and beverage, wine, 

liquor and cosmetics industries in Asia Pacific. New 

Toyo was founded in 1975, and its listing on the 

Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange dates back 

to 4 April 1997. Stemming from our headquarters 

in Singapore, we have employees numbering 1,257 

as our operations and activities are positioned 

regionally to strategically provide tailored solutions 

to both our local and global clients. The backbone 

of our solid manufacturing base consists of 

multiple facilities in key geographical locations in 

four countries, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and 

Dubai. This regional presence allows us to provide 

timely support to our customers in these markets, 

promoting our Group’s focus on fulfilling customer 

needs and perfecting the quality of our products.

New Toyo has two core business divisions:

The Specialty Papers (“SP”) division focuses 

on providing laminated and/or coated paper 

and paperboards in reel form or in sheets for 

customers in the food and beverage, alcohol, 

tobacco and cosmetics industries. These products 

are primarily used in the packaging of cigarettes, 

food, beverages, wine and liquor, tissues and 

cosmetics, as well as for labelling and gift-wrapping.

The Printed Cartons and Labels (“PCL”) division 

offers mainly gravure and lithography printing. 

Gravure printing is a specialised high-speed 

printing process essential to the printing of high 

quality paper prints, mainly for cigarette packaging. 

Lithography or offset printing is primarily for the 

supply of folded cartons and labels for rapid selling 

consumer goods.

In addition, the Group has a trading business 

that centres on the sale of raw materials, paper 

products and equipment.

















For the past 40 years, New Toyo has built a reputation as a 

respectable value-added supplier of quality products and 

services. We continuously endeavour to improve productivity 

and align with current trends in the packaging industry as we 

strive to be the supplier of choice for our customers.

ETHOS



















To do our part to Safeguard our Environment and better the lives of 

Our People and the Communities where we Work and Live.

“



“









We require all of our suppliers to read and formally 

acknowledge that they would adhere to the New 

Toyo’s Supplier Code of Conduct policy (“Supplier 

CoC”), so as to ensure alignment throughout our 

supply chain. 

The Supplier CoC encourages our suppliers to 

regard sustainability not only as a set of rules for 

compliance and prompts them to view sustainability 

as a key underlying principle guiding the conduct of 

business. The Supplier CoC provides guidelines on 

numerous issues, from ethics in business dealings 

and adherence to applicable laws and regulations, 

and environmental stewardship. 

Aligning with these principles, we proudly reiterate 

that, according to our expectations, no product of 

ours has been restricted in any of the markets 

where we operate.

It is our belief that a responsible conduct of 

business involves maintaining the right attitude 

and mind-set to enhance ethical and responsible 

behaviour. For additional details on our management 

of raw materials and engagement with suppliers, 

please refer to Materials and Responsible Sourcing 

on page 26.

At New Toyo, we adopt a proactive approach 

towards embedding sustainability practices into our 

business. We continuously evaluate how to run 

our operations in a more productive and efficient 

manner, and how to ensure ongoing engagement 

with key stakeholders in order to grow and nurture 

a positive influence on future generations and 

our relationship with them. We recognise that 

prioritising sustainability issues is crucial to our 

reputation in the market and to our bonds with 

each and every one of our stakeholders.

Our approach 



to sustainability encompasses the 

supply chain in its entirety, from raw materials and 

conversion to the eventual provision of products 

for our customers. Through effective planning, 

this has allowed us to limit the use of natural 

resources needed to produce paper, paper board 

and aluminium foil. This is made possible because 

of our constant strive for improvement and 

therefore the emphasis we place on continuously 

reviewing our processes.

HOW WE CREATE VALUE SUSTAINABLY



OUR INPUTS



HOW WE MANAGE 



 



OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS



In our pursuit to deliver quality products and services, we believe in ensuring that sustainability underpins 

our entire supply chain, from the raw materials we use to the distribution of final products to our 

customers. By integrating sustainability throughout our manufacturing process, we aim to create value 

for our stakeholders through a safe and environmentally sound approach.

Base materials

Proactive planning allows us to obtain base materials 

that closely match the dimensions of our final products’ 

specifications. We thereby reduce wastage and consequently 

consume fewer natural resources.

Other raw materials

We always encourage our customers to use water-based 

inks as they are more environmentally friendly.

Personnel planning

Operational efficiency and productivity are achieved through 

meticulous and well-considered planning and procedures.

Job scheduling

Appropriate personnel and manpower resources scheduling allows 

for sufficient rest for staff between and before their shifts. Healthy 

work practices are instilled in all operations to enhance efficiency while 

also providing for employee well-being and reducing accident and injury risks.

Electricity

Machine maintenance is regularly scheduled with the intent to minimise 

machine downtime and in turn, leads to a reduced carbon footprint. As our 

machineries consume additional electricity when switching from a disconnected 

to a running mode, as compared to running continuously, a reduction in 

machine downtime enable us to minimise environmental impacts.

Water

In comparison with the typical manufacturing plant, our manufacturing facilities 

require less water as our water usage is less intensive than other heavy 

industries. Regardless, environmental concerns remain a top priority at New 

Toyo, and we monitor our water consumption patterns closely to find ways 

to minimise water usage where feasible.

Totalling more than 40 years of experience, New Toyo 

has established a reputation as a value-added provider of 

quality products and services. We uphold our commitment 

to upgrade our technology and to focus on employee 

development through rigorous training programmes that 

enhance productivity.

Mutually beneficial and long-term relationships with 

our customers are built through an unwavering 

pledge to quality and customer service excellence.

The safety and well-being of our employees are 

prioritised by adopting procedures to minimise 

potential hazards and risks.

HOW WE DISTRIBUTE



We reduce necessity for last minute urgent deliveries by providing on-

time and full delivery of orders, consequently limiting our environmental 

impact.

Our customers receive immediate assistance due to our robust 

manufacturing base and facilities strategically placed in the Asia 

Pacific and Middle East. Our regional representation means we 

are always an arm’s reach from our customers. This results in 

reduced distances and travel times for product delivery, in turn 

bringing down costs and minimising our environmental impact.

Quality 

products 

are 

guaranteed as our production 

plants have achieved ISO 

9001 

certification. 

The 

assurance of quality leads 

to a reduced consumption 

of 

resources 

as 

fewer 

internal and external rejects 

translates into savings on 

materials, energy, transport 

and labour needed for 

rectification and replacement.

Licenced 

and 

locally 

registered contractors are 

requisitioned for waste 

disposal to provide proper 

adherence to local laws and 

conditions.

All items are securely packed and enclosed, 

leading to products that retain their quality 

during the delivery journey even when 

facing exposure to the elements. Rejects 

on the customer end are thus reduced, 

which limits consumption of raw materials, 

energy, transport and labour costs incurred 

when replacing damaged products.

ABOUT 



 



THIS REPORT



Subsequent to our first report in 2018, our 

sustainability report serves as a complement to 

the annual report. The reporting scope for financial 

year 2020 covers four countries of operation – 

Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Dubai.

This sustainability report focuses on the three core 

areas of environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) topics prioritised by our stakeholders. 

Detailed information on our material ESG topics 

and the ways our operations interact with society 

and the environment are provided in the following 

sections.

The present sustainability report focuses on how 

the SP division is representative of our material 

ESG topics, with our PCL division reported in a 

separate report by our subsidiary, Tien Wah Press 

Holdings (“TWPH”) as TWPH is listed on Bursa 

Malaysia and subject to Bursa’s sustainability 

reporting requirements1. Absent as well from this 

report, is the Trading division as it functions as an 

intermediary in the buying and selling of materials, 

with minimal sustainability impact. Periodic reviews 

of the materiality of the Trading division as part 

of a due diligence process are considered for 

potential inclusion in future sustainability reports. 

Our stakeholder engagement exercise compiles 

feedback on our material ESG topics gathered 

through various stakeholders, with a focus on 

stakeholder inclusiveness, completeness and 

balanced reporting. For more details, please refer 

to our Materiality section on page 14.

Guided by best practices, our sustainability 

reporting aligns with the Global Reporting Initiative 

(“GRI”) Standards framework for clear specifications 

that ensure reporting accuracy and enable us to 

benchmark our performance against peers. This 

report has been prepared in accordance with 

the GRI Standards: Core option. In aligning with 

previous years’ reports, external assurance has 

not been sought with this choice re-evaluated as 

necessary into future reports where relevant and 

prudent. Sustainability remains a cornerstone of 

our organisation, and we endeavour to embed key 

sustainability-related metrics into our management 

systems. Our ongoing efforts will allow us to 

enhance our sustainability reporting further by 

remaining cognisant of the changing business 

environment and adopting relevant KPI where 

necessary to safeguard our organisation’s long-

term sustainability. 

A complete and transparent perspective of our 

Group’s performance inclusive of environmental, 

social and economic factors can be accessed 

by reviewing this report together with our most 

recent annual report, which provides details of 

our financial performance and our approach to 

corporate governance and risk management. Please 

refer to our 2020 annual report at newtoyo.com 

for further information.

Standard units of measurement are employed 

for this report. Any necessary and applicable 

conversion factors, in addition to the computational 

basis for certain metrics, are provided in respective 

sections.

Please address any queries in connection to this 

report to enquiry@newtoyo.com.

Risk Assessment

As a long-term approach to creating value, sustainability has been increasingly embraced by leading 

corporations. Recognising this, we launched the Sustainability Reporting Committee (“SRC”) in early 2017 

to steer and supervise the growth of New Toyo’s sustainability policies and practices. Guided by this 

implementation, the Board is responsible for the oversight of New Toyo’s overall sustainability practices, 

and the SRC’s updates to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer keep the 

Board abreast of relevant sustainability issues. The Board is responsible for ensuring sustainability is 

upheld in a diligent manner throughout all levels of the organisation. The Board reviews all identified 

material ESG topics when considering decision to New Toyo’s strategic planning and development.

Our outlook on sustainability is enhanced by our well-established governance structures and proactive 

method of risk management. Please refer to the Corporate Governance Statement in our 2020 Annual 

Report for further details regarding our corporate structures, practices and policies.

Risk Management



Our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) structure is a tool that allows us to capture emerging 

opportunities and to mitigate adverse effects of strategic, financial, operational and compliance risks. 

Sustainability topics are identified accordingly in the event that such risks emerge. We recognise that 

each business unit operates within a unique business environment, with a distinctive set of risks and 

opportunities. With this in mind, it is recommended that we follow ERM in spirit and substance, rather 

than in form, while attending to the unique circumstances and requirements encountered by each unit. 

Please see the Risk Management and Internal Controls section in our 2020 Annual Report for further 

information on our practices and policies.

OUR 



APPROACH



Business Continuity Management



At New Toyo, sustainability functions are a vital aspect to progressively manage challenges within the 

community, environment and business to reduce the impacts of adverse events on our people and 

the local community, and to minimise any form of disruption in our supply to our customers.

Business continuity management considers options to:

• 

Ensure our employees’ safety and well-being are of utmost importance

• 

Enable containment actions to control damage to the factory, personnel and surrounding areas 

• 

Reduce harm to production equipment due to emergencies, such as a fire

• 

Minimise disruption to operations and damage to factory resources 

• 

Redirect shipments to alternative production facilities should our customers experience disruptions 

at their site

• 

Facilitate immediate information sharing on matters of emergency response and safety

This plan is checked frequently each year to ensure its robustness and continued viability and reliability.

Ethical Standards



Our clients can be assured that we focus on reliability, dependability and transparency through the 

adoption of ethical standards in our business practices, including all liaisons with clients, suppliers and 

investors. This augments the stability of our entire supply chain, resulting in long-term sustainability. 

Ethical standards are followed strictly, particularly when it comes to anti-competitive behaviour, anti-

trust and monopoly issues and customer privacy. All employees acknowledge that they have read, 

comprehend and follow our Code of Conduct (“Code”) as a way of prompting them to rigorously adhere 

to ethical standards. The Code is a key inclusion in each new employee’s orientation session. This 

covers all measures of compliance with relevant laws, rules and regulations, including matters related 

to insider trading, fraud and anti-counterfeiting. These policies form the basis of our anti-corruption 

ethos as stressed in the Code.

Alongside the Code, our whistle-blowing policy provides an avenue for employees to relay concerns 

connected to possible financial reporting infringements or other relevant matters. Each employee is 

familiarised with this policy on his or her introduction to the company.

All employees are provided means to raise any matters they may have in good faith to New Toyo’s 

designated receiving officer, the chairman of the Audit Committee. An open avenue of contact values 

respect for anonymity and underlines our pledge of a workplace where employees are able to share 

concerns without fear.

Our Employee Handbook provides all New Toyo employees with guidance on ethical matters, particularly 

addressing policies and procedures for data protection and confidentiality. The handbook is acknowledged 

by each new worker as he or she begins with the company.

In line with our expectations, no incidents of non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social 

and economic areas occurred for year 2020. In addition, there were no recorded incidents of breaches 

of customer privacy or losses of customer data, and no legal actions were brought against New Toyo 

anti-competitive behaviour or anti-trust and monopoly practices. We endeavour to continue adhering 

to this perfect record as ensuring compliance minimises the company’s exposure to risk in the form 

of reputational damage.

OUR 



APPROACH

























We foster close relationships with our stakeholders by engaging them on matters of mutual importance 

and prioritised on a long-term basis via multiple avenues, such as regular customer surveys and 

shareholder meetings. To achieve this, stakeholder engagement is upheld as we pledge to position 

stakeholder considerations topmost among the material matters vital to us.

In accordance with our last sustainability exercise, we emphasise five stakeholder groups in relation 

to their influence and involvement with New Toyo:

• 

Customers

• 

Suppliers

• 

Investors

• 

Board of Directors

• 

Employees (represented by management personnel from our SP division units)

OUR 



APPROACH



Materiality



 

Traditional means of financial reporting are enhanced with additional measures as we honour our 

commitment to sharing material information with our stakeholders on important items. Material topics 

have an impact on how stakeholders perceive New Toyo, and can materially impact our long-term 

financial performance; consequently, the needs of stakeholders are prioritised when classifying the 

material ESG topics.

In the materiality assessment performance of year 2017, we worked with an independent sustainability 

consultant, and the survey results indicated our stakeholders were satisfied with our management of 

the material topics. In the formal process of the survey:

• 

Topics were first identified and validated by the Sustainability Reporting Committee;

• 

Stakeholders were invited to rank the topics by their significance; and

• 

Material ESG topics were identified through means of a materiality assessment workshop with the 

presence of the Board and top management.

New Toyo has formulated the 2020 sustainability report according to these ESG topics and in accordance 

with the GRI Principles. 

Targets for material topics identified as High Priority, as well as their corresponding control mechanisms, 

were built to benchmark our performance based on these targets. We are pleased to announce that 

all targets were achieved or maintained. Moving forward, we will continue to monitor and ensure we 

make continuous improvements on our material ESG topics.  

Reviewing the materiality of ESG topics will ensure their continued relevance to future changes in the 

operational environment.

OUR 



CUSTOMERS



Word of mouth marketing via our customers is 

a recognition and validation of our achievements. 

Being a global brand, we strive for excellence in 

customer service. Our highly satisfied and engaged 

customers allow us to stand out in the field of 

our competition and enable us to lead in capturing 

emerging opportunities. Customer tours of our 

operations and audits are welcome as they enable 

our customers to better understand our working 

environment, people and production activities.

An excellent customer experience begins with the 

first point of contact with the customer. As the 

relationship grows, we are able to identify the 

customers’ needs and provide them with on time 

delivery of top-quality products and acclaimed after 

sales support. 

Our goal is a smooth and timely delivery of product 

supply to our clients, but there are times when 

extenuating circumstances impact our operations, 

including those of our customers, and this may 

affect our ability to deliver to the intended 

destinations. Regionally challenging conditions, such 

as floods, earthquakes and political instability, may 

lead to scenarios that impact the supply chain. 

In line with our promise to our customers, we 

continuously monitor safety measures that mitigate 

and alleviate external risks. Our business continuity 

management system identifies contingency locations 

within the Group and our customers’ supply 

chains. The effectiveness of these measures is 

regularly reviewed to allow us to efficiently and 

swiftly activate these procedures if the need arises. 

Such measures include sourcing alternative sites 

for raw materials and rerouting goods to ensure 

continuity of supply. 

Based on our customers’ feedback, the quality 

control department coordinates with relevant 

departments to jointly investigate and determine 

the primary source of the problem, followed by 

recommendations for appropriate actions to avoid 

future occurrences. 

Our goal is to continually engage with customers 

to understand their needs and concerns. This 

is a material ESG topic ranked highly by our 

stakeholders, and vital to ensuring this is our 

annual customer satisfaction survey. In 2020, we 

posted an average rating of 4 out of 5 for our SP 

division on both product quality and the quality 

of packaging for products supplied, and we look 

forward to improving this rating.

















Our customers are continually provided excellent services 

and quality products as we regard their satisfaction to be the 

measure of our success and enhancement of our reputation 

in the field. In order to maintain this status, we continuously 

interact with clients by engaging in proactive relations 

and soliciting feedback on the continuing strength of our 

interconnections. “

Our business units are certified according to 

the ISO9001 Standard to guarantee that our 

products meet the needs of our customers 

while aligning with statutory and regulatory 

requirements:

OUR 



PEOPLE



Our Employees



Our workforce comprised 452 members within our SP division at the end of 2020. This represented 

numbers of male and female employees at 359 and 93 respectively in our workforce. Most of these 

employees are assigned to the production factory floor and are engaged in physical work. Consequently, 

the company attracts a majority of male employees as is often the case in the manufacturing industry. 

(see Figure 1.1)

All workers are full-time employees, aside from three part-time female staff. 24.8% are engaged for 

fixed-term or temporary contracts ranging one and three years. 37.1% of our workforce in Malaysia 

and 100% of our workforce in Vietnam are engaged through collective bargaining agreements. Following 

our interest to safeguard worker rights, we adopt the SA8000 Standard at our Vietnam operations. 

This Standard highlights our aim to develop, maintain and apply socially acceptable practices in the 

workplace.

















At New Toyo, we believe the success of our organisation is a 

result of our employees’ performance. To enhance employee 

satisfaction and effectiveness, we encourage and foster a 

culture of inclusiveness and self-improvement throughout the 

organisation, and offer customised training and development 

opportunities to all our employees.

Employee Attrition and New Hire Rates



Remuneration and career progression opportunities are pegged at competitive rates in order to attract 

and retain our valued staff. In 2020, employee turnovers and new hires were at 12.2% and 9.7% 

respectively. The employee turnover rate decreased in year 2020 due to the group’s restructuring 

exercise which provided upticks in production efficiency.

Overall employee turnover rate decreased by 17.8% in year 2020 (in 2019: 30.0%). This was mainly 

due to operations stabilising subsequent to the restructuring in the prior year (see Figure 1.3), and 

the turnover was largely from Vietnam as a result of cessation of our core paper business operations 

in the 4th quarter of 2019.

OUR 



PEOPLE



Diversity and Equal Opportunity



At New Toyo, we establish a work environment that is inclusive and respectful of each employee, and 

we do not discriminate based on age, gender, ethnicity, nationality or sexual orientation. We evaluate 

the performance of newly hired and present employees in terms of merit, qualifications and work 

performance. The feedback, suggestions and concerns of our employees are highly valued and taken 

regardless of each employee’s position as we strive to create a workplace that enables and promotes 

diversity of talent.

Our business resilience is strengthened by monitoring and responding appropriately to changes in the 

composition of our supply chain. This is only made possible by maintaining a diverse pool of talents 

who feel empowered to contribute their input safely and with comfort and dignity. Emphasising diversity 

and inclusion fosters stronger relationships with our customers as we understand and consider their 

priorities in terms of differing social, ethnic and geographical backgrounds. 

Anti-Discrimination and Harassment-Free Environment



New Toyo upholds a workplace culture of mutual cooperation where each worker is given due respect. 

Absence of discrimination, including all forms of abuse or harassment, is prioritised and stringent 

measures are in place to prevent and settle any incident should it arise. This includes discrimination 

based on age, ancestry, marital status, national origin, race, religion, gender or veteran status, among 

others. Harassment is considered as abusive, insulting or offensive behaviour, such as sexual advances, 

speech with sexual comments and attempted procurement of sexual favours. 

Grievance Mechanism



In the event that an employee experiences or witnesses any form of discrimination or harassment, he 

or she may immediately approach our Group Legal department, and the reporting party is guaranteed 

absolute confidentiality. Our managers undertake timely submission of any incident and will promptly 

inform the company’s senior management or our Human Resources department in the event that an 

incident of harassment or discrimination occurs. The relevant policies are provided for in the Employee 

Handbook Recruitment Policy and Guidelines on Selection and Hiring. Human Resources evaluate hiring 

processes to ensure discrimination is avoided and maintains statistical data that is provided to the 

Group HR Admin Manager quarterly. No reported incidents of discrimination occurred during 2020.













































WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE BETWEEN 

GENDER AND AGE IN YEAR 2020.

OUR 



PEOPLE



Training and Development



At New Toyo, we believe in the importance of lifelong learning. We provide ample opportunities for 

our employees to grow professionally through skills upgrading and training. External and in-house 

career training programmes provide a means for our employees to excel in their roles and achieve 

their highest potential. Financial assistance is provided, which include subsidies for external courses 

should workers choose to pursue opportunities to further enhance their skillsets.

Where possible, we promote employees from within the organisation as and when individuals demonstrate 

the potential, drive and skills to fill emerging positions instead of recruiting externally. Our appraisal 

and profiling process enables us to identify the best candidates to take on leadership roles within the 

organisation. Human capital development continues to be a priority as we continue working on our 

growth strategies and capitalise on opportunities. 

Open Communication 



To ensure a feedback loop between employees and their reporting officers, we established a performance 

evaluation system which provided an avenue for open dialogue. As a result, we are able to provide 

recognition and incentives that commensurate with employee contributions, and encourage our employees 

to improve themselves through a customised training and development programme.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY



We have revised our disclosures to begin aligning with the new GRI 403: Occupational Health and 

Safety 2018 Standard. It is important that we achieve this alignment as the health and safety of our 

employees are fundamental principles at the top of our agenda. Here at New Toyo, we are committed 

to make health and safety an integral part of our culture, and we have strict health and safety policies 

and systems in place to help us achieve that.

We have a robust risk management system that allows us to systematically identify, analyse, evaluate 

and treat different types of risk. This year, in line with the updated GRI standards, we have enhanced 

our system to include the identification of hazards and the assessment of risks, as well as the 

mitigative measures that are in place to eliminate hazards and minimise risks. Please refer to the Risk 

Management section on page 11 of the report for further information. 

As our workforce is exposed to certain risks while operating in the factory setting, we continuously 

review and develop strict operating procedures to anticipate and prevent potential safety risks before, 

during, and after operations. Employees are required to observe and follow all safety and environmental 

regulations outlined, including those detailing the use of necessary safety equipment where relevant. We 

also have stringent requirements for reporting of incidents and injuries, as well as potential hazardous 

situations, which are then systematically investigated and reported on. 

We recognise that it is our responsibility and duty to provide a safe and accident-free work environment 

for all our employees. While we acknowledge that no workplace risk, such as cuts, bruises and sprains, 

may be fully prevented, we make it our top priority to introduce precautionary measures to prevent, 

anticipate and reduce workplace accidents.

We also acknowledge the need to shift our focus from safety-only, towards equal emphasis on safety, 

health and well-being. Safety protocol refresher courses are mandatory and help to ingrain a culture 

of safety in our workplaces across our various operating regions. In addition, we provide necessary 

healthcare benefits to all employees such as annual medical check-ups.

Our low absentee rates speak volumes of our resolute commitment to ensure the highest standards 

and safety within the organisation.























Our absentee rate for FY2020 remained low as we prioritise a healthy lifestyle 

among our employees through promoting and providing relevant information 

on the importance of healthy living. Workplace safety training is regularly 

conducted for our employees upon joining and thereafter. This led to no 

work-related fatalities reported for FY2020.

ENVIRONMENT



We believe every organisation has a fundamental obligation and responsibility towards environmental 

stewardship. The importance of environmental matters and their impact cannot be underestimated. 

We meticulously and diligently ensure we adhere to all environmental laws and regulations. As a 

commitment towards long-term sustainability, we actively obtain feedback from our key stakeholders 

to reduce the environmental impact of our activities.

Zero incidents of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including incidents related to 

air toxins, effluents and waste were noted this year. Our goal is to maintain this admirable performance 

into the future as we further develop our businesses. 

Our machines operate by utilising more electricity when switching from a disconnected to a running 

mode. Consequently, we align our manufacturing cycles efficiently to keep unnecessary starts and stops 

to a minimum. Maintaining the machines on schedule enables us to keep them running optimally while 

reducing the likelihood of a breakdown, thus contributing to a lower carbon footprint. Additionally, we 

advise our customers to use water-based inks as they are more environmentally friendly. 

Our environmental policies and programmes are regularly upgraded to ensure their relevance and 

importance.

In year 2018, we devised a set of KPIs for all relevant business units, encompassing key areas such as 

materials utilisation, work scheduling, machine upkeep and staffing to ensure a high level of efficiency 

is maintained. These KPIs are closely monitored to ensure the standards of efficiency we are known 

for is maintained and improved on.

For our annual sustainability report, we have opted for the eco-friendly option of e-distribution. Copies 

of this report and future sustainability reports can be downloaded from our website at: http://www.

newtoyo.com/investannualreport.htm.

















We endeavour to be responsible stewards of the environment 

and are committed to adhere to and comply with all applicable 

laws and regulations related to environmental issues.

Water



Water scarcity is a complex issue that affects every continent, including tropical regions such as Malaysia, 

Dubai and Singapore, where we base our operations in. With the impact of a rising global population 

compounded by natural disasters brought about by climate change, an increasing number of regions 

are reaching the limit where water services can be delivered at a sustainable level. Though water is not 

identified as a material topic for New Toyo’s operations as our water use is not as intensive as that 

of other heavy industries, we acknowledge the importance of better stewardship of water resources, 

and strive to understand our impact on both the environment and the local communities. For this 

year, we have updated our disclosures to be aligned with the new GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018 

Standard. This allows us to properly assess the impact of our use of water resource across the whole 

product supply chain, particularly in water-stressed regions. 

Water is supplied by municipal water sources for all our operations. The total volume of water used 

in 2020 decreased to 21.2 mega litres, down from 29.4 mega litres in 2019. This was mainly due to 

efficiencies in water usage associated with production activities in Vietnam.

Materials



Our products are manufactured using pre-processed raw materials that do not require our own 

processing of paper pulp. At the same time, we recognise that the production of paper materials 

does leave an environmental footprint that may impact local communities. We therefore implement 

an appropriate resource conservation plan to alleviate this.

As we are a responsible and dedicated company, we steadfastly adhere to the mottos of Our Approach 

and Our Sustainability Ethos and actively seek to limit our impact on the environment through effective 

planning and excellent product delivery. Our products remain of the highest quality, even as we commit 

to a responsible use of materials in our operations. Keeping the number of rejects low (both internally 

and externally), provides a direct impact on material, energy, labour and transportation costs involved 

in replacing faulty products. These measures allow us to minimise wastage and attain an optimal level 

of operational efficiency that enhances value for our customers, shareholders and the environment. 

One of our strategies to reduce environmental impact is the use of recycled paper cores to package 

our materials wherever possible. For the present year, 5.0% (2019: 10.2%) of input materials were 

paper cores made from recycled materials. For our operations, resulting materials of recyclable quality 

amounted to 1,743 metric tonnes (2019: 2,761 metric tonnes) of scrap materials sent for processing 

during 2020.

Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions



Setting the bar high on limits to energy consumption and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 

give us an opportunity to increase operational efficiency, while also being environmentally friendly as 

we find means to enhance energy efficiency and the use of renewable fuel sources. This contributes 

to global efforts in reducing the effects of climate change. Our sustainability reports provide access 

to our headline figures and trend data as we continue to monitor and reduce our carbon footprint.

New Toyo’s internal Energy Conservation Policy and Procedure, published since 2011, is obligatory 

reading for all headquartered employees as it provides a guide on ways our employees can promote 

energy conservation. The guidelines include measures such as setting air conditioning systems to 24°C, 

keeping doors closed, turning off lights and enabling the power management features of personal 

computers, as well as other means to reduce energy consumption where feasible. Following this guide, 

our employees can show their support for our initiative to improve our energy and emissions profile.

Our supply, manufacturing and distribution processes are closely monitored and kept at an optimal 

level in order to control our carbon footprint. For instance, we ensure containers are fully loaded to 

their ideal safe capacity wherever possible. Our energy intensity for 2020 was 472 kilojoules per dollar 

revenue. We endeavour to maintain our future energy usage within a reasonable range.

Our energy intensity calculations include fuel5 and electricity consumed in our factories, with electricity 

consumption counted by our electricity billing. We source fuel in diesel form and biomass (from 

compressed wood tablets), which is considered an environmentally friendly form of energy. 

Where possible, we promote the use of energy efficient products.

We acknowledge the role that our communities play in our success as an organisation, and we give back 

to our communities accordingly. We sponsor charitable activities and committed pledges to non-profit 

organisations devoted to supporting community well-being. Our Sponsorship and Corporate Donation 

Policy guides us as we establish priorities and rationales for sponsorships and corporate donations. 

Non-profits focusing on education, community development, environmental improvement, humanitarian 

and social projects, and economic development rank foremost when receiving our support.

The following requirements are in place for a non-profit organisation to participate:

• 

be recognised as a charity or non-profit organisation and have a charter to that effect;

• 

be tax exempt;

• 

have administrative fees of less than 20% of overall expenses; and

• 

ensure that our support will improve the quality of life in the community.

We will not consider the provision of funding for the following types of requests:

• 

organisations without a non-profit status;

• 

political organisations, candidates or campaigns;

• 

lobbying groups;

• 

sponsorships/donations for individual purposes; and

• 

solicitations that discriminate on the basis of age, race, gender, sexual orientation or national origin.

Our Community Engagement 



We have been making several donations since year 2017 to various non-profit organisations and local 

communities such as National Heart Centre Singapore, Vietnam Red Cross Society, and Xiamen Haicang 

District Education Foundation in our efforts to better society.

















By supporting and maintaining our commitment to local 

neighbourhoods, we build a valued reputation in the regions 

we operate. Over the years, we have given back to our 

communities through various initiatives, such as donations, 

involvement in social work and other community services. “

RESPONSIBLE 



SOURCING



Our major customers have taken measured steps to embrace sustainability and become leaders of 

sustainability. With sustainability gaining priority by our customers, our goal is to meet their high 

standards using appropriate procurement from a social and environmental perspective. New Toyo’s 

Supplier CoC provides guidance in important areas such as ethics in business dealings, adherence to 

applicable laws and regulations, and environmental stewardship, and we welcome our suppliers to 

embed these measures in their business operations.

Ethics in Business Dealings



Ethical business dealings are fundamental to the long-term success of a business. We depend on our 

suppliers to embed measures and mechanisms within their organisation which serve to prevent conflicts 

of interest, excessive gifts and entertainment, bribery and corruption. The company’s established code 

of conduct includes items related to ethical conduct, including conflicts of interest within or beyond 

the Group. It also provides policies on the acceptance of gifts, hospitality or other favours that all our 

employees pledge to abide by and strictly adhere to. 

Finally, to maintain trust in our business relationships, we pledge to always act with integrity, and 

actively seek to promote a transparent and fair business environment in all the regions we operate in.

Enviroment



At New Toyo, environmental matters are regarded with the same importance as all other business 

concerns. All suppliers are required to be responsible stewards of the environment and emphatically 

follow all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We encourage our suppliers to proactively 

source for new methods to limit the consumption of natural resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

and improve waste management.

















As a responsible business partner, we ensure our suppliers 

formally agree and adhere to our Supplier’s Code of Conduct as 

it forms a core principle to guarantee we conduct business with 

appropriate contacts.
