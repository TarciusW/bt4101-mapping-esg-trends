The Group continued to drive its business focusing on higher value-add services and customised metallurgical solutions 

with its range of proprietary NICO brand of metal alloys and material to overcome limitations, and achieve functional and 

high-performance applications, of its customers’ end-user products. The Group’s total revenue in FY2021 increased US$3.3 million 

or 23.3% from FY2020 (US$14.0 million in FY2020 to US$17.3 million in FY2021). This was mainly due to an increase in orders 

from the Chinese companies.

Water Conservation

The Group consumes large volumes of water in its manufacturing processes. The Group draws water from public utilities for 

its business operations. In FY2021, our total water consumption was 30,239 m3 which was a decrease of 20% from FY2020. This 

reduction has led to water saving of 7,790 metric tonnes and has been achieved by using customised in-house wastewater 

treatment.

Water Discharge

Water used as part of our production process is principally discharged via public sewage systems in the countries in which we 

operate. Currently we recycle a small amount of our water consumption. All waste water is mostly discharged through a defined 

discharge point into the local sewer.

Since 31st January 2019, our electroplating production facilities in China started to implement customised in-house wastewater 

treatment and water recycling systems to increase cost savings from the fees charged on wastewater discharged per tonne. By 

using this method, it is expected that the average wastewater discharged will reduce from 11 tonnes to 8 tonnes on every tonne 

of metal alloy being produced.

Our electroplating production facility began to be used in November 2019. Compare with actual usage of 1,889 metric tonnes 

as of December 2019, our water usage in FY2021 has reduced by 23% which was within the estimated range of 20% to 40% 

cost savings disclosed earlier. In FY2021, the Group recorded a decrease from 30,993 metric tonnes in FY2020 to 20,740 metric 

tonnes of actual water usage, resulting in a usage saving of 33% from the regulated fee charged for every tonne of wastewater 

discharged from the electroplating production facility.

In China, any unlawful discharge into the public sewage system will result in significant monetary fines. During FY2021, there was 

no reportable incident of any penalty for unlawful discharge of wastewater. The Group is currently reviewing additional recycling 

initiatives and may add more water recycling equipment at our production facilities.

The waste generated at our manufacturing plants included scrap metal in addition to wastewater used during the production 

and electroplating processes. All waste produced is disposed by our respective manufacturing plants in accordance with the 

prevailing laws and regulations and disposed through approved recycling centres, landfills or incineration plants. In the case of 

scrap metal, we engage specialist contractors to dispose of the same.

In FY2021, approximately 12 tonnes of non-hazardous waste generated by our subsidiaries in China was recycled which waste 

included waste paper core and waste film. The Group produced 33.9 tonnes of non-hazardous waste in total during FY2021.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021




During FY2021, there was no signification non-compliance with applicable environmental laws and/or regulations in the countries 

where we operate.

SOCIOECONOMIC



FY2021 recorded no reportable incidents of significant fines due to non-compliance with applicable labour laws and/or regulations 

across the Group. The Group also aims to minimise its impact on the environment and takes seriously its obligations under 

applicable environmental legislations and standards of the regions in which we operate.

INDIRECT 



ECONOMIC IMPACTS



The Group’s operations have contributed to the economies of the countries in which it operates. The Group is a part of the 

community in the places in it operates, and has created employment, up-skilled local workforces through training and on-the-job 

experience and contributed to tax revenues.



NICO STEEL HOLDINGS LIMITED

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021



NON-COMPLIANCE WITH 



ENVIRONMENT LAWS AND/OR REGULATIONS






The Group recognises the crucial role that its suppliers play in achieving its overall success. We are dependent on our suppliers 

and it is in the Group’s interest that our suppliers are successful, whilst supplying quality components at acceptable price points.

In FY2021, the Group managed to make a breakthrough into the domestic Chinese market, especially in the field of mobile 

communications, garnering orders from dominant Chinese brands and working directly with brand owners and key module 

suppliers. Amidst the pandemic, demands for electronic communication devices continue to grow which in turn create demand 

for all components up and down the supply chain of the Group’s business. This bodes well for the Group.

LOCAL 



SUPPLIERS



The Group strives to keep it supply chains short and local. However, most of the components used in the Group’s products, notably 

steel plates are sourced from large multi-national corporations and so it is not always possible to source locally. Furthermore, 

the need to remain competitive may lead to the sourcing of components from the most cost-effective suppliers, which may be 

located off-shore.



NICO STEEL HOLDINGS LIMITED

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

SUPPLY CHAIN AND 



PROCUREMENT POLICY






The Group has been awarded “SCS Recycled Content” certification for aluminium alloy A5052 R80 and A1060 R80 with achieving 

minimum 80% pre-consumer recycled aluminium content by SGS Global Services (“SCS”) through our subsidiaries located in China.





In FY2021, Nico Steel became the first company in China that can supply aluminium with a recycled content of 80% and above 

to achieve carbon neutrality and carbon footprint control solution for the device markets. This is particularly important due to 

regulations established by the European Union (“EU”) Metals Ecosystem Directive requiring high-tech electronic products to 

have a minimum of 50% recycled metal content before being imported into the EU by year 2025. Global brands such as Apple, 

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Facebook, Samsung and Sony are swiftly taking action in incorporating this new 

directive into their products. Hence, global brand users can apply for carbon credits by using Nico Steel’s SCS certified recycled 

materials in order to enter the EU market after year 2025.

In addition, by year 2030, major top brands in United States and Europe will have to switch their usage of current materials for 

ecologically recycled materials in order to achieve carbon neutrality, which the R80 recycled aluminium content currently provided 

by Nico Steel can achieve. With these certifications, Nico Steel can have a first-mover advantage and become the preferred supplier 

of designated recycled materials for our customers.
