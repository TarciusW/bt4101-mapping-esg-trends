BOARD 

STATEMENT



Dear stakeholders,

Sustainable growth has become increasingly important 

as we continue to grow and expand our business. 

The sustainability of our business practices, together 

with transparent disclosure, has become increasingly 

imperative, especially since the release of the “Comply 

or Explain” rule for sustainability reporting by the 

Singapore Exchange (“SGX”). In the long-term, we 

believe that our focus on sustainability will place us in 

a better position to enhance value for our shareholders 

while looking after the needs of the broader stakeholder 

community. 

Pursuant to this belief, the Board of Directors 

(“the Board”) takes into account material 

environmental, social and governance 

(“ESG”) factors in its strategic formulation. 

Setting the tone at the top, the 

Board works closely with the senior 

management to identify and oversee 

the management and monitoring 

of the material ESG factors. The 

publication of this inaugural 

Sustainability Report marks the 

continuation of our ongoing 

efforts towards sustainable 

development, and serves as 

a communication tool for all 

our stakeholders.

Listed on SGX, Golden Energy and Resources Limited 

(“GEAR”) is primarily engaged in the exploration, mining, 

processing and marketing of thermal coal. Our coal 

production activities are done through our subsidiary, 

PT Golden Energy Mines Tbk (“GEMS”). On 31 August 

2018, the acquisition of PT Barasentosa Lestari (“BSL”) 

was completed by GEMS.  As a result of the successful 

acquisition of BSL, GEMS’ coal mining concession 

areas increased from approximately 42,904 hectares 

to approximately 66,204 hectares in South Kalimantan, 

Central Kalimantan, Jambi (a province in Sumatra) 

and South Sumatra Basin, Indonesia. Collectively, 

GEAR owns the rights to mine more than 2.7 billion 

tonnes of thermal coal resources* with coal reserves 

currently estimated at more than 1.02 billion tonnes as 

at 31 December 2017. For more information on GEAR,

ABOUT 

THIS REPORT





We are pleased to present our inaugural Sustainability 

Report for the financial year ended 31 December 

2017 (“FY 2017”), with comparison to data from 

FY 2016, where applicable. This report details our 

policies, practices and performance with respect to 

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) topics 

which are most material to our business and our 

stakeholders. Some policies and practices are group-

wide while some are specific to our subsidiary, GEMS. 

The performance data disclosures in this inaugural 

Sustainability Report are mainly focused on the 

coal mining operations of our subsidiary, PT Borneo 

Indobara (“BIB”) in which GEMS has 98.0951% interest. 

Within the Group, BIB bears the largest impact on our 

sustainability performance as its production volume in 

FY 2017 constitutes more than 85% of our Group’s 

production volume in FY 2017. We plan to include 

other operations in future reports should they become 

significant. This report has been prepared with reference 

to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards and 

GRI Mining and Metals sector supplement. We have 

chosen GRI Standards for our reporting framework, 

due to its internationally-recognized, robust guidance 

and universal application, which enables comparability 

of our performance. We have not yet sought external 

assurance on the disclosures made but will consider 

doing it as our reporting matures over time.  As 

we embark on our sustainability journey, we look 

forward to your continued support and appreciate 

any comments, feedback or queries. Please address 

them to Ms. Pauline Lee, Chief Financial Officer, at 

paulinelee@gear.com.sg.

FOCUSING ON 

WHAT MATTERS MOST





Establishing which ESG matters are material for GEAR is crucial, to enable us to focus on specific areas of 

stakeholders’ interests, to grow the business and align future sustainability efforts. To achieve this, we conducted 

our first materiality assessment exercise in 2017 with guidance from external sustainability consultants. The 

process as detailed in Figure 6 takes into account GRI’s Principles for Defining Report Content which focuses on 

the material matters determination process. The results are laid out in Figure 7.

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTION OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS





Emergency preparedness is at the cornerstone of 

our efforts towards protecting our stakeholders. We 

strive to anticipate and be sufficiently ready to handle 

all possible types of emergency should they occur. 

Guided by our Emergency Readiness and Response 

Policy, we take measures to prevent and contain 

emergency situations to minimize damage to our 

assets, environment and stakeholders. 

To ensure smooth implementation of mitigation actions 

in the event of an emergency, our Mining Head 

established an Emergency Response Team (“ERT”) 

consisting representatives from all concession areas. All 

members of the ERT are equipped with a Deployment 

Card, which contains guidance on steps to be taken in 

the event of an emergency, administrative forms and 

an emergency checklist. The Deployment Card serves 

a dual purpose: to ensure that the ERT is coordinated 

and well-prepared to handle an emergency, and to 

ensure that other employees can replace ERT members 

who are not present at the site during the emergency.

• Natural disasters (e.g. flood, windstorm)

• Emergency simulations are done for all types of possible 

emergencies as identified by the Head, Safety and Environment 

(“HSE”) Manager and as approved by the Mining Head at the start of 

each year

• The frequency of the emergency simulations is as follows:

•  Full-scale (covering all concession areas) : At least once a year

•  Limited scale (covering selected areas) : At least twice a year

•  Administrative simulations : At least once every three months

• All employees and visitors are briefed on potential hazards at the 

mine, as well as steps to be taken during an emergency, including 

communications protocol and evacuation plans

• ERT is required to attend emergency simulations

• Evaluation is done at each emergency simulation to assess the 

readiness of GEAR and the ERT in handling emergency situations

• Audit is carried out to ensure that all procedures relating to 

emergency preparedness exercise have been done and evaluated 

for areas of improvement

• The results of evaluation and audit are submitted for GEMS’ 

Management’s review

In FY 2017, we conducted 11 emergency simulations involving 149 employees and contractors. Some of the 

findings noted from our emergency simulations include the need to replenish first aid supplies, establish a dedicated 

radio channel for emergency, and increase staff awareness on standard operating procedures (“SOP”) during 

emergency. For instance, some workers were not familiar with the muster points and the emergency alarm sound, 

as the sound of the alarm was similar to that of the conveyor belt’s alarm. Owing to the continuous improvement 

of our emergency response plans, we did not face any business disruptions due to emergency in FY 2017.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTION OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS

Figure 10: GEMS’ OHS committee 

Occupational health and safety (“OHS”) is deeply ingrained in our corporate ethos, which is centered on human 

capital. Mining operations invariably pose health and safety risks to our employees and workers, but we leverage 

on the highest safety standards to drive operational excellence and achieve sustainable growth. Overall OHS 

management is administered by our HSE Department, whose structure is shown in Figure 10. Our approach 

towards managing occupational health and safety includes a suite of policies (Figure 11) which is reviewed 

periodically to ensure continued relevance and compliance with the most updated regulatory requirements.

GEMS’ Policies

Summary

General Mining 

Safety and 

Environmental 

Protection 

Policy

 

X We recognize that mining is a high-risk activity that needs to be carefully managed 

to prevent dangers, accidents, occupational diseases and negative impact to the 

environment.

 

X We develop work programmes which are based on continuous improvement and 

covering all our operational activities, taking into account HSE considerations.

 

X All work programmes are documented and evaluated periodically.

 

X We are committed to engaging all workers within our concession, including 

contractors and subcontractors, in implementing HSE initiatives and complying with 

regulation standards.

 

X We strive to manage our contractors effectively and procure requisite goods and 

services to uphold mining safety.

HIV / AIDS 

Policy

 

X This policy is developed pursuant to the Indonesia’s Ministerial Decree no. 68 (year 

2008) about Prevention and Mitigation of HIV/AIDS at Workplace.

 

X The objectives of this policy are to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS among workers 

and their families, and to safeguard the workers’ rights.

 

X We are committed towards:

• Raising awareness about HIV/AIDS among all workers;

• Exercising non-discriminatory practices towards workers who are infected with 

HIV/AIDS;

• Offering free choice for workers to undergo HIV/AIDS screening without any 

compulsion and maintaining confidentiality of test results;

• Offering health services for infected workers; and

• Safeguarding the health and safety of all other workers.

Use of Drugs 

and Alcohol 

Policy

 

X Zero tolerance towards drugs and alcohol in our work facilities.

 

X We are committed towards:

• Complying with the Indonesian government’s laws regarding the use of drugs and 

alcohol; and

• Achieving a drug-free and alcohol-free work environment.

 

X To achieve this, we take the following measures:

• Conduct random and periodic checks on workers, contractors and business 

partners who are within our work facilities;

• Grant rest to workers who are suspected to be under the influence of drugs and 

alcohol; and

• Terminate employment contract with workers who are found to distribute and 

consume drugs and alcohol at our work facilities.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTION OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS

We believe in a collaborative approach based on a 

sense of ownership in cultivating OHS culture among 

all our employees and workers. To that end, we 

conduct compulsory safety trainings and daily safety 

toolbox meetings for all employees and workers at the 

mining site. In FY 2017, 230 employees took part in 

36 safety training sessions. To raise awareness in all 

levels of our organization, we organized National OHS 

Month with various programmes to raise awareness 

about OHS to employees and contractors in FY 2017.

Part of the participation from employees and workers 

to identify and mitigate OHS exposures is incident 

reporting. All our employees and workers are 

encouraged to report safety incidents, including near-

misses, using a standard incident reporting form. All 

incident reports are investigated using a Root Cause 

Analysis (“RCA”) to identify the root cause of each 

incident and implementation of corrective actions 

to prevent reoccurrence. To maintain the quality of 

investigation, at least one member of the investigation 

team has gone through RCA training. The HSE 

Department categorizes all incidents based on the 

type (health, safety or environment) and degree of 

severity (light, heavy or fatal). All reported incidents are 

subsequently recorded at our centralized HSE portal 

for data analytics and audit trail.

As part of our approach towards monitoring and 

managing our safety performance, we set an internal 

target (“threshold”) for our safety statistics. The 

threshold for work-related fatality is set at zero at all 

times, and we have consistently achieved this in FY 

2016 and FY 2017. In addition, we set thresholds for 

lost time injury frequency rate2 (“LTIFR”) and lost time 

injury severity rate3 (“LTISR”) based on best practice in 

the industry, as reflected in the audit scoring scheme 

from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. 

Our LTIFR and LTISR statistics are shown in Figures 12 

to 13.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTION OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS

There was no work-related injuries in Singapore office 

for both years. On the other hand, we regret that there 

was an increase in LTISR in FY 2017 at BIB operation 

due to one incident. This one-off accident translated 

into more lost days than that in FY 2016. Nevertheless, 

our LTIFR and LTISR were maintained below the 

thresholds in both years.

To maintain the rigor and effectiveness of our safety 

management system, we conduct annual audit for 

it in accordance with Regulation no. 38 year 2014 

about Mining Safety Management System by Ministry 

of Energy and Mineral Resources (Mineral and Coal 

division) of Indonesia and OHSAS 18001. In FY 2017, 

the audit covered our operations and 17 contractors. 

The lowest score across various criteria4  was 64% and 

highest was 96%. Through the last cycle of audit, we 

identified some areas of improvement, such as data 

management, reporting consistency and quality of 

investigation. To improve our performance in FY 2018, 

CASE STUDY: HSE PORTAL

In the past, incident reports were stored manually 

and in different forms without a centralized 

database. With data being stored in various 

formats, there was a lack of data consistency 

and therefore it was difficult to perform quick 

and reliable data analytics. In addition, there 

were occurrences of human error in data inputs, 

resulting in inaccurate employee assignment. To 

resolve this, we developed a web-based HSE 

portal that provides standardized forms for input of 

HSE data in FY 2017. Ever since this project went 

live, we experienced reduced processing time and 

improved data reliability.

we plan to organize safety investigation trainings for 

our frontline supervisors, and to standardize safety 

reporting templates for our contractors.

In FY 2017, the families of truck drivers and heavy 

equipment operators who are working for BIB’s 

contractors were invited to the BIB concession 

site.  Through these site visits, we aim to raise 

awareness about the high risk exposures faced 

by those truck drivers and heavy equipment 

operators.  We strive to build relations with their 

families and encourage better rest management at 

home.  We plan to use the data collected regarding 

the number of accidents due to fatigue of truck 

drivers and equipment operators in FY 2017 to 

set a baseline and to measure the success of this 

project in FY 2018 and beyond.

LAND MANAGEMENT

NURTURING THE ENVIRONMENT

Even as we hold the License to Borrow and Use of 

Forest Areas (Izin Pinjam Pakai Kawasan Hutan or 

“IPPKH”) in our concession area, we recognize our 

role in restoring the function of the natural environment 

through reclamation and rehabilitation. Having mined 

the resources, we are committed to returning the 

mined land to its original state and/or its intended 

purpose. We make it a practice to develop a mine 

closure plan which includes a reclamation plan for all 

our concession areas even before we commence our 

mining activities. This reclamation plan is approved by 

the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (Mineral 

and Coal division), and serves as a guide for our 

rehabilitation efforts.

Based on the reclamation plan, the Ministry of Energy 

and Mineral Resources (Mineral and Coal division) 

conducts independent audit on the reclamation 

progress at our concession, on an annual basis. In FY 

2017, we obtained a score of 60% and above5  during 

the audit, without any findings of non-compliance. 

Figure 14: Elements of GEMS’ land reclamation policy

• Mined land shall be returned to its original 

state and/or its intended purpose.

• The size of reclaimed area shall be equal to 

the size of mined area.

• Top soil shall be stored appropriately for post-

mining revegetation purposes.

• Reclamation process shall be monitored and 

managed to happen as planned.

• Disruptions to drainage patterns due to mining 

activities shall be rectified.

• Erosion shall be minimized during and after 

the reclamation process.

• Revegetation shall be done using the 

plant species as listed on the Environment 

Management Plan that is submitted to the 

Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources 

(Mineral and Coal division).

• During reclamation, the road access to the 

reclaimed area shall be closed.

Due to the increase in production activities, there was over 68% increase in the size of land disturbed and not yet 

rehabilitated at the end of FY 2017 compared to that at the beginning of the year. However, these areas will be 

rehabilitated at the post-mining stage in compliance with our mine closure plans.

Based on BIB’s Reclamation Plan for 2014 to 2018, which was submitted to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral 

Resources (Mineral and Coal Division), we target to reclaim 197.5 hectares of land area, and as at end FY 2017, 

and we have reclaimed 81% of the said land area.

5The land reclamation audit was conducted based on three broad criteria – land management, erosion and sedimentation 

control, and revegetation.

As part of our rehabilitation efforts, we set apart 2.49 

hectares of land for nursery. From 2014 to 2017, we 

have also replanted approximately 112,900 trees as 

part of our rehabilitation efforts. To equip our staff with 

knowledge on the latest rehabilitation practices, we 

also sent close to 40 staff and contractors to attend 

the Revegetation Technology Training organized by 

Bogor Agricultural University (Institut Pertanian Bogor 

or “IPB”) in 2016. In 2017, we invited the Technical 

Head of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources 

(Mineral and Coal division) of Indonesia to provide a 

training about local regulations and statutory reporting 

of land reclamation progress to all our employees and 

contractors. We rehabilitated an area of 46.7 hectares 

in our concession area in FY 2017.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

NURTURING THE ENVIRONMENT

Our mining operations are energy-intensive, requiring 

large amount of energy to produce and transport 

coal. Besides affecting our financial bottom line, this 

generates substantial amount of greenhouse gas 

(“GHG”) emissions into the atmosphere. On the other 

hand, both Singapore and Indonesia have pledged 

their commitments6  to reduce GHG emissions as 

per the Paris Accord. As a group of companies which 

operates in both countries, we understand that we 

have a part to play in achieving these national targets 

by consuming energy efficiently. 

In Indonesia where our main operational activities are 

carried out, the government encourages the use of 

B15-graded biodiesel by all mining companies in its 

effort to achieve its GHG emissions reduction target. 

While this is a recommendation instead of a regulation, 

we have taken gradual steps to follow it. In FY 2017, 

we had started to consume a mix of petrodiesel and 

B10-graded biodiesel to support our operations. 

Some of our contractors were still using B10-graded 

biodiesel which was sourced from smaller-scale 

suppliers. In order to meet our biodiesel consumption 

in FY 2018, we are currently engaging larger suppliers 

to supply higher-graded biodiesel to our contractors 

and community-owned enterprises. In addition, we are 

engaging our major equipment manufacturers to share 

their evaluation and confirm that biodiesel does not 

impact the equipment’s performance and useful life.

In FY 2017, we consumed 2,929 terajoules (TJ)7 of 

energy derived from petrodiesel, biodiesel and gasoline 

(used to operate our mining equipment, vehicles and 

on-site generator sets) and 384.3 MWh of electricity. 

This amounted to over two-fold, and a 35% year-on-

year increase, respectively, attributed by the increase 

in our coal production. Similar trends were observed 

in our Scope 1, Scope 2 and biogenic emissions 

accordingly.

6Singapore committed to reduce its GHG emissions intensity by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030, while Indonesia committed to 

reduce its GHG emissions by 29% from business-as-usual scenario by 2030.

Coal mining activities invariably release a large amount 

of dust and pollutants (in the forms of nitrogen oxides 

and sulfur oxides). As our mine is located in close 

proximity to local villages, it is imperative that we 

implement air quality management programme to 

prevent undesirable health and safety impacts to our 

employees, contractors and the local community. To 

that end, we set targets which are in line with the 

upper limits set by the Indonesian government and 

put in place a monitoring process, where we engaged 

an accredited external laboratory to test the quality of 

ambient air from the generator sets in our site every 

quarter and on a half-yearly basis. Figures 20 to 25 

summarize the test results for FY 2016 and FY 2017.

Despite our best efforts to maintain our air quality 

throughout the year there was a spike in dust emissions 

(ambient air) in the first two quarters of FY 2016 in 

Kusan mining area, and in the first two quarters of FY 

2017 in Kusan and Girimulya mining areas because 

there were a lot of heavy equipment movements at 

these locations during the sampling periods, due 

to higher production activities. However, the dust 

emissions (ambient air) stabilized in subsequent 

periods, and we continue to monitor the emissions to 

maintain compliance at all times.

WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

NURTURING THE ENVIRONMENT

The local community surrounding our concession area is dependent on the nearby water bodies to serve their 

day-to-day needs. Hence, we hold a responsibility to ensure that the effluent that we discharge does not pollute 

the water bodies by complying with the applicable regulatory limits. Our approach to managing our effluent is 

encapsulated in Figure 26 below.

Figure 26: GEMS’ approach towards effluent management

Effluent treatment and monitoring

• A sedimentation pond has to be constructed at each mining area prior to the commencement of mining 

activities, to control acid drainage and prevent erosion.

• GEMS’ effluent is treated at the sedimentation ponds before it is discharged.

• The pH, turbidity, acidity and metal content of effluent is monitored daily by GEMS and monthly by an 

accredited laboratory.

• The test results are submitted to the local Governor once every quarter.

• In addition, on-site testing is conducted by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (Mineral and Coal 

division) annually.

• Whenever the water quality reaches its upper limits, the effluent is treated using pH adjuster, caustic soda 

and soda ash at the sedimentation ponds.

• During treatment activities, water pumping at the sedimentation ponds is stopped and the ponds’ spillway 

is closed to prevent the release of water into the surroundings.

• Dredging is done periodically to remove collected sediment, which is transported to a dedicated disposal 

area.

Figure 27 to Figure 36 present the quality of effluents 

from our mining operations in FY 2016 and FY 2017. We 

ensured all required parameters (i.e. total suspended 

solids, mineral contents, average pH values) under the 

upper limit set by the local government for both years, 

and we target to maintain this good performance 

in the next year. The measurements are done on 

effluents which have undergone treatment (before 

being released to the nearby water bodies) and are 

done monthly by an external laboratory. In addition, 

we also monitor the water quality of rivers surrounding 

our site. However, the data about nearby rivers’ water 

quality is not within the focus of this report, as there 

are a lot of factors affecting the data, including the 

presence of other mining companies nearby the 

rivers. We continued striving to improve the quality of 

effluents arising from our mining activities. For instance, 

we engaged professional consultants from Bandung 

Technological Institute (Institut Teknologi Bandung) 

to develop a more effective water treatment process 

at our concession area. In FY 2017, the consultants 

conducted site visits and took samples for preliminary 

analysis. The project is slated to complete in FY 2018.

As part of our commitment towards accountability, 

the local community can submit any feedback 

on our sites’ effluent directly to GEMS’ External 

Relations Department. In the event that a feedback 

is received, GEMS’ Chief Operating Officer and 

Mining Head will investigate the situation and meet 

the feedback provider, if required. In FY 2017, we 

received a complaint from the local community about 

contamination at a river near our concession. Upon 

receiving this complaint, we sampled the river water 

from our site to the point of concern for testing and to 

identify the source of contamination. Subsequently, we 

mapped out the sampling results and presented it to 

both the management and feedback provider. It was 

concluded that the contamination was not caused by 

our operations.

SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT

NURTURING THE ENVIRONMENT

Effective solid waste management is integral to our operations, as it creates both environmental and economic 

value. We comply with our Waste Dumping Policy to manage the solid waste that we generate through our 

operations. As a result of our open pit mining activities, we produce a significant amount of solid waste, especially 

in the form of overburden8. Proper storage and disposal of overburden minimizes environmental damage and 

safety hazards from structural failure of overburden pile, and enables land rehabilitation at the post-mining stage.

Figure 37: Elements of GEMS’ Waste Dumping Policy

Waste Dumping Policy

• Waste dumping can be done in two ways:

–  Direct dumping – dumping of material using a haul truck at the dump crest 

 

–  Indirect dumping – dumping of material using a haul truck at a safe distance away from the dump crest, 

to be pushed by a dozer towards the dump crest 

• Solid waste management begins by identifying potentially acid forming (“PAF”) and non-acid forming (“NAF”) 

substances.  

 

 

 

 

 

–  PAF should not be placed at the ground surface 

 

 

 

 

–  NAF may be used to encapsulate PAF, with a minimum thickness of 10 meters

• Mud is to be mixed with other material prior to dumping, to maintain slope stability.

• Overburden and other waste can only be dumped at specific dumping locations as assigned by the Mine 

Planning and Development (“MPD”)  department, taking into account geotechnical and geoengineering 

considerations.

–  Overburden is also reused for land reclamation before rehabilitation works are carried out

• The active and inactive dumping areas are monitored by our geotechnical engineers at all times to prevent 

land slides.

In FY 2017, we generated 51,542,376 Bank Cubic Metres of overburden, an increase of more than 86% from 

FY 2016 due to an increase in production activities in FY 2017. This overburden was used to reclaim approximately 

61.7 hectares of land for rehabilitation.

8Overburden refers to the topsoil removed for accessing the coal or resources mined below, commonly measured in Bank 

Cubic Metres.

LOCAL COMMUNITIES





At GEMS, we regard community empowerment as our company’s responsibility. As our mines located at developing 

region in Indonesia, we are presented with opportunities to meet the existing needs of local communities around 

us and helping them to improve their standards of living. We respond to these opportunities by implementing 

various Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) activities which are in line with our strategic priorities and in 

tandem with our operational activities. Figure 38 summarizes our approach towards CSR management.

EMPOWERING 

LOCAL COMMUNITIES



We regularly engage the local community to 

understand their changing needs and design strategic 

CSR programmes that target these needs. Our 

ultimate aim is to help the local community attain 

financial independence and enhanced standard of 

living, achieved through partnership and environmental 

protection. Formal and informal education to build 

the capacity of the local community, as well as skills 

upgrading programmes to develop the local economy, 

form the backbone of all our CSR efforts. Besides 

rendering support in the form of resources, commitment 

from our management and the stakeholders lay the 

foundations for our CSR strategy. 

In line with Regulation no. 41 (year 2016) about local 

community development as issued by Indonesia’s 

Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, we aligned 

our CSR activities with the pillars of the CSR blueprint 

of the local governor.

OUR HUMAN

PROFILE OF OUR WORKFORCE

OUR HUMAN CAPITAL

In FY 2017, we saw almost 9% increase in our 

workforce as a result of the increase of our production 

activities. These employees are mostly located in 

Indonesia, where our mine is located in. In FY 2016, 

only 8 out of our 281 employees were located in 

Singapore, whereas 15 out of our 306 employees 

were based in Singapore in FY 2017. 

68.6% of our employees were hired on a full-time 

basis with permanent contract, enabling us to equip 

them with the skillsets for their growth. As our mining 

operations are also heavily supported by contractors; 

we extend the same expectations for talent and 

capabilities in our employees to our contractors. We 

understand that talent with the right technical skills 

is limited in supply, thus we allow transfer of some 

employees with the right skillsets to support our 

contractors on the ground. In FY 2017, we transferred 

102 employees in Indonesia who were below 

“Supervisor” level, but showed good performance and 

had undergone internal trainings (safety, environment, 

operations, etc.) to our contractors. Through the 

transfer, they were able to impart their skills to other 

contractors, and in turn, improve the performance at

our site. In FY 2017, there were 117 turnover (inclusive 

of 102 employees transfer) which were more than 

offset by 143 new hires in the same year.

While our gender breakdown indicates a higher 

proportion of male than female, this can be attributed 

to the fact that the nature of mining activities 

traditionally attracts more male workers over female 

workers. Nevertheless, we strive to promote gender 

diversity in our operations.

LOOKING AFTER OUR EMPLOYEES

OUR HUMAN CAPITAL

One of our core values is “Loyalty”, where we advocate a sense of fraternity and pride as members of our group, 

among all our employees. At GEAR, we believe that retaining and developing our employees are as important as 

attracting the top talent into our organization. As an employer, we look after our employees’ welfare by offering 

competitive remuneration packages, medical insurance and other benefits.

As our mine is located away from the city, a lot of employees at the site live away from their families. To 

maintain and enhance our employees well-being, we provide facilities beyond their basic needs. Besides 

providing free accommodation, meals and medical facilities to our employees, including an on-site clinic, 

we also provide various recreational facilities, such as karaoke set and sport facilities. In addition, we 

provide travel allowances for our employees to return home and meet their families during their breaks 

and holidays. Although these employees are located out of our headquarters, we offer equal training 

opportunities at the site, such as computer courses for workers and technical and safety training for 

technicians by sending trainers to site, to ensure that our employees continue to upgrade their skills. 

To foster a sense of community among our employees and workers, we organize various recreational 

activities regularly.

In FY 2017, GEMS conducted its first group-wide employee engagement survey. Facilitated by an 

independent consultant, this survey saw 90% participation rate by employees across various employment 

categories, locations, age groups, etc. Through this survey, we gathered insights about areas where 

we have done well, such as leadership direction, provision of resources for employees and training 

opportunities. At the same time, we identified areas of improvement. As a follow-up from this survey, we 

shared the survey results to our employees and continued the conversation with them to identify how we 

can better enhance our employee engagement and satisfaction. We also rolled out various action plans 

which are monitored on a regular basis. Given the success of this survey, we plan to hold similar surveys 

periodically in the future.

At GEAR, we encourage continuous improvement in 

our employees performance through various training 

opportunities which hone both their technical skills 

(e.g. business process, project management) and soft 

skills (e.g. people skills, leadership). We introduced a 

focused competency development programme called 

the “five pillars certification” programme. Targeted at 

assistant managers and above, the training covers 

financial, legal, geology, engineering, information 

technology and business management courses, to 

equip the participants to be all-rounded leaders. In 

FY 2017, we started to encourage more training for 

our employees in Singapore by providing an annual 

training budget, as evidenced by the increase in 

average training hours in Singapore. However, there 

was an overall decrease in average training hours 

for our employees in Indonesia because there was a 

vacancy for the Learning and Development Head role 

in FY 2017. This role was eventually filled subsequently, 

and the Company remains committed to the continued 

support of our employees’ training needs.

All our employees go through a fair performance 

appraisal process twice a year, where they are assessed 

for their performance in achieving personal targets and 

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) both quantitatively 

and qualitatively. Employees whose performance 

rating is good or excellent are eligible for promotion to 

a higher level subject to their scope of responsibilities in 

the next level and the organization’s needs. Contrary to 

the traditionally singular promotion path, we make our 

promotion more inclusive through a dual progression 

path. Our management level employees can undergo 

not only structural promotion (from team leader to 

Business Unit head), but also professional promotion 

(from “specialist” to “acknowledged expert”).

LABOR RELATIONS MANAGEMENT

OUR HUMAN CAPITAL

Being in a labor-intensive industry, we seek to develop 

good industrial relations at all times. This helps to 

create a conducive working environment and prevents 

undesirable operational disruptions. At GEAR, all 

workers are encouraged to communicate to their 

supervisors any issues that they face, so as to arrive 

at a mutually acceptable solution. In the event that the 

issue remains unresolved, the issue will be escalated 

to the Industrial Relations team for further discussions 

until a mutually acceptable solution is reached. As a 

reflection of a fair grievance mechanism and the good 

industrial relations that we have built with our workers, 

there were zero cases of strikes and lockouts in our 

operational areas in FY 2017. We are in full compliance 

to Indonesian labor laws, as concluded in annual audits 

by the Ministry of Labor and Transmigration.

GOVERNANCE AND ETHICS

Figure 46: GEAR’s whistleblowing mechanism

GEAR has in place a policy that provides an avenue for every employee and also external stakeholders (such as 

suppliers) to report any wrong-doing or suspected wrong-doing that they may experience or notice at GEAR. The 

details of the process in place is described below.

Reporting mechanism for any wrong-doing or suspected wrong-doing / fraud involving 

employees as well as GEAR’s business associates (consultants, vendors, contractors and/or 

any other parties with a business relationship with GEAR)

• To develop, promote and maintain high standards of corporate governance within GEAR 

and its subsidiaries

• To provide assurance to whisteblowers (employees and non-employees) that they will be 

protected from reprisals or victimization for whistle-blowing in good faith and without malice 

• Concerns are submitted to the Chairman of GEAR’s Audit Committee through e-mail, 

phone call or in writing (details can be found in GEAR’s website)

• Within 14 days of raising a concern, the whistleblower will be informed about who has been 

appointed to handle the matter, how s/he may contact the appointed person, and if s/he is 

required to provide further information

• Upon completion of investigation, the investigation officer will submit a full report of findings 

to the Audit Committee Chairman who will deliberate on the follow-up actions

• GEAR will release a copy of the report to the whistleblower, including findings and follow-up 

actions

• GEAR endeavors to resolve the matter within one month from the receipt of the concern

WHAT

WHY

HOW

As a testament of our sound corporate governance and ethics, no incidences of corruption, fraud or non-

compliance with all applicable laws and regulations were reported in FY 2017, a record that we aim to maintain 

every year. In the same year, our subsidiary, GEMS, received “The 9th IICD11  Corporate Governance Award” in 

the category of top 50 largest publicly listed companies by market capitalization, for the 5th consecutive year 

since 2013.

11IICD refers to Indonesian Institute for Corporate Directorship, a non-profit organization which advocates best practices of 

good corporate governance and directorship in Indonesia.
