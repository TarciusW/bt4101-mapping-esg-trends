Duty Free International Limited / Sustainability Report 2019 

 

 

 

 

INTRODUCTION 

 

Duty Free International Limited (“DFI” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”), a 

duty free retail specialist in Peninsular Malaysia with over 40 years of experience, has 

established a premium travel retail brand “The Zon” that is strategically and extensively 

located across all leading entry and exit points in Peninsular Malaysia. DFI has created 

and defined its own unique and exclusive travel retail concept that offers travellers an 

extensive premium selection of international brands - imported duty free beverages, 

tobacco products, chocolates and confectionary products, perfumery, cosmetics and 

souvenirs. 

 

DFI’s core value is to provide travellers with an exclusive duty free shopping experience 

beyond expectations by having the highest standards of customer service, retail execution 

and exquisite product offering. 

 

This Sustainability Report 2019 (“Sustainability Report”) is DFI’s second annual 

sustainability report which highlights the progress and achievements of the Group on our 

commitment to working alongside our valued stakeholders to build a sustainable 

business. The Group strives to achieve sustainable growth with our business model 

through operational excellence by capitalising on the strength of our human capital and 

strategic alliance with our business partners as well as being committed to highest 

standards of customer service while minimising the environmental impact from our 

operations.  

 

There has been heightened focus amongst stakeholders for the use of the natural 

resources in a manner that is extensive yet sustainable. The use of clean, renewable 

energy is one of the most important actions companies can take to directly reduce their 

carbon footprint upon the environment and to move towards a more energy efficient future. 

The Group completed its installation of Photovoltaic (PV) panels in May 2018 at one of its 

major outlets to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels and increase its exposure to solar 

power. Our initiatives on energy saving via adoption of technology have contributed to 

lower energy consumption and in turn, smaller carbon footprint. We will continue our 

commitment towards implementing strategy to build a sustainable business. 

 

This Sustainability Report aims to provide our stakeholders, namely, our customers, 

partners, investors, employees, local communities, non-governmental organisations, and 

governments, with a transparent account of how we address the sustainability topics in 

relation to DFI during the current financial year.

DFI’s Code of Conduct (the “Code”) instils a sense of good business practice and responsibility, 

which drives a culture of integrity and honesty across the Group. The Group strives to uphold the 

highest standards of professionalism and cultivate exemplary corporate conduct.   

The Code sets out expectations for all employees of the Group. It emphasises the need for 

employees to conduct themselves in a manner beyond that required by mere compliance with the 

law. Similarly, the need to comply with the Code extends to our business partners to ensure 

professionalism and compliance with applicable laws. 

In addition to highlighting the principles of honesty, trustworthiness and conscientiousness, the 

Code covers the following matters:

employees may address their concerns in writing to the Audit Committee Chairman of the Group. 

These guidelines and procedures are readily accessible via our intranet or through physical 

briefing by respective Heads of Departments or Outlet Managers.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

 

At DFI, engaging with our stakeholders is a priority and is done continuously to ensure timely 

actions are taken to address key concerns that are critical to our business. By understanding their 

expectations and responding to their concerns, we also strive to strengthen stakeholder

sustainability efforts throughout our activities.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

 

 

Material sustainability topics are economic, environment and social (EES) risks and opportunities 

that affect our stakeholders’ decisions and impact our business. The identification of material 

sustainability topics enables us to focus our efforts and allocate resources to address the high 

priority topics of the Group.  

Our material topics were identified through the following materiality assessment process: 

 

Diagram 3: Materiality assessment process 

 

In FY2018, a materiality assessment workshop was conducted to identify and prioritise 

sustainability matters that are material to DFI as detailed in Diagram 3 above. This process 

involved our heads of key business functions and key management personnel, while taking into 

consideration our stakeholders’ expectations. This year, we reviewed the FY2018 materiality 

matrix and deemed the identified material topics remained relevant as there were no significant 

changes in our stakeholders’ concerns and business environment throughout the year.  



Identification

Preliminary EES issues were identified based on the GRI 

Standards, desktop research and peer benchmarking. 

A customised questionanaire with a list of stakeholders and 

material sustainability topics were circulated to internal 

stakeholders to shortlist topics that are relevant to DFI. 



Prioritisation

During the materiality assessment workshop, key internal 

stakeholders were asked to rank shortlisted material topics 

according to its:

- Significance to DFI 

- Importance to our stakeholders



Validation

A summarised ranking of the material topics were presented to 

the Board of Directors for discussion and validation. 

Five (5) material topics were selected for reporting in FY 2018.

These material topics were deemed relevant in FY2019.

OUR ECONOMIC 

DFI’s presence as a travel industry retailer provides it with a strategic position in the global travel 

market. The rapid increase of tourist arrivals (25.8 million of tourist arrivals in Malaysia and 

MYR84.1 billion receipts in 2018 alone, according to Tourism Malaysia) into the country provides 

a prime opportunity for the Group as shopping is a key element of the travel experience for many 

passengers. Throughout the years, we have established an extensive market presence with 

branches at all major entry and exit points in Peninsular Malaysia as illustrated on page 2 of our 

Annual Report FY2019. These branches are centrally managed in Kuala Lumpur and Penang, 

Malaysia. 

On 8th August 2018, we acquired a new subsidiary, Brand Connect Holding Pte Ltd (“Brand 

Connect”). Brand Connect group of companies is engaged in the business of marketing and 

trading, wholesale and retail distribution of beverage products across countries in the Asia Pacific 

region. The acquisition of Brand Connect group of companies by DFI is intended to develop and 

grow the Group’s distribution business as well as to expand the Group’s market operations 

beyond the current sales channels in the duty free market of Malaysia to include the duty paid 

market across Southeast Asia. 

In pursuit of sustainable profits through revenue generation, DFI has contributed to its 

stakeholders through various activities, including generating employment opportunities and 

servicing taxes. Diagram 6 below illustrates the Group’s value distribution to its different 

stakeholders. Further insights into the Group’s economic performance for FY2019 can be found 

on page 42 to 122 of our Annual Report.

A positive customer experience is crucial in driving sustained growth in the travel retail industry. 

This year, we implemented the Mystery Shopper programme across all our retail outlets to assess 

and elevate our customers’ shopping experience. The criteria measured include customer 

service, cleanliness of store, product display, product knowledge, shop outlook and selling skills. 

We gained insights into areas of improvement as we strive to continually serve our customers 

better. We will continue to implement operational strategies in our commitment to improve the 

quality of our service to our customers.

OUR PEOPLE 

 

 

DFI’s continuous growth is built on the strength and talent of our workforce. We strive to provide an 

inclusive and conducive working environment for our employees. Echoing this commitment, we strive 

to conduct our business and operations in a manner that promotes diversity, employee well-being, 

and development of our people. The Employee Handbook, which is provided to every employee upon 

onboarding, sets out behavioural standards expected of all employees as reflected in our day-to-day 

operations. 

 

 

We treat all our employees equitably and without prejudice in providing training, career progression 

and retention, regardless of gender, age or religious backgrounds. Diversity in our team enables us 

to harness diverse knowledge, skills sets and experience to better engage and understand the unique 

needs of our stakeholders and strive towards providing better customer experience.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

We consistently emphasise merit-based evaluation in our recruitment and employment practices. 

As such, we now count 825 employees of varied ethnicities, gender and age whose demographics 

reflect the customers we aspire to serve. In FY2019, upon acquisition of BCH group, 40 

employees were added to DFI Group’s total employees, of which 15 were expatriate and 25 were 

local. Out of the total 825 employees, 38% comprised the below 30 age category, highlighting our 

endeavours to recruit young, local talent for succession planning and to deliver new and exciting 

in-store experiences for our travelling customers.

We recognise the importance of encouraging women 

inclusion at the workplace and having fair female 

representation in the Group. Women account for 

52% of our workforce in FY2019, as compared to 

53% in FY2018. Despite the marginal decrease, this 

statistic 

highlights 

the 

balance 

in 

gender 

representation across the Group as it is above the 

50% threshold. Additionally, female representation in 

senior management positions has grown as we now 

have a total of 32% of women in senior management 

positions, as compared to 27% in FY2018.  

 

 

 

We strive to compensate our employees fairly and competitively, in line with the relevant labour laws 

in efforts to attract and retain our employees. This is further demonstrated by the improved retention 

rates during the year in review.  

We also extend ample consideration towards our employees’ personal commitments, such as their 

parental responsibilities. We offer both maternal and paternal leave to eligible employees and 

encourage them to utilise this benefit to promote bonding time with their family, while improving their 

overall well-being.

Investing in our workforce through training and education is fundamental in fostering continuous 

employee development while improving productivity. At DFI, we provide opportunities for our 

employees to grow and develop in their professional and personal capacities. These trainings 

support employees to gain a greater understanding of their responsibilities within their role, which 

in turn builds their confidence to keep up with the evolving needs of the industry.  

In FY2019, the Human Resource department rolled out a series of training initiatives to equip our 

employees with the tools they require to enhance DFI’s brand. These initiatives seek to equip our 

workforce with necessary capabilities and competencies required to carry out their day-to-day 

duties.

Echoing our commitment in advancing our employees’ professional development, we carry out 

annual performance reviews to assess their current competencies and provide them with 

customised career direction at DFI. Through utilisation of the Balanced Scorecard, supervisors 

are able to objectively analyse employees’ performance and development to align their 

performance with the Group’s goals. 

 

Diagram 19: Performance and career development review process 

For FY2019, 100% of DFI employees have received their performance assessments for the period 

under review.  

 



Target setting 

Each department 

will set its annual 

performance 

targets and key 

performance 

indicators for each 

employee, which 

ultimately aligns to 

the Group's vision. 





Consultations

Employees may 

enquire and obtain 

advice on their 

performance 

expectations from 

their immediate 

superior. Their 

compentencies will 

be assessed and 

training needs will 

be identified. 





Appraisal

At year end, a one-

to-one appraisal 

session will be 

conducted 

between 

immediate superior 

and the employee 

to evaluate work 

performance 

against the targets 

and expectations 

set.





Compensation

Any high achieve 

will be rewarded 

with lucrative 

monetary benefits, 

whereas for any 

under performer, 

further training will 

be provided to 

bridge his or her 

capability levels.

OUR ENVIRONMENT 

 

 

 

Climate change awareness across the globe and government policies are driving a shift towards 

sustainable and eco-friendly power generation in combating climate change impacts. Our energy 

consumption across our operations contributes to the generation of carbon emission. Cognisant 

of this, we are committed to progressively minimising our reliance on non-renewable sources of 

energy and using energy efficiently. 

 

 

In FY2019, we continued to monitor 

and track our energy consumption 

while measuring the progress of our 

efforts year-on-year.  

We noted an overall 5% decrease in 

electricity consumption in FY2019, 

mainly contributed by the installation 

of solar panels at our Bukit Kayu 

Hitam outlet on 2nd May 2018. 

Consequently, our energy intensity 

decreased to 6.28 MWh/employee as 

compared to 7.14 MWh/employee in 

FY2018.

Note: *Consumption of the Melaka outlet was recorded at below 1%. 

 

 

Managing our environmental footprint consists of making continuous improvements in energy 

efficiency. Malaysia has committed to achieving 20% renewable energy by 2025. In echoing this 

commitment, the Group is gradually shifting its focus towards renewable energy sources. Given 

the nature of our operations, a tangible influence DFI can have in reducing energy consumption 

is through energy saving adaptations at our outlets and solar panels installations.  

On 2nd May 2018, we installed the Group’s first solar panels at our Bukit Kayu Hitam outlet. It has 

contributed to a cost savings of approximately RM20,955 per month since its installation. Albeit 

this is 3% below our projection, our estimated cumulative savings have amounted to RM251,460 

for this year.

In the coming years, we aim to expand the installation of solar panels to our other outlets as we 

progressively transition to the use of renewable energy.

Principles and Commitments 

 

DFI strives to reduce reliance on non-renewable sources of energy in light of climate change. 

 

Monitoring and Control Systems 

 

Energy consumption monitoring 

We monitor all outlets’ monthly energy consumption as shown on Page 24. 

 

Solar panel performance tracking system 

The installed solar panels’ performance is tracked using vendor’s photovoltaic (PV) system, 

Sunny Portal. This system allows DFI to access and analyse key system data remotely and in 

real time. The monitoring mechanism measures both the overall assumption of internal power 

and external energy as well as the generation of power for self-consumption. 

 

These data are available on a daily, monthly and yearly basis and includes historical data. The 

system is able to detect minor deviations and resolve it quickly. There is also a built-in community 

portal for DFI to benchmark our PV system data with other peer users.
