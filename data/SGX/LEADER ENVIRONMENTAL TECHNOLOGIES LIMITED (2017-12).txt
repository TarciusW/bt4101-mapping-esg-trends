Message from our Executive Chairman and CEO 

 

In line with the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) Sustainability Reporting Guide and the Global 

Reporting Initiative Standards (“GRI”), we set out hereunder our first Report.  

 

Leader Environmental Technologies Limited (“Leader” or the “Group”) is engaged in the 

business of providing environmental protection systems primarily for industrial wastegas and 

wastewater treatments. Given the nature of our industry, sustainability is an integral part of our 

business strategies, objectives and policies. The Group endeavours to be an environmentally 

and socially responsible corporation known to provide innovative environmental solutions and 

deliver steady sustainable performance. We strongly believe that understanding and 

responding to the needs and concerns of our key stakeholders are of paramount importance 

in achieving consistent collaborative success in our business. To us, it is about sustaining the 

landscapes of tomorrow. 

 

Guided by the principles from SGX and GRI, the Group has identified our key stakeholders 

and defined the material sustainability matters which are deemed important to these key 

stakeholders. For our maiden Report, we adopted a phased approach and will focus on critical 

issues relating to four (4) key factors – product excellence, business discipline, occupational 

health and safety, and human capital development. This Report seeks to discuss the initiatives, 

policies and procedures we have implemented in our sustainability reporting.   

 

We are committed to our sustainability strategy. We understand the importance of 

measurement and will set specific targets for the evaluation of our sustainability performance 

in the next phase of our sustainability journey. The Group acknowledges that a lot more can 

be done and we welcome constructive feedback so that we can continue to fine-tune our 

processes, policies and strategies as we chart our path towards business sustainability.

Our Business 

We provide environmental protection solutions in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).   

While our head office is in Changchun, Jilin province and our operations are focused mainly 

in the Northern China region, we serve a wide variety of clients spanning over different sectors 

and industries in the region.  

 

Please refer to Table 1 for some of the sectors serviced by us.  

 

Table 1 - Markets served by Leader Environmental Technologies Limited 

 

One of our competitive strengths lies in our proven and tested in-house developed 

technologies for the treatment of wastegas, which enables us to offer customer quality 

products to meet the stringent emission requirements imposed by the PRC laws and 

regulations. 

As disclosed in our annual report, we are keen to penetrate into the Shanghai and Fuzhou 

markets and may set up representative offices so that we can be closer to our prospective 

customers.

Scale and structure of our Group 

In the financial year ended 31 December 2017, we have over 75 employees primarily working 

for two active companies providing one-stop solutions for environmental protection. All 

employees are on full-time basis with the majority of them based in the PRC. Due to the nature 

of our business, our projects are site-based resulting in our employees comprising about 70% 

male and 30% female. During the financial year ended 31 December 2017, our Board of 

Directors consisted of five (5) directors, of whom three (3) were males and two (2) were 

females. Currently, our Board of Directors consists of three (3) male directors and one (1) 

female director. We believe that diversity goes beyond gender and while we believe that we 

have an appropriate mix of skills, gender, experience and knowledge in our Group, we will 

formulate and formalized our diversity policy.   

Our net sales was approximately RMB 119.8 million and our total capitalization comprised 

approximately RMB 44.4 million from equity and RMB 130.0 million in debts as at 31 December 

2017.  During the financial year, our revenue streams came mainly from our 12 industrial 

wastegas contracts and 3 industrial wastewater contracts. For a breakdown of our group 

structure, highlights and details of our financial performance, please refer to our 2017 annual 

report. 

Notable Memberships 

We are a member of the Provincial 

Environmental Protection Industry 

Association of Jilin province. The 

association solicits opinions on 

local laws and regulations and 

relevant governmental decisions 

and laws promulgated by the 

National People’s Congress and 

propose necessary amendments; 

participates in legislative research 

and research projects organized by 

the special committees of the Provincial People's Congress and the working organizations of 

the Standing Committee; and gathers feedback in respect of  legislative proposals and 

requirements including feedback on difficulties encountered during the implementation of laws 

and regulations, and proposes amendments and improvements.  

This membership allows us to be involved in and stay up to date on any potential introduction 

or changes of legislation that may impact our key stakeholders.  

 

 




 



7 

Our Supply Chain 

The Group's main suppliers consist of subcontractors and suppliers of raw materials of our 

business operation. We are committed to building a sustainable and responsible supply chain 

through our procurement policy which provides guidelines on the selection of suppliers and 

procurement process management. We will perform background checks on the suppliers’ 

reputation, financial position, product quality and delivery lead time before entering into any 

transaction with them.  

Subcontractors are normally engaged for scavenging, excavation, installation and other civil 

engineering works that are required for our projects. Our subcontractors are selected based 

on, amongst others, their experience and expertise in the field and service quality.  We have 

implemented policies and procedures over the selection of suppliers and to manage 

operational risks from our supply chains. 

The majority of our contracts with 

suppliers and subcontractors are 

entered into back-to-back with our 

contracts with customers. The 

payment terms of our suppliers for 

raw materials and subcontractors 

correspond generally with the 

payment terms of our contracts 

with our customers, which are 

generally based on progress or 

milestones achievement of the 

project.  A retention sum of 

between 5% and 10% of the 

contract value is usually provided 

as a form of guarantee for a period 

of one year against the quality of 

parts supplied or subcontracting 

services 

rendered. 

A 

similar 

retention sum is also provided for in 

our contracts with our customers.  

For certain contracts with suppliers, we may also request for extension of the defects liability 

period of certain components of the systems supplied (i.e. fabric filter bags) to a longer period 

(i.e. two or three years).  




 



8 

Generally, no specific credit term is extended to us by our suppliers and subcontractors. For 

major contracts with suppliers entered on a back-to-back basis with contracts with customers, 

it is stipulated that payments to suppliers will only be made when we are paid by our customers. 

Hence, if there is any delay in the payments from our customers, payments to some of our 

major suppliers can be delayed without any penalty. However, for purchases of customised 

items, we will place an advance before the suppliers will commit to the production of the 

customised products. 

Most of our projects’ requirements vary 

and hence, our source of raw materials and 

services 

from 

suppliers 

and 

subcontractors is dependent on the 

requirements and location of each project. 

As such, we may not generate similar 

purchases in terms of types of raw 

materials/services and volume with the 

same supplier or subcontractor. 

We 

enter 

into 

long-term 

purchase 

contracts with some of our suppliers for 

common raw materials in order to secure 

better terms. Hence, for project specific 

supplies, procurements are expected to 

vary within and across the financial years. 

 

 

 

 




 



9 

Our Approach in Determining Material Factors 

We first determine the scope of our sustainability reporting by determining our material factors.  

We use a 4 Step Approach to identify and assess potential factors. 

 

 

 

Identification 

We identified a list of sustainability issues based on our evaluation of Leader’s sustainability 

on economic, environmental, social, and governance matters.  These sustainability issues 

were identified based on research on various sources of information including GRI, 

stakeholders’ feedback, laws and regulations, market expectations, group policies and 

strategies etc.  

 

 

 

 






 



10 



 

Prioritisation and Validation 

We conducted a materiality assessment with our key stakeholders and prioritised the potential 

significant ESG factors based on the feedback received from the key stakeholders. This 

process enabled us to understand the key stakeholders’ concerns and to determine the 

economic, environmental and social issues of greatest concern to the key stakeholders. This 

allows us to refocus and channel resources into areas where it matters most to our key 

stakeholders.   

 

Materiality 

The ranking of our material ESG factors was performed based on two parameters- importance 

to key stakeholders and impact on Leader’s business.  The list of ESG factors are depicted in 

the ESG materiality matrix below. 

 

  ESG Materiality Matrix 

 

 

Based on our approach, we will focus our efforts in 

sustainability strategy and implementation on our top four (4) 

material ESG factors. 

 

 

 






 



11 

ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENT 

Product Excellence 

 

Sustainable innovation is at the heart of our strategy on product excellence. We have 

developed and patented numerous technologies relating to the treatment of wastegas which 

give our customers more options to choose from in order to meet their specific needs and 

requirements.  We see innovation as one of our key strengths and to stay at the forefront as 

the one-stop environmental solutions provider, we will commit more resources on research 

and development to improve on our 

existing solutions to meet the increasingly 

high expectations of our customers and 

satisfy the more stringent requirements of 

the PRC government. A list of our notable 

systems and technologies can be found 

on page 4 of our 2017 Annual Report and 

reproduced here:

Chinese companies which fail to comply with environmental laws now face heavier penalties 

and longer suspension. The increase in environmental regulations and tighter enforcement 

from the PRC government has created two main impact on our business environment. Firstly, 

there are many more projects available for tender. Secondly, there are stricter inspections by 

the PRC government thereby creating even more emphasis on our product quality and 

excellence. 

 

 

 

The natural synergy of our core products with environmental sustainability enables us to 

maximise the results of our efforts by aligning our sustainability goals with our business goals. 

Our sales figures and targets are good indicators of our business and sustainability efforts. As 

at Financial Year 2017, the breakdown of our group’s revenue by business segment is as 

follows. 

 

 

 






 



13 

Sales Targets 

The bulk of our revenue in FY2017 was currently generated from 12 wastegas treatment 

contracts and 3 wastewater treatment contracts. The Group intends to increase its 

participation in tenders for industrial wastegas and wastewater contracts. We also seek to 

improve on our credentials and build our track records so that we can partake in larger scale 

government contracts.   

 

The strong emphasis by the PRC government to curb pollution coupled by the tightening of 

environmental policies with more on-going inspections have boosted the environmental 

industry.  Accordingly, more contracts are made available for tenders which gave us the added 

optimism that the Group can increase the number of contracts to be performed in FY2018.

Business Discipline 

 

The increased environmental regulation has resulted in an increase in the number of projects 

available for tender. However, this has also created a significant level of risks and opportunity 

costs when selecting and allocating our resources.  

 

Given that some of the contracts may take more than twelve months to complete, hence, it is 

important that we exercise financial discipline during customer and supplier assessment. Non-

financial factors are equally taken into consideration when assessing both our customers and 

suppliers.  

 

Customer Assessment 

 

Our criteria for customer assessment include an analysis on the return on investment (ROI), 

profit margin, and customer’s financial track record and reputation. However, due to the current 

dynamic business climate, our criteria for customer assessment are updated for continued 

relevance where appropriate. We also monitor debtors’ aging very closely and follow up on 

outstanding trade receivables to push for more prompt collections. 

 

Supplier Assessment 

 

Our sales contracts are long-term commitments and hence, the success of our timely delivery 

to our customers is critically linked to our success in maintaining a reliable and sustainable 

supply chain. 

 

Prepayments to our suppliers form a huge portion of our total assets. Items purchased from 

trade suppliers must be customised to meet the needs of specific projects, hence our suppliers 

require advances prior to commitment to the production of the customised items.  Some 

customers also impose a requirement on the project bidders to make advances to their 

customer-appointed supplier(s) during the bidding stage or upon signing of the contract so as 

to ensure that we are capable of providing the initial required capital to facilitate the completion 

of the project. 

 

 


 



15 

Our supplier assessment criteria are based on both financial and non-financial factors to 

ensure a holistic assessment. As environmental sustainability is the driving force behind our 

business, we consider environmental sustainability very seriously within our supply chain. 

 

 

 

Prior to the appointment of potential new suppliers, our purchasing manager does customer 

evaluation by performing the following: 

a. Obtain either the supplier’s management accounts or audited financial statement to 

assess and evaluate their financial positions to ensure they have the financial means 

to fulfil their commitments; 

b. Conduct visits to suppliers to perform detailed checks and observations of their 

establishments. Factors considered in the checking of potential new supplier’s 

establishment includes sustainability, reputation, reliability, quality, and delivery lead 

time; and 

c. Conduct due diligence by engaging with other business contacts who have business 

dealings with these potential suppliers for reference checks.  

 

We will only work with established suppliers in the city or province where the projects are 

based.

SOCIAL 

Occupational Health and Safety 

 

Occupational health and safety of our employees and workers form an integral and material 

part of our business activity as well as the foundation for the sustainable growth of the Group.  

 

Being in the industry to design, construct and install industrial wastegas and wastewater 

treatment systems, it is evident that our employees and workers are our greatest assets 

because they play pivotal roles in achieving our Group’s objective of attaining business 

sustainability.  The Group relies on our team of employees and workers to execute and deliver 

a given task in a timely and efficient manner.  Hence, we recognise our responsibility and the 

utmost importance of providing and promoting a safe and healthy work environment for our 

employees and workers to stay healthy, productive and motivated to thrive and deliver results 

effectively and efficiently. 

 

The Group has direct control on the provision of a safe working environment for our employees 

and our workers based at our project sites, including workers under the employment of our 

subcontractors. Our occupation health and safety management system applies to our 

employees and all workers based at our project sites. 

 

 


 



17 

To ensure that occupational health and safety are managed properly, the Group has the 

following measures in place: 

a. Health and Safety Department 

b. Established relevant policies: 

i. 

公司安全生产责任制度 (Health and Safety Policy) 

ii. 

安全生产处罚条例 (Safety Regulations and Penalties) 

iii. 

施工现场安全管理制度 (Site Safety Management System) 

iv. 

安全生产事故隐患排查治理制度 (Incident Investigation Policy) 

v. 

对分包单位的安全生产管理制度 (Safety policy with regard to subcontractors) 

c. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities over employees and workers’ safety 

d. Operational procedure and requirements 

i. 

Pre-project commencement site evaluation 

ii. 

Daily safety briefing and inspections 

iii. 

Requirement over reporting of sites’ inspections and incidents 

e. Target of zero-accident set for all project managers as aligned to the Group’s goals of 

having zero-accident at all sites managed by the Group. 

 

 

 

 




 



18 

Policies 

The ownership of the Occupational Health and Safety policies resides with the Health and 

Safety Department and are applicable to all employees as well as workers assigned to the 

Group’s projects, including subcontractors’ workers. These policies are reviewed either 

annually or when there are substantial changes to the operating environment to ensure that 

the policies stay relevant to operational needs. 

 

Commitments, Goals and Targets 

In line with our beliefs that our employees and workers are the key driving force to achieve our 

economic and environmental goals, Health and Safety Department is set up to ensure 

operations are carried out with the safety of our employees and workers assigned to our 

projects in mind. Policies created by the department is to facilitate the goals of having zero-

accident at all sites managed by the Group. 

 

Responsibility and system in place 

Our Occupational Health and Safety system is based on the principle of “管生产必须管安全”、

“安全生产人人有责” (Safety should always be a part of project management and workplace 

safety is the responsibility of everyone) and the operational principle is based on “一级抓一级、

一级对一级负责” (a safeguard whereby responsibility is to be shared across the chain of 

commands).  

 

With these two guiding principles, we put in place a process where incidents are investigated, 

verified and reported by all personnel involved and escalated up to the highest authority.  

 

To further reinforced the Group’s commitment to a safe workplace environment, we also set 

up a reward system for reporting any safety lapses. Whistle-blowers will be rewarded with 

monetary incentives to encourage reporting of any potential or apparent safety hazards for 

timely identification and rectification. 

 

 


 



19 

Occupational Health and Safety Management System scope 

 

Our Occupational Health and Safety Management System is implemented to comply with both 

the required legislations as well as our Group’s assessment on the importance of keeping our 

employees and workers safe.  Below is an extract of relevant key legislations with regards to 

Occupational Health and Safety that we comply with: 

• 

《职业病防治法》- Regulation on prevention of occupational hazards 

• 

《安全生产法》- Regulation on production safety 

• 

《消防法》- Regulation on fire safety 

• 

《突发事件应对法》 – Regulation on emergency incident response 

• 

《危险化学品安全管理条例》 – Regulation on handling of hazardous wastes  

• 

《工伤保险条例》– Regulation on workers accident insurance 

 

Our Occupational Health and Safety Management System covers both our own employees as 

well as any workers working at project sites managed by our Group. We require all 

subcontractors to sign an agreement that workers sent to our worksite have to abide by our 

Occupational Health and Safety policies. 

 




 



20 

Hazard identification, risk assessment, and incident investigation 

 

Hazard identification and risk assessments processes are put in place throughout different 

phases of our operations ranging from pre-employment training to daily site briefings and 

inspections. Refer to Figure 1: Process for hazard identification and risk assessment below for 

some key processes put in place to facilitate hazard identification and risk assessments.  

 

Figure 1: Process for hazard identification and risk assessment 

 

 

The Health and Safety Department collects incident reports from all active sites and 

consolidates the information on a monthly basis before submitting it to the management in the 

following month. Annually, a summary of incident reports is reviewed and approved by the 

General Manager prior to submission to the local Bureau of Work Safety. 

 

Information from these incident reports translates into a common knowledge pool which is 

communicated during daily safety briefing and debriefing to employees and workers stationed 

at our project work sites to continually improve our Occupational Health and Safety 

Management System. 

 

 




 



21 

The incident report is reported, investigated and endorsed by all relevant personnel in the 

hierarchy of responsibility (refer to Figure 2) for the administration of Occupational Health and 

Safety Management System before the report is consolidated by the Health and Safety 

Department and presented to the management.  This is to inculcate a shared ownership with 

regards to all safety incidents and to prevent any individual from being wrongfully isolated as 

the person responsible for the lapse in safety. We abide by our principle, safety is the 

responsibility of everyone. 

Figure 2: Hierarchy of Responsibility 

 

 

We perform a thorough investigation to establish the facts when there is any worker who is of 

the view that there are unmitigated risks at the work site and has asked to be removed from 

the specific work site.  If the evaluation results confirm that the worker’s concerns are founded 

on reasonable grounds, we will approve the site transfer and take appropriate rectification 

actions at the work site accordingly. In addition, prior to the deployment of the said worker to 

another site, he has to undergo another round of pre-job training and test to certify his 

suitability to work on the other project site. 

 

We appoint Safety Officers to work sites to facilitate identification and reporting of such safety 

hazards.  Appointed Safety Officers are stationed at work sites and serve as a first point of 

contact for reporting of any safety issues.  A reward system has been set up to encourage 

identification of potential and apparent safety hazards.  This sets the tone for employees and 

workers that whistle-blowing is encouraged to ensure a safety work environment. Anyone 

caught penalising whistle-blowers will be reproved with either a heavy penalty or discharged 

from the company.  




 



22 

 

Occupational health services 

 

The Group provides canteens and housings for workers based at the project work sites.  Our 

project managers ensure proper work site sanitary installations are in place at these facilities 

for the health benefits of workers who are stationed at the work site throughout the project 

period. Projects can range from three to six months or may last up to two to three years 

(depending on the scale of the project), hence we are committed to ensure that these facilities 

are properly set up for each project site and our project manager performs daily check to 

ensure any potential issues relating to such facilities for timely identification and rectification 

actions. 

 

At each project site, first aid items (i.e. medications like cold and flu medicines, drugs for weak 

stomach, adhesive bandages, gauze, antiseptic, etc.) are stored and easily accessible by the 

workers. The effectiveness and replenishment of stock of the first aid items is monitored by 

the project managers. 

 

We also have in place a comprehensive emergency plan for accidents to cater to any 

emergency treatment for our workers.  The emergency rescue plan is headed by our General 

Manager and supported by our Project Manager. 

 

 


 



23 

Worker participation, consultation, and communication on occupational health and 

safety 

 

Our compulsory daily briefing and inspection session prior to the start of each work shift is a 

key touch point with workers with regard to health and safety communication. Workers can 

use these sessions for the following: 

 

a. Supervisors to highlight potential hazards relevant to the tasks (e.g. working at heights, 

confined spaces, working with specialised machinery etc.) and the proper way to 

approach them; 

b. Workers to inform the respective supervisors of their poor state of health and any 

concerns they had while on shift;  

c. Supervisors use these inspections for cursory check to identify any workers that are 

unfit for duty; and 

d. Any incidents identified with regards to health or safety hazards will be shared via these 

briefing. 

 

For any incidents reported, personnel involved is required to confirm the cause of the safety 

incident and will be part of the workgroup to develop preventive measures to improve the 

Occupational Health and Safety Management System.  

 

We want to build strong working relationships with our employees and believe in open 

communication. All employees including workers are encouraged to provide constructive 

feedback and suggestions at any time. These feedbacks and suggestions will be escalated to 

our Human Resources Department for final analysis and follow up actions. We recognize that 

labour disputes can occur. Once every three months, a meeting will also be held with the Union. 

Discussions in these quarterly meetings focus primarily on the interest and welfare of 

employees and workers to ensure that their concerns are brought to the attention of the 

management. 

 

 

 


 



24 

Worker training on Occupational Health and Safety 

 

Prior to the commencement of employment, employees are required to undergo compulsory 

training on workplace safety. General rules and regulations with regard to safety at the 

worksites are also documented in our 安全生产处罚条例 (Safety Regulations and Penalties) 

and 施工现场安全管理制度 (Site Safety Management System) policies.  The training covers 

the common workplace hazards and appropriate approach to specific work site situations that 

forms part of our safety regulation at our project sites.  

 

In situations where specialised equipment are used, the Project Manager or Safety Officer 

verifies whether the worker tasked to operate the specialised equipment is certified to handle 

the equipment prior to the deployment of the worker. 

 

Promotion of workplace health and well being 

 

In addition to compliance with the relevant PRC laws and regulations relating to social welfare 

insurance, we have also taken social insurance coverage, namely the unemployment 

insurance, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance and pension insurance for our 

employees. Furthermore, we have taken maternity insurance for our female employees and 

utilised part of the union funds for workers’ health checks. 

 

To minimise any accidents due to intoxication, we included in our policies rules for prohibition 

of consumption of alcohol, gambling and drug abuse at our work sites. Frequent checks are 

conducted on a random basis at the accommodation areas to ensure that there are no illegal 

activities (i.e. consumption of alcohol, gambling and drug abuse) that may lead to poor mental 

well-being. 

 

During the summer, to prevent workers from heat stroke, the Group provides workers with 

water-rich fruits such as watermelons and soups (i.e. green bean soup) to cool down body 

temperature and prevent dehydration. At the same time, we encourage our workers to 

consume more fluids so that they will stay hydrated throughout the warm summer. 

 

 


 



25 

Prevention and mitigation of Occupational Health and Safety Impacts directly linked 

by business relationship 

 

We are aware that the safety impacts are directly linked to our operations. Hence, we have in 

place a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety Management System that covers not 

just potential safety impacts to our employees and workers but also to the safety of the 

community based near our project sites.  

 

Our site visits prior to undertaking new projects involve evaluation on the suitability of the area 

to be used as a project site and checks on whether safety measures can be taken to mitigate 

risks posed to the surrounding area.  

 

Our policies include, but not limited to, the following measures: 

a. Ensure proper drainage and perimeter demarcation; 

b. Deploy personnel to direct traffic at junctions with high traffic flow; 

c. Set up electrical points in compliance with PRC’s regulations;  

d. Ensure that there are no fire hazards at the project sites; and 

e. Ensure the structural integrity of the surrounding buildings and work site structures.

Human Capital Development 

 

Our philosophy on human capital is depicted below: 

企业重视人才、爱护人才、合理开发人才、使用人才、留住人才、提升人才。的指导

思想和价值观念。尊重人的品德，重视人的智慧；承认人的价值，珍惜人的感情；维

护人的尊严，提高人的素质。人才富有，企业才能强大。 

 

We value our human capital and attach great importance to talent development. We believe 

that our people and their skills are our greatest asset. We believe that we can only be 

successful as a sustainable enterprise when our talent pool is strong.  In addition to providing 

a safe environment for our people to work and deliver results, it is equally important for us to 

ensure that they are well-equipped with the skills to match our needs and goals.   

 

We have prepared a training plan for the upcoming financial year for each department in our 

business, from the design and consulting department to the construction and safety 

department. Our training strategy focuses first on enabling our people to develop the right skill 

sets to fulfil existing work responsibilities and then upskill to be future-ready.  The training plan 

spans across the year and the total hours of training per person is approximately 83 hours. 

Each training programme also has a specifically designed test for the participating staff to 

assess the effectiveness of the training. 

 

In addition, we see succession planning as a key aspect of our talent management strategy 

and our long term sustainability. With majority of our key executive officers at near or past their 

retirement age, the Group knows and understands the critical need to rejuvenate the team 

with younger members.  

 

The Group intends to step up efforts to recruit younger candidates with the relevant experience 

and drive from outside the organisation to occupy the key positions in Finance, Human 

Resource and Administration, Production and Sales. To ensure a smooth transition process, 

the old guards are retained by the company for a short period of time as consultants to mentor 

the younger talents to become future leaders of the Group.     

 

 

 

 


 



27 

GOVERNANCE 

Sustainability Governance 

 

We hope to strengthen our overall sustainability governance by setting up a Sustainability 

Committee to be headed by the Group’s General Manager, Xu Shulin. 

 

The Sustainability Committee will provide overall oversight and accountability over all 

sustainability efforts by the Group, from identification to management.
