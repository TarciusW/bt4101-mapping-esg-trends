“Trust”), the only Indonesian retail real estate investment 

trust (“REIT”) listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”), invests and owns quality 

income-generating retail and retail-related real estate 

across Indonesia. Since its listing in November 2007, LMIR

increase and optimise portfolio value through strategic 

acquisitions, proactive asset management and asset 

enhancement initiatives.

As of 31 December 2021, LMIR Trust has a portfolio of 

29 properties, including 22 retail malls and seven retail 

spaces (collectively known as the “Properties”) located 

in other shopping malls. These quality assets have a total 

gross ﬂoor area (“GFA”) and a total net lettable area (“NLA”) 

of 1,825,720 square metres and 956,632 square metres 

respectively, standing at Rp19,039.9 billion in total asset 

value. Strategically located in large population catchment 

areas across Greater Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Medan, 

Palembang, Bali, and Sulawesi, LMIR Trust’s properties cater

income domestic consumers in Indonesia.

About

This Report

LMIR Trust reaffirms its commitment to sustainability 

with the publication of its fifth sustainability report. The 

report covers the sustainability performance of LMIR Trust 

from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 (“FY 2021”) 

and communicates its sustainability journey with a focus 

on the environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) 

topics important to both LMIR Trust and its stakeholders. 

The information found in this report should be read in 

conjunction with the financial and governance information 

detailed in LMIR Trust’s FY 2021 Annual Report. A summary 

of this report can also be found on page 42 of the FY 2021 

Annual Report.

REPORTING FRAMEWORK

This report has been prepared in accordance with the 

Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards 2016: Core 

Option and complies with the sustainability reporting 

requirements of the SGX-ST Listing Manual (Rules 711A and 

711B) on a “comply or explain” basis.  The GRI Standards 

were chosen as it is the most widely used international 

framework for sustainability reporting and enables LMIR 

Trust to transparently report on its material ESG topics 

based on the Standards’ guidance. In defining the report 

content, LMIR Trust applied the GRI reporting principles of 

materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, 

and completeness. The relevant disclosures can be found in 

the GRI Content Index provided at the end of this report on 

page 30. 

As part of the global effort to achieve a more sustainable 

future for all, LMIR Trust supports the United Nations 

Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDGs”). 11 UN SDGs 

have been identified whereby LMIR Trust can create the 

most significant social and environmental impact and has 

referenced them in this report. 

LMIR Trust has not sought internal or external assurance 

for all information disclosed in this report. However, it 

will adopt a phased approach to reporting and will be 

subjecting FY 2022’s report to internal review conducted 

by its internal audit team, in line with SGX’s regulations for 

listed-companies to subject ESG data to internal review for 

the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2022. LMIR 

Trust seeks to adopt external assurance in the near future as 

its sustainability reporting matures.

Dear Stakeholders, 

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact communities 

globally and afect the way businesses operate. LMIR Trust 

adapted and dealt with various challenges by rethinking our 

operating systems and ensuring that our eforts continue to 

create value for our diverse pool of stakeholders, especially 

our tenants, shoppers, unitholders, investors and employees. 

The pandemic placed a spotlight on the need for businesses 

to accelerate their climate action and integrate resilient 

strategies into their business operations. This was also 

emphasised by the outcomes of COP26 and Indonesia’s 

commitment to achieving net-zero by 2060. LMIR Trust 

showed its continued commitment to both the international 

and national agenda by reviewing its sustainability strategy 

and developing its sustainability framework, which will guide 

the organisation as it takes greater steps to improve its 

sustainability performance and impact.  

LMIR Trust placed a high emphasis on climate action 

and building resilience in recognition of the growing 

environmental impact generated by businesses worldwide. 

We are taking concrete actions to reduce our environmental 

footprint and began the process of developing our carbon 

inventory. This will enable us to manage our impact on both 

the environment and society, as well as to seek new ways 

to minimise our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. We 

also evaluated our climate risks and opportunities, and this 

year marks our ﬁrst reporting on our climate-disclosures 

in line with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 

Disclosures (“TCFD”). As we move towards a lower-carbon 

economy, LMIR Trust will continue building our capabilities 

to mitigate these risks in order to ensure our long-term 

resilience. 

On the governance front, LMIR Trust continues to uphold 

good corporate governance and ethical business conduct 

through our internal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, 

as well as by ensuring adequate training relating to good 

governance is provided across the organisation. To that 

end, we are pleased to report zero conﬁrmed incidents of 

corruption and have complied with all laws and regulations 

during the reporting year. 

As we continue improving our sustainability eforts, LMIR 

Trust leverages our business of managing retail properties 

to make a positive impact on communities. We believe in 

contributing to the communities where we operate in. As an 

example, our malls have served as vaccination centres and 

held blood donation drives for the public.

The Board continues to oversee material ESG topics 

important to the organisation, including working closely 

with all stakeholders to ensure sustainability is integrated 

into our business operations. Sustainability is a journey 

and LMIR Trust will build on our existing eforts to create 

lasting shared value for our stakeholders and strengthen 

our internal capabilities on managing current and emerging 

sustainability issues.

The scale and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic made the 

year 2021 another challenging year for many businesses 

globally, including LMIR Trust. LMIR Trust’s business 

operations were directly impacted due to restrictions 

imposed by Indonesia’s government to reduce the spread 

of infections. In July 2021, LMIR Trust had to temporarily 

close 16 retail malls and six retail spaces across Java and 

Bali in response to a rise in COVID-19 cases and emergency 

restrictions on public activity. 

The health and well-being of LMIR Trust’s employees, 

shoppers, and tenants continue to be the organisation’s 

utmost priority. During the reporting year, LMIR Trust 

implemented safety measures across all retail properties 

to ensure shoppers’ safety and well-being. Before entering 

the malls, all shoppers were required to show proof of their 

first COVID-19 vaccination dose through the government-

mandated application Peduli Lindungi. Within the malls, 

additional safety measures were implemented, including 

temperature screening, ensuring shoppers adhered to 

safe distancing protocols, and provision of hand sanitisers 

at strategic locations across the malls. As for LMIR Trust’s 

tenants, additional rental support, utilities and service charge 

discounts, and rental waivers were extended to tenants  

who could not operate during the period of mall closure.  

LMIR Trust seeks to continue building long-term 

partnerships with its tenants and unitholders by helping 

them overcome business impacts during the pandemic by 

balancing short-term financial loss with long-term business 

continuity. 

Recognising that the health and safety of its employees 

is key to ensuring business continuity, LMIR Trust took 

measures to ensure safe and healthy work environments. In 

Singapore, working from home continued to be the default 

work arrangement and the layout of LMIR Trust’s office was 

reconfigured to fulfil safe-distancing and precautionary 

measures. Additionally, cleaning of common office areas 

was performed more frequently, and hand sanitisers and 

disposable face masks were supplied to all employees. 

LMIR Trust will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic 

closely and ensure all safety measures are reviewed and 

updated in a timely manner. Despite the challenges brought 

on by the pandemic, LMIR Trust remains committed to its 

sustainability goals and will adapt quickly to the changing 

business and societal environment.

Sustainability Governance  

At LMIR Trust

The Board of Directors is responsible for sustainability at 

LMIR Trust, including approving its strategic ESG direction 

and its annual sustainability report. The Board also attends 

sustainability training, including on emerging regulatory and 

market developments and ESG risks, at least annually.

The Board is supported by The Sustainability Committee, 

which is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of 

LMIRT Management and comprises the management team 

and representatives of the Finance, Asset Management, 

Corporate Services, and Legal &amp; Compliance departments. 

The role of the Committee is to provide strategic direction 

and guidance for managing sustainability-related risks 

and opportunities at LMIR Trust. This is done through 

the integration and monitoring of sustainability practices 

within all business operations and its portfolio assets. The 

Committee reviews LMIR Trust’s framework policies, and 

processes and updates them where necessary, and reports 

to the Board on LMIR Trust’s sustainability performance, 

material ESG factors, and any updates on its sustainability 

initiatives. 

The Committee continuously seeks out and attends relevant 

courses, seminars, and webinars to stay up to date with the 

latest sustainability trends, issues, and practices. 

Strategic Directions 

The Committee shall develop, 

provide inputs, and manage 

LMIR Trust’s policies, strategies, 

and programmes relating to 

sustainability and corporate 

social responsibility. This will 

include the environment, local 

community, employment 

practices, labour rights, 

health and safety, corporate 

accountability, public affairs, and 

philanthropy.

Performance Goals

The Committee shall determine 

and review the goals established 

for LMIR Trust’s performance on 

sustainability and corporate social 

responsibility and monitor its 

progress on a regular basis against 

those goals.

Manager and Property Manager 

regarding relationships with key 

external stakeholders that may 

have a significant impact on LMIR

members of the Manager and works closely with  

PT Lippo Malls Indonesia (the “Property Manager”) in 

Indonesia for ESG-related data collection and sustainability 

implementation at the malls and retail spaces.

Good corporate governance underpins long-term success 

and forms a key pillar of sustainability at LMIR Trust. 

LMIR Trust is fully committed to conducting its business 

in an ethical manner, in line with all applicable laws and 

regulations, to uphold business integrity and maintain trust 

among its stakeholders. Please refer to pages 44 to 68 

of LMIR Trust’s FY 2021 Annual Report, which highlights 

its approach to good corporate governance, including 

topics such as board composition and performance, staff 

remuneration as well as organisational risk management and 

internal controls.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE AT LMIR TRUST 

Strong sustainability governance is central to creating 

long-term enterprise value and ensuring ESG is embedded 

throughout our business operations. The Sustainability

Our Approach 

to Sustainability

SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK 

In FY 2021, LMIR Trust worked with an external consultant 

to refresh its approach to sustainability and developed its 

sustainability framework to articulate its commitment to 

sustainability and economic, environmental, social, and 

governance (“EESG”) focus areas over the next several 

years. Sustainability at LMIR Trust is delivered through four 

overarching pillars, built upon its sustainability vision and 

underpinned by shared values across the value chain. This 

framework determines key focus areas and aims to support 

LMIR Trust in its sustainability journey as it seeks to continue 

creating value for its stakeholders while safeguarding the 

environment.

Materiality

Assessment

LMIR Trust engages with both internal and external 

stakeholders to refresh its material EESG topics and assess 

their importance to the business annually. The assessment 

serves as an opportunity for LMIR Trust to re-evaluate 

current material issues and identify new ones, measure their 

relevance against current and emerging trends, and ensure 

key interests of stakeholders are addressed. 

In FY 2021, LMIR Trust partnered with an external consultant 

to perform a materiality assessment to increase the credibility 

of the assessment conducted and ensure focus is placed on 

the relevant issues important to LMIR Trust. The Management 

team worked closely with the external consultant to 

determine topics impacting LMIR Trust’s business and 

importance to stakeholders via a three-step process: 

1.

Identiﬁcation: To identify a set of EESG topics most 

relevant and important to LMIR Trust, it analysed a 

wide range of sustainability issues relevant to the real 

estate industry, including comparisons between its 

industry peers and considering industry best practices. 

Key challenges and issues based on LMIR Trust’s 

interactions with organisations such as the Singapore 

Exchange, REIT Association of Singapore, Securities 

Investors Association of Singapore, and the Monetary 

Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) were also considered.

2.

Prioritisation: LMIR Trust engaged with its key 

internal stakeholders via a stakeholder engagement 

survey to better understand their viewpoints on the 

level of impact each identiﬁed EESG topic has on the 

business and the level of importance each identiﬁed 

EESG topic is to them. Internal focus sessions with the 

Sustainability Committee were also held to prioritise 

the material topics.

3.

Validation: The ﬁnal set of material topics were 

approved and endorsed by LMIR Trust’s Board of 

Directors and senior management.

Through this assessment, LMIR Trust refreshed its material 

EESG topics to reﬂect the current sustainability landscape 

and identiﬁed nine material topics. The identiﬁed material 

topics place greater emphasis on energy and greenhouse 

emissions as well as social topics such as health, safety 

and employment. Furthermore, LMIR Trust also identiﬁed 

three additional topics which were not categorised as 

material but has implemented measures for improving their 

performance. These non-material additional topics include 

sustainable supply chain, waste management, and local 

communities.

This year, LMIR Trust embarked on the process of setting 

targets for material topics identiﬁed to track its performance 

and ensure consistent improvement on an annual basis. As 

this is LMIR Trust’s ﬁrst year setting targets, some qualitative 

targets were set. Moving forward, LMIR Trust will work 

towards setting more concrete short- and long-term 

qualitative and quantitative targets. Speciﬁc targets set are 

elaborated upon in the next sections of the report.

PERFORMANCE

Our Target for FY 2022

• 

To install Light Emitting Diode (“LED”) lights and energy efficient chiller as part of the asset 

enhancement initiative of Gajah Mada Plaza

• 

Explore opportunities to install solar panels to provide renewable energy sources in selected malls

Guided by its sustainability framework, LMIR Trust supports 

the lower-carbon economy and is committed to minimising 

its environmental footprint as well as enhancing its resource 

efficiency through investments in new technology and 

innovation. It will continue to integrate environmental 

sustainability into its business activities and reduce resource 

consumption where possible.

Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

LMIR Trust recognises that the nature of its business can 

generate significant carbon footprint and is actively taking 

steps to reduce its energy consumption.

Properties included in the consolidation of environmental data pertaining to energy and water consumption and GHG emissions follow the 

scope of this report. 

3 

Gross floor area changes year on year due to divestment and acquisition of new properties as well as changes to the net leasing area.  

4 

LMIR Trust used the financial control approach to calculate its GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) in accordance with the GHG Protocol. The 

emission factors used were derived from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“DEFRA”) environmental reporting 

guidelines, which is aligned to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s approach to calculating GHG emissions and is one of the 

third-party databases recognised by the GHG Protocol.

5 

Scope 1 emission sources include fuel combustion from the use of backup generators, fuel combustion from the use of leased vehicles, and 

fugitive emissions from refrigerants. Scope 2 emission sources include purchased electricity consumed by LMIR Trust. 

6 

Scope 2 emissions were calculated using the location-based method.

In FY 2021, LMIR Trust collaborated with an external 

consultant to develop its greenhouse gas inventory to 

better enable the monitoring of its GHG emissions and 

identify aspects within its operations that are considered 

as “GHG hotspots” where emission reduction initiatives 

can be focused on. This enables LMIR Trust to manage its 

carbon footprint and implement suitable emission reduction 

initiatives in the near future.

Environmental

Scope 2 emissions from LMIR Trust’s electricity consumption 

represents around 97.0% of its total GHG emissions. A 

large amount of electricity is consumed at its properties 

as electricity is required to run lighting equipment, air 

conditioning units, and other essential building features 

such as lifts and escalators. 139,116.7 MWh of electricity 

consumed was reported in FY 2021, a 21.2% increase from 

FY 2020, and energy intensity increased from 0.14 MWh/m2 

to 0.16 MWh/m2. This is due to the acquisition of Lippo Mall 

Puri in January 2021 as well as the re-opening of malls and 

retail spaces as the Indonesian government eased COVID-19 

restrictions. As for Scope 1 emissions, there was a 23.5% 

decrease from 2,006.7 tCO2e in FY 2020 to 1,535.1 tCO2e 

in FY 2021. LMIR Trust will continue to work closely with 

the Property Manager to ensure all environmental data are 

accurately recorded, and its performance will be monitored 

closely by the Board and Senior Management. 

Looking ahead, LMIR Trust is aware that a comprehensive 

understanding of its GHG emissions across all scopes will 

enable it to effectively enhance emission reduction initiatives 

and prioritise areas within its business operations which are 

identified to be more emission intensive. In line with LMIR 

Trust’s commitment to the climate agenda, it is working 

towards developing its Scope 3 carbon inventory and seeks 

to disclose its emissions in future reporting. 

There are significant benefits and cost savings from a 

reduction in energy usage. As such, LMIR Trust is taking 

steps to reduce its energy consumption and minimise 

associated GHG emissions across its retail properties. This 

includes investing in energy-saving products such as LED 

lights and implementing changes to its mechanical and 

electrical systems to become more energy efficient. At 

Sun Plaza, all existing corridor lights have been replaced 

with LED lights. Additionally, the switch to utilising inverters 

as chiller pumps resulted in a decrease in electricity 

consumption by 14.0%. At Lippo Mall Puri, TL lights in the 

parking area were replaced with LED lights, resulting in up 

to 70.0% in energy and cost efficiency. Additionally, LMIR 

Trust also engaged a third-party to conduct energy audits of 

chillers to ensure they are operating efficiently. 

To promote resource efficiency, LMIR Trust plans to achieve 

green certifications for its properties. It is currently working 

with an external consultant to perform a pre-assessment 

for Green Mark Certification for two of its malls – Lippo Mall 

Puri and Sun Plaza. LMIR Trust is dedicated to improving its 

energy efficiency and reducing emissions and will continue 

to implement new initiatives to improve its carbon-related 

performance.

TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL 

DISCLOSURES (TCFD) 

According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks 

Perception Survey in 2021, climate action failure was ranked 

as the most severe risk on a global scale in the next decade. 

This is supported by evidence from scientific reports such 

as those from the UN IPCC which show the need for 

businesses to increase their climate ambitions. LMIR Trust 

understands the impact that climate change can have on 

its retail properties and the importance of identifying and 

integrating climate risks into its business operations to 

ensure climate resilience. 

LMIR Trust supports the TCFD and reports, for the first time, 

its climate-related disclosures are in line with the TCFD’s four 

key pillars. It believes this will enable it to not only understand 

its climate-related risks and opportunities, which can result in 

strengthened risk management and better-informed strategic 

planning, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence that it is 

assessing and managing these risks adequately. 

Governance 

The Board is accountable for LMIR Trust’s sustainability 

performance, including providing oversight of climate-

related risks and opportunities and monitoring key material 

ESG topics such as energy and GHG emissions. Recognising 

that an effective climate governance is important in future-

proofing the business, the Board underwent training ran 

by an external consultant on climate risk management. All 

members of the Board attended the training workshop. 

Going forward, it will be a requirement for the Board to be 

regularly updated on climate-related issues.

Furthermore, the Sustainability Committee provides 

strategic direction and guidance for managing sustainability-

related risks and opportunities, and the CEO and Senior 

Asset Director have been assigned to initiate and monitor 

programmes that impact the portfolio’s climate footprint.

Strategy and Risk Management

LMIR Trust views climate-related risks to be an integral part of its 

business strategy and ensures that climate issues are considered 

when managing its retail properties or acquiring new assets. In 

the recent annual materiality assessment conducted, LMIR Trust 

also identified energy and GHG emissions to be a material topic 

for its business and stakeholders.

In FY 2021, under the guidance of an external consultant, 

LMIR Trust engaged its key internal stakeholders, through a 

survey, to identify its climate-related risks and opportunities 

and the impact they may pose on its business operations, 

strategy development, and financial planning. The key risks 

and opportunities identified are as follows: 



LED lights installed, resulting in energy savings


1 7

Climate-Related Opportunity

Potential Impact on LMIR Trust

Annual cost savings

- 

Reduced long-term operational costs due to the use of more efficient energy 

sources and equipment.

Ability to operate more efficient 

buildings

- 

Reduced long-term operating costs by improving efficiency across LMIR Trust’s 

buildings, machinery/appliances, and transport/mobility, particularly in relation 

to energy efficiency but also including broader construction materials, water, 

and waste management.

Reduced exposure to litigations/

sanctions/fines 

- 

Keeping abreast of emerging and future regulations may better inform LMIR 

Trust’s business plans and implementation of sustainability-related measures 

to ensure regulatory compliance, thereby reducing its litigation and legal risks, 

and the likelihood of being subjected to monetary sanctions.

Capitalising on changing 

consumer behaviour and 

preferences

- 

By capitalising on increasing consumer preference for ‘green malls’, shopper 

traffic may increase at LMIR Trust’s malls and retail spaces, and its reputational 

standing among its stakeholders, particularly among its visitors and investors, 

may improve.

Use of more efficient production  

and distribution processes in the  

value chain

-    Improved efficiency within LMIR Trust’s business and value chain may improve 

its organisational resilience to climate-related transition and physical risks. For 

example, the use of energy-saving lighting and recycled packaging materials 

by tenants may reduce overall carbon emissions as well as utility costs.

- 

Improved business and value chain may increase LMIR Trust’s access to capital 

for financing new opportunities.

Access to green loans

- 

Tapping on green loans and other sustainable finance opportunities to invest in 

more sustainable technologies may improve LMIR Trust’s resource efficiency, 

particularly on energy, across its properties.

Educating tenants on climate 

risks and sustainable practices

- 

Improve tenants’ knowledge on sustainable practices and ways to achieve 

energy savings can translate into cost savings for them in the long run, thereby 

reducing the risk of unoccupied mall spaces in LMIR Trust’s properties. This 

may also increase shopper traffic at malls and retail spaces, particularly among 

environmentally conscious shoppers.

- 

Engagement with tenants, either directly or through collaborations with mall 

owner associations, to promote and educate on sustainability may improve 

LMIR Trust’s reputational standing among its stakeholders.

Climate-Related Transition Risk

Potential Impact on LMIR Trust

More stringent regulations 

affecting existing assets 

- 

LMIR Trust may face litigation or legal risks, including monetary and non-

monetary sanctions, as a result of failure to adequately mitigate impacts of 

climate change, failure to adapt to climate change, and the insufficiency of 

disclosures on material financial risks brought on by climate-related issues.

- 

Public cases of non-compliance may negatively affect its reputation among its 

stakeholders and the public.

Increased stakeholder concerns  

and expectations

- 

LMIR Trust may face reputational risk tied to changing stakeholder perceptions 

of its contribution to or detraction from the transition to a lower-carbon 

economy. 

- 

Increased scrutiny from investors and creditors, and their perception of LMIR 

Trust’s impact on climate change or management of climate risks may reduce 

the availability of financing for LMIR Trust and potentially result in a higher cost 

of financing.

Increased cost of materials  

- 

Technological improvements or innovations in renewable energy and materials 

may raise operational and capital costs.

- 

Changing weather patterns may spur the need for greater financial 

expenditures in retrofitting and new equipment (e.g., energy-efficient air-

conditioning systems), thereby increasing the capital expenditures of LMIR 

Trust’s properties.

Changing consumer behaviour  

and preferences

- 

Increasing shopper preference for ‘green’ malls may impact shopper traffic in 

LMIR Trust’s malls and retail spaces.

Climate-Related Physical Risk

Potential Impact on LMIR Trust

Extreme weather events

- 

Disruptions in the supply chain brought by climate-related physical risks may 

hinder the ability to make progress in LMIR Trust’s business plans and targets.

- 

LMIR Trust may face financial implications from direct damage to its properties 

and indirect impacts brought by supply chain disruptions.

- 

Existing equipment may become insufficient to meet the changing physical 

conditions of LMIR Trust operational areas (e.g., current air conditioning 

systems among rising temperatures).

- 

Increased occurrences of flooding may incur damages to LMIR Trust’s 

properties and reduce shopper traffic in its malls and retail spaces.

Environmental

Based on the climate-related risks and opportunities 

identified, LMIR Trust will continue to retrofit its retail 

properties to enhance energy efficiency and reduce 

its exposure to climate-related risks while tapping on 

potential opportunities. In the near future, LMIR Trust plans 

to integrate climate-related risks into its Enterprise Risk 

Management Framework, explore climate scenario analysis 

options, and develop a climate risk policy.

Metrics and Targets 

LMIR Trust began tracking its Scope 1 and 2 emissions 

in FY 2021 and will continue to disclose its energy and 

emission performance in future reports. For performance 

data regarding LMIR Trust’s energy consumption and scope 

1 and 2 emissions, please refer to page 15 of this report. 

As this is LMIR Trust’s first year consolidating data relating 

to Scope 1 and 2 emissions, using the findings from the 

GHG inventory, LMIR Trust is working towards developing 

quantitative climate-related targets to better manage and 

track the progress of its performance, under the guidance of 

the Management and Board.

Total water consumption across LMIR Trust’s retail properties 

from municipal sources increased by 5.6% from 881,712.3 m3 

in FY 2020 to 931,177.8 m3 in FY 2021. This is attributable to 

the acquisition of Lippo Mall Puri and the opening of malls 

due to the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions imposed by 

the Indonesian government, resulting in increased traffic 

and business to the malls. However, water intensity from 

municipal usable water declined from 1.10 m3/m2 in FY 

2020 to 1.07 m3/m2 in FY 2021 and the volume of recycled 

water consumed tripled. This is primarily due to the water-

saving features of Lippo Mall Puri and reflects LMIR Trust’s 

commitment towards responsible water management. 

To reduce reliance on potable water, LMIR Trust taps on the 

use of recycled water and rainwater. Wastewater Treatment 

Plants (WWTP) are also installed at seven of its malls to 

promote the recycling of wastewater to non-potable water, 

and there are plans to progressively install WWTP across all 

malls. Recycled water is used in cooling towers, watering 

plants, and flushing toilets. The cost savings of using 

recycled water is around 30.0% less than piped water. As for 

rainwater, it is used to increase the raw water tank capacity, 

which in turn helps to reduce water usage during rainy 

seasons. This is currently practiced at Sun Plaza and Lippo 

Mall Puri. 

LMIR Trust will continue to incorporate water efficiency 

measures at its retail properties to ensure responsible use of 

water and to minimise its impact on scarce water resources.

WATER MANAGEMENT

Water is essential to LMIR Trust’s business and is used in ensuring its retail properties are kept clean and temperatures 

within the properties are regulated. LMIR Trust is committed to taking a strategic approach towards managing its water 

consumption and engaging in responsible water management practices.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

(Non-material additional disclosure) 

Due to the nature of LMIR Trust’s business, its retail 

properties generate general waste such as plastic, glass, 

paper, and cans by both tenants and shoppers. As part of its 

commitment to managing waste production, stakeholders 

such as tenants are encouraged to reduce waste generated. 

In particular, LMIR Trust is working with vendors to recycle 

waste and to cultivate a habit of recycling among its tenants 

and shoppers by educating them about the benefits of 

recycling through signages and e-pamphlets distributed 

across malls. As for the Manager, it continues to pursue 

initiatives such as recycling mineral water bottles used 

by employees and working with organisations such as 

Engineering Good Ltd, a non-profit organisation, to donate 

old laptops to low-income families. 

LMIR Trust is currently taking steps to quantify the amount 

of waste disposed and recycled by working with waste 

vendors to sort its waste, and actively looks to implement 

new initiatives to tackle specific waste streams and ensure 

waste is responsibly managed at its retail properties.

Employee Wellness Fruit Day 

In FY 2021, as part of ongoing efforts to encourage staff 

to eat and stay healthy, LMIR Trust continued its weekly 

Fruit Day activity, in which every employee received a 

packet of fruits every Friday to encourage them to eat 

healthily

surfaces, and a requirement for employees who resume 

work at the office to take an Antigen Rapid Test (“ART”) 

twice a week were implemented at LMIR Trust’s offices.

LMIR Trust also invests in employee wellness initiatives and 

organise annual programmes centred on the concepts of 

mental, physical, and emotional wellness for its staff.

SAFETY MEASURE 



Staff engagement events 

The Manager continued to engage 

its employees through various staff 

engagement events and activities:

• 

Company luncheons were 

organised with the relaxation of 

dining restriction

• 

Christmas log cakes were 

delivered to every employee 

during the festive period as LMIR 

Trust was unable to host its annual 

Christmas lunch

Shoppers and Tenants 

The health and well-being of its shoppers and tenants 

are important to LMIR Trust. As such, the Mall Director of 

each mall, supported by their respective Operations teams, 

are in charge of ensuring the health and well-being of all 

shoppers. To make sure that safe and hygienic spaces are 

present at its properties, LMIR Trust’s mall managers have 

put in place various measures to create a safe environment 

for shoppers to carry out their activities, to help tenants 

operate their business safely, and to limit the spread of 

COVID-19 as it reopened its malls and retail spaces. These 

include the following:

App for visitors to show proof of 

first dose COVID-19 vaccination. 

Personal protective equipment 

for staff

All frontline employees, such as those 

manning the information counters or 

entry checkpoints, are required to use 

standard Personal Protective Equipment 

(“PPE”) when carrying out their duties to 

maintain hygiene and safety.



Safety protocols for tenant areas 

Before entering tenants’ areas, shoppers 

must undergo health and safety 

protocols such as temperature-taking 

and use of hand sanitisers. All tenant 

employees are also required to use 

standard PPE at work to maintain hygiene 

and safety.

Temperature checks 

All visitors are required to have their temperatures 

checked at designated entry checkpoints of each mall.

Keeping hands clean

The malls provided more opportunities for visitors to 

keep their hands clean and sanitised by providing hand 

wash sinks and hand sanitisers at various strategic 

points across each mall. They are accompanied by signs 

to encourage visitors to wash or sanitise their hands 

regularly.

Regular cleaning of common facilities, such as 

escalator handrails, toilets, seating areas were carried 

out using disinfectant and UV rays.

Touchless buttons in lifts and carparks 

To reduce the spread of the virus, touchless buttons in 

both lifts and the ticket payment machines in carpark 

areas were installed at Lippo Mall Puri.

Governance

Good governance is essential in forming trust among 

its stakeholders and reflecting its commitment towards 

accountability and transparency. To this end, LMIR Trust 

observes the highest standard of corporate governance 

and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Upholding the Highest Standard of Corporate 

Governance 

The Manager ensures that the business of LMIR Trust is 

conducted in an ethical manner, adhering to the principles 

and guidelines of the MAS Code of Corporate Governance 

2018 (the “2018 CG Code”) and other applicable laws 

and regulations, including the SGX-ST Listing Manual (the 

“Listing Manual”), the Code on Collective Investment 

Schemes (the “Code on CIS”), and the Securities and 

Futures Act (“SFA”).

On 1 January 2022, the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) listing 

rule was amended which required all listed companies 

to describe the board diversity policy and details such as 

diversity targets, plans, timelines and progress and will 

only be applicable for annual reports for the financial year 

commencing on or after 1 January 2022. In view of this, 

the Board Diversity Policy was revised as an early adoption 

of the SGX rule.   

For more details on LMIR Trust’s corporate governance, 

please refer to pages 44 to 68 of the FY 2021 Annual 

Report.

Conducting Business with Integrity 

LMIR Trust complies with all relevant laws and regulatory 

requirements as this will shape a culture of responsibility 

among employees and plays a vital role in accelerating 

sustainability across its business operation. 

The Manager has an internal Code of Business Conduct 

and Ethics which is reviewed biennially by the internal 

Legal and Compliance Team. It lays out a clear and 

concise framework for employees to follow when 

performing their day-to-day work and comprises the 

Manager’s business principles and practices, such 

as integrity and accountability, at all levels of the 

organisation, providing guidance on issues relating to:

• 

Compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, 

such as the 2018 Code, the SGX-ST Listing Manual, the 

Code on CIS, and the SFA

• 

Conflicts of interests and the appropriate disclosures 

and reporting to be made

• 

The Manager’s stance against bribery, corruption, 

and the reporting guidelines of actual or suspected 

wrongdoings

• 

Adherence to the Manager’s policy on Employee 

Conduct, Confidentiality, Personal Trading, Personal 

Data Protection, and Whistle Blowing

• 

Compliance with guidelines on contracting Associated 

Persons, related party transactions, and outsourcing 

arrangements

The Code also provides clear guidelines and procedures 

for giving and receipt of corporate gifts and concessionary 

offers. This policy has been communicated to all Board 

of Directors, senior management, and employees. 

Additionally, all employees must undergo training on 

anti-money laundering and countering the financing of 

terrorism every two years.  

LMIR Trust has a zero-tolerance stance on corruption and 

bribery. 100% of its malls are annually assessed for risks 

relating to corruption and it is compulsory for all tenants 

to undergo a Know Your Customer (KYC) process during 

onboarding and periodically afterward. Reflecting the 

Trust’s position against all forms of corruption, it seeks to 

continue enhancing its compliance measures.   

LMIR Trust also has in place a whistle-blowing policy, 

which provides employees and external parties such as 

suppliers, customers, and contractors with accessible 

channels to report on suspected fraud, corruption, 

dishonest practices, or other similar matters relating to 

LMIR Trust or the Manager. An independent investigation 

will be conducted and appropriate follow-up actions will 

be taken for all reports made.  

LMIR Trust is pleased to report that, in FY 2021, there were 

zero reported incidents of bribery or corruption involving 

employees thereby meeting the FY 2021 target set.

key decisions made by the Board will directly influence 

its growth and strategic directions in achieving its goals. 

Therefore, the Manager is committed to ensuring that 

the Board fulfills various requirements, including diversity, 

independence, and renewal of board members, so that 

the Board is able to perform its duties in the best interest 

of LMIR Trust. To this end, the Manager is guided by a 

set of five key pillars which ensures a robust system of

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Non-compliance with laws and regulations can result in 

significant adverse impacts on LMIR Trust’s reputation, 

business continuity, and financial performance. LMIR 

Trust, therefore, places a high emphasis on regulatory 

compliance in its business operations and does not 

tolerate non-compliance.

LMIR Trust and the Manager comply with applicable 

laws and regulations, including the Listing Manual, Code 

on CIS, SFA, conditions of the Capital Markets Services 

Licence of the Manager issued by the MAS, as well as 

the tax rulings issued by the Inland Revenue Authority of 

Singapore. 

As LMIR Trust owns retail malls and spaces in Indonesia, 

the retail malls and spaces are subject to Indonesia’s 

laws and regulations. In FY 2021, the Manager started 

conducting periodical legal due diligence on LMIR Trust’s 

assets to ensure the highest standard of compliance and 

legality of documents of its assets.

To comply with all laws and regulations and ensure the 

Board of Directors is capable of advising LMIR Trust as 

regulations change, the Manager follows a set of policies 

and procedures which include:

• 

Ensuring that the Board of Directors are competent 

and well-informed on regulatory matters by selecting 

directors who are professional and business leaders 

with diverse backgrounds

• 

Scheduling training sessions for the Board of 

Directors to keep them abreast of the latest regulatory 

requirements

LMIR Trust is pleased to announce zero reported 

incidences of non-compliance with any relevant laws and 

regulations at the Manager level.

SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN

(Non-material additional disclosure) 

Recognising that its supply chain makes up a substantial 

portion of its environmental impact, LMIR Trust seeks 

to use its unique position as the owner of retail real 

estate to influence its stakeholders to minimise their 

environmental footprint and adopt sustainable practices. 

LMIR Trust is currently working with vendors to recycle 

waste generated and educating tenants, vendors, and mall 

visitors on sustainable practices through the distribution 

of e-pamphlets and signages across the malls. A high 

emphasis is placed on educating tenants on the benefits 

of reducing their environmental footprint and encouraging 

them to work closely with their suppliers to manage their 

environmental impact. As for the Manager, it only uses 

paper certified under the Programme for the Endorsement 

of Forest Certification (“PEFC”) to ensure that paper used 

by its employees is obtained from sustainably sourced 

and managed forests. LMIR Trust will remain committed 

to collaborating with its supply chain stakeholders to 

reduce its social and environmental impact and practicing 

responsible sourcing along its value chain.
