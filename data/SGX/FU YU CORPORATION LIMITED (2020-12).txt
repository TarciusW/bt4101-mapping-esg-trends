SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020


On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is my pleasure to present the Company’s Sustainability Report for FY2020. This is our 

fourth Sustainability Report and the first time that we are presenting it as a separate publication from the Company’s Annual 

Report.

First and foremost, the Board would like to thank our Sustainability Steering Committee, Sustainability Task Force and all 

employees for their commitment and support in measuring, monitoring and managing the Group’s performance in Economic, 

Environment, Social and Governance (EESG) factors.

Looking back on FY2020, it was an extremely difficult and challenging year for communities and businesses worldwide due 

to the emergence of the Covid-19 virus. The rapid spread of the virus resulted in a pandemic that had a devastating impact 

on all our lives. In addition to the heavy death toll and severe measures that had to be implemented, the Covid-19 pandemic 

also caused major disruptions to business activities which resulted in a global economic downturn.

Like many other companies, Fu Yu did not escape unscathed from the effects of the pandemic. With governments around the 

world implementing country-wide lockdowns, our factories in China and Malaysia had to close temporarily for various periods 

during the first few months of 2020.

Although there were inevitable disruptions to the Group’s and our customers’ business, our factories were still able to operate, 

albeit some at reduced levels of activity, as Fu Yu provides manufacturing services that are part of the essential supply chain.

Our two top priorities during the pandemic were to ensure the well-being of our employees and the long-term sustainability 

of the Group’s operations. At Fu Yu, we recognise that our people are vital to the Group and place great value on their health 

and safety. From the onset of the pandemic, the Group took immediate steps to activate our business continuity plan and 

implement the necessary measures at all our factories to provide a safe and healthy working environment for our people, as 

well as comply with government regulations.

Despite the many challenges that the Group faced during this unprecedented period, we are heartened that Fu Yu was able 

to display resilience in our operational and financial performance. For FY2020, the Group delivered a commendable bottom 

line performance, defended our robust financial position and sustained dividend payments to our shareholders.

As a leading provider of vertically-integrated services for the manufacture of precision plastic components and the fabrication 

of precision moulds and dies, we recognise that EESG issues have been thrust to the center of public attention, both in 

Singapore and across the globe.

The Board believes that sharpening our focus on EESG factors, by observing sustainable business practices and improving 

the level of stakeholder interest, will ultimately generate long-term competitive advantage and financial returns that have a 

positive impact on society.

Hence, the Board is firmly committed to sustainable business practices. We believe these practices are in line with the Group’s 

strategy to deliver satisfaction to our customers, provide continuous learning for our people, while creating higher value and 

maximising returns for our shareholders.

Specifically, the Board has considered sustainability issues as part of our strategic formulation and overseen the management 

of sustainability-related risks, opportunities and practices. This year, our report has been expanded to include discussions 

about the Group’s Economic Performance, Corporate Social Responsibility and our Infectious Diseases &amp; Pandemic 

Continuity Plan. More in-depth information has also been provided about the measures we are taking to protect the Group’s 

and our customers’ confidential information. In this sustainability report, we will describe the EESG factors that are material 

to the Group, the related policies, practices and performance, as well as the targets we have set for the forthcoming year.

Moving forward, the Board will continue to look for ways to integrate more sustainability factors as part of the Group’s business 

strategy. Our Sustainability Steering Committee will also continue to perpetuate these core values into the organisation and 

instill a culture that reflects our commitment to the environment and society at large.

Identify Material EESG Factors 

Relevant EESG factors were identified by taking reference from the GRI Standards 

Materiality Principle.

In the process, we have considered:

– Global and local emerging sustainability trends;

– Main topics and future challenges, as identified by peers;

– Observation gained from interactions with external stakeholders; and

– Key organisational strategies and risks identified in our existing Risk Management 

framework.

Prioritise Material EESG Factors 

The EESG factors identified in Step 1 are prioritised by evaluating the EESG impact, 

based on order of importance to the Group’s business and stakeholders.

Integrate and validate Material EESG Factors 

Validation of the EESG factors was conducted by the Group’s management team 

and Board.

Review Material EESG Factors 

The material EESG factors are continually reviewed for importance and relevance.

The Group conducted our first formal materiality assessment in 2016 to review, prioritise and validate the ESG issues that are 

significant to business operations and of interest to key stakeholders. In subsequent years, we continue to review the material 

factors for relevance and importance using a four-step materiality assessment approach. 

Following our review, the ESG factors reported in FY2019 remained relevant in FY2020. In addition, we have expanded the 

scope of our sustainability reporting to include Economic Performance. The Group’s materiality assessment approach for our 

EESG factors is summarised below:

MATERIAL FACTORS


Notwithstanding a challenging business environment, the Group has displayed a resilient financial performance in FY2020. 

While revenue was affected by business disruptions that resulted from Covid-19 containment measures, as well as weaker 

end-user demand amid the pandemic, the Group sustained its profitability in FY2020.

Group revenue softened 21.0% to S$153.4 million in FY2020 from S$194.1 million in FY2019. However, net profit attributable 

to owners of the Company (“net profit”) grew 33.3% to S$16.9 million in FY2020 from S$12.7 million in FY2019. Excluding the 

one-time expenses incurred in FY2020 and FY2019, the Group would still have registered relatively stable net profit of S$17.9 

million in FY2020, compared to S$18.3 million in FY2019. This could be attributed mainly to the Group’s strategy to maintain 

a diversified product portfolio, and its continual efforts to enhance cost and operational efficiencies. Indeed, our initiatives to 

streamline our China operations over the past two years have placed the Group on a firmer footing to tackle the challenges 

brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The table below shows the amount of direct economic value generated by the Group through our operations, and the 

distribution of this value to our stakeholders including suppliers and contractors, employees, shareholders, government 

authorities and local communities. For FY2020, the Group generated direct economic value of S$162.2 million. Approximately 

88.9% or S$144.2 million of the economic value generated in FY2020 was distributed to various stakeholder groups. In 

particular, around 27.5% of the value distributed was allocated to the remuneration of employees, and 7.1% or $10.2 million 

was allocated to shareholders in the form of dividends. The economic value retained in FY2020 was S$18.0 million.

PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT


The Group purchases electricity from the local power grids in various geographical locations.

In 2020, our electrical energy consumption amounted to 38,260,378 kilowatt hours (kWh), representing a 25.0% year-on-

year decrease from 51,041,529 kWh in 2019. The overall energy intensity for the Group also decreased 5.3% to 0.249 kWh 

per dollar of revenue in 2020 from 0.263 kWh per dollar of revenue in 2019, reflecting our continual efforts to improve energy 

efficiency. In addition, our initiative to optimise the Group’s China operations by consolidating the Group’s Shanghai operations 

with our facility in Suzhou at the end of 2019 has also led to improved utilisation of production resources and higher energy 

efficiency.

Besides electrical consumption, the Group also monitors our diesel and petrol consumption and strives to control the level 

of usage in a bid to reduce our carbon footprint. Diesel is used mainly for forklift machines, truck deliveries and staff canteen 

operations. In 2020, our annual diesel consumption decreased 16.6% to 53,297 litres from 63,868 litres in 2019. This decline 

was attributed to lower level of business activities and the replacement of diesel forklifts with electric forklifts.

Petrol is used mainly for company cars and vehicles. Annual petrol consumption in 2020 decreased 51.6% to 28,054 litres 

from 57,941 litres in 2019. This was attributable mainly to fewer visits to customers’ premises amid the coronavirus outbreak 

in 2020. Most of the interactions and communications with customers were conducted mainly through virtual meetings, email 

and telephone conversations.

WATER

Sustainable and efficient water usage is practised at the Group’s operations as part of our commitment to environment 

conservation. The Group relies primarily on the municipal water supply for our needs. The primary uses of water for our 

operations are as follow:

• Cooling tower usage

• Cooling purpose for injection moulding machines during manufacturing process

• Cleaning purposes

We endeavour to minimise our water usage through a number of efficiency initiatives. To this end, the Group has implemented 

the following initiatives to improve water management and promote water conservation:

In 2020, water consumption amounted to 205,773 cubic metres (m3), representing a 23.7% year-on-year decrease from 

269,846 m3 in 2019. The decrease was attributed mainly to the lower level of business activities and remote working 

arrangements amid the Covid-19 situation. We have kept the overall water intensity steady at approximately 0.001 m3 per 

dollar of revenue in 2020.

Moving forward, the Group targets to maintain our water intensity at the current level.

PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT


EFFLUENTS AND WASTE

At the heart of the Group’s operations is our “3R” approach towards waste management – “REDUCE, REUSE AND RECYCLE”.

We believe that proper management of waste and effective use of resources underpins our responsibility towards the 

environment and also helps to lower overall operating cost. As such, our enhanced waste management approach starts with 

“reduction of waste”, followed by “waste reuse on-site” and “material recycling”.

REDUCE

REUSE

RECYCLE

We put effective and efficient 

management into practice to reduce 

raw material wastage.

During the manufacturing process, 

resins are reused to clean the 

machines.

Our product packaging is reused 

as we help manage our customers’ 

waste by requesting the return of the 

package.

We initiate a waste bin management 

programme to sort paper, food and 

electronic waste which are recycled or 

properly disposed accordingly.

The Group’s factories are certified with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System. We are committed to responsible 

procurement of materials and work closely with our vendors to replace toxic substances with environmentally-friendly 

substitutes. We will also purchase environmentally-friendly materials with accredited green labels upon requests from 

customers.

As part our supply chain management, we carry out vendor evaluation assessment on a yearly basis to assess our new 

vendors. We also measure/monitor our existing vendors’ performance to reduce costs, mitigate risks and drive continual 

improvement towards environmental sustainability.

We adopt a stringent attitude towards proper waste sorting (i.e., hazardous and non-hazardous) and appropriate disposal 

methods that comply with the local regulations. The Group also engages licensed toxic waste collection companies to ensure 

that toxic waste is properly disposed to minimise any negative impact to the environment.

In the unlikely event of a chemical spillage, we are able to 

activate our in-house Chemical Spillage Control Team 

immediately and reduce the potential impact of such 

chemical pollution to the environment. We conduct yearly 

refresher training courses to ensure that our team is always 

ready to remedy any chemical spillage if the situation arises.

In 2020, there was no incident of significant chemical spillage 

in production facilities.

Moving forward, the Group aims to have zero significant 

cases of chemical spillage and improper disposal of waste at 

our manufacturing facilities in the forthcoming year.

Training on chemical spillage control

At our operations in Singapore, we have put in place 7,000 reusable containers to replace paper carton boxes for storage of 

products on our production floor. Following this change, we achieved estimated annual saving of at least 300 tonnes of paper 

in FY2020.

Paper Usage Reduction Efforts

The amount of hazardous waste in 2020 was reduced by 

21.6% to 109 tonnes in 2020 from 139 tonnes in 2019. 

General, non-hazardous waste in 2020 also decreased 

7.6% to 791 tonnes in 2020 from 856 tonnes in 2019. 

These decreases were in line with the lower level of business 

activities in 2020 and also attributed to the closure of our 

factory in Shanghai in 2019. In addition, the replacement 

of hydraulic machines with electric/hybrid machines led to 

lower volume of non-hazardous waste in 2020.

EMPLOYMENT AND TALENT RETENTION

Fu Yu recognises that our most valuable asset is our employees as they determine the Group’s success in the long term. 

We believe it is the Group’s responsibility to help our employees excel in their roles by ensuring a safe and healthy work 

environment and cultivating a positive culture that embodies the Group’s corporate values.

At Fu Yu, all our employees are treated with respect and dignity. The Group has a zero tolerance policy regarding disrespectful, 

hostile, intimidating or threatening behaviour in our workplace. This includes sexual advances, actions or comments of racial 

or religious slurs.

In line with our commitment towards creating a positive work environment, the Group has a strategic reward system in place. 

This system takes into account our employees’ abilities, performance, contributions and experience to make a positive 

contribution to the values and business objectives of the Group.

The Group supports the concept of fostering good work-life balance for our employees. We believe a healthy work-life balance 

promotes the well-being of individuals, families and communities as well as strengthens our employees’ commitment to the 

organisation. We employ human resource strategies and policies that encourage social and recreational activities, such as 

food fairs, company trips, festive celebrations, team building, annual dinner and dance, for our employees on a regular basis.

In November 2020, our subsidiary in Zhuhai, China organised a recreational trip for its employees.





As of 31 December 2020, the Group had a total of 1,872 employees across our headquarters and subsidiaries in Asia. This 

was a reduction from 2,246 employees at the end of 2019, due mainly to the closure of our operations in Shanghai in January 

2020 and Chongqing in the last quarter of 2020.

The Group’s workforce comprises mainly permanent and full-time employees. We also supplement our workforce by hiring 

temporary workers in tandem with the level of our manufacturing activities. In 2020, we have reassessed the turnover rate 

to exclude temporary workers as hiring of temporary workers is dependent on our business requirements. Our turnover rate 

increased from 43.7% in 2019 to 48.4% in 2020. The higher turnover rate was due to the closure of our factory in Chongqing, 

as well as the resignations of employees who were affected by travel restrictions and movement control orders following the 

outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Excluding the reduction in headcount arising from the closure of the Chongqing factory, 

our turnover rate would have been 38.3% in 2020.

As we moved to fill these vacant positions, the Group saw an increase in new hires from 25.8% in 2019 to 32.5% in 2020.

The Group advocates fair and equal opportunities for all our employees regardless of age, race, gender, religion, marital and 

family status or disability. We believe in treating our people fairly without bias, and creating a workplace that values diversity 

and promotes dignity.

We have developed policies to stipulate fair and equal opportunities to all employees and job applicants. Our selection and 

recruitment criteria is based solely on an applicant’s skills, experience and/or ability to perform the job.

The gender ratio between our male and female employees remained fairly stable in 2020 although there was a slight decrease 

in the percentage of females. Most of our employees are in the 30-50-year age group, which is relatively common in the 

industry that the Group operates in.

DEVELOPING OUR WORKFORCE


TRAINING AND EDUCATION

As Fu Yu navigates our business through an increasingly challenging global environment, we recognise that developing the 

potential of our human capital is a critical factor for the progress of our Group. Employee training and development will always 

remain our key priorities. We are confident that continuous career development enhances the organisation’s talent pool and 

will contribute to higher levels of employee satisfaction. This in turn should lead to improved performance and success for the 

Group in the long term.

To help our employees achieve their full potential, we encourage them to upgrade their knowledge and skillset. In this regard, 

the Group provides opportunities for employees to increase their capabilities by offering them a variety of training and personal 

development programs based on their strengths and needs. All eligible employees are assessed at an annual performance 

review when each individual’s training needs are discussed and determined. Supervisors will recommend certain training and 

development initiatives and employees can request for specific training which they believe will be beneficial to upgrade their 

skills.

Despite the many challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group has continued to place significant emphasis 

on developing and managing our talent. We believe that a competent workforce will enable the Group to better seize new 

opportunities as the global economy charts its path towards recovery.

In 2020, the average training hours per employee increased to 20 hours from 14 hours in 2019. The average training hours 

per employee also increased across-the-board from our people in operations to executive and management personnel. In 

particular, the training hours per employee for workers have increased 46.7% from 15 hours in 2019 to 22 hours in 2020. This 

was due mainly to new hires in 2020 who attended mandatory training on the job and government incentives to encourage 

workers to upgrade their skills and knowledge through 24/7 access to online learning platforms. We also saw a large increase 

in the average training hours for our female employees from 14 hours in 2019 to 23 hours in 2020.

Moving forward, the Group’s target is to ensure that 100% of our employees receive an annual performance review.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Group endeavours to create an organisational culture that prioritises the health and safety of our people in the workplace, 

which is of particular importance for our manufacturing facilities. As such, we have made considerable efforts to ensure a 

conducive and safe working environment in our manufacturing facilities.

The Group has established a Workplace Safety and Health Committee (WSHC) to review and monitor the overall performance 

of our health and safety practices on a regular basis, as well as to ensure compliance with the relevant laws and regulations 

of the countries where we have operations.

The WSHC also initiates various programmes and activities to raise awareness of occupational health and safety (OHS). All 

new employees are required to attend a compulsory safety briefing as part of the Group’s Induction Training. In our day-to-

day operations, employees have to ensure that all necessary safety measures are properly implemented prior to carrying out 

work. As part of the assurance process, we also conduct practice sessions regularly for employees to reinforce the OHS 

requirements, in-house safety rules and job-specific safety requirements.



Fire drill exercise



Training session on safety measures

Additionally, regular inspections are conducted to ensure that our infrastructure and manufacturing facilities are well maintained, 

and our employees observe the correct work processes and practices. We are continually seeking to improve workplace 

conditions by proactively identifying potential hazards and risks, establishing better measurement methods to monitor the 

working environment and obtaining the necessary legal permits/licences.

The Group is continuously studying ways to improve the safety measures in our manufacturing facilities. For example, we have 

installed a Safety Barrier Control system and Safety Sensor Control system at our manufacturing facilities in Singapore and 

Suzhou respectively. This prevents accidents when the machinery is running in auto cycle mode.

The Safety Barrier Control system, which fences up our automation equipment, has been further enhanced with the placement 

of an Emergency Stop Button. In case of emergency, the machine can be stopped immediately when its users press the stop 

button. This will help to avoid risks of accidents, personal injury or machine damage. In addition, we have affixed signage on 

the Safety Barrier to remind machine users of the importance of workplace safety.

With regards to the Safety Sensor Control system at our Suzhou factory, the automatic nut-embedding machine is equipped 

with safety grating sensors which can prevent accidents when the machine is operating. The machine will stop immediately 

when the operators accidentally reach into the machine.

FORCED OR COMPULSORY LABOUR

The Group endeavours to prevent and combat all forms of forced or compulsory labour within the scope of our activities.

Firstly, we have a clear policy which strictly forbids the use of forced, bonded or indentured labour, including debt bondage, 

involuntary prison labour and slavery or human trafficking.

We also carry out a factory audit for each of our factories in Singapore, Malaysia and China when requested by customers 

by following the guidance of Responsible Business Alliance, which is a set of standards on social, environmental and ethical 

issues in the electronics industry supply chain. The standards set out in the Code of Conduct reference international norms 

and standards including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ILO International Labour Standards, OECD Guidelines for 

Multinational Enterprises, ISO and SA standards, and many more.

In addition, we ensure that our employment contracts are drawn up in languages that are easily understood by workers, to 

facilitate their understanding of the job scope and procedures for leaving the company.

In 2020, there were no incidents of non-compliance with forced or compulsory labour at our manufacturing facilities. Moving 

forward, the Group’s target is to achieve zero incidents of non-compliance with Labour Laws relating to forced or compulsory 

labour. We also aim to achieve a rating of “satisfactory” or above on all Responsible Business Alliance factory audits, if any.

CHILD LABOUR

The Group strictly prohibits the use of child labour in all our activities. We encourage customers to request an audit of our 

manufacturing facilities to assess the risk of child labour under the Responsible Business Alliance Guidelines, whenever they 

believe it to be appropriate.

In 2020, there were no incidents of non-compliance with child labour at our manufacturing facilities. Moving forward, the 

Group’s target is to achieve zero incidents of non-compliance with Labour Laws relating to child labour. We also aim to 

achieve a rating of “satisfactory” or above on all Responsible Business Alliance factory audits, if any.

DEVELOPING OUR WORKFORCE


At Fu Yu, we are committed to ensuring and maintaining high standards of corporate governance and business conduct 

to uphold market integrity and safeguard the interests of our stakeholders for the Group’s long term success. We believe 

in fostering an organisational culture that promotes the highest level of integrity and ethical business practices, including 

compliance with applicable laws and regulations, respect for human rights and environmental conservation.

ANTI-CORRUPTION

Our management takes the lead in fostering a strong corporate governance culture and implementation of policies that 

promote ethical behaviour. With zero tolerance towards unethical and corrupt practices, the Group places significant emphasis 

on effective prevention and detection of fraudulent activities and misconduct. We have adopted a Fraud Risk Management 

Framework and Policy that guides all employees on anti-fraud measures to minimise the risks of fraud. Our respective Plant 

General Managers conduct a fraud risk assessment yearly, and reports any key fraud risks and anti-fraud mitigation measures 

to Audit Committee and the Board. 

In addition, we have also put in place a Whistle Blowing Policy that provides a transparent channel for employees to raise 

concerns about possible fraud, improprieties in financial reporting and other matters. At the same time, this policy also 

provides reassurance that employees will be protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle blowing in good faith. We 

conduct refresher training sessions annually on anti-corruption and whistle blowing policies for all our employees at the 

Group’s operating sites.

Policy to our employees. Our policy provides detailed 

guidelines on employees’ business conduct, including 

requirements for employees to declare any direct or indirect 

interest in, or relationship with other businesses and 

organisations where potential conflicts of interest may arise.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

The Group adheres to the highest standards of business practices to ensure compliance to all applicable environmental laws 

and regulations. We are mindful of the potential impact on the Group’s operations, and reputation as well as legal liabilities 

that could result from a breach of applicable laws or regulations. To this end, we ensure that all of the Group’s factories are 

ISO 14001 certified.

In 2020, there were no incidents of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations resulting in significant fines or 

sanctions. Moving forward, the Group targets to maintain zero incidents of non-compliance with environmental laws and 

regulations resulting in significant fines or sanctions.

Our Environmental Compliance Projects

At our manufacturing facility in Dongguan, China, we have redesigned our existing sewage and pipe networks in accordance 

with the requirements of the “Dongguan City Rain and Sewage Diversion Work Implementation Plan”. Completed in 2020, 

the redesigned sewage and piping system comprises separate rain water collection pipes and sewage pipes to prevent water 

pollution and enhance water quality standards.

Phase 2 – Lay pipe network and establish 

sewage transit collection pool

Phase 3 – Completion

Besides taking steps to manage water pollution, the Group has implemented measures to reduce air pollution and comply 

with China’s national and local environmental regulations. We have installed new exhaust gas treatment systems at our 

factories in Suzhou and Zhuhai, and are in the process of putting in place new systems at our factory in Dongguan to meet 

the stringent regulatory standards on treatment of VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) emissions. Below is a list of the projects

Completed Projects



Fu Yu Zhuhai – Exhaust Gas Treatment System 

(completed in 2018)

To resolve the issue of exhaust gas generated by our injection 

molding workshop and the secondary processing pad 

printing workshop, Fu Yu Zhuhai has installed an exhaust 

gas treatment system. This system comprises equipment 

that utilises decomposition and oxidation processes to 

transform the exhaust gas into odorless compounds or 

completely mineralised into water and carbon dioxide which 

can be safely discharged into the atmosphere. The entire 

purification process takes one second to complete.

The Group uses crushers to recycle plastic waste materials. 

As the main pollutant of the crushing process is dust, 

Fu Yu Zhuhai has installed dust removal equipment that will 

separate, filter and trap dust particles before releasing clean 

air back into the atmosphere.



Fu Yu Zhuhai – Dust Removal Equipment 

(completed in 2018)

To treat exhaust gas generated from the spray painting 

process, Fu Yu Suzhou has a system to remove harmful 

gases and reduce concentration of paint mist emitted 

from the spraying process. This system undergoes 

annual inspections to ensure it meets the requirements for 

environmental protection.

Fu Yu strongly believes in giving back and creating positive impact for our local communities. During the Covid-19 pandemic 

in 2020, we were cognisant that non-profit organisations might not able to carry out their usual donation drives, and families 

may not have adequate support due to the devastating impact of the virus outbreak on livelihoods.

To support our local communities, Fu Yu made cash donations of S$150,000 in total to the Singapore Children’s Society and 

Singapore Taman Jurong Town CCC Community Development and Welfare Fund in 2020. Additionally, our people in Malaysia 

(Fu Hao Manufacturing (M) Sdn Bhd) and China (Fu Yu Moulding &amp; Tooling (Suzhou) Co., Ltd) have voluntarily stepped up for 

a good cause through their participation in blood donation drives.
