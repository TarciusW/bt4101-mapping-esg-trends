Board Statement

OVERVIEW OF F&amp;N 

SUSTAINABILITY  

REPORT 2021

The Board is pleased to present the  

F&amp;N Sustainability Report (“Report”)  

for the Financial Year (“FY”) covering  

the period from 1 October 2020 to  

30 September 2021. The Report 

provides an overview of the key 

Environmental, Social and Governance 

(“ESG”) topics performance of the 

Group for the year. Through this Report, 

we demonstrate our unwavering 

commitment to incorporate sustainable 

practices into our business and show 

our leadership in addressing critical 

sustainability challenges through 

offering stakeholders an insight into  

the Group’s business model, strategies 

and values, as well as providing key 

financial and operating information  

in an open and balanced manner.

This Report is prepared in accordance 

with the internationally recognised 

Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) 

Standards (Core) which is in 

compliance with the Singapore 

Exchange’s (“SGX”) Listing Rules 711A 

and 711B. The report covers activities 

of the Group’s operations, including 

13 manufacturing sites in Singapore, 

Malaysia and Thailand. The detailed 

reporting scope is explained on pages 

10 and 11 of this Report. 

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

The Board has overall responsibility 

for sustainability – from strategy to 

implementation and monitoring of 

performance – and have been closely 

involved in the development of this 

Report. While the Board takes the lead 

in the Group’s sustainability direction, 

the Sustainability and Risk Management 

Committee (“SRMC”) is responsible 

for steering the Group’s sustainability 

efforts. The SRMC is supported by 

the Sustainability Development 

Committee (“SDC”), chaired by Mr. 

Lee Meng Tat, Chief Executive Officer 

for Non-Alcoholic Beverages, which 

monitors the progress of the Group’s 

sustainability priorities. To ensure a 

holistic management of sustainability 

across the material ESG topics across 

the Group, the SRMC and the SDC 

are represented by management from 

various parts of F&amp;N’s business, including 

Finance, Operations, Human Capital, 

Research and Development, Marketing, 

Communications and Risk Management. 

RENEWED SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY 

AND AMBITIONS AT F&amp;N 

The Board is responsible for ensuring 

that the ESG topics remains relevant 

and are considered and integrated 

in the formulation of F&amp;N’s strategy. 

We oversaw the process to review the 

material ESG topics and refresh the F&amp;N 

materiality matrix in 2020 and update 

the sustainability framework in 2021. 

The updated sustainability framework 

focuses on the material ESG topics 

that are perceived by internal and 

external stakeholders to be important 

to F&amp;N. F&amp;N has also defined new 2025 

sustainability goals for the 12 most 

important ESG topics, in alignment 

with the refreshed materiality matrix, 

marking the path for our sustainability 

roadmap for the next 5 years. 

The 2025 sustainability targets, reviewed 

by the SDC, were approved by the 

Board as important sustainability topics 

that may potentially impact F&amp;N’s 

long-term financial and non-financial 

goals. Full details on the new 2025 

sustainability targets and updated 

sustainability framework can be found 

on pages 21 to 23 of this Report.  

The Group will continue to engage our 

stakeholders, evolve our sustainability 

framework and action programs to 

create sustainable value for people,  

the planet and the future viability of  

our businesses.

PURSUING SUSTAINABILITY EXCELLENCE 

AMIDST CHALLENGING TIMES 

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented 

new challenges to many businesses 

worldwide, including F&amp;N. This year, 

as the more infectious Delta variant 

spreads through Southeast Asia, 

we adapted and implemented the 

COVID-19 Business Continuity Plan 

(“BCP”) to ensure that our systems 

and procedures were implemented to 

minimise business operational risks and 

more importantly, to protect the health 

and safety of our staff and customers.

Sustainability Report 2021







Despite these difficult times, advancing 

sustainability and making positive 

impacts on the material ESG topics 

remain a core focus for F&amp;N. This 

year, we stepped up our goals for the 

future with new milestones to actively 

contribute, positively, to climate 

protection, a circular economy and 

social progress. 

We are pleased that our support 

of sustainable palm oil has been 

recognised by WWF, the world’s leading 

independent conservation organisation. 

In the recently released 2021 WWF Palm 

Oil Buyers Scorecard (“POBS”), F&amp;N 

had the best score out of the 46 Asian 

companies invited to participate. This is 

an important recognition and a great 

encouragement as we progress  

on our sustainable journey.

F&amp;N is also pleased that its subsidiary, 

Fraser &amp; Neave Holdings Bhd (“F&amp;NHB”), 

has been recognised for excellence 

in sustainability and strong ESG 

practices by being included as one of 

the constituents of the newly launched 

FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia Shariah 

(“F4GBMS”) index. It has maintained 

its position as a constituent of the 

FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia Index 

(“F4GBM”) for the third year running; 

and was invited to participate in the S&amp;P 

Global 2020 Corporate Sustainability 

Assessment (“CSA”), for inclusion in 

the S&amp;P ESG Index. These inclusions 

stand testament to F&amp;N’s sustainability 

performance and strong ESG practices.

CLOSING REMARKS

The Group is proud of its sustainability 

efforts over the past years. To drive 

progress, we have defined specific mid-

terms targets, built on previous milestones, 

for each of our key material topics to 

be achieved by 2025. These milestones 

will support our progress toward a 

sustainable business model based on  

the principles of circular economy.

Sustainability Report 2021

Message from Chairman of SDC

OVERVIEW OF F&amp;N 

SUSTAINABILITY  

REPORT 2021

This Report has been prepared in 

accordance with the GRI Standards 

(Core), which represent the global best 

practice in sustainability reporting. 

By adhering to the GRI Standards, 

F&amp;N aims to provide information on 

sustainability performance that is useful 

to our stakeholders and demonstrates 

our progress towards achieving our 

targets over time.

As Thai Beverage Public Company 

Limited (“ThaiBev”), F&amp;N’s parent 

company, has demonstrated its 

sustainability excellence by being 

awarded the S&amp;P Global Gold Class, 

for being ranked as the top 1% of 

companies in the Beverages industry 

participating in the S&amp;P Global 2020 

CSA, in the S&amp;P Global Sustainability 

Yearbook 2021, F&amp;N has chosen to 

align and integrate our data collection 

processes with ThaiBev’s reporting 

parameters. With a systematic approach 

to sustainability reporting, F&amp;N aims to 

provide consistent information disclosure 

and benchmark its performance against 

industry leaders to improve through best 

practice sharing and knowledge transfer.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW

This year, we have scaled up the 

success of our previous initiatives, while 

implementing new activities to continue 

and nutritious offerings. This year, we 

continued to rollout a number of healthy 

beverages such as the F&amp;N FRUIT TREE 

FRESH No Sugar Added Prune &amp; Mixed 

Fruit Juice Drink, F&amp;N NUTRISOY Fresh 

Soya Milk infused with Ondeh Ondeh 

flavour, F&amp;N NUTRIWELL Roselle, etc.  

The F&amp;N FRUIT TREE FRESH No Sugar 

Added Prune &amp; Mixed Fruit Juice Drink, 

for instance, is a health-forward beverage 

that is not only low in sugar, but also 

contains health-specific ingredients – 

vitamin C and fibre-rich. To encourage 

reduced sugar intake, &gt;60% of F&amp;N’s 

Ready-to-drink (“RTD”) products sold 

today in Singapore and Malaysia 

contain less than 5g of sugar per 100ml.

Human Rights Due Diligence 

A robust Human Rights Due Diligence 

(“HRDD”) process has been conducted 

this year to identify and mitigate Human 

Rights risks along F&amp;N’s value chain. The 

scope of the HRDD process is aligned 

with this Report’s scope and involves 

a Human Rights Risk Assessment 

exercise for material F&amp;N operations 

in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. 

Developed as part of the HRDD process, 

we have formulated our Human Rights 

Policy in accordance with related 

Human Rights principles under key 

international standards and frameworks. 

The F&amp;N Human Rights Salient Issue risk 

matrix, illustrating key Human Rights 

salient issues identified throughout our 

value chain, has also been disclosed. 

More details can be found in the 

‘Human Rights’ section on pages 55 to 

61 of this Report.

pursuing sustainability excellence.  

In particular, we would like to highlight 

the following initiatives, where we 

have demonstrated commitment to 

sustainability performance through 

cross-function collaboration.

2025 sustainability targets, 2021 

materiality matrix and sustainability 

framework

In 2020, F&amp;N conducted a comprehensive 

materiality assessment to refresh the 

materiality matrix for 2021. External  

and internal stakeholders were 

consulted, and the input received were 

considered. We identified and prioritised 

topics that were most material to our 

businesses and stakeholders, and set 

2025 sustainability targets on them.  

The F&amp;N 2021 materiality matrix and 

2025 sustainability targets were reviewed 

and finalised by the SDC, endorsed by 

the SRMC and approved by the Board.  

The sustainability framework was 

updated in 2021 to incorporate the 

material topics determined in the 

materiality assessment. Details of the 

Group’s materiality assessment, 2021 

materiality matrix and sustainability 

framework, and 2025 sustainability 

targets can be found in the ‘Our 

Sustainability Approach’ section on 

pages 18 to 23 of this Report.

Healthier products for consumers

Nutrition is placed at the core of F&amp;N’s 

sustainability strategy. We constantly 

review our portfolio and work at 

increasing the nutrient profile of our 

products, as well as innovate with new 

This year, we have scaled up the 

success of our previous initiatives, 

while implementing new activities 

to continue pursuing sustainability

Environmentally friendly packaging

Integral to our circular transition is the 

reduction in packaging material usage 

and waste. To reduce our environmental 

impacts, we design new packaging 

solutions to ensure that they can  

be recycled, reused or composted. 

F&amp;N ICE MOUNTAIN has added a new 

sustainable and recyclable pack format 

to its drinking water range. Available  

in 300ml cans, the new packaging 

is made from aluminium that is fully 

recyclable. Consumers now have the 

additional option of purchasing  

F&amp;N ICE MOUNTAIN Drinking Water in 

an eco-friendly recyclable aluminium 

packaging.

F&amp;NHB joined nine other companies to 

form the Malaysia Recycling Alliance 

(“MAREA”) in January 2021. The alliance 

is an industry-led, pioneering initiative 

towards circular economy solutions 

with goals that focus on improving 

collection and recycling of post-

consumer packaging, encouraging 

the use of recycled and renewable 

materials as well as reducing post-

consumer packaging leakage into the 

environment for a greener Malaysia.

World Wide Fund for Nature  

(“WWF”) Palm Oil Buyers Scorecard 

(“POBS”) 2021

F&amp;N’s efforts in the sourcing of 

Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 

(“RSPO”) certified sustainable palm 

oil, over the past few years, have been 

recognised in the 2021 WWF POBS 

where F&amp;N scored the highest amongst 

the 12 participating Asian companies. 

However, F&amp;N recognises that there is still 

more work to be done and has begun 

taking steps regarding this aspect. For 

example, this year, F&amp;NHB has released 

a biodiversity statement committing 

to avoid deforestation and protect 

high biodiversity value areas through 

stakeholder engagements in order 

to preserve biodiversity and conserve 

natural ecosystems for sustainable 

development.

F&amp;N RESPONSE TO COVID-19 

It has been more than a year since 

the pandemic began, the world is still 

grappling with surging infection rates 

and its damaging impact on society 

and businesses. The instability of the 

global situation has reiterated the 

interconnectedness of Environmental 

and Social topics. The COVID-19 

pandemic also highlights the 

importance of managing economic  

and social risks and opportunities, 

especially in Nutrition, Employee  

Health, Safety and Well-being, 

Community Development and  

Inclusive Growth, and Supply Chain 

Stewardship. F&amp;N remains committed 

to addressing our material sustainability 

topics with our key stakeholders,  

such as employees, suppliers, customers 

and the community, in order to build 

resilience. 

Safeguarding Our People 

F&amp;N continued to support our 

employees’ adjustment to remote 

working environments through 

increased adoption of digital tools, 

such as videoconferencing software 

like Zoom and Microsoft Teams, to 

reduce business travel and replace 

physical meetings. Flexible working 

arrangements and social distancing 

measures also ensured safe distancing 

in the physical interactions between 

employees. These measures safeguard 

employees’ health by minimising the 

potential exposure to COVID-19 at 

the workplace. F&amp;N employees are the 

heart of its business operations and 

to safeguard them would ensure the 

continuity of business operations.

Supporting Our Suppliers and 

Customers

F&amp;N ensures minimal disruptions 

during this period by having regular 

engagements with suppliers and 

working with them to ensure healthy 

inventory levels.

To engage our customers, F&amp;N taps  

into social media and online platforms, 

in addition to traditional media,  

to introduce the latest F&amp;N products. 

E-commerce platforms, such as Lazada, 

are some of the alternate methods 

through which F&amp;N provided customers 

with access to our products from the 

convenience and safety of their homes. 

Encouraging the Vulnerable 

Communities and Frontline Workers

F&amp;N continued to support the vulnerable 

in our communities through outreach 

programs during this period of 

uncertainty. 

To also show appreciation and gratitude 

to the frontline healthcare workers 

who have been serving the people 

and communities most affected by the 

COVID-19 pandemic, F&amp;N has also 

donated products to help keep them 

hydrated and energised.

TOWARDS F&amp;N’S 2025 SUSTAINABILITY 

AMBITIONS 

As F&amp;N progresses on its sustainability 

journey, we continue to identify 

areas where we can make a positive 

impact. We look forward to further 

expand our positive contribution to 

sustainable development and play 

our part in addressing the complex 

and interconnected challenges of 

sustainability.

During 2021, the Group has examined 

strategies and planned initiatives to 

be undertaken in the next few years in 

order to progressively work toward the 

2025 sustainability targets. The 2025 

sustainability targets will drive F&amp;N’s 

sustainability performance throughout 

the business and strengthen the 

commitment to create long-term value 

for key F&amp;N stakeholders.

Driving Sustainability

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, 

the world has been grappling 

with the pandemic’s damaging 

effects on people and businesses. 

F&amp;N remains cautious of local 

and global uncertainties as 

the COVID-19 pandemic 

situation has not yet stabilised. 

Despite this uncertainty, F&amp;N 

remains committed to pursuing 

sustainable and inclusive growth 

with our employees, business 

partners and the community.

The ability to weather challenges 

and navigate safely through 

the uncertainty is the result of 

initiatives to ensure resiliency of 

our business and stakeholders. 

Safeguarding the health and 

well-being of our people remains 

pivotal while ensuring continued 

availability and accessibility of 

F&amp;N’s products in the market.  

We will continue to closely monitor 

the situation and local regulatory 

guidelines in our key markets to 

ensure timely and appropriate 

mitigation measures. 

Looking forward, we are confident 

that our long-term strategies are 

well placed to manage the risk 

of the current landscape, while 

keeping the Group on track for a 

stronger future.

F&amp;N COVID-19 RESPONSE AND 

LEARNINGS 

To manage the changing external 

landscape, F&amp;N aims to adapt 

its business through ensuring the 

safety of employees, suppliers, 

and the communities it operates 

in. To ensure business continuity 

throughout the COVID-19 

pandemic, F&amp;N has adapted 

to working remotely and works 

closely with suppliers to manage 

uncertainties in commodity 

supplies. 

As a primary F&amp;B manufacturer, 

F&amp;N has been working closely with 

relevant government agencies 

to expedite the vaccination 

process for its employees. As of 

September 2021, in Malaysia, 

F&amp;NHB’s vaccination rate is at 

96%. F&amp;N continues to extend our 

support towards the respective 

nation’s COVID-19 immunisation 

programme, in the countries the 

Group operates in. 

We continue to enhance safety 

measures, including regular 

COVID-19 testing in our plants,  

to alleviate infection risks and 

ensure minimal impact to 

operations. Maintaining the 

highest levels of hygiene through 

regular cleaning and sanitising 

has always been, and will 

continue to be, a top priority  

at all the Group’s premises.  

In 2021, F&amp;N remains dedicated 

in protecting our employees 

across all working levels. Annual 

health and safety training 

sessions on work hazards were 

conducted virtually and credible 

information on COVID-19 related 

risks were provided.

Since the start of the pandemic, 

F&amp;N has extended its support to 

the frontline workers, vulnerable 

communities and vaccination 

centres in Singapore, Malaysia 

and Thailand. To date, over 2 

million F&amp;B products have been 

distributed directly or through 

Non-Government Organisations 

(“NGOs”)/community groups to 

beneficiaries. 

To ensure business continuity, our 

employees are fully supported as 

they adjust to working remotely. 

F&amp;N has increased adoption of 

digital tools and technologies to 

replace physical meetings and 

reduce business travel. Employees 

are also encouraged to reskill 

and upskill with training and 

development courses to enhance 

their remote working capabilities. 

No roles were made redundant 

due to COVID-19. Our employees 

are kept up to date on internal 

company news and relevant 

COVID-19 advice through our 

internal mobile application (at 

F&amp;NHB) and email advisories. 

Additionally, F&amp;N works closely 

with suppliers to build resiliency 

and ensure minimal disruption 

to the Group’s supply chain. 

This has so far helped F&amp;N to 

ensure healthy inventory levels 

throughout the COVID-19 

pandemic. 



Safeguarding the 

health and well-being 

of our people remains 

pivotal while ensuring 

continued availability 

and accessibility of F&amp;N’s 

products in the market.

Sustainability Report 2021

Driving Sustainability

Fraser and Neave, Limited (“F&amp;N” or the 

“Group”) originated more than a century 

ago from the spirited decisions of two 

enterprising young men, John Fraser and 

David Neave, who diversified from their 

printing business to pioneer the aerated 

water business in Southeast Asia (“SEA”) 

in 1883. 

The entrepreneurial spirit, embodied by 

our founders, remains in today’s F&amp;N. As 

a soft drink company, F&amp;N seized the 

opportunity and ventured into the beer 

brewing business in 1931 in partnership 

with The Heineken Company and built a 

very successful beer empire in Asia Pacific 

– through its joint venture company, 

Asia Pacific Breweries Limited (“APB”). 

In 1959, it entered the Dairies business 

by forming a canned milk joint venture 

with Beatrice Foods of Chicago, and in 

2007, it acquired Nestle’s liquid canned 

milk business in Thailand, Malaysia, 

Singapore and Brunei, and accelerated 

its growth in the dairy business. Today, 

F&amp;N is the largest canned milk producer 

in SEA. In 1985, the Group diversified 

into the Properties business. Starting with 

the redevelopment of its soft drinks and 

brewery sites in Singapore, F&amp;N soon grew 

its property arm – Frasers Centrepoint 

Limited (“FCL”, now known as Frasers 

Property Limited) to become one of the 

leading property companies in Singapore 

with multi-national businesses in 

residential, hospitality, retail, commercial 

and industrial properties.

In 2012, F&amp;N divested its equity stake 

in APB to realise a substantial value 

for shareholders. In 2014, the Group 

demerged FCL through a listing on the 

Singapore Stock Exchange, thereby 

transferring value to shareholders.

Today, F&amp;N is a leading Southeast 

Asian consumer group with expertise 

and prominent standing in the Food 

&amp; Beverage and Publishing &amp; Printing 

industries. Leveraging its strengths in 

marketing and distribution, research 

and development, brands and financial 

management, as well as years of 

acquisition experience, the Group 

provides key resources and sets strategic 

directions for its subsidiary companies 

across both industries.

Listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange, 

F&amp;N ranks as one of the most established 

and successful companies in the region 

with an impressive array of renowned 

brands that enjoy strong market 

leadership. F&amp;N is present in 11 countries 

spanning Asia Pacific, Europe and the 

USA, and employs over 6,900 people 

worldwide.

F&amp;N SUSTAINABILITY PRIORITIES – MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

In 2020, F&amp;N conducted a robust materiality assessment with support from an independent consultant.

Step 1 – Identification: F&amp;N first conducted an external trends analysis to identify an initial list of 50 possible sustainability topics. 

After a further survey of peer best practices and a review of global initiatives and frameworks, the list was narrowed to 18 material 

sustainability topics. Materiality is considered based on the interactions between F&amp;N’s value chain and the physical environment 

and social community and its governance. 

Step 2 – Prioritisation: Internal and external stakeholders were engaged to prioritise the 18 material sustainability topics.  

This ensures that our ESG materiality assessment takes into consideration relevance to the business, strategy, business model and 

key stakeholders across the value chain.  

 

Over 950 employees from across the Group were surveyed.

 

Interviews with 17 key external stakeholders, including suppliers, customers, thought-leaders and regulators. 

 

Workshops with over 50 participants from F&amp;N senior leaders, department heads and subject matter experts in Singapore and 

Malaysia.

Based on stakeholder inputs received, the list of 18 material sustainability topics were plotted in a matrix based on their priority to 

stakeholders (external) and to F&amp;N’s business (internal). 

Step 3 – Validation: The materiality matrix was reviewed and endorsed by the F&amp;N SDC at their meeting on Aug 2020 and 

approved by the F&amp;N SRMC at their meeting in Sep 2020. 

We will continue to monitor sustainability trends and review our material topics annually.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY 

A circular business model can be defined as the way an organisation creates, delivers and captures value with, and within, 

closed material loops and chains.

The shift to a circular economy underpins progress on many of F&amp;N’s material topics. F&amp;N is committed to work toward a circular 

economy through the following principles:

 

Prioritising renewable inputs

 

Efficient use of products and materials

 

Recovering by-products and waste

Innovation

We tap into process innovation to improve 

resource efficiency and the reduction 

of raw material waste. Our product 

packaging designs and materials are 

reconsidered to enhance recyclability.

 Refer to the ‘Innovation’ section of the 

Report for more information.

Supply Chain Stewardship

We encourage our suppliers to follow 

circular economy principles in the 

production of raw materials – namely, 

designing out waste and pollution 

in production processes, keeping 

materials in use for as long as possible, 

and regenerating natural ecosystems – 

where possible.

 Refer to the ‘Supply Chain Stewardship’ 

section of the Report for more information.

Packaging

We proactively innovate and source 

sustainable packaging solutions that 

can be easily recycled, reused or 

composted. F&amp;N has a long-term target 

to increase the percentage of recycled 

materials used in our packaging.

 Refer to the ‘Packaging’ section of the 

Report for more information.

Energy

We reduce our energy demands, extract 

energy from renewable sources and/

or recover energy from our operations. 

F&amp;N has taken these steps by exploring 

the installation of solar panels for 

manufacturing plants in Singapore, 

Malaysia and Thailand. 

 Refer to the ‘Energy and Climate Change’ 

section of the Report for more information.

Water Stewardship

We manage our water usage through 

monitoring with appropriate tools and 

conducting water assessments. F&amp;N has 

implemented a water tracking system 

to calculate daily water consumption 

and effluent quality. Ways to recycle 

wastewater for cleaning or cooling 

purposes are being explored.

 Refer to the ‘Water Stewardship’ section  

of the Report for more information.

Waste Management

F&amp;N is committed to our zero-landfill 

target and does so by minimising waste in 

production. We work with our stakeholders 

to explore ways to reduce costs for them, 

by creating by-products from residual 

liquid or solid waste, where possible.

 Refer to the ‘Waste Management’ section  

of the Report for more information.

Community Development and  

Inclusive Growth

To raise awareness of circular economy 

and promote behavioural change, 

we conducted school education 

programmes in Malaysia and Thailand 

to promote good waste management 

practices. 

 Refer to the ‘Community Development and 

Inclusive Growth’ section of the Report for 

more information.

OUR KEY PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS 

GRI Index: GRI 102-12 (External Initiatives), GRI 102-13 (Membership of Associations)

We believe our sustainability journey is one where we proactively manage and understand the impacts of our footprint on the 

larger environment and society. As such, we partner with and take guidance from international organisations and sustainability 

thought leaders. F&amp;N is a proud member of the RSPO, Support Asia for Sustainable Palm Oil and the Buyer Supporting VIVE 

Sustainable Supply Chain Programme. 

In Malaysia, F&amp;NHB teamed up with key industry leaders to establish a voluntary, industry-led Extended Producer Responsibility – 

MAREA. The alliance is the first of its kind in Malaysia that focuses on improving collection and recycling of post-consumer packaging.

F&amp;NHB is also part of the CEO Action Network capacity building work stream that aims to uplift the sustainability capacity in 

supply chains and business ecosystems. F&amp;NHB representatives were speakers in a series of supplier and SME training sessions 

for two sustainability topics – Energy Management and Labour Practices.

F&amp;N is aligned with sustainability charters, principles and standards, including the United Nations SDGs, GRI and the 

International Integrated Reporting Council. 

EXTERNAL RECOGNITION

The achievements of our subsidiary, F&amp;NHB, toward environmental excellence was acknowledged through different 

prestigious awards received in Malaysia and Thailand. The awards included: 

2019/20 Prime Minister’s Hibiscus Award

The award is the premier private sector environmental award for business and industry in Malaysia. 

F&amp;NHB received three awards – two for F&amp;N Dairies Manufacturing Sdn Bhd and one for F&amp;N Beverages 

Manufacturing Sdn Bhd. 

Sarawak Chief Minister’s Environmental Award 2019/2020

Kuching Plant in Malaysia earned an accolade – Merit Award under the Medium Enterprise Category 

(Manufacturing sector) at the 9th Sarawak Chief Minister’s Environmental Award 2019/2020. This prestigious 

award recognises the environmental effort and commitment of industries, local authorities, and individuals.

Prime Minister (“PM”) Best Industry Award 2020 

Each year, only one selected company, from amongst all the qualifying companies from the different 

industries, would be presented with the PM Best Industry Award. To qualify for the PM Best Industry Award, 

companies will need to have previously received a minimum of at least three PM Awards (from among the 

nine PM Award categories). The eligible companies will then be further evaluated and scored based on

SDG:

ESG issues are incorporated in the formulation of F&amp;N’s 

business strategy. As part of the Board’s Conduct of 

Affairs, the Board “considers sustainability issues such as 

environmental and social factors as part of its strategic 

formulation”. Hence, F&amp;N’s long-term business direction is 

ensured by the Board to be guided by sustainability principles. 

They have an ultimate oversight of all sustainability issues. 

As a Board level committee, the F&amp;N SRMC is responsible  

for steering the Group’s on-going sustainability efforts.  

This committee ensures sustainability risks and opportunities 

are considered at the highest level of F&amp;N by providing 

strong support to the management team. The SRMC has the 

responsibility to approve all strategic initiatives and policies 

related to sustainability in F&amp;N.

The F&amp;N SDC supports the overall direction of the SRMC by 

monitoring and reporting the progress of F&amp;N’s sustainability 

projects. The SDC is supported by the Sustainability 

Development Working Team which consists of cross-functional 

representatives who take on various roles. They monitor the 

performance of designated goals, drive initiatives at an 

operational level, and gather data for reporting. In FY2021, 

the SRMC convened on sustainability matters three times,  

and the SDC three times.

Driving Sustainability

APPROACH

Risk Management 

F&amp;N integrates material sustainability topics into our overall Risk Management framework by identifying specific risks, 

opportunities, and key priorities to drive our strategic decisions. 

Sustainability risks are considered from three perspective: 

 

Review of risks from external sources, such as environmental trends, consumer trends, expectations from stakeholders, and legal 

and regulatory developments; 

 

Review of potential impact F&amp;N products have on the environment; and 

 

Review of new and emerging risks from external sources as well as within the organisation. 

Risk appetite and risk tolerance statements are reviewed by the SRMC and approved by the Board annually. At the end of the 

financial year, the Board receives assurance from the CEO and Chief Financial Officer that the risk management and internal 

control system is adequate and effective to address the risks from key material topics identified by the Group.

Risks are identified through the Enterprise Risk Management 

(“ERM”) Validation Report and Comfort Matrix, which assesses 

the likelihood of risk occurrence and potential impact on 

relevant business objectives. The outcomes of identified risks 

are consolidated in a Corporate Risk Scorecard as a reference 

for the rest of the Group. 

Each business division has a dedicated risk coordinator to 

conduct risk analyses with management. Risk coordinators 

compile reports for timely submission to division heads and 

conduct briefings on risk policies and practices. 

Examples of ESG-related risks considered F&amp;N Key Risks include: 

 

Increasing awareness of sugar consumption among 

consumers

 

Plastic usage and its impact on health and the 

environment

 

Supply chain management

 

Talent management

 

Product quality and safety

POLICY AND REGULATION 

GRI Index: GRI 307-1, GRI 419-1

SDG:

F&amp;N places a high importance on regulatory compliance 

across our operations and engages with policymakers in a 

responsible and transparent manner. 

Ensuring halal compliance and maintaining halal integrity is 

of utmost importance in Malaysia, a pre-dominantly Muslim 

country. It is F&amp;N’s imperative to ensure strict adherence and 

implementation of halal standards throughout our operations, 

and even the supply chain, to provide confidence to our 

Muslim consumers.

APPROACH

Halal Policy 

Halal integrity is maintained throughout F&amp;N’s supply chain, 

including our distributors and retailers. F&amp;N scrutinises the 

handling process of our ingredients in our operations and 

supply chain to prevent mixing non-halal ingredients with the 

halal ingredients.

F&amp;NHB has adopted a 2-tier halal management structure to 

drive halal development at the Group level: 

 

F&amp;NHB established a Group Halal Council in 2016 to 

determine policies and strategies, with the support of the 

Halal Affairs Department in implementation. 

F&amp;N supports the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 

Human Rights, International Labour Organisation (“ILO”) 

guidelines, Thailand’s Labour Protection Act and Malaysia 

Employment Act 1955, and has covered these guidelines and 

legal requirements in our internal policies. 

The F&amp;N Code of Business Conduct states the principles 

upheld by F&amp;N, which are related to integrity, respect, and 

excellence. This Code is communicated to our employees 

and is made available on our intranet. To disclose possible 

conflicts of interest with F&amp;N, an annual acknowledgement 

and declaration by employees is required. 

During the reporting year, F&amp;N executives went through training 

on risk management, ESG, anti-bribery, whistleblowing, and 

business ethics. The Board sets good principles of ethics and 

values for the Group, ensures proper accountability within the 

Group, and seeks to ensure that obligations to shareholders and 

other stakeholders are understood and met. In FY2021, there 

were no substantiated bribery cases and 4 corruption cases.  

The 4 corruption cases took place in Thailand and involved  

sales staff who misappropriated payment from customers.

 

Each of its manufacturing facilities has an internal 

Halal Committee that is responsible for all matters 

pertaining to Halal compliance in the supply chain; 

from the procurement of ingredients and raw materials, 

management of manufacturing facilities and personnel 

involved in production processes, to the storage, 

warehousing, and transportation of our products.

F&amp;N is awarded with product halal certifications by complying 

to halal audit requirements by regulatory authorities such as 

the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) and 

other relevant Islamic certification authorities, such as MUI, 

CICOT, MUIS and adherence to Good Halal Manufacturing 

Practices.

Halal Standards

 

F&amp;NHB’s products are halal certified by JAKIM and 

other relevant authorised Islamic certification bodies, in 

accordance with the Halalan Toyyiban standards and the 

Islamic Shariah Law requirements.

 

F&amp;NHB contributes to developing halal-related standards 

with the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (“FMM”) 

and JAKIM through trade associations, such as the 

Sertu standards and Malaysian Standard 1514 Good 

Manufacturing Practice (GMP for food).

 

F&amp;N commits to adhering with the halal standards and 

requirements by strengthening our employees’ awareness 

and understanding through the following initiatives:

- 

Regular halal awareness training programme.

- 

Auditing our distributors and training transporters to 

actively ensure the downstream of our supply chain is 

halal compliant.

- 

Perform Sertu (ritual cleansing) on our second-hand 

machines brought into our factories.

- 

Strictly prohibit non-halal food/drinks within factory 

premises, including the office and canteen.

PERFORMANCE 

F&amp;N is an apolitical company and does not contribute in any 

way to any political party or activity. 

We are an active member of various trade associations such 

as FMM, Thai Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Thai 

Industry and Thai Dairy Industry Association. 

Policy and Regulatory Body Engagements 

 

Business Continuity during COVID-19

 

To adapt our business operations to the COVID-19 

restrictions, F&amp;N worked closely with relevant regulatory 

bodies – like the Ministry of Health and Ministry of 

International Trade and Industry in Malaysia, to ensure 

business continuity. F&amp;NHB obtained relevant approvals for 

maintaining operations during the lockdown in Malaysia 

and secured maximum output while subjected to reduced 

production hours and workforce, as stipulated by the 

authorities.

Responsible Business Practice

 

Product and Service Labelling

 

We ensure that our marketing and advertising activities 

do not violate any ethical standards. F&amp;NHB adheres to 

the Malaysian Code of Advertising Practice in Malaysia 

and the Consumer Protection Act of B.E. 2522 (1979) 

in Thailand. In Malaysia, F&amp;NHB is a signatory to the 

‘Responsible Advertising to Children’ initiative and have 

pledged to restrict marketing to children under 12 years  

of age.

 

Quality Management

 

We adhere to all health and safety regulations applicable 

to the F&amp;B industry for the markets in which we operate. 

All F&amp;N products are manufactured under stringent 

international quality and food safety standards; our 

production processes at every stage are subjected to 

rigorous quality control procedures.

 

Nutrition

 

F&amp;N has collaborated with authorities like Singapore’s 

Health Promotion Board, Singapore Food Agency, Ministry 

of Health, and FMM to adhere to food safety regulations. 

 

Employee Safety, Health and Well-being

 

Safety is integrated across our operations through the 

implementation of Environmental, Safety and Health 

(“ESH”) systems and monitoring processes. Our adhesion 

to international standards – ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 

for our major sites, demonstrates our commitment to 

extend our safety practices beyond compliance with 

national regulations. All employees, workers and activities 

are covered by our ESH systems, and all workers receive 

adequate training and safety equipment as appropriate.

 

Environmental Compliance and Management

 

The F&amp;B manufacturing process involves the generation of 

liquid (effluent) and solid wastes. We strive to improve our 

solid waste management by identifying key waste streams 

that we can recycle and reduce waste from.

 

 

Our ESH Policy and adherence to the circular economy 

principles provides waste management guidance to F&amp;N 

– e.g. the quality of our effluent discharges. We apply strict 

standards to our waste management and continuously 

explore alternative uses for ‘waste’ from our operations.

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

GRI Index: GRI 201-1

F&amp;N’s business success is based upon long-term value 

creation for our stakeholders. This is achieved by maintaining 

leadership in our core markets, leveraging innovative 

technologies, engaging our employees’ expertise to meet 

consumers’ evolving demands, and to enter new markets.  

Our economic performance provides us with a firm foundation 

to continue delivering the products our customers love.

The F&amp;N Business Model is explained in detail on page 16 of 

this Report. F&amp;N’s economic performance depends upon six 

capitals – Financial, Manufactured, Intellectual, Human, Social 

and Relation, and Natural. Our sustainability initiatives support 

F&amp;N’s abilities to create financial value.

PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY

GRI Index: GRI 416-2

SDG:

Product Quality and Safety is a core principle embedded in F&amp;N’s culture. Our 138 years of success is built on offering products 

that have earned the trust, created the satisfaction, and have considered the well-being of our consumers. This requires a 

holistic approach to quality and safety across our products.

APPROACH

From boots to boardroom, we promote a culture of good product quality and safety standards. F&amp;N adheres to all health 

and safety regulations applicable to the F&amp;B industry for the markets we operate in. Our plants are certified with international 

standards – FSSC 22000, ISO 22000 and HACCP Food Safety management systems, and our production processes at all stages 

are subjected to rigorous quality control procedures. The F&amp;N SRMC regularly reviews the key risks relating to product quality  

and safety. 

All critical suppliers were audited on food safety regulations and standards, and none were found to be non-compliant this year. 

We assess a range of quality assurance and food security criteria to safeguard the health of consumers and the safety of workers 

in our supply chain. Our suppliers are assessed on the basis of: the implementation and monitoring of good manufacturing 

processes, use of protective clothing, food safety management systems, and chemical management.

Responsible Product Stewardship

We are committed to good product quality and food safety and have obtained  

local and international certifications, such as:

Our production facilities follow strict operational procedures to ensure our products are stored and transported in good 

condition, e.g. appropriate temperature range, lighting and stress on packages. 

At F&amp;N, we believe listening and acting on customers’ feedback is critical to the customer experience. We provide multiple 

communication channels for customers to connect with us and share their feedback or enquiries – our product website, email 

address, or F&amp;N’s social media accounts like Facebook and Line. In Singapore, we have a hotline for customers to contact  

us directly.

2025 TARGETS 

F&amp;N has set a 2025 target to achieve 100% of plants and production processes certified with the FSSC scheme 22000 and Halal 

Standard (or equivalent). At the end of FY 2021, 100% of our plants are certified halal, with 63% certified with FSSC 22000.

We focus our efforts on ensuring high halal standards through a holistic approach – incorporate a high halal standards culture, 

strengthen internal control, engage private and public stakeholders, and maintain halal communications. In the coming years, we will 

explore other initiatives to meet this target by 2025. More details can be found in the ‘Policy and Regulation’ section of the Report.

Packaging and labelling are the primary means for F&amp;N to communicate information about our product quality, nutrition, safety, 

and disposal methods in a transparent manner. It is essential that our labelling is comprehensive, accurate and clear for our 

consumers to make informed purchasing decisions.

APPROACH

Our comprehensive processes and controls ensure our labelling adheres to Singapore Food Regulations and to the guidelines set 

by the Singapore Food Agency. F&amp;N adheres to the Food Act in Malaysia and all requirements of the Food and Drug Administration 

in Thailand. 

All information disclosed on our labels are reviewed regularly by internal experts from Research and Development (“R&amp;D”) teams, 

Scientific &amp; Regulatory Affairs teams, and dieticians, to ensure rigorous quality standards. Labels are then submitted to government 

authorities for verification and endorsement.

Responsible Product Stewardship


39

Fraser and Neave, Limited  

&amp; Subsidiary Companies

Sustainability Report 2021

F&amp;N goes beyond mandatory labelling requirements because we believe our customers deserve clarity and transparency in their 

purchases. Some of such comprehensive information included in our labels are – the Nutrition information panel at the back-

of-pack which is not mandated by current regulations, the HCS and Healthier Choice Logo (“HCL”) for relevant products in 

Singapore and Malaysia, respectively, and the energy icon at the front-of-pack for selected products in Malaysia. The Halal logo 

is also displayed on our Halal certified products for our Muslim consumers to easily identify suitable products that meet their diet 

requirements.

Our customers are increasingly concerned about the environmental footprint of our products. 100% of F&amp;N products with carton 

packaging are Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certified cartons and labelled as such. FSC cartons are from responsibly 

managed forests and other controlled sources where new trees replace the ones harvested, through planting or natural 

regeneration.

We strictly adhere to marketing and advertising policies – the Singapore Code of Advertising Practice, Malaysian Code of 

Advertising Practice and the Consumer Protection Act of B.E. 2522 (1979) in Thailand. In Malaysia, F&amp;NHB is a signatory to the 

‘Responsible Advertising to Children’ initiative and have pledged to restrict marketing to children under 12 years of age. F&amp;NHB 

adopts the guidelines by the Malaysian Advertisers Association, which pledges to ethical marketing standards, on a voluntary 

basis. F&amp;N ensures our employees are aware and up to date with our stance on marketing ethics. Existing employees go through 

an annual training as a refresher course and our new marketing and communication hires participate in marketing ethics training 

during their new hire orientation.

INNOVATION 

SDGs:

Innovation is central to F&amp;N’s long-term business success.  

It represents a response to growing concerns about social 

and environmental issues. By investing in product and process 

innovation, F&amp;N is able to evolve to deliver new and unique 

product offerings which cater to consumers’ changing needs 

and improve production efficiency. We are further guided by 

the circular economy principles – to continuously innovate for 

longer shelf life and improve the recyclability of our product 

packaging to reduce waste. This year, we achieved 9% of 

product innovation for commercialised F&amp;N products.

APPROACH

F&amp;N’s R&amp;D Unit in Singapore is supported by teams in 

Malaysia and Thailand. The unit leads efforts for continuous 

improvements to our product formulas according to changes 

in consumer preferences and the regulatory environment, 

while exploring methods to improve our products’ functional 

benefits and shelf life. F&amp;N collaborates with Nanyang 

Technological University (“NTU”) through the F&amp;N-NTU Food &amp; 

Beverage Innovation Lab in Singapore to foster research that 

will result in better food packaging and conversions of spent 

produce from food processing as future valuable resources.

Employee-Driven Process Innovation 

At F&amp;N, the two aspects of employee-driven process innovation are:

Cost and eco-efficiency – F&amp;N reviews the current system processes to improve efficiency in our plants through innovation – 

enabling water savings, reduction in GHG emissions and minimising resource consumption. We leverage on circular economy 

principles to reuse and recycle wastewater where possible. More details can be found in the ‘Energy and Climate Change’ and 

‘Water Stewardship’ sections of this Report.

Cultivating an innovative mind-set – We encourage a ground-up empowerment of employees throughout our Business Units by 

cultivating an innovative culture. This year, our employees have contributed to F&amp;N’s innovation efforts through our flagship Way 

of Work (“WOW”) Award – an innovation competition organised for employees.

WOW Award

Organised by ThaiBev, F&amp;N’s parent company, the WOW Award competition encourages employees to present new 

concepts, business models, or processes that will support the organisation in cost reductions and efficiency gains.  

F&amp;N employees participated in the competition to drive process innovation within the organisation. The outcomes were two 

notable projects –TEAPOT Duo Sachet, increase convenience for our consumers, and an operational efficiency initiative 

that improves nutrition in fresh milk (details can be found in the ‘Nutrition’ section of the Report).

The TEAPOT Duo Sachet is a new portable packaging that increases convenience for our consumers. The working team 

called “X men double sachet” devised the idea and was the runner up in the WOW Award competition. They developed  

the TEAPOT Duo Sachet from a F&amp;N existing tube machine that was modified and resulted in cost savings of about  

THB 3 million (about SGD 122,000) for F&amp;NHB.

Responsible Supply Chain

In today’s world, a resilient supply chain is key to ensuring business success. F&amp;N collaborates with our partners upstream of the 

supply chain to mitigate supply chain risks. In the following chapter, we elaborate on how we engage and work with our suppliers 

to reduce environmental and social impacts of F&amp;N products. 

SUPPLY CHAIN STEWARDSHIP

GRI Index: GRI 204-1, GRI 308-1, GRI 414-1

SDGs:

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive disruptions to global supply chain. Other key supply chain risk factors include 

changing weather and climate conditions, regulatory changes imposed by the government, human rights risks – poor working 

conditions, and forced and child labour. Having a resilient and sustainable supply chain enables us to manage the cost of raw 

materials and ensure it is sustainably sourced as they have direct impact on F&amp;N operations and the bottom line of the business.

APPROACH

As a market-leading F&amp;B company, we constantly work with the counterparts of our supply chain, including business partners, 

suppliers and vendors, to understand their needs, and deliver mutually sustainable solutions that create long lasting value.  

We encourage our stakeholders to improve their sustainability performance throughout the supply chain, where applicable,  

and lead by example. 

The cornerstones to our Supply Chain Stewardship are as follows:

PERFORMANCE

3 

VIVE is a voluntary, continuous improvement sustainability programme for ingredient supply chains, covering all operations and activities for producers through to 

end users that have a bearing on sustainability.

INITIATIVES

Sustainable Paper 

Paper is an essential component in F&amp;N’s printing 

operations, we understand the importance of sourcing 

paper sustainably and supporting sustainable forest 

management.

Times Publishing Group, our subsidiary firm, is certified with 

Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification 

(“PEFC”) Chain of Custody. The PEFC Chain of Custody 

certification tracks forest-based products from sustainable 

sources to the finished product. Each step of the supply 

chain is closely monitored through independent auditing to 

ensure that unsustainable sources are excluded. This is an 

ongoing initiative since 2009.

While 100% of our paper products used in carton 

packaging carry the FSC certification. 

Sustainable Palm Oil

Palm oil is a widely used raw material in F&amp;B products and 

is one of the raw materials in our supply chain. Irresponsible 

palm oil cultivation has caused — and continues to  

cause — significant environmental and social damage.  

As such F&amp;N understands the importance of our actions 

and business practices on the support for sustainable palm 

oil production. 

F&amp;N became an ordinary member of the RSPO in August 

2017 to reiterate our support for the use of CSPO in 

products. Currently, 100% of palm oil used at F&amp;N is RSPO 

certified. 20% of the RSPO CSPO is physical while 80% is 

offset by RSPO credits. Out of the 227 global companies 

which had participated in the WWF POBS 2021, F&amp;N was  

ranked 46. This puts us in the top 25% across all 

manufacturers/retailers/hospitality companies which  

were invited to participate, and the highest scoring 

amongst the Asian companies. 

 For more information on F&amp;N Group’s ranking in the palm oil buyers 

score card, visit this site: https://palmoilscorecard.panda.org/#/

scores/46

Sustainable Sugar 

Sugar is a critical raw material for F&amp;N’s products.  

We procure sustainable sugar under the guidance of the 

VIVE sugar certification programme.3 F&amp;N is also exploring 

the possibility of using BONSUCRO certified sugar products 

for our operations in Thailand. This year, F&amp;N has procured 

24,000 metric tonnes of VIVE certified sustainable sugar. 

This is the second year that F&amp;N has purchased VIVE-certified 

sustainable sugar.

Sustainable Sourcing

As a F&amp;B business, we are dependent on the supply of raw 

materials including sugar, palm oil, aluminium and resin 

for production operations. We aim to source raw materials 

certified with eco-credentials, including RSPO, VIVE, 

BONSUCRO and FSC, whenever possible, as part of our 

sustainable supply chain strategy.

Driving Sustainability

Policies

F&amp;N supports the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 

Human Rights and F&amp;NHB is a member of the Supplier Ethical 

Data Exchange. The 2025 target is to ensure that suppliers are 

compliant with the F&amp;N SCOP. By the end of FY2021, 67% are 

compliant with the F&amp;N SCOP. 

Our SCOP includes the following requirements: business 

ethics,4 whistle blowing, communications, competitors, 

environmental management, human rights, and occupational 

health and safety. Suppliers are expected to treat their 

employees equally, with respect and dignity, in accordance 

with the ILO standards and applicable labour laws under 

the SCOP. This covers child and compulsory labour, equality, 

human capital development, layoff practices, wages and 

benefits, and working hours. 

Supplier Management – Identify Risks 

High or variable costs and uncertain availability of raw 

materials pose commercial risks to F&amp;N. To mitigate these 

risks, especially key risks, we established a BCP to proactively 

ensure product supply. 

Screening

F&amp;N has a systematic screening process for all new suppliers 

on environmental and social criteria. These criteria reflect 

the commitments towards the environment (such as reducing 

waste, pollution and water usage) and society (including 

human rights and labour practices). Suppliers are assessed 

annually to verify if they have:

1. Implemented an environmental policy

2. Undertaken audits to monitor environmental performance 

and compliance 

3. Maintain an ISO14001 compliant Environmental 

Management System 

During the pre-qualification screening of suppliers, we assess 

our suppliers on delivery capacity, technical capabilities, ESG 

company policies and certifications. 

 

Critical Suppliers Identification 

Critical suppliers are active direct (tier 1) material suppliers 

with a sales value greater than MYR 1 million per annum 

(for F&amp;NHB suppliers) and/or irreplaceable suppliers. Direct 

material suppliers are those who supply packaging materials, 

raw ingredients and auxiliary materials. Irreplaceable 

suppliers are single-source suppliers. We conduct a vendor 

performance evaluation for critical suppliers annually and 

consider their sustainability performance.

Antitrust, business gift, legal compliance, confidentiality and conflict of interest.

Supplier Capacity Building and Partnerships 

In the past year, we have engaged with over 4,000 global 

and local suppliers across our supply chain, including 

manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, importers/merchants, 

contractors and professional service providers. A successful 

case study on our supplier capacity building and partnership 

programme this year is Farming Excellence System in 

Thailand. 

Farming Excellence System – Thailand 

Since 2013, F&amp;N has been collaborating with local Thailand-

based farmers in cooperatives that supply F&amp;NDT with fresh 

milk. Our efforts last year focused on Nakhorn Ratchasima 

Province reaching to 2,000 farmers. This year, we channelled 

our efforts to Chaiyaphum Province.

Supplier engagement at F&amp;NDT takes a ground-up and 

collaborative approach. Understanding the challenges 

brought about by weather and climate change, from the 

dairy farmers, F&amp;NDT installed a large water storage tank to 

increase water security. This minimises the need to travel long 

distances to access reservoirs and water resources, especially 

during times of droughts. This THB 460,000 (about SGD 

18,700) investment is able to supply 1.68 million litres of water 

every month for up to 180 households across communities in 

Chaiyaphum Province. This provides a sufficient water supply 

for up to 24 farms, consisting of over 950 cattle, to minimise 

disruptions from droughts and ensure farmers can continue 

their farming operations sustainably, and enhance the supply 

chain resilience of F&amp;NDT. 

Supplier Management – Monitor Risks

Monitoring, Auditing and Corrective Action Planning

The Group works closely with our suppliers and conducts 

regular audits to ensure standards and practices for food 

safety and the environment are maintained throughout the 

value chain. Non-compliant or underperforming suppliers 

must demonstrate their commitment to taking necessary 

corrective actions within a predefined period, or risk having 

contracts terminated. 

F&amp;N exploring the update of the evaluation checklist to 

include additional ESG criteria, such as corporate governance 

and human rights.

Creating Value for Society

As an industry leader in the F&amp;B sector, F&amp;N believes it is our role as a corporate citizen to create value for our consumers, 

and the communities in our operational markets. We have created value through offering healthy products to our consumers, 

supporting local communities, and advocating for human rights. Our efforts are further elaborated in the following sections:

GRI Index: GRI 416-1, GRI 416-2

SDGs:

Consumer F&amp;B trends across the world are shifting. “Quality” is redefined by consumers to focus on affordable nutritious 

products. Yet many see cost as a barrier to improving their diet and health. This drives F&amp;N to constantly reinvent, reformulate, 

and release new and improved products annually by focusing on reducing the sugar level of our beverages and fortifying the key 

nutrients in our products, to expand the availability of affordable nutritional beverages. 

APPROACH

Our increasing health and nutrition ambition focuses on: 

 

Reducing sugar levels

 

Catering to consumers with diverse dietary needs

F&amp;N’s product development team continues to expand the health and nutrition profile of our portfolio. It is important for F&amp;N to 

provide products with healthier option that do not compromise on our consumers’ enjoyment. More details on the new products 

can be found in the ‘Innovation’ section of the Report.

Improving consumers’ health is F&amp;N’s top priority. Our philosophy of ‘Pure Enjoyment. Pure Goodness’ is our commitment to 

consumers to deliver tasty and good quality products packed with nutritional goodness.  Together with promoting an active 

lifestyle, F&amp;N aims to offer products that satisfy our consumers and enhance their health and well-being. 

The F&amp;N Nutrition Charter outlines our commitment to developing products that are healthy for consumers and guides us 

through our product development. 

 

Principles of the Nutrition Charter: 

Led by  our brand 

promise of ‘Pure 

Enjoyment. Pure 

Goodness’ to 

consumers - to deliver 

products which are 

not only great-tasting 

but also packed with 

nutritional goodness

To develop products 

based on proven 

scientific evidence 

and research, and 

consumer insights and 

tastes relevant  

to evolving Asian 

lifestyles

To actively self-

regulate and ensure 

accountability via 

strong corporate 

governance

To provide safe,  

high-quality and 

affordable products  

to all our consumers

To innovate and 

constantly refine our 

products to meet the 

changing needs of 

all our consumers 

and ensure consistent 

delivery of good 

taste and the right 

nutritional values

INITIATIVES

Reducing Sugar Content

Over 60% of our RTD products portfolio this year are certified HCS/HCL. Since 2004, F&amp;N has taken deliberate steps in reducing 

the sugar content of our RTD products. We have achieved a reduction of 5% in the sugar index (grams of sugar content per 

100ml) across our range of RTD products, in Singapore and Malaysia, as compared to last year. 

2025 TARGET

67% of beverage (excluding Cordial) and dairy (excluding Canned Milk) products (based on formulation) in compliance with 

Nutritional Guidelines.

 

In 2021, 62% of beverage (excluding Cordial) and dairy (excluding Canned Milk) products (based on formulation) are in 

compliance with Nutritional Guidelines.

Catering to consumers with dietary restrictions and preferences

F&amp;N provides alternative, and healthier options for consumers with food intolerances, such as lactose free milk. Lactose free 

milk is available in Singapore and Thailand, and F&amp;N plans to expand this offering to Malaysia. We are exploring new product 

categories, such as plant-based milk, which F&amp;NHB intends to launch next year.  

F&amp;N increased its products with HCS/HCL from around 50 in FY2020 to over 140 in FY2021. 

WOW Project

The delivery of high-quality fresh milk to our consumers meets many challenges from production to logistics. The greatest 

obstacle in producing fresh milk is the wait at the farm before it is collected for delivery to the factory – risking contamination of 

the milk from microbial growth. Prioritising the safety of the product, fresh milk typically undergoes high heat treatment. However, 

this affects the quality of fresh milk with nutrient loss and increases the cost of production.

As part of the WOW Project – an internal innovation challenge (details in ‘Innovation’ section of the Report), F&amp;N employees 

developed two alternative solutions that maintain high nutrition value and increase efficiency:

 

A digital platform to encourage traceability throughout the supply chain that support the farmers and distributors to improve 

fresh milk quality. The implementation of this solution reduced the time of receiving fresh milk by 70%. 

 

A new transportation method for fresh milk, with the use of route planning to reduce transportation time required. The solution 

involves active real time monitoring of the fresh milk during transit.

GRI Index: GRI 413-1

SDGs:

F&amp;N recognises that the scale of our operations in the region goes beyond impacting our consumers. We connect and support local 

communities by maintaining positive relationships and strengthening them between different cultures to promote social inclusion. 

APPROACH AND INITIATIVES 

In each market F&amp;N operates in, we undertake several short and long-term programmes that serve to create greater social 

equity. We developed five thematic areas to focus our community endeavours on.

Creating Value for Society

Strengthening Vulnerable Groups

Offering COVID-19 Relief 

As the COVID-19 pandemic prolongs, so will the devastating effects on the vulnerable and marginalised groups. The toll from 

the pandemic will further deepen inequality causing a greater global challenge. Our consumers and employees come from 

all segments of society and the widening inequality of wealth and opportunities undermine the development potential of our 

communities and also our business.

Offering COVID-19 Relief 

Healthcare workers and resources around the world were stretched thin as the world grapples with the influx of COVID-19 

patients. F&amp;N showed our support and appreciation for the healthcare workers in Malaysia with our beverages to keep them 

hydrated and energised. As part of our ongoing commitment to support Malaysians during the COVID-19 pandemic,  

a 100PLUS hydration booth was set up at vaccination centres for vaccine recipients and front-line medical staff. F&amp;NHB also 

provided logistical support through the #HidratkanDiriSihatkanBadan campaign, to raise public awareness on the importance 

of maintaining optimal hydration levels during post-vaccination. 

In Thailand, F&amp;N products were donated to Uthai Community Hospital, Uthai Hospital, and Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital. 

F&amp;N stands in solidarity with and support the communities where we operate.

In Singapore, F&amp;N partnered with other non-profit and government agencies to work with the Ministry of Culture, Community 

and Youth to donate products to frontline workers – estate cleaners, safety management officers, and healthcare workers,  

to show our support for the local communities.

Collection of food items for distribution to those in need 

with Food Bank

Since 2007, F&amp;NHB has partnered with schools across 

Malaysia to educate the next generation on the importance 

of environmental conservation. The number of schools 

participating in this programme have grown from 360 in 

2019 to 961 schools in 2021. 

The Waste Bank and Recycling Project was set up in two 

local schools in Thailand, approximately THB 150,000 (about 

SGD 6,100) was spent on improving the waste management 

infrastructure – setting up recycling stations to renovating 

waste storage areas. Through these projects students get 

inculcated with good recycling habits and obtained tangible 

monetary benefits by selling the recyclables collected.

School Recycling Program

Singapore: Recycle N Save

Companies have a critical role to play in minimising our environmental footprint and leading sustainable development 

in societies. As we continue to move towards a circular economy model in our business, we exchange knowledge with 

communities and learn from them to better implement our ideas. Establishing partnerships with communities to promote 

environmental consciousness is our key priority.

Recycle N Save is a joint initiative by F&amp;N and the National 

Environment Agency (“NEA”) of Singapore. To date, the 

initiative saw the collection of over 3.3 million aluminium cans 

and 4.8 million PET bottles for recycling. More details can be 

found in the ‘Packaging’ section of this Report on pages 82 

and 83. 



To tackle this issue, F&amp;N focused its efforts on supporting 

underprivileged children through investing in educational 

programmes.

Since 2010, F&amp;NHB had invested a total of RM200,000  

(about SGD 64,900) for the F&amp;NHB ICDL Annual Programme. 

The funds have equipped three F&amp;NHB IT Corners in Malaysia 

with basic electronic equipment and funded the ICDL 

vocational programme. To date, 585 children have excelled 

and graduated with the ICDL certification. ICDL is the world’s 

leading computer skills certification.

100PLUS’ delivered supplies to frontline workers in hospitals, 

police stations and fire stations.

F&amp;N partnered with the Indian Muslim Social Service 

Association to spread the festive cheer to underprivileged 

families by donating F&amp;N products – F&amp;N SEASONS Ice 

Lemon Green Tea and F&amp;N SEASONS Ice Peach Tea for 

including in the festive hampers. Festive hampers were 

distributed to over 100 underprivileged households in 

Singapore.

F&amp;N’s products contribute to the health and wellbeing 

of our communities. We have a long and proud tradition 

of promoting active lifestyles in the community; from 

grassroots developments to elite levels. We believe sports 

have an important role in all societies and is a powerful tool 

to support nation-building. 

Lowering the barrier of access to sports and encouraging 

participation among youth is vital because it teaches 

core values like cooperation and respect, while instilling 

discipline and confidence within the individual. It is for 

this reason that 100PLUS is passionate in supporting 

schools and grassroots sports programmes, especially in 

football and badminton, to nurture future generations of 

champions.

Policy Commitment

F&amp;N Human Rights commitment applies to all employees of F&amp;N, 

including our stakeholders throughout our value chain – such as 

suppliers and business partners.

HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY

Principles and Rationales

Fraser and Neave, Limited (“F&amp;N”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) operate their 

business with integrity, honesty, fairness and full compliance with all applicable 

laws. The Group adheres to the principles and provisions of the Code of Corporate 

Governance 2018 as well as to the Group’s “Code of Business Conduct”.  

We are committed to taking responsibility for our impact on society and treating 

all of our stakeholders with dignity, respect, fairness without discrimination, and 

consideration for their human rights. Our stakeholders include employees, business 

partners, suppliers and communities throughout our value chain. We believe that 

to enhance our business sustainably and to contribute positively to the society, it is 

crucial to respect the human rights and the relevant principles of all stakeholders 

in our value chain.

To promote and respect the rights of all stakeholder groups, we established the 

Group’s Human Rights Policy that upholds under domestic and international laws, 

rules, and regulations. The Human Rights Policy was developed to align with the 

related human rights principles under the international standards, including the 

United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the United Nations 

Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (“UNGP”), United Nations Global 

Compact, and the International Bill of Human Rights and The International Labor 

Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 

Definitions

The Group 

Refers to Fraser &amp; Neave Limited, or F&amp;N, and subsidiaries 

where the Group holds more than 50% of their shares and has 

management control.

Employees 

Refers to all employees who work under an employment contract 

with the Group, covering all positions.

Suppliers 

Refers to contractors, sub-contractors, manufacturers, primary 

producers, importers/merchants, and professional service 

providers.

Business Partners 

Refers to agents, joint venture partners and customers

Scope of the Policy

The Group’s Human Rights Policy applies to all activities (i.e., direct activities, products, 

or services), as well as to all of F&amp;N’s directors, executive officers, employees, and all 

business operations and associated activities. The Group’s suppliers and business 

partners are expected and strongly encouraged to support and align with our Human 

Rights Policy and commitments, where applicable.

Moreover, we extend these expectations and commitments throughout the Group’s  

value chain, to all relevant stakeholders and affected rights holders, including: customers, 

local communities, the Group’s indirect employees (i.e. third-party contracted labor)  

and vulnerable groups (i.e. women, pregnant women, children, Indigenous People, 

foreign/migrant workers, local communities, minority groups, refugees, stateless 

individuals, disabled people, elderly, and LGBTQI+ identifying individuals).

The Group’s human rights commitments include: 

• 

Prohibition of child labor, forced labor, human trafficking, and discrimination and 

harassment.

• 

Respecting and promoting fairness, diversity, the right to freedom of association 

and collective bargaining, and fair remuneration. Also, fair working conditions, 

addressing the elimination of excessive working hours and supporting the right 

to a minimum or living wage, where required by the country’s regulation. We also 

respect and promote health and safety, data privacy and the environment of our 

stakeholders.

We expect all our stakeholders to be aware and align with these human rights 

commitments, where applicable. 

Practices and Guidelines of the Policy

To meet our human rights commitment, the Group effectively oversees our human 

rights management, and performance through the Group’s Human Rights Due 

Diligence (“HRDD”), which is in-line with UNGP’s human rights framework. As part of the 

HRDD, we conduct a Human Rights Risk Assessment (“HRRA”) for all own operations 

in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand and its associated activities in our value chain. 

The scope of the HRRA aligns with the scope of the Group’s Human Rights Policy. 

The risk assessment covers all previously mentioned stakeholders, rights holders, and 

vulnerable groups at risk of human rights violations, as well as, the human rights issues 

outlined in our commitments. Moving forward, we aim to progressively incorporate this 

to all of our existing operations.

1. Employee Practices

Our human rights commitments have been incorporated into all aspects of our Human 

Capital management. We ensure respect of human rights for all of our employees 

through incorporation of human rights aspects into our Code of Business Conduct. This 

includes respect for human dignity, human rights for every person, and zero tolerance 

for discrimination, whether due to differences in ethnicity, race, nationality, gender, 

language, age, skin color, physical status, religion, political view, education, social 

status, culture, tradition, union membership, gender identity or any other status which is 

considered to be a human right.

environment. The Group ensures effective health &amp; safety policies are up-to-date 

and effective in order to prevent accidents, injuries, and work-related illnesses arising 

from business activities in accordance with the standards imposed by applicable 

laws and international standards.

The Group has established easily accessible reporting channels (as stated in the 

Whistle-Blowing Policy and Grievance Policy) for employees to report and feedback on 

issues. They are encouraged to report any form of human rights violations arising from 

F&amp;N’s business operation through those reporting channels. As specified in the F&amp;N 

Whistle-Blowing Policy, F&amp;N shall protect, support and treat any whistle-blower fairly.

The Group will establish awareness building and training to employees to understand 

their roles, duties, and responsibilities related to human rights and to perform their 

duties in accordance with our human rights commitments and guidelines. 

2. Business Partner Practices

The Group commits to fair treatment for all business partners without discrimination. 

We expect our business partners to align with our Human Rights Policy, and any relevant 

human rights laws, practices, and standards, where applicable. We also encourage 

our business partners to apply our human rights commitments in their management 

approaches. We ensure that our customers receive products and services that are of 

good quality, safe, fair and equitable pricing and promote health and nutrition.

3. Supplier Practices

The Group commits to fair treatment for all suppliers without discrimination.  

We communicate and support suppliers and business partners to do business with 

ethics, respect for human rights of others and treating others fairly.

The Group expects and encourages all suppliers to conduct their business in 

accordance with our commitments on human rights, including promoting the right 

to freedom of association and collective bargaining, addressing the elimination 

of excessive working hours and supporting the right to a minimum or living wage, 

where required by the country’s regulation, and animal welfare, and to adhere to 

the principles of fair and business ethics, as well as applicable laws and regulations. 

Child and forced labor, and other illegal forms of labor are strictly prohibited.

Our Sustainable Procurement Policy and sourcing practices cover our full commitment 

to standard principles of ethical business practices throughout the supply chain, and 

to adhere to guidelines and principles of fair play and transparency. Our sourcing 

practices take into consideration environmental, social, governance, and economic 

factors in our suppliers’ selections. We also focus on local sourcing to contribute to 

local economic development when applicable.

Our Supplier Code of Practice outlines our commitments and expectations for 

suppliers relating to business ethics, environmental management, health and safety, 

and human rights. We encourage and support our suppliers to have appropriate 

measures in place for preventing, mitigating, managing, and remedying the human 

rights violations potentially arising from their business operations. Any forms of 

human rights violations found shall be addressed and will not be ignored by the 

Group.

4. Community &amp; Environmental Practices

The Group commits to ensuring that our operations and business activities produce 

no direct human rights violations for surrounding communities and the environment. 

We operate our businesses responsibly through giving considerations towards 

potential impacts on communities and the surrounding environment. The Group 

has established an Environmental Policy as well as management guidelines for 

conducting business activities and minimizing environmental impacts as much as 

applicable. We aim to strengthen positive relationships with all stakeholders, and 

for fair and transparent treatment of stakeholders to prevent any violations of their 

human rights. 

The Group continuously tracks, monitors, and assesses our human rights risks, and 

have developed whistleblowing and complaint/feedback channels where inputs on 

issues and concerns related to human rights violations can be submitted. We will 

communicate and educate employees on our human rights practices. We promote 

and support cooperation from all directors, executives, employees, and all groups 

of stakeholders within the business value chain in reporting on any forms of human 

rights suspicions, incidents, and violations arising from the business operations 

through the Group’s established and dedicated channels.

The results from these channels will be used to consider any improvements, and 

to develop appropriate mitigation and remediation measures. We evaluate the 

implementation on human rights policies and mitigation measures, according to 

the tracking and monitoring processes. A person who has commited a violation 

of human rights will be subjected to the disciplinary action process, and punished 

according to the Conduct and Discipline section in the F&amp;N Group Human Capital 

Handbook. If such violation is against the applicable laws, legal proceedings may 

also be initiated. 

We are determined to conduct the HRDD process regularly to identify/review and 

evaluate any risks and impacts relating to a violation of human rights caused by 

the Group’s business operations and associated activities. Our Human Rights 

Performances will be reported annually in our Sustainability Report. 

This Human Rights Policy Statement consolidates the existing human rights 

commitments reflected in our existing corporate commitments, control and 

procedures, processes, and management approaches.   

F&amp;N Human Rights Policy was developed in accordance with related human rights principles under international standards – 

the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human 

Rights, United Nations Global Compact, the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s 

Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The Human Rights Policy upholds under domestic and 

international laws, rules, and regulations. The Human Rights Policy extends to all companies under the F&amp;N Group.

Our newly acquired business, Sri Nona, has also undergone our Human Rights Risk Assessment. F&amp;N will look into conducting 

assessments for new business relations (i.e. mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures), where possible, moving forward. 

Methodology of Human Rights Risk Assessment

1. Human Rights Issues identification

 

Identify human rights issues for F&amp;N Group’s own operations, value chain and new business relations by considering the 

impact to the business and on potential rights holders. We benchmarked peer companies in the dairy and beverage sectors 

and acknowledged global human rights trends to improve our understanding on the impact of human rights issues.  

2. Inherent Risk Ranking

 

Rank risks of the identified human rights issues that do not have controls and/or measures in place.

3. Residual Risk Ranking

 

Rank risks of identified human rights issues that exist even with the company’s controls and/or measures.

4. Risk Prioritisation

 

Prioritise salient human rights issues, and issues with high residual risk. 

 

Results of Human Rights Risk Assessment

As it is a newly acquired business, the mitigating measures implemented throughout the Group might not have had sufficient 

time to also be incorporated at Sri Nona. To provide a better illustration of the Group’s Human Rights salient issues, Sri Nona’s 

identified salient human rights issues have been excluded for this year.

Track and Communicate Performance

 

The Group continuously tracks, monitors, and assesses our human rights risks to stay informed on issues and concerns 

relating to human rights violations. 

 

F&amp;N communicates and educates all employees on our human rights practices. We promote and support cooperation 

from all directors, executives, employees, and all groups of stakeholders within the business value chain to report any forms 

of human rights suspicions, incidents, and violations arising from business operations through established and dedicated 

communication channels.

 

Feedback from these channels is used to consider improvements, and to develop appropriate mitigation and remediation 

measures. F&amp;N evaluates the implementation of human rights policies and mitigation measures by tracking and monitoring 

processes.

 

We are determined to conduct the human rights due diligence process regularly to identify, review and evaluate any risks and 

impacts relating to a violation of human rights caused by the Group’s business operations and associated activities.

 

Our human rights performance will be reported annually in our Report.

 

Remediate Adverse Impacts

 

F&amp;N recognises our business activities may potentially contribute to or be linked with human rights violations of relevant 

stakeholders. F&amp;N is committed to mitigate such potential human rights risks and violations. 

 

Our ongoing commitment is supported through a revised assessment of human rights risks within an appropriate timeframe. 

Additional mitigation measures will be established to remediate and reduce the possibility of human rights violations caused 

or endorsed by business activities of F&amp;N.

 

There were no human rights violation cases in 2020. Thus, no remediation measures were taken.

F&amp;N plans for an annual systematic review of the human rights assessment, and to conduct the assessment every three years.

GRI Index: GRI 403-9, GRI 403-10

SDG:

The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of health, hygiene, and safety. F&amp;N ensures our employees 

are safe from work hazards and workplaces are aligned with the national government’s COVID-19 strategy. We enforce strict 

protocols to physically protect our employees on the ground and enable better work-life balance practices to boost the mental 

health of our employees working from home.  

F&amp;N believes that working as a team is the only way to achieve our target of zero LTIFR. We foster a proactive ‘safety first’ culture 

for employees to be aware of their responsibilities to themselves and their colleagues. 

APPROACH

The safety of our people, and those who work with us, is one of our top priorities. To ensure our employees and contractors’ 

employees carry out their functions aligned with F&amp;N’s safely protocols, various safety training programmes were conducted.  

F&amp;N’s commitment is further strengthened with the incorporation of these two key performance indicators for our executives  

to prioritise: 

 

LTIFR; and

 

Number of safety and health initiatives conducted

Creating a Safety Culture

F&amp;N strictly adheres to the ILO guidelines, Singapore’s 

Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) Council WSH 

guidelines, Thailand’s Labour Protection Act and 

Malaysia Employment Act 1955. We go beyond national 

regulations by complying with ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 

at all our major sites. Guidelines and legal requirements 

of these policies have been extended to our internal 

Workplace, Safety, Health and Security Policy, signalling 

F&amp;N’s commitment to creating a safety culture for all.

F&amp;N integrates safety across our operations through 

the implementation of ESH systems and monitoring 

processes. All employees, workers and activities are 

covered under our ESH systems. Workers are to receive 

adequate training and safety equipment wherever 

appropriate.

Every plant has a Safety Committee, which includes 

representatives from the management and the workers.  

The main objective of these committees is to oversee 

F&amp;N’s safety systems and programmes to ensure their 

effectiveness. This is supported by: 

 

Periodical meetings to discuss accidents or near-

misses and determine appropriate corrective actions

 

Audits of ESH systems

 

Development of annual safety plans

 

Initiating programmes to increase awareness of 

health and safety issues among employees

On the ground, our Company Emergency Response Teams 

are trained to mobilise quickly and attend to any incidents.

Employee Safety Training and Awareness

Despite limitations due to COVID-19, this year, safety briefings were conducted in small groups during toolbox meetings at F&amp;NHB. 

Five different safety briefings conducted for small groups, amounting to over 310 hours, were attended by over 120 employees.

Our safety trainings remained effective with over 1,450 

employees participating in over 6,600 hours of safety 

trainings in Malaysia and over 410 employees participating 

in over 930 hours of training in Singapore. The safety 

topics our manufacturing staff covered in FY2021 included 

noise exposure and personal hearing protection, plant 

safety awareness, driving fire safety, chemical handling, 

first aid, ergonomics, breaking the chain of infections with 

vaccinations, etc. 

F&amp;N conducts frequent checks on our employees to detect 

early onset symptoms from potential hazards in their day-to-

day work. Audiometric tests are conducted regularly for all at-

risk workers annually, with follow-up doctor consultations when 

hearing impairments are identified. Additionally, employees 

that are unable to work from home due to the nature of their 

responsibilities are given COVID-19 self-test kits.

In Singapore, a driving safety training is conducted, in 

collaboration with Comfort Delgro, using the Cartrack system 

which facilitates the tracking of driving patterns. This includes 

tracking of driving speeds, location of vehicle, temperature 

of chill trucks, etc. The Cartrack system will be considered for 

route planning purposes in future to improve the safety of our 

drivers. 

Conducive Working Environment

The Safety Committees comprises skilled personnel trained 

to comprehensively evaluate areas where employees may be 

exposed to health risks and are supported by accredited 

Occupational Health and Safety (“OHS”) consultants.  

All employees and contractors have access to OHS services, 

including hygiene services, ergonomic tools, protective 

equipment, and first aid kits. 

Air quality, brightness, temperature and noise levels are 

monitored in all of F&amp;N’s facilities. By monitoring noise levels 

at our facilities regularly, F&amp;N is able to ensure that the noise 

level is within the recommended range. For instances where 

workers are exposed to high noise levels, hearing protection 

equipment is provided. 

To promote a better work-life balance, F&amp;N has implemented 

flexible working hours for office employees.

INITIATIVES

F&amp;N implemented extensive safety measures to ensure all 

premises maintained the highest level of hygiene and a 

sanitary environment, including: 

 

Work environments sanitised daily and cleaned after the 

end of each work shift. The premises undergo a special 

chemical sanitisation every two weeks.

 

Daily contactless temperature screening, health-related 

declarations for all employees and safe distancing 

measures are enforced at all workplaces.

 

Upgraded key office facilities to contactless systems, e.g. 

replacing cash with e-payment systems at the cafeteria 

and replacing biometrics with face scanner for sign-in.

 

Provided personal protection equipment for all employees, 

e.g. masks and hand sanitisers.

 

Care packs containing an oral thermometer, two face 

masks and hand sanitiser, were issued to employees 

and cleaners who belonged to the Pioneer and Merdeka 

Generation in Singapore. 

 

F&amp;NHB arranged a company-wide employee vaccination 

programme in collaboration with the Malaysian 

government.

 

COVID-19 Procedure Compliance Briefings conducted at 

all facilities 

Work practices were adapted to uphold the safety and 

wellbeing of our employees: 

 

Instead of F&amp;N’s usual company-organised sporting 

events and sport classes, virtual wellness programmes 

were organised in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand to 

guide employees on mental and physical health.

 

Employees are entitled to work from home or in split team 

arrangements, where applicable. Our IT resources and 

tools were upgraded to support working remotely.

ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE

GRI Index: GRI 302-1, GRI 302-3, GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4

SDGs: 

Climate change is the defining global challenge of the 21st century. It presents various risks for F&amp;N – price fluctuations over raw 

materials, and water scarcity issues – but also creates opportunities for F&amp;N – cost savings, alignment with customer expectations,  

and contributions to sustainable development. 

F&amp;N recognises the need for a low carbon economy transition and is committed to reduce our energy and GHG emissions intensity at 

our plants as the two main priorities of our 2025 targets.

APPROACH

F&amp;N’s approach is guided by the following Energy Management principles: 

Operations Exposure to Climate Change Risks

Potential climate change impacts, such as rising sea levels, extreme temperatures, and limited water availability, will negatively impact 

F&amp;N’s operations and supply chain. As such, F&amp;N considers climate change risks in our ERM process. At F&amp;NHB, physical climate 

change risks are monitored and managed under the responsibility of the F&amp;NHB SRMC. To manage identified risks, they work closely 

with state authorities and local councils. Robust incident escalation procedures and response plans are also in place as part of our 

Business Continuity Management.

2025 TARGETS

 

Reduce the Group’s energy intensity ratio at our plants (from a 2020 baseline) by 8% by 2025

- 

Our group energy ratio increased by 1%, due to lower production volume at our plants with COVID-19 pandemic.

 

Reduce the Group’s GHG emissions intensity ratio at our plants (from a 2020 baseline) by 8% by 2025

- 

Our GHG emissions intensity ratio decreased by 1%, due to use of renewable energy at our plants

INITIATIVES

Improving energy efficiency in our operations makes just as 

much business sense as it is to reduce our environmental 

impacts. Key energy saving initiatives to optimise plant 

processes include upgrading chillers and improving air flow 

systems across our plants. Some initiatives are highlighted in 

this report.

An automatic control chiller supplies ice and chilled water 

based on consumption demands. During off-peak periods, 

the chiller functions as an ice bank to generate and store 

chilled water in the water tanks; it then supplies water during 

peak periods. With this installation, electricity consumption 

has reduced up to 1,350,000 kWh creating savings of about 

THB 4.7 million per year (about SGD 192,000 per year).

Thailand: F&amp;NDT – Implementation of Automatic  

Control Chiller

Air Controllers

Malaysia: F&amp;NCM – Centralised Compressed

Singapore:  Times Printers – Energy Efficient 

Opportunities Assessment (“EEOA”)

Thailand: F&amp;NDT – Installation of Solar Panel Rooftop

Intelligent flow air controllers were installed in F&amp;N Beverages 

Manufacturing Sdn Bhd’s main plant’s air compressor. With the 

flow air controller, fluctuation pressure during operations can 

be reduced from 0.5 bar to 0.14 bar. Energy cost has reduced 

by 15% (about 400,000 kWh) with about MYR 140,000 (about 

SGD 45,700) in savings. F&amp;NHB will explore the installation of 

the intelligent flow controllers for other production lines.

TP production facilities in Singapore and is currently being 

audited by an energy consultancy company, CBM Solutions 

Pte Ltd, with their inhouse certified EEOA auditors and 

engineers. The resulting EEOA Report, which is estimated to be 

ready by December 2021, will provide TP with the necessary 

data, information and recommendations regarding initiatives 

that can be explored in future to improve its energy efficiency.

Renewable Energy Sourcing and Generation

Besides energy effiency upgrades, F&amp;N looks to increase 

renewable energy use.

At the F&amp;NDT Rojana plant, a solar panel rooftop was installed 

in April 2020. It provided cost savings around THB 6 million 

(about SGD 270,000). The THB 30 million (SGD 1.35 million) 

solar photovoltaic (“PV”) system with 1MWp generating 

capacity significantly reduces energy offtake from the grid  

by utilising renewable energy for its daily operations. 

Combined two separate air systems into one centralised 

compressed air system. The initiative reduces the amount of 

electricity needed for operations, thus decreasing the energy 

usage by about 250,000 MJ (an equivalent of 41 MT CO2e 

reduction in GHG emissions) annually. It resulted in cost 

savings of approximately MYR 25,000 (about SGD 8,200) each 

year. For the next phase, F&amp;NCM is exploring modifications 

to the cooling system such that it only runs when needed, 

contributing to even greater energy savings.

Low Carbon Product 

The Extra Non-dairy Half Creamer for Cooking and Baking (385g) is F&amp;NHB’s first low-carbon product certified by Thailand 

Greenhouse Gas Management Organisation (“TGO”). The product’s carbon footprint of 295 kg CO2 successfully meets the 

requirements of the Carbon Footprint Label Scheme. 

F&amp;NHB is working towards having more products certified by TGO under the Carbon Footprint Label Scheme.

Route Planning 

Optimal route planning can help reduce GHG emissions. In the last few years, we have continued to streamline our distribution 

networks. 

Since 2014, F&amp;NHB has made more than MYR 800 million (more than SGD 250 million) of capital investments on new lines 

and warehouses across production facilities in Malaysia and Thailand. By decentralising our logistics with manufacturing and 

warehouse operations located in closer proximity, transportation routes will become shorter and fuel consumption and GHG 

emissions will be reduced. 

F&amp;NHB also invested about MYR 180 million (about SGD 58 million) in an integrated warehouse at Shah Alam Plant in Malaysia 

and established a regional distribution centre (“RDC”) in Rojana in Thailand. Both are equipped with the Automated Storage 

Retrieval System (“ASRS”) and have commenced operations this financial year. The RDC in Thailand serves as the regional 

distribution hub for F&amp;NDT’s products, and is estimated to have reduce material and transport costs by about THB 20 million 

(about SGD 800,000) in a year. The ASRS automates process of getting finished goods ready for delivery to markets or 

distributors’ warehouses. This system drives improvements through: 

Singapore: FNFS – Future Energy Improvement Initiatives

Malaysia: F&amp;NHB – Installation of Solar PV Systems

Singapore: FNFS targets to move to a new plant in 2022 with plans to enhance their environmental performance through more 

energy efficient equipment. Some of the installations planned for include a bio-digester, high-efficiency air-condition chiller, 

heat recovery from air compressors, water recovery systems, a 500,000 kWh rooftop solar PV system.

Malaysia: As part of the strategic direction to reduce fossil fuel consumption and carbon footprint, the Group explored a 

renewable energy programme at our F&amp;NHB plants (Shah Alam, Pulau Indah and Bentong) by setting up 10MWp solar PV 

systems at the three plants. This initiative is estimated to replace at least 20% of its total electricity consumption in Malaysia.

WATER STEWARDSHIP

GRI Index: GRI 303-3, GRI 303-4, GRI 303-5

SDGs:

Water is an important resource for F&amp;N because it is used extensively in our products and operational processes. The success to our 

business depends on a reliable supply of water and effective water management. We are committed to responsible water stewardship 

by managing our water use to safeguard the availability of clean water for the local communities, in the markets we operate.

While none of our sites are in high water-stress areas (according to World Resources Institute Aqueduct), many regions in 

Thailand and Malaysia have faced floods and water shortages. The effects of climate change are expected to intensify water 

stress in the future. Water security issues will become increasingly important for F&amp;N.

APPROACH

Guided by the F&amp;N ESH Policy and the principles of circular economy, F&amp;N has organised initiatives to increase water security 

and reduce our water consumption. Water-related risks and opportunities are identified and addressed by collaborating with 

relevant stakeholders to create shared value projects.

To reduce risks towards our water supply, we utilised a range of internal water assessments and have deployed action policies in 

all our facilities. 

 

Water Stewardship and associated risks are regularly monitored on F&amp;N’s ERM system. 

 

The sustainability team utilises tools such as the WRI Aqueduct and World Wildlife Fund Water Risk Filter. 

 

F&amp;N has an established system within all operations for systematic daily and monthly tracking and monitoring of water 

consumption and effluent quality.

2025 TARGET

 

Reduce the Group’s water intensity ratio at our plants by 8% from a 2020 baseline by 2025

- 

Our group water intensity ratio increased by 1% because of lower production volume at our plants due to the COVID-19 

pandemic.

Operational Eco-Efficiency

F&amp;N implemented various water saving initiatives this year to 

further progress toward our target of reducing water intensity 

by 8% by 2025. F&amp;N seeks to improve our water efficiency with 

our plant engineers looking into closing the loop for our water 

systems – through treating wastewater from our plants and 

using the recycled water for general cleaning and cooling 

purposes. 

We also share best practices with suppliers upstream in the 

value chain. Beyond that, F&amp;NDT engaged dairy farmers 

to enhance their water security. This has enabled F&amp;NDT to 

improve supply chain resilience through water stewardship. 

More details can be found in the ‘Supply Chain Stewardship’ 

section of the Report. 

Water Stewardship in Our Operations

Water-Efficiency and Zero-Discharge in  

Our Operations.

INITIATIVES

In particular, we would like to highlight the efforts at FNFS.

Recognising that soya process is one of the more water 

intensive processes at FNFS plant, we evaluated our soya 

activities and implemented changes to improve water 

efficiency in 2020. Monthly average water usage reduced by 

about 42% after the implemented changes. The total average 

yearly water savings was approximately 13,300 m3, with cost 

savings of around SGD 36,000. 

With success of the soya line, F&amp;N worked on the Hipex 

Production line this year – the second most water intensive 

process at the F&amp;NFS plant. Changes implemented included 

swapping out the open-end hose for the spray gun hose with 

a lower flow rate and controlling CIP process by using pH 

readings. Monthly average water usage had a 14% reduction, 

with the total average yearly water savings estimated to  

be about 4,000 m3. The cost savings are approximately  

SGD 11,000. 

As mentioned in ‘Energy and Climate Change’ section of the 

Report, FNFS is intending to move to a new plant in 2022 with 

plans for more efficient processes and equipment installed. 

Specifically, an improved water system that helps recover 

water through the use of Reverse Osmosis. The used water is 

then channelled to general cleaning and cooling of towers. 

There are also plans for CIP programmes to recover chemicals 

and water.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

GRI Index: GRI 306-1, GRI 306-2, GRI 306-3, GRI 306-4, GRI 306-5, GRI 306-6

SDGs:

Waste is generated at F&amp;N plants as well as downstream of the value chain, post-consumer use. Circular economy views 

waste as a resource that could generate value by being used as an input for another process. Effectively managing our waste 

enhances F&amp;N’s ability to achieve resource efficiency. We also look to manage waste post-consumer use through packaging, 

which is further elaborated in the ‘Packaging’ section of the Report.

APPROACH

F&amp;N aspires to achieve zero landfill and zero discharge. Our manufacturing teams seek to improve efficiency in our operations 

by applying innovation and discovering new opportunities to close the loop in the material cycle. We actively monitor our waste 

composition in the manufacturing process including liquid (effluent) and solid wastes, with the aim of increasing recycling and 

reducing waste generation. We extend our commitments beyond our operational borders and engaged our stakeholders to 

identify circular opportunities in their operations, to assist them in reducing costs and using resources efficiently.

Under our ESH Policy, all employees are encouraged to be involved through awareness raising on responsible consumption and 

understanding environmental issues from our activities.

2025 TARGET

 

Reduce the solid waste sent to landfill (from a 2020 baseline) by 30% by 2025

Operational Eco-Efficiency

Since May 2021, F&amp;NDT has joined the ranks of our factories that have achieved zero waste sent to a landfill (“zero-landfill”).  

Of our 13 factories, 55  have zero-landfill. All waste products at F&amp;NDT are sent to a waste-to-energy plant to be converted into 

a fuel source.

F&amp;NDT’s zero-landfill achievement is made possible through effective awareness raising programmes on waste segregation and 

reduction for our employees. At F&amp;N, we have ongoing campaigns at plants to cultivate awareness among employees about 

waste management with the goal of increasing recycling rate.

Our dairy plants in Thailand and Malaysia continue to be a great source for local farmers to acquire organic fertilizer made from 

100% industrial sludge from our operations. This year we have generated over 1.200 m3 of industrial sludge which has benefited 

local farmers.

Optimisation: Convert Food Waste Downstream to Animal Feed 

We are currently investigating the potential ways of recycling food waste downstream of our value chain. An experimental study 

is conducted with an external vendor that collects market returned products, okara waste, and juices, to turn it into biomaterials 

for animal feed (fishes) using the larva of black soldier flies. 

 

Optimisation: Redistribute Food Waste to Communities in Need

Since 2019, F&amp;NHB established a partnership with Yayasan Food Bank Malaysia to support the Food Bank Siswa programme with 

surplus food for various communities in need.

Food loss and food waste have become a global concern and 

an issue for sustainable development goals. An estimated 1/3 

of all food produced globally is lost or goes to waste. Food 

loss and waste not only contribute to food shortage, water 

stress, biodiversity loss, and increases GHG. 

As a F&amp;B manufacturer, F&amp;N aspires to optimise our position 

to minimise food wastage in our entire value chain. We are 

committed to reducing global food loss/waste by: 

 

Reducing food loss throughout our value chain, from 

sourcing, manufacturing and logistics 

 

Reducing our production waste to landfill by 30% by 2025 

 

Collaborating with our business partners to reduce food 

waste 

At F&amp;NHB, a framework for managing food loss and waste, 

guided by the Food and Drink Material Hierarchy from the 

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 

has been developed. They collaborate with upstream and 

downstream partners to look for innovative alternatives to 

reduce food loss or redirect food loss with focus on prevention, 

optimisation, recycling and recovery initiatives to minimise 

food waste along our value chain.

Value Chain Impacts

Looking at our products’ life cycle beyond our operational boundaries and considering the environmental impacts of our 

products, F&amp;N considers packaging waste and biodiversity as a highly important material environmental topics to focus on in 

our value chain. We look into ways to improve packaging and inputs used to manufacture our products through innovation and 

procurement. This year, we made new commitments to protect biodiversity and natural ecosystems. More information can be 

found in the following sections:

PACKAGING

GRI Index: GRI 301-1, GRI 301-2

SDG:

The increase in awareness of environmental impacts of single-use plastics have resulted in consumers and stakeholders 

actively demanding for companies to take action and invest in sustainable solutions. Added pressure from various stakeholders, 

including national governments, in our markets have led to the introduction of environmental policies designed to encourage 

companies to rethink their production methods. Such government initiatives like – Thailand’s ‘Roadmap on plastic waste 

management’, Malaysia’s ‘Roadmap towards Zero Single-Use Plastics’ and Singapore’s ‘Zero Waste Masterplan’ will impact  

the F&amp;B industry.   

As a F&amp;B company, F&amp;N views packaging as one of the critical aspects where we could leave a positive impact on society and 

the environment, by seeking sustainable packaging solutions to encourage recyclability and increase the circularity of materials, 

to reduce the resource intensity in our packaging.

APPROACH

F&amp;N focuses on designing our packaging with the environment in mind and looks into investing in new innovations, integrating 

circular economy concepts, and working closely with our stakeholders to innovate packaging solutions. 

F&amp;N’s packaging approach is focused on: 

 

Reducing the amount of materials used in our packaging

 

Increasing the use of recycled materials, e.g. replacing virgin aluminium and tin cans with recycled materials

 

Switching to certified sustainable packaging materials, e.g. FSC certified

 

Designing packaging to be recyclable

F&amp;N actively works across the supply chain to find solutions to manage post-consumer packaging. We have partnered with 

other organisations to close the loop and we are seeking to work with new suppliers that meet our requirements for sustainable 

packaging materials.

Sustainability Report 2021



In January 2021, F&amp;NHB and nine other members formed 

MAREA – an alliance in collaboration with the Malaysian 

government to enable a voluntary, industry-led Extended 

Producer Responsibility group. It brings like-minded companies 

together to focus on boosting the value chain and improving 

the collection rates and recycling of post-consumer packaging.

F&amp;N spearheaded a joint initiative with the NEA of Singapore 

to introduce 50 reverse vending machines across Singapore 

since 2019. The initiative was to provide an easily available 

avenue for consumers to deposit selected used plastic bottles 

and aluminium cans to encourage a habit of recycling. This 

supports the national vision of the Sustainable Singapore 

Blueprint’s goal to increase the national recycling rate to 70% 

by 2030. As of September 2021, more than 3.3 million cans 

and more than 4.8 million bottles have been collected and 

passed on to recycling facilities.

F&amp;NDT had implemented a project to reduce the use of 

single-use plastic bags and one-time paper cores by reusing 

them. By reusing the paper cores of the supplier’s film rolls and 

the lidded plastic bags, F&amp;NDT had successfully reduced the 

amount of plastic bags and paper cores used in its operations 

by over 5,500kg and 10,700kg, respectively. This translated to 

over THB 980,000 (over SGD 40,000) cost savings each year. 

It also has the added benefit of reducing over 3 MT CO2e of 

GHG emissions indirectly.

BIODIVERSITY

GRI Index: GRI 304-1

SDG:

Our future strongly depends on a rich biodiversity and healthy ecosystems. In recent decades, the world is experiencing 

biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation at an unprecedented pace. F&amp;N is dependent on plant-based ingredients and 

materials such as palm oil, sugar and paper, and the natural environment may in turn be impacted by our business – especially 

in the upstream of our supply chain. 

We recognise the importance of sustainable sourcing, and our role in ensuring healthy natural ecosystems together with 

our suppliers. It is necessary to be aware of our biodiversity-related risks to properly manage our operations in areas where 

biodiversity is rich. There is a need to scale up our efforts beyond sustainable sourcing and we have taken the steps to protect 

biodiversity and natural ecosystems in areas where we operate.

APPROACH 

This year, F&amp;N considers biodiversity as a material topic for the first time. Our subsidiary, F&amp;NHB, is taking the lead in this area. 

F&amp;NHB had discussions with internal and external stakeholders to develop a strategy and direction for this material topic. They 

have developed a biodiversity statement which serves as a foundation for biodiversity management at F&amp;NHB. This statement is 

applicable to all current and future operational sites at F&amp;NHB:

Value Chain Impacts

We aim to protect biodiversity and ecosystems through the following commitments:

Avoid deforestation in our supply chain.

Avoid operating and developing in close proximity 

to nationally, or internationally recognised areas 

of high biodiversity value, including World Heritage 

areas, International Union for Conservation of 

Nature (IUCN) Category I-IV protected areas, 

RAMSAR Sites and key biodiversity areas.

In managing potential biodiversity risk, we will 

engage necessary stakeholders, including 

local authorities and the communities nearby, 

and ensure appropriate mitigation strategy 

is developed to minimise impacts to as low 

as reasonably possible. We are committed to 

collaborating with external partners, such as 

biodiversity experts, to support our biodiversity 

assessment and management process.

In any circumstance where our production sites or 

a proposed project is located within, or depend 

upon, areas of high biodiversity value, we will apply 

the following mitigation hierarchy:

a. Avoidance - Avoid operating and developing 

in areas of high biodiversity value.

b. Minimisation - Implement measures/

initiatives to monitor and minimise impacts on 

biodiversity from our operations.

c. Restoring - Seek to restore/rehabilitate areas 

where impacts cannot be prevented.

d. Offset - Consider biodiversity compensation/

offsets measures, where there is residual impact.

LR Independent Assurance Statement 

Relating to Fraser and Neave, Limited’s data for selected GRI 

indicators for the fiscal year 2021 (1st October 2020 – 30th 

September 2021) 

 

This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Fraser and Neave, Limited in accordance with our contract but is intended 

for the readers of this Report.  

 

Terms of engagement

based on current best practice, is in accordance with ISAE 30001 and uses the following principles of - inclusivity, materiality, 

responsiveness and reliability of performance data. 

 

Our assurance engagement covered F&amp;N’s operations and activities in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand specifically the 

following requirements: 

 

• 

Confirming whether the selected economic, environmental and social indicators below were compiled according 

to GRI’s Standard 2016.

LR’s Opinion 

Based on LR’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that F&amp;N has not, in all material 

respects: 

 

• 

Met the requirements above 

• 

Disclosed reliable performance data and information as no errors or omissions were detected 

 

The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional 

judgement of the verifier.  

 

Note: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement.  Limited assurance engagements 

focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites.  Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement 

is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.  

 

LR’s approach 

LR’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with our verification procedure.  The following tasks though were 

undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement: 

 

• 

Auditing F&amp;N’s data management systems to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions or mis-

statements in the data.  We did this by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling procedures, instructions and 

systems, including those for internal verification.  We also spoke with those key people responsible for compiling the 

data and drafting the report. 

• 

Sampling the selected GRI indicators (F&amp;NBM Plant in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, F&amp;NCM Plant in Shah Alam, Malaysia 

and F&amp;NUL Plant in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand). We also reviewed how these selected GRI indicators from the 

operations in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand were consolidated into the final reported data. 

 

Observations  

Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are: 

 

• 

Reliability: Data management systems are established and centralized for the data and information collection and 

calculation associated with the selected GRI indicators. However, we believe that F&amp;N should work together with 

supply chains to improve the quality and reliability of data reported in the future, typically for reporting of GHGs and 

OH&amp;S performance. 

 

LR’s standards, competence and independence 

LR ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and experience. The 

outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior management to ensure that the 

approach applied is rigorous and transparent. 

 

This verification is the only work undertaken by LR for F&amp;N and as such does not compromise our independence or impartiality.
