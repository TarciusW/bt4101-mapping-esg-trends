 est World International Limited is 

pleased to present our second Sustainability Report. 

In line with the phased approach encouraged by 

the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”), Best World will 

be focusing only on our operations in Singapore 

and Taiwan for this report. We will work towards 

taking gradual steps to expand the reporting scope 

to include core entities of  the Group in subsequent 

reports.

This report covers the Financial Year 2018 (“FY2018”) 

from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018, with 

Financial Year 2017 (“FY2017”) from 1 January 2017 

to 31 December 2017 as the year of  comparison. 

Our report has been drafted in accordance with 

the internationally recognised framework, Global 

Reporting Initiatives (‘GRI’) Standards - Core option, 

and the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading 

Limited (‘SGX-ST’) Mainboard Listing Rule 711(B).

For this report, no external assurance was sought, 

but we will consider doing so for future reports. 

Moving forward, Best World hopes to report on our 

non-financial performance annually and continue to 

strengthen our sustainability efforts.

In 2018, we assessed the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters previously identified in 2017 and found them 

to be still relevant to our business and stakeholders. Back in 2017, we engaged an independent sustainability consultant and 

initiated a formal materiality assessment process to identify the ESG matters that greatly affect our business and stakeholders. 

Both internal and external stakeholders were taken into consideration for the assessment. With the contributions from different 

representatives from relevant departments, we adopted a four-step materiality assessment process summarised in Figure 1 below:

Figure 1: Best World’s Materiality Assessment Process

Identification

A preliminary list of  ESG matters were selected after conducting a desktop analysis of  Sustainability 

Reports published by leading industry players and interviews with key personnel across departments

Validation

Material matters that were identified in Step 2 were presented to the Board for validation and 

approval

Prioritisation

The identified ESG matters were rated and prioritised through an anonymous voting exercise by 

the representatives from the various departments, taking into consideration the perspective of  both 

internal and external stakeholders

Review

Material matters that were approved by the Board will continue to be re-assessed in subsequent 

reporting periods to ensure that reported topics remain relevant and material

BUSINESS ETHICS

At Best World, we are dedicated to operating our business in an honest and transparent manner. During the process of expanding into 

rapid-growth markets, where the operations are dependent on its local businesses and suppliers, there is a greater risk of exposure to 

corruption. Our group has adopted a zero-tolerance approach towards all corruption practices and have strived to embed a culture 

of anti-corruption in all aspects of our operations. In 2018, we enhanced our anti-corruption framework and made certain policies 

available online to enhance communication to our stakeholders. 

COMPONENTS OF OUR ANTI-CORRUPTION FRAMEWORK

All employees are trained on our corporate policies, anti-corruption policies and procedures during our mandatory new employee 

orientation	programme.	Our	suppliers	are	also	required	to	make	an	annual	declaration	that	they	have	no	conflict	of	interest	before	they	

will be engaged by our Logistics and Procurement team.

In FY2017 and FY2018, no cases of corruption were reported.

Perpetual Target

FY 2018 Performance

Zero Instances of  Corruption

Achieved

100% of  employees are to be informed of  their responsibility to prevent dishonesty in 

the course of  business and all employees involved in sourcing and procurement for the 

company have acknowledge the declaration form annually

Achieved

Conflict of  Interest Policy  

Framework to guide employees on the measures 

to take to prevent conflicts of  interest as well as 

action steps to take in the event a conflict arises.

Whistle-Blowing Policy

Provides details on the whistle-blowing, a 

communication for employees to anonymously 

report suspected wrongful activities within the 

organisation to ensure an honest and transparent 

business conduct at Best World.

Gift and Entertainment Policy

Guidelines for employees on the proper 

procedures to process the gifts and entertainment 

from external parties to uphold business integrity.

Code of  Ethical Conduct

COMMUNICATING KEY BUSINESS ETHICS EFFECTIVELY

In	2018,	our	Taiwan	office	rolled	out	a	series	of	short	comics	to	educate	distributors	on	key	ethical	business	practices	such	as	consumer	

rights, distributor’s responsibilities and obligations and the Company’s intellectual property rights. Refer to the link below for more 

information.

https://tw.bwlgroup.com/tchinese/whatson_code_conduct.jsp

RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICE

 

 

Consumers lie at the heart of our business. Best World’s continued success depends on the trust 

 

 

and	confidence	that	consumers	place	in	our	distributors	and	products.	As	well	as	conforming	to	

 

 

respective countries’ consumer legislation, we also committed ourselves to consumer Code of 

 

 

Practice set out by the Direct Selling Associations Singapore (DSAS).

 

 

DSA Codes of Conduct address the obligations of DSA members to direct sellers (for instance 

 

 

BW’s obligations to BWL’s distributors) as well as DSA members’ obligations to consumers. For 

 

 

instance, the Direct Selling Association in Singapore sets out detailed criteria for members,  

 

 

 

which include: -

 

 

• Fair Selling Methods

 

 

•	Customer	order	cancellation	rights	–	7-Day	“Cooling-off	period”

 

 

• Respect for the rights and privacy of the customers

 

 

• Proper handling of customer complaints

At	Best	World,	we	always	ensure	our	members	and	distributors	act	ethically	and	beneficially	for	customers	and	the	community	at	large.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION 

AND COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS 

Every year, we invest a considerable amount of  resources 

to develop new and innovative premium products for our 

customers. Intellectual property (IP) protection, hence, is 

critical to us as it safeguards our investments and allows us to 

reap its full benefits.

We begin to manage and protect our IP before we launch the 

product to the market we operate in. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Customers from all the markets that we operate in recognize 

our product brands as our unique identity and marks of 

premium quality. The protection of  these intangible assets is 

one of  the key elements of  our business strategy. 

We protect our brands through trademarks and other IP 

rights along with strict management of  trade secrets. Our 

Intellectual Property Division (IP Division) focuses on 

establishing new brands and logos through trademarks 

registration and maintain registered marks from time to time 

to ensure that all logos and brands are properly protected. 

Our logos and brands are wide spread and well protected in 

many	 different	 jurisdictions.	 Till	 date,	 our	 IP	 Division	 has	

successfully registered more than 350 marks across the globe 

and is applying more than 150 new marks in Singapore, China, 

Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand, UAE, Korea, 

Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Vietnam, India, United 

States of  America, Europe, Canada and other countries which 

are	not	specifically	stated	herein.	

To ensure that our business activities are consistent with our 

IP strategy, IP rights management comes under the care of 

the IP Division of  HQ Legal Department.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AWARENESS 

Best World works closely with global top tiers law firms and 

Intellectual Property Office of  Singapore (IPOS) to maintain 

the intangible assets of  the Group across the globe. 

We also actively attend and participate in events and courses 

organised by Singapore Corporate Counsel Association 

(SCCA), International Association for the Protection of 

Intellectual Property (AIPPI) and International Trademark 

Association (INTA) to keep a close tab on the latest 

developments in international and local IP laws.  

Internally, our IP Division actively promotes IP awareness 

within the Group/subsidiaries and makes collective decisions 

with other Departments/Divisions within the Group 

regarding the use of  IP from a management perspective. 

COUNTERFEIT MANAGEMENT 

Best World takes a strict approach in handling counterfeit 

goods and infringement matters. Our IP Division segregates 

different infringement matters into two groups.

Infringement matters which are not material and will 

not constitute material impact against the Group will be 

categorised as minor infringement matters. Our IP Division 

will resolve these matters by entering into negotiations with 

potential infringers and resolve these matters internally or by 

adopting Alternative Dispute Resolutions.

On the other hand, all major infringement matters will be 

handled directly by our IP Division with care where strict 

approach will be imposed while dealing with related infringers. 

In such cases, our Legal Counsels work closely with relevant 

local authorities and the police to enforce raids against the 

infringers and also file infringement suits against them.

 

Our Business Process Division is currently working closely 

with our IP Division on to implement up-to-date policies, 

in-house rules and measures for subsidiaries to react to and 

manage infringement and counterfeit issues. 

On our physical products we have recently implemented 

QR codes, which will allow users to scan the product and 

determine whether the product is authentic on DR’s Secret 

product packaging for Taiwan in FY2018.

Zero cases of  non-compliance

RESPONSIBLE LABELLING/ ADVERTISING

Lapses in labelling and advertising can affect not just our brands and reputation as an organisation but potentially cause harm 

to our consumers as well. We care deeply about the people we serve. We recognise the consequences of  mislabelling and biased 

advertising of  our products. The lack of  transparency in reporting all product ingredients used or the effects it may cause prevents 

consumers from making an informed decision about the product they purchased, which can lead to undesirable consequences. 

By upholding our business integrity in marketing of  our products, we aim to achieve zero cases of  non-compliance with the 

Singapore Health Science Authority and Taiwan Food and Drug Administration’s labelling and product claim requirements. 

As such, strict practices are implemented to strengthen our labelling and advertising process. Labels are checked against the 

regional labelling requirements, product claim guidelines and code of  advertising practices to ensure compliance by product 

development and management executives, content writers and regional product registration officers.

Our brand incorporates regional labelling requirements into our products, complying with the guidelines of  the local regulatory 

bodies. Information on the country of  origin, product ingredients and directions for use are required to be printed on all 

products. Only products approved by these regulatory bodies can be marketed. Claim substantiation is also performed to 

prevent mislabelling or false advertising.







CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

At Best World, we are committed to product 

excellence and strive to ensure regulatory 

compliance for all of  our products. Throughout 

the development of  our products, from product 

concept design, formulation review, product 

stability and compatibility study, consumer 

product trial and product lab testing, we 

implement stringent quality standards and abide 

by regulations or guidelines enforced by local 

regulatory boards. We collaborate with external 

accredited labs regularly for quality assurance of 

our cosmetic and health supplement products. To 

further monitor the performance of  our products, 

we instituted a coherent and systematic process for 

customers to provide feedback on the products. 

Regional centres will receive customer feedbacks 

via digital channels or physically and will compile 

the feedbacks received into a monthly report for 

submission to HQ. The Quality department at 

HQ will keep track of  incidence rate and conduct 

necessary investigation or corrective actions 

where required. 

Under the care of  our Product Development 

team and Quality team, we recorded zero 

reported case pertaining to consumer health and 

safety in 2018. We aim to continue to assess the 

health and safety impact of  all our products.

COLLABORATION WITH SGS TAIWAN 

In partnership with SGS Taiwan, Taiwan’s largest and most 

diverse independent quality testing facilities. Best World was 

able to establish our very own quality assurance zone on the 

SGS Taiwan Safety Information Platform. Contaminant 

test reports for microbial, heavy metals, western drug and 

cosmetic steroid etc., related to our products are uploaded on 

their website for customers’ reference. 

In FY 2018, one of  our DR’s Secret skin care product 

received the coveted certification from Taiwan’s Symbol of 

National Quality (SNQ), Sunscreen #5 was strictly examined 

by the panel and proudly awarded “2018 SNQ – Symbol of 

National Quality Certification” according to its excellent 

quality among the category of  skin care products. 

CONSUMER SATISFACTION

Sustaining a viable business cannot be done independently. 

At Best World, we understand the importance of  customer 

engagement and channel much resources to it. We begin by 

engaging our distributors, who directly interacts with our 

consumers. By conducting monthly surveys with distributors, 

we are able to garner their responses, have a better 

understanding of  their feedback and concern, and make 

improvements based on the feedback received. Furthermore, 

regular trainings and events are also arranged by the local 

team to engage with distributors. 

In FY2018, we managed to obtain 100% satisfaction rate 

(defined	as	a	score	of 	4	or	5	out	of 	a	scale	of 	1	to	5)	on	distributor	

satisfaction survey and member satisfaction surveys.

On the mobile front, we launched BWL Mobile app in Taiwan 

in FY2017, and subsequently Singapore during early FY2018. 

Our digital strategy complements our physical stores, allows 

our orders to be placed 24/7 and delivered via courier to 

improve the speed of  service. On top of  that, mobile apps 

include the functions such as product browsing, promotions, 

as well as order tracking. While our business objectives 

remain unchanged, with the rise of  mobile technologies we 

have progressively made the shift towards a digital mindset to 

enhance our business advantage. We believe the investments 

made in technology advancement are important in ensuring 

our distributors have the best support to succeed in an 

increasingly competitive market.

WASTE DISPOSAL MANAGEMENT

Proper waste management is essential for the well-being of 

the environment. As a distributor of  consumer products, waste 

in the forms of  containers and plastics are inevitable in the 

packaging process. We seek to ensure that our waste is properly 

managed and disposed to ensure the safety of  our community.

 

Singapore

Our Singapore operations are served by National Environment 

Agency registered waste collectors. In FY2018, no hazardous 

waste was disposed.

Figure 6 summarises the amount of  non-hazardous waste 

produced in the Singapore operation for FY2017 and FY2018.

Taiwan 

No hazardous waste was generated by our Taiwan operations 

in FY2017 and FY2018. 

Figure 7 summaries the amount of  non-hazardous waste 

disposed in Taiwan. The non-hazardous waste generated 

in FY2017 mainly pertains to expired products as well as 

products that were returned or exchanged by consumers. 

There was much less waste produced in 2018 due to the 

absence of  large amounts of  expired products in the year as 

compared to FY2017.

In FY2018, there were no cases of  improper waste disposal 

and we will continue to make efforts to maintain these 

standards.

PACKAGING

MANAGEMENT

Our commitment to environmental sustainability 

extends to our packaging materials. On top of  ensuring 

that the packaging materials we use can provide enough 

protection and are compatible with our products 

and brand image, we also strive to minimise its 

environmental impacts.

In 2018, we adopted the use of  eco-friendly ink on our 

carton boxes. The ink chemistry allows for more cost-

effective and less energy intensive paper recycling, as 

it simplifies the usually tricky process of  separating the 

ink from paper to obtain clean pulp.

Moving forward, Best world continues to look into other 

possibilities of  making its packaging and packaging 

practices more environmentally friendly.
