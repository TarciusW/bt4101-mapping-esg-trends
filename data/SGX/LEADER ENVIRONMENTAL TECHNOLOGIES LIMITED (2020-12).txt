About this Report 

 

This is the Annual Sustainability Report (“SR” or the “Report”) of Leader 

Environmental Technologies Limited (“LET”, and together with its subsidiaries, the 

“Group”) and covers the sustainability efforts of the Group in the financial year ended 

31 December 2020.  

 

Our approach is to focus on the four material topics of our sustainability strategies 

which are aligned to our core beliefs and business priorities. We continue to refine our 

practices to identify and manage key environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) 

factors that are material to the Group and our key stakeholders, including those topics 

highlighted in our previous Sustainability Report in 2019 through a materiality exercise 

that considers the developments of our business and evolving stakeholder concerns.  

 

This Report describes management’s roles and responsibilities over these ESG 

factors in addition to how the Group’s interests are aligned with the evolving needs 

and concerns of our key stakeholders. It is recommended that you read this Report 

with our Annual Report which provides important information about our corporate 

governance, risk management, and financial information. We strive for clarity, 

transparency and reliability in our communication. Both reports are key communication 

tools in our communication with stakeholders. 

 

This Report is prepared based on the requirements of Singapore Exchange Securities 

Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Rules 711A and 711B and Practice Note 7F 

Sustainability Reporting Guide, with reference from the Global Reporting Initiative 

(“GRI”) Standards: Core Option.  The GRI Content Index is identified at the end of this 

Report.

Board Statement 

 

The Board of Directors of Leader Environmental Technologies Limited (“LET”) is 

pleased to present its fourth Sustainability Report (“SR2020”) covering the period from 

1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 (“FY 2020”). The SR2020 is prepared in 

accordance with the internationally accepted global reporting initiative (“GRI”) 

standards and is in compliance with the SGX Listing Rules. Guided by the principal of 

materiality, the Group prioritises and focuses on economic, social and governance 

issues that are deemed to be of paramount importance to our key stakeholders and 

their progress are tracked in this  Report.   

 

The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis that has significantly affected the 

global economy and supply chains and is unavoidably affecting and impacting the 

Group’s business to a certain extent. Nevertheless, the Group remains committed in 

our sustainability efforts, and is looking to expand and embark on more environmental 

related projects, especially municipal sludge treatments and industrial wastewater 

projects, in the foreseeable future to reduce pollution and harmful materials to the 

environment.     

 

FY2020 was the year of transformation for the Group amidst the COVID-19 pandemic 

situation, as we underwent a strategic review of our environmental businesses with 

the objective of creating and building a sustainable business for the Group and 

delivering long-term value to our key stakeholders.  

 

The Group encourages environmental stewardship practices as a responsible 

organisation with the aim to create long-term stakeholder value. The Group will work 

closely with our various stakeholders, and endeavours to leverage on our expertise in 

offering and providing our customers with the best technologies and services to meet 

the various stringent regulatory requirements. The Group will continually look at new 

ways to achieve sustainability, and also fine-tune and improve on our existing 

sustainability practices for a sustainable future.

What LET does  

 

LET is an environmental services provider listed on SGX-ST and headquartered in 

Singapore. The Group’s business scope includes treatment of municipal sludge, 

industrial wastewater treatment, and production of high-performance membrane 

products and equipment widely used in water and sludge treatment. Our services 

include system integration, equipment and product supply, project investment, 

engineering design procurement and construction (“EPC”), and operations and 

maintenance (“O&amp;M”). 

 

During 2020, the Group underwent a strategic review to re-organise our group 

structure and de-registered two dormant companies, divested a loss-making 

subsidiary, and incorporated three new wholly-owned subsidiaries, namely, United 

Greentech Holdings Pte. Ltd., United Greentech (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd and United 

Greentech (Tianjin) Co., Ltd., to engage, invest and partake in the new environmental-

related businesses in respect of sludge treatments, industrial wastewater, production 

of high performance membrane, and greentech investments. 

 

In January 2021, we acquired Bituo Environmental Technologies (Tianjin) Co., Ltd. 

(“Bituo”), an environmental technology company specialising in municipal sludge 

treatment with nine patents covering different technologies and processes. We believe 

that Bituo’s patented technologies, particularly its continuous thermal hydrolysis 

technology, can help to reduce the water content of sludge to 30-40% and generate 

dried sludge with higher heating value. This improves the overall energy recovery of 

the sludge treatment process and brings significant cost savings. The acquisition will 

provide us with an added advantage in tendering for sludge treatment projects. 

 

In the same month, the Group also entered into a joint venture investment with 

Nanosun Pte. Ltd. (“Nanosun”) to set up high performance membrane manufacturing 

facilities in Singapore and China. The high-performance membrane is widely used in 

water treatment, as well as the pharmaceutical, life science and medical industries. 

This is a strategic investment for the Group as we move towards building our position 

as an integrated solution provider of membrane-based treatment technologies. 

 

In the midst of working on the Group’s transformation plans, our business activities in 

FY2020 were largely confined to completing the manufacturing and installations of the 

remaining dust elimination and industrial wastewater projects. 

 

With the transformation, the Group positions ourselves as a technology-driven 

environmental solutions provider. Having established a core team of specialists and 

instilled an enterprise culture of technological innovation and management efficiency, 

the Group has developed proprietary technologies focusing on addressing pressing 

environmental issues and new capabilities in sludge management, industrial 

wastewater treatment and membrane technology. The Group also intends to achieve 

greater impact through collaboration and project investments. This will include equity 

investments in promising greentech companies with strong environmental 

technologies.

Supply Chain Management 

 

The Group believes in building a resilient and 

sustainable supply chain and has procurement 

policies over the selection of suppliers and our 

procurement process. 

 

The main suppliers of the Group comprise 

subcontractors and suppliers of raw materials to 

our business operations. Subcontractors are 

typically engaged for scavenging, excavation, 

installation and other civil engineering works for 

our projects. On suppliers, we perform the 

necessary due diligence checks based on the 

evaluation criteria established in accordance 

with the Group’s procurement policies before entering into any transaction with them. 

In situations where several suppliers can meet our project requirements, the Group 

will select those with a good reputation for being environmentally and socially 

responsible.  This underpins our commitment to a sustainable supply chain.

Key Stakeholders Engagement 

 

We have identified and prioritised five key stakeholder groups to understand and 

respond to their concerns, needs and expectations.  

 

The illustration below summarises the key avenues and outcomes of our engagement 

with our main stakeholders, as we continue to communicate with our shareholders and 

employees with enhancements as compared to previous reporting year:

Materiality Assessment 

 

The Group adopts the same targeted approach through the use of questionnaires, as 

disclosed in our prior years’ sustainability reports, to identify ESG factors and material 

topics which are of high importance to our key stakeholders and with greatest impact 

on the Group’s businesses. Our materiality approach is closely guided by our core 

shareholders’ value and long-term sustainability of the Group’s business. The material 

topics based on the ESG factors affecting our business and operating environment 

presented in this Report were prioritised via a stakeholder-inclusive process to frame 

and focus our efforts.  

 

The illustration below shows our prioritisation and presentation of material ESG factors:  

 

Figure 3: Material ESG factors 

 

During 

 

 

The ranking of our ESG factors continues to be based on the same two parameters:  

importance to key stakeholders and impact on the Group’s business. Additional priority 

on occupational health and safety in response to the evolving COVID-19 situation and 

our associated health measures is elaborated in the “Managing COVID-19” section of 

this Report. 

 

As there are no significant changes to our business environment in FY2020, our 

ranking of the existing materials topics remains consistent with prior year. We 

remained focussed on addressing our material topics in “Our Economic and 

Environmental”, “Our People” and “Our Governance” sections of this Report.

Risk and Opportunities 

 

The evolving COVID-19 situation poses significant uncertainty to the global economy 

and brings about unprecedented economic, health and social challenges. 

 

Notwithstanding these enormous challenges, we hope to enjoy first-mover advantage 

as a proven provider of sludge treatment solutions as we see opportunities in the 

immense market potential of the sludge treatment and disposal industry in China. 

Sludge treatment is expected to be a multi-billion nascent industry in China. In China, 

more than 60 million MT of sludge was produced in 2020. China’s sludge treatment 

market has exceeded RMB50 billion since 2017 and is forecasted to increase at a rate 

of 10% p.a.1  Before FY2021, there were no projects which provided recurring income. 

In January 2021, the Group secured a RMB62.47 million (approximately S$12.70 

million) Build-Operate-Transfer (“BOT”) contract to treat the municipal sludge from the 

wastewater treatment plants in Jinghai District, Tianjin City. 

 

Continual evaluation of the Group’s risks and opportunities remains crucial to 

recalibrate the Group’s risk tolerance and risk management in a timely manner. Below 

illustrations address the Group’s approach over the identified risks and opportunities 

based on the material ESG factors:

Our Economic and Environmental Efforts 

 

Sustainability is at the heart of our business and this is demonstrated through the 

Group constantly striving to incorporate environmental and economic efforts in our 

business strategy. The Group is acutely aware of the environmental impact for every 

economic decision it undertakes; and we ensure that environmental compliance and 

health and safety standards are upheld and current laws and regulations are fully 

adhered to.   

 

The Group embraces innovation and continuous improvement in our businesses and 

work processes so as to stand ready to adapt to this uncertain and rapidly changing 

business environment. 

 

Our efforts and performance in 2020 are elaborated below: 

 

Business Discipline 

 

During the current reporting year, the Group remains focused on improving the 

Group’s cash flow by proactively engaging its customers on long overdue receivables, 

and also to expedite the final settlements of projects and improve the Group’s cash 

flows. As a result of our conscientious efforts, we managed to repay all of our bank 

borrowings in 1Q2021.  

 

Going forward, the Group will avoid turn-key projects in the Northern regions of the 

PRC where business environment has become more challenging over the years. We 

will instead focus on other parts of the PRC, especially Tianjin, in securing and 

investing in projects on sludge and industrial wastewater treatments which contain 

long-term concession rights. In addition to the engineering, procurement and 

construction works, these projects also offer operations and maintenance services 

which enable the Group to generate stable and recurring income.   

 

 

 




 

14 | P a g e 

 

Product Excellence 

 

To embark on the Group’s transformational journey, we will re-position ourselves and 

invest heavily in the following areas so that we can offer our customers the best 

technologies in projects relating to sludge treatments and industrial wastewater:   

 

1) Sludge Treatment Technologies 

• 9 patented technologies to breakdown sludge particles  

• This reduces the total sludge mass 

• By-product of treated sludge can be recycled to produce building 

materials etc. 

 

 

 

2) Nanosun’s Hybrid Membrane 

• Cylindrical-hollow structure instead of flat sheet to save space 

• Hybrid organic polymer and inorganic crystalline titanium membrane 

results in enhanced durability (pores will not collapse easily) 

• Easy to clean; non sticky 

• Cost-effective 

• Uses significantly lesser chemicals 

• Eliminate fouling  

• Treats industrial wastewater which is recycled for industrial use 

• Promotes environmental sustainability 

 

 

 

 

 




 

15 | P a g e 

 

Our Social  

 

Being a responsible corporate and global citizen, sustainability is fully embedded in 

LET’s values, which is reflected in how we enable innovation for our customers, as 

well as in the way we operate as one team of 30 engaged employees around the 

region. 

 

Occupational Health and Safety 

 

The Group is fully committed to the health and safety of our employees. We place 

great value on our employees’ mental and physical well-being and are focused on our 

efforts to ensure their health and safety.  

 

The Group continues to promulgate the importance of safe work procedures to our 

employees as evidenced by the list of programmes to continually enhance our 

occupational health and safety management system. This management system 

covers all employees at their respective workplace and management is again targeting 

to maintain zero accident rate as per prior year.  

 

Specific pre-employment training is one of the activities 

carried out and strictly overseen. This is of paramount 

importance to the health and safety of employees, given 

the risk and nature of work at the work sites and operating 

of equipment and machineries at work.  

 

 

Highly qualified and experienced 

project managers are on-site of work to oversee and provide 

additional supervision and guidance to workers, especially 

whereby specialised machinery is employed and on-site 

assessment on the suitability for project usage is required. 

 

 

In FY2020, the Group again maintained its excellent safety performance as in FY2019 

by achieving its goal of zero occupational accident. The Group would like to thank all 

employees for their great efforts and support given in actualising this goal.  

 

 






 

16 | P a g e 

 

Managing COVID-19 

 

We are pleased to inform that we have no cases of employees who were infected by 

COVID-19 to date. 

 

The Group continues to closely follow guidance from the local health authorities in 

China, and we are constantly monitoring the evolving COVID-19 situation so as to be 

ready to adapt our efforts and responses.  

 

We will always place the health, safety and security of our employees, customers, 

suppliers and stakeholders as our top priority. These include implementing safe 

management practices which include the distribution of masks and disinfectants to all 

employees and measurement of each employee’s body temperature daily before 

commencement of work at project site and in office. In addition to the above measures, 

regular cleaning and disinfection of office premises is conducted. 

 

Group Vaccination Program 

 

COVID-19 vaccination has yet to commence in Jilin province. However, our subsidiary 

in Jilin has started to compile the headcount and their details for the government.  

 

In our Singapore office, the Group also strongly encouraged the employees to register 

for vaccination. 

 

 

 


 

17 | P a g e 

 

Human Capital Development 

 

People remain the cornerstone of our business. The Group remains committed to 

investing in people development through upskilling of employees, enabling employees 

to enhance their capabilities and capacity for growth, and to build a future-ready 

workforce. 

 

With this mind, the Group maintains a training programme to ensure that employees 

are provided sufficient and appropriate training that enables them to continue to stay 

relevant to the business and also for their professional development. The Group 

conducted training and education courses for our employees. During FY2020, all 

employees attended training courses catered to them according to the skill sets 

required for their roles. 

 

Figure 7: Training hours 

 

 

Through the continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of the course and training 

programmes and the training plan, the Group aims to build a highly competent, 

innovative and skilled team.   

 

The Group remains committed in our efforts in talent management. We have been 

directing our focus to build a high performing team which works well together and 

thereby grow our business. We strive to identify and groom future leaders amongst 

the team and we stay focused in our efforts in providing resources to nurture such 

talents. 

 

 

 




 

18 | P a g e 

 

Our Governance 

 

The Group is committed to conducting our 

business in a responsible manner.  

 

As always, the Board of Directors will 

continue to uphold its overall oversight 

responsibility of the established internal 

control measures. Policies and procedures, 

coupled with our corporate governance 

framework, are implemented to monitor the 

performance and progress of our sustainability commitments. Periodic evaluation of 

the Group’s existing policies and procedures are conducted to ensure that the Group 

stays relevant in the new normal. 

 

Code of Conduct 

 

The Group places top priority on ensuring that a very high standard of corporate 

governance is upheld. The Group firmly believes that an ethical corporate environment 

is indispensable for good corporate governance, as this will safeguard the interests of 

the shareholders and investors’ confidence would also be elevated. 

 

The Code of Conduct serves as the foundation for the Group’s effective corporate 

governance. Our Code of Conduct provides our employees with clear and documented 

guidance on acceptable standards of ethical behaviour and raises the employees’ 

awareness of their corporate and social responsibilities towards shareholders and the 

expected strict adherence to the Company’s established guidelines. 

 

Delegation of Authority and Payment Approval Policy 

 

During the year of 2020, the Group has implemented the delegation of authority 

(“DOA”) and payment approval policy in the subsidiaries in China. To ensure 

completeness and adequacy of these written policies on DOA, we have engaged our 

internal auditors, MS Management Pte Ltd, to perform a review and make 

recommendations so as to enhance the internal controls of our payment approval 

process.      

 

 

 

 

 




 

19 | P a g e 

 

Business Continuity Plan 

 

 

 

 

 

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 

puts our Business Continuity Plan 

(“BCP”) to the test and we are 

managing and navigating many 

unexpected scenarios that were 

evolving at a fast pace by 

constantly 

adapting 

to 

the 

changing 

environment. 

The 

recovery plan is documented 

within the BCP together with the 

operational guidance to allow the 

stakeholders to put them into action. The BCP phases of assessment are illustrated in 

the diagram. 

 

 

Board of Directors (“BOD”) 

 

The Group’s governance of sustainability is anchored by the BOD and the LET 

management team. Under their leadership, LET strives to strengthen our internal 

controls and risk management policies and procedures, in adherence to the latest 

corporate governance standards.  

 

The Group warmly welcomes Mr Lim Kuan Meng and Mr Lee Suan Hiang as 

independent directors of the Board.  

 

The 

BOD 

has 

also 

rejuvenated 

and 

strengthened its management team during the 

year. This includes the appointment of Mr Ngoo 

Lin Fong as Deputy CEO &amp; Finance Director, 

Mr Li Li as Deputy CEO cum General Manager 

of United Greentech (Tianjin) Co. Ltd, and Dr 

Guo Chenghong as the Deputy Chief Technical 

Officer.  

 

Going forward, the Group will benefit from 

these new directors and management team 

who bring with them extensive and diverse 

experience.
