Dear Stakeholders, 

 

I am pleased to share with you the Sustainability Report of Wee Hur Holdings Ltd (“the Company” or 

“Wee Hur”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 

(“FY2020”).  

In FY2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the built environment industry greatly and affected the 

process of construction projects due to the passing laws or regulations implemented to address the 

pandemic, such as the Circuit Breaker and quarantined foreign workers. During the year, we had 

seven properties under development (three in Singapore and four in Australia), ten construction projects 

in Singapore and four investment properties (one in Singapore and three in Australia). 

Despite all the challenges we faced amid this COVID-19, the safety and welfare of our staff and 

workers remain our top priority in these trying times. All necessary measures to stop the transmitting the 

virus imposed by the authority will be strictly complied with. 

 

The Group is committed to providing a safe working environment for all employees. Our health and safety 

performance have significantly improved since 2018, and we achieved zero fatalities and no stop-work 

days in FY2020. Our Workplace Injury Rate (“WIR”) also reduced from 925 in FY2019 to 716 in FY2020. 

We will continue to stay committed to prioritising the health and safety of our staff and workers. 

I am thankful to our shareholders, business associates, consultants, sub-contractors, suppliers, staff and other 

stakeholders that have supported us and contributed in making our progress possible. I am also 

grateful to the Board for their guidance and support. Thank you for your interest in Wee Hur’s 

sustainability journey. I hope you enjoy reading this report.  

 

 

Sincerely,  

GOH YEOW LIAN

Wee Hur’s Sustainability Story

The Group will continue to promote responsible practices by further improving our water and waste 

management capabilities. We prioritise industry innovation in our projects and firmly believe that the cities 

of the future are smart and green. By contributing to better sustainability practices in the industry, we are 

capable of making a greater impact on the global movement to combat climate change. We have embraced 

the United Nation’s call to action and will strive for continual enhancement of our sustainable practices. 

 

A dedicated task force comprising key management personnel has been established to implement and 

oversee sustainable initiatives throughout our organisation. The Sustainability Task Force meets regularly to 

plan and review the progress of Wee Hur’s sustainability initiatives. 

 

Sustainability Targets   

The economic landscape for properties under development, construction and investment property markets 

has been impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. As such, we will continue to adopt a prudent and 

cautious approach towards making investment decisions. We are progressively diversifying our businesses 

beyond Singapore to propel our growth.  

We aim for zero fatality and injuries to foster a safe and healthy workplace environment. Our suppliers will 

also be subject to more robust assessment regarding their socioeconomic compliance and environmental 

practices.  

We shall continue to maintain and uphold our energy saving standards and performances in 

workers’ dormitory and PBSA. We target to adopt innovative technologies within the next few years 

with the aim to lower our greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity ratio. 

We will continue to develop more meaningful partnership with charitable organisations and various institutions 

to improve the welfare of the community. We aim to bring more diversity in terms of gender, 

race and age groups to build a capable and diverse workforce. 

 

At Wee Hur, we are committed to playing our part for society through meaningful partnerships with local 

communities and various institutions. 

Wee Hur firmly believes in the value of sustainable practices in property, construction and development. 

As a testament to our beliefs, the Group has aligned with the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development 

Goals (“SDG”) which define global priorities for sustainability until 2030. Through the 2020 Sustainability 

Report, we wish to articulate our commitment to the following 4 SDG:

Due to COVID-19, the number of workers 

residing in worker dormitories decreased 

in FY2020 compared to F2019 due to 

regulatory requirements. Energy consumed 

remained constant despite lower occupant 

numbers. Hence, energy consumption 

did not fall as drastically as the number of 

occupants, causing energy intensity1 to 

increase.

Energy intensity rose to 549.5 kWh per 

occupant.

Water intensity of 66.7 m3 

per occupant.

Due to COVID-19, there was a significant 

increase in disinfection and cleaning 

frequency in areas with frequent physical 

contact to limit the spread of infection, 

leading to higher water consumption 

in FY2020. Combined with a drop in 

occupancy rates due to regulations, the 

water intensity2 had increased.

Water intensity rose to 94.9 m3 per 

occupant.

Sustainability Report 2020

Sustainable Accommodations (GRI 203-1, 416-1) 

We prioritise the well-being of our occupants. Some of the initiatives that we have taken to enhance well-being of 

our occupants include: 











Every habitable room has a window to provide an external outlook and maximum natural light.

Ample access to natural ventilation and natural light around the facility.

Communal areas for relaxation and enjoyment.

Appointed operator will be experienced in engaging occupants. 

Large green courtyard for activities.

Sustainable Development of PBSA Properties 

The following sustainable development principles were incorporated during the design phase:  

 

•	 Each development is designed to achieve the required Environmental Sustainability standards in each 

 

 

respective local government jurisdiction prior to construction. For example, the A’Beckett development 

 

 

in Melbourne will achieve a 5-star standard in the GreenStar Rating system. 

 

• Low VOC paints and adhesives are being used in the construction of all our developments. 

 

• Deployment of drought resistant plants for landscape works to control the water consumption especially 

 

 

during dry seasons. 

 

• Main corridors in of all our developments are designed to be naturally ventilated instead of being 

 

 

air-conditioned space to reduce overall energy consumption in our buildings. 

 

• Air-conditioning is based on highly efficient air-cooled and water-cooled Variable Refrigerant Flow (“VRF”). 

 

• Lifts will be installed with regenerative drives to convert the excess energy generated into reusable energy.  

 

• Energy efficient lighting was adopted. This comprises fluorescent and LED lighting at student accommodation 

 

 

units with a minimum output of 27 lumens per Watt. 

 

• Motion detectors or occupancy sensors in common areas will be used to provide responsive, demand- 

 

 

controlled and energy efficient amenity. 

 

• Every habitable room has a window to provide a great view and maximum natural light. 

 

• Ample access to natural ventilation and daylight around the facility. 

 

• Large green courtyard for activities. 

 

• Sky gardens for communal activities. 

 

 

• Use of green facade provides passive shading to East and West facing facades in UniLodge City Gardens. 

 

• Airflow between green facade and the external skin of the building promotes energy efficiency by

 

 

natural cooling effects. 

 

•	 Capture rainfall and slow its entry into the storm water system. 

 

•	 Swipe	card	system	which	controls	the	power	supply	to	lights	and	air-conditioning	in	each	apartment.		

Furthermore, by selecting efficient water fittings and water management measures incorporated in the design, 

the predicted water consumption fares better than the average residential water consumption rates.

Electricity and water metres are installed at every project site to track and monitor our electricity and water usage. 

The Group is committed to educate our employees and workers on good environmental practices. 

Water is recycled and reused at project sites to wash vehicles exiting construction site. Water reducers are 

fitted at taps to reduce water usage, and regular on-site checks are conducted at all water outlets to 

ensure that there are no water leakages.  

All our construction projects are equipped with Earth Control Measure (“ECM”) as part of the requirement to 

control earth and silt from being discharged into public drains that lead to water catchment areas. The collected 

water containing a mixture of mud and silt will be treated and filtered before being discharged into the 

common public drainage.

Public Safety (GRI 413-1) 

We are aware that construction sites can be dangerous for the public, and we take full responsibility and 

precaution towards ensuring public safety. We strictly comply with relevant Health and Safety regulations and 

endeavour to reduce safety risks as is reasonably practicable. 

 

Our public safety measures include managing site access to ensure that site boundaries are clearly and 

physically defined with suitable fencing, such as installing netting and toe-boards on scaffolds. We also 

ensure that scaffolding is properly constructed and maintained, and open floor edges are properly blocked off with 

barriers or suitable covering.   

Noise Management (GRI 413-1) 

We proactively engage occupants of any upcoming construction works in the vicinity and where possible, minimise 

the inconvenience to the occupants. Any feedback received is acted promptly. 

 

We have also implemented a noise management programme to minimise noise levels at construction sites.  

Identify Noise Levels

•	

Real	time	noise	monitoring	to	ensure	noise	do	not	exceed	allowable	limit.

Minimise Noise Impact

•	

Limit	noisy	activities	to	daytime	and	no	noisy	works	at	night.

•		

Provide	noise	barrier	and	use	silencer	on	equipment	to	reduce	noise	generated.

•		

Where	possible,	we	adopt	alternative	construction	methods	to	reduce	level	of	noise	generated.

Public Relations

•	

Engage members of the public residing in the surrounding areas to seek their understanding on the 

 

ongoing works. 

• 

Provide feedback avenue by displaying phone number of hotline and any complaints or feedback are acted 

 

on promptly.  

In FY2020, our construction projects exceeded the permissible noise limits set by the National Environmental 

Agency (“NEA”) on 2 occasions.

Vector Control (GRI 413-1) 

Vector control plans are implemented at every construction site to prevent mosquito breeding. NEA officers 

are invited to give talks during our annual campaign to eradicate mosquito breeding. The worksites are 

divided into different zones, with personnel in-charge assigned for each zone to monitor and take action 

to prevent any forms of mosquito breeding. 

We have also implemented cross-checking of sites for mosquito breeding to remain vigilant. External pest 

control companies are also engaged to carry out checks and regular insecticide spray to control mosquito 

breeding. 

We take a serious view on mosquito breeding as it might lead to a health hazard for our workers like 

dengue fever. Six instances of mosquito breeding were discovered at our project sites in FY2020.  

Innovation and Excellence (GRI 203-2) 

We adopted the use of biometric authentication system for all our construction projects. The system allows 

capturing of entry and exit of personnel at the worksite automatically using biometric authentication, 

thereby increasing security and reducing the need for manual recording and compilation of reports. 

In FY2019, we successfully implemented a web-based mobile application to manage our Permit-to-Work 

system, site safety inspections and corrective actions. This replaces the traditional paper-based system and 

allows the safety team to perform more efficiently and productively in their work.  

Workplace Health and Safety (GRI 403-1, 403-2, 403-4) 

Wee Hur has a risk management plan in place for our construction sites to identify, analyse and management 

the risks throughout the lifecycle of the project.  

The project manager works closely with the project team members to ensure that risks are managed during the 

construction process. Risks will be identified as early as possible in the project so as to minimise their impact. 

The health and safety of employees is our number one priority  

The Group has implemented an Environment, Health and Safety (“EHS”) Management System to uphold best 

practices for workplace safety. 

A safety committee is formed for every project site, chaired by the project manager and assisted by the 

Workplace Safety and Health Officer (“WSHO”). A Safety Committee site-walk and meeting is convened every 

fortnightly to ensure all procedures are in place. Non-compliances are identified, and action plans are 

formulated to prevent recurrence. 

For all new workers, they will undergo a safety induction briefing conducted by the project safety team before 

being allowed to commence work on site. For contractors, all personnel and workers entering construction 

sites will undergo a safety orientation by the site WSHO before they are allowed to work. Daily toolbox 

meetings are conducted to remind workers to thoroughly review the work for the day and the safety issues to 

look out for. 

We also conduct twice weekly mass exercise and safety talk at all project sites for all contractors. Safety briefings, 

demonstration and talk are given to all workers to educate and remind them on safety. For all high-risk 

activities, a permission-to-work system is in place and the checklist will need to be checked by the Safety 

Assessor before approval from the project manager is obtained for the work. Site safety is reviewed monthly 

during the senior management review meeting for every site, where project managers report on the safety 

performance of their projects. 

Regular safety promotion campaigns are also conducted at project sites to raise awareness and remind 

workers of the best practices expected of them. Emergency drills are conducted to instil the level of 

vigilance in our workers to respond effectively to emergencies at construction sites.

WEE HUR HOLDINGS LTD 

Sustainability Report 2020

To further promote safety awareness, we have started the monthly evaluation of site safety performance. 

Corporate Safety will conduct monthly safety audits and evaluate the safety performance at 

every site. The performance of every site will be circulated to all teams to encourage them to perform 

well in safety, and areas for improvement will be highlighted. 

For project sites with poorer safety performance, the frequency of corporate safety inspection and audit will be 

increased. Close guidance will be given to the team to improve their safety performance in the shortest 

time possible. 

In FY2020, there were 6 reportable incidents at our construction sites. A near miss is an unplanned 

event that did not result in any injury, illness or damage, but had the potential to do so. By tracking near 

misses, we can take pre-emptive action before an incident happens. The Group abides by MOM 

regulations regarding the reporting requirements for work related incidents. There were zero near misses 

in FY2020. 

Our health and safety performance has improved since FY2019. We saw 6 reportable incidents, zero fatalities 

in our projects. However, there were 2 stop-work incidents resulting in 13 stop-work days in FY2020.

Managing our Suppliers (GRI 308-1, 414-1) 

Wee Hur strives to ensure that suppliers throughout the supply chain meet the practices and standards 

expected by the Group.  

Suppliers and subcontractors are required to declare and acknowledge their responsibilities in ensuring 

compliance to local regulations. Above and beyond, we comply with the ISO 14001 Environmental 

Management Standards and assess our suppliers and subcontractors based on their environmental and social 

obligations. 

We have included environmental and social criteria in the evaluation of our new suppliers and 

subcontractors in FY2020. Suppliers were assessed on whether they carry Green Label products as 

endorsed by Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (“SGLS”), and whether subcontractors have the 

workplace safety and health capabilities to meet the standards of “Bizsafe level 3”. 

Fines or Penalty (GRI 307-1, 308-2, 414-2, 419-1) 

Wee Hur received fines of S$55,500 in FY2020, which was significantly higher than S$37,200 in FY2019. 

We have an overall monitoring structure to ensure that corrective actions have been implemented to effectively 

reduce future occurrences.

Energy, Emissions and Water Management (GRI 302-1, 302-3, 302-5, 303-1, 305-2, 305-4, 305-5) 

Total energy consumption decreased whereas water consumption increased in FY2020 compared to FY2019. 

The intensity of energy and water consumption increased in FY2020 compared to FY2019.   

The increase in water intensity was due to a lower number of occupants from regulatory requirements 

during FY2020 and the increase in the frequency of cleaning and disinfection due to COVID-19. For energy 

intensity, the drop in energy consumption did not decrease as drastically as total occupant numbers, 

leading to an increase compared to FY2019. We have in place a robust energy and water management policy

and will continue our efforts to minimise consumption.  

Waste Management (GRI 306-1) 

The sewage and sanitary drainage system at Tuas View Dormitory is designed and operated in accordance with the

requirements and provisions of the Sewerage and Drainage Act. All wastewater generated from the dormitory 

are discharged into the public sewer according to the requirements and provisions of the Sewerage and 

Drainage Act.  

Occupant Health and Safety (GRI 416-1) 

Induction programmes are conducted for occupants during check-in to inform them of the safety rules and

regulations. Posters for safety and health awareness have also been placed around the residential area 

for tenants in different languages to educate them of safety precautions. Regulatory bodies such as the 

Singapore Police Force, NEA and MOM are invited to conduct roadshows to engage with the occupants 

to educate on safety and legal obligations in Singapore. 

 

Wee Hur takes a firm stand towards complying with legal and regulatory requirements and ensures that 

treatment for fogging, larviciding and treatments for rats, cockroaches and mosquitoes are conducted to 

ensure cleanliness of premises. Clean room awards are given to occupants who display outstanding efforts in 

maintaining a hygienic premise.  

Tuas View Dormitory 

Tuas View Dormitory is one of the largest workers’ dormitories 

in Singapore. This dormitory is a self-contained living quarters 

equipped 

with 

common 

toilets, 

designated 

cooking 

and 

food 

preparation area, laundry area and common dining cum interacting 

area.	 It	 also	 comes	 with	 an	 indoor	 recreational/multi-purpose	 room,	

reading rooms and TV rooms as well as two indoor gymnasiums 

and at least two outdoor game courts. There are also commercial 

amenities such as minimarts, a canteen and other retail shops to 

provide greater convenience to the occupants.  

Investment Property



Tuas View Dormitory was granted an extension on its land lease for another three years on 1 November 2020. 

To comply with the new requirements for workers’ dormitories, Tuas View dormitory had its capacity reduced 

to 11,808 beds from 16,800 beds.

In FY2020, a COVID-19 cluster was confirmed at the Tuas View Dormitory. The operator that manages 

the Tuas View Dormitory will continue to maintain strict compliance with COVID-19 safety regulations 

as mandated by authorities to ensure the safety of dormitory inhabitants. 

UniLodge Park Central, Brisbane 

The PBSA property has two towers, namely the Metro Tower which has 437 beds and Sky Tower which 

has 1,141 beds, totalling 1,578 beds. Due to the ongoing pandemic, we experienced a drop of annualised 

occupancy from 80% in FY2019 to 57% in FY2020.

Total energy and water consumption decreased in FY2020 compared to FY2019. However, energy and 

water intensity increased in FY2020 compared to FY2019 due to the COVID-19 global pandemic which 

has limited the ability of students to meet physically for classroom learning and moved many mediums 

for teaching and learning online, resulting in higher usage within the dormitories. Occupancy has also 

been impacted due to restrictions placed on international travel. Due to the smaller tenant base, the fixed 

energy consumption required to power common areas and equipment has been allocated to a smaller 

number of occupants, causing energy and water intensity to appear disproportionately higher.  

Moving forward, we will continue our efforts to minimise consumption and encourage occupants to live 

sustainably. The Group will be embarking on various initiatives to help reduce consumption at the property. 

We have been exploring the options of installing water efficient equipment and fittings at taps and showerheads. 

Initiatives such as raising the environmental awareness of our occupants through targeted campaigns 

to incentivise residents to reduce their consumption are also on our roadmap as well.

Waste Management (GRI 306-1, 306-3, 306-4, 306-5) 

At UniLodge Park Central, we promote recycling and endeavour to minimise waste generation. We provide 

dual recycling bins and general waste chutes at each floor which encourages residents to separate their 

wastes and dispose accordingly. Furthermore, we have two designated areas for large waste disposals 

located at the carpark and loading bay which facilitate the collection of waste and recycled materials.

There was a 33% increase in waste generated from 0.26MT per occupant to 0.35MT in FY2020. This was 

directly attributable to more parcel deliveries during COVID-19 where online deliveries became the main 

mode for purchases during lockdowns. For instance, our data revealed that UniLodge Park Central registered 

approximately 1,150 parcels in December 2020 at 35% occupancy compared to only 390 parcels in 

December 2019 at a much higher occupancy of 75%. We continue to be relentless in our efforts to educate 

residents on recycling and are exploring the use of technological advancements to help recycle and reuse 

cardboard waste.

are exploring ways to help divert waste such as packaging cardboard from being directly disposed of. 

Y Suites on Waymouth, Adelaide 

The property along Waymouth Street in Adelaide will be the first to be launched under the Group’s new 

Y Suites brand for our PBSA portfolio in Australia. The PBSA property has 811 beds and was due to commence 

operations in February 2021. However, due to the ongoing pandemic which has seen international borders 

in Australia being closed up till June 2021, we have yet to commence operations. We will accumulate the 

environmental data for the PBSA property which will be reported in FY2021, subject to the property 

commencing operations within the year.

Safety Measures against COVID-19 (GRI 403-1, 403-4) 

In FY2020, the COVID-19 outbreak resulted in a global pandemic which had an unprecedented impact 

worldwide. To contain the outbreak, the Singapore Government implemented measures including a 

circuit breaker, safe distancing and movement restrictions. During these unsettling times, we stay committed 

to prioritising the safety of our employees and workers.  

We implemented safe management measures (“SMM”) and all employees were briefed on the SMM and 

required to ensure strict enforcement. Some of the SMM include putting in place SafeEntry visitor 

management and temperature screening for all entering our premises and work sites. We increased the 

frequency of cleaning and disinfection of our premises, especially areas with high contact points. In addition, 

a clear physical spacing of at least one metre must be kept between all persons at all times. In line with 

Government measures, the Group implemented alternative work arrangements and tele-conferencing to minimise 

physical contact. 

As at 31 December 2020, we had 217 staff and 216 foreign workers under our care. In FY2020, there were 

21 incidents of COVID-19 transmission among foreign workers and zero incidents of COVID-19 transmission 

among staff. There were 1,680-man days lost as a result of COVID-19. In addition, there was no reported 

incident of non-compliance with local COVID-19 laws and regulations regarding the living conditions of 

our foreign workers. 

Employee Diversity (GRI 401-1, 405-1) 

Wee Hur values diversity. We have staff of different nationalities, and we continuously cultivate interactions 

and understanding between nationalities.  

While we do not have any female director at the board level currently, we are open to having one in the future
