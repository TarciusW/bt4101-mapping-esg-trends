CEO’S MESSAGE

This is Singapore Airlines’ fifth 

Sustainability Report, detailing 

our sustainability-related 

initiatives over the past financial 

year related to economic, 

environmental and social issues. 

It represents another progressive step forward in our 

sustainability journey. We have transitioned to the latest 

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards for 

disclosures on topics identified as important to SIA and 

our stakeholders, and are encouraged by feedback that 

we have been receiving about the quality of our 

reporting. We will endeavour to keep improving.

SIA was recognised by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in 

2016 as a frontrunner in environmental, social and 

governance standards when we were included in the new 

SGX Sustainability Leaders Index. We were honoured by 

the recognition, and consider it affirmation that our 

sustainability efforts are maturing and moving in the right 

direction. We are now working to ensure that future 

reports will be in compliance with new SGX rules on 

sustainability reporting that will soon take effect.

In this year’s report, we have included additional targets 

that have been set for various aspects of our business. 

For example, to improve sustainability along our supply 

chain, we aim to source seafood from suppliers that have 

been accredited by the Marine Stewardship Council. We 

also aim to offer more Singapore-manufactured 

products to our customers to support more local small 

and medium-sized enterprises.

During the past financial year, we took delivery of 10 more 

Airbus A350-900s, which are the most fuel-efficient aircraft 

in our fleet. We also announced a commitment to order 

20 Boeing 777-9s and 19 more Boeing 787-10s. This is in 

line with our longstanding practice of maintaining a 

modern fleet, which enables us to operate more 

efficiently and expand our network reach. We added 

Canberra, Dusseldorf and Wellington to the Singapore 

Airlines network during the financial year and 

relaunched non-stop services between Singapore and 

the United States. In addition to allowing for network 

expansion, our investment in new fuel-efficient 

aircraft helps to advance our objective of reducing 

carbon emissions.

We support the wider aviation industry’s targets to tackle 

climate change. These comprise: improving fuel efficiency 

by an average of 1.5 per cent annually from 2009 to 2020; 

stabilising net aviation CO2 emissions at 2020 levels 

through carbon-neutral growth; and reducing aviation’s 

net CO2 emissions to 50 per cent of 2005 levels by 2050.

Our new Singapore-Canberra-Wellington route, dubbed 

the “Capital Express”, is one example of how we are 

doing our part to reduce emissions together with 

partners. We have worked closely with the air traffic 

management authorities to implement best practices in 

flight operations to help reduce fuel burn.

We are also committed to achieving, by FY2020/21,  

a 15 per cent reduction in electricity consumption in 

our offices and a 30 per cent reduction in waste 

generation from our buildings. Various departments 

across Singapore Airlines are also doing their part for 

the environment by setting targets to reduce paper 

usage. Details of these and other initiatives are shared 

in the “Managing Our Environmental Impact” section of 

this report.

A significant corporate development during the 

financial year was the formation of Budget Aviation 

Holdings, which has been tasked with more closely 

integrating the two budget carriers in our portfolio, 

Scoot and Tiger Airways, which will be operating under 

the single Scoot brand name in the second half of the 

2017 calendar year. This is an example of the increasing 

importance of subsidiaries to the SIA Group, and we 

aim to progressively broaden our scope of reporting to 

include more information about them in the years 

ahead. This will enable us to better move the entire SIA 

Group forward in our sustainability development. In 

this report, we have included various initiatives taken 

by subsidiary airlines aimed at enhancing the travel 

experience of our customers. 

The year ahead will be another challenging one, with 

overcapacity in our industry that is continuing to put 

significant pressure on yields. Fuel prices remain volatile, 

competition is intensifying and there is uncertainty over 

the global economic outlook. Despite the challenges, we 

remain committed to achieving our sustainability goals, 

and will continue to invest in new technologies and 

initiatives to sharpen our competitive advantage. We will 

also continue to seek out new opportunities to expand 

through adjacent businesses. The Airbus Asia Training 

Centre for pilot training in Singapore is one example. The 

facility, which is a joint venture with Airbus, was officially 

opened in the last financial year to meet the increasing 

demand for flight crew training services in the region.

SIA’s greatest asset is its people and we will continue to 

invest heavily in training and learning initiatives to 

further develop our staff and expand their competencies. 

Our corporate core values have been refreshed to better 

motivate employees in a fast-changing economy. 

 A dedicated Transformation Office was established 

recently to explore ways to do business differently and 

more innovatively. We also met targets relating to the 

enhancement of employee communications during the 

financial year in review.

This is the SIA Group’s 70th anniversary year. As we 

celebrate this milestone and look back on our journey, 

we will remain committed to continue giving back to the 

community, growing as a sustainable organisation and 

looking forward to the future.

ABOUT SINGAPORE AIRLINES


CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Singapore Airlines Board and Management are committed 

to continually enhancing shareholder value by maintaining high 

standards of corporate governance, professionalism, integrity 

and commitment at all levels, underpinned by strong internal 

controls and risk management systems.

This Report sets out the Company’s corporate governance 

processes, with specific reference to the guidelines of the revised 

Code of Corporate Governance issued by the Ministry of Finance 

in Singapore in May 2012.

The Singapore Airlines Board consists of Chairman Mr Peter 

Seah Lim Huat, CEO Mr Goh Choon Phong and seven Directors 

from diverse backgrounds with varied expertise in finance, 

legal, business, marketing and management fields. The Board’s 

principal functions include charting the Group’s strategic 

direction, reviewing and approving annual budgets and financial 

plans and monitoring the Group’s performance; approving major 

acquisitions and fund-raising exercises; and ensuring the Group’s 

compliance with all laws and regulations as may be relevant to 

the business.

Full profiles of Directors are available on pages 20 to 21 and 

pages 76 to 79 of the Annual Report.

Length of Service

Newly appointed Directors serve an initial term of three 

years, after which they are considered for re-nomination 

for another term(s). Their re-nominations are subject to the 

recommendations of the Chairman of the Board and the 

Nominating Committee. New Directors appointed in the year 

are subject to retirement and re-election by shareholders at 

the next Annual General Meeting after their appointment. All 

new appointments and re-elections require the approval of the 

Special Member, Singapore’s Minister for Finance.

Management briefs new Directors on the Company’s business 

and strategic direction, as well as governance practices. The 

Company conducts orientation programmes and site visits for 

new Directors and arranges for Directors to be updated on new 

laws and regulations, as well as changing commercial risks 

and industry developments, as deemed appropriate. Formal 

letters are issued to newly appointed Directors upon their 

appointment, including details of their duties and obligations 

as Directors.

For FY2016/17, Board Members attended briefings on the 

challenges facing the airline industry, as well as other related 

topics conducted by global airline industry leaders and experts.

Please refer to pages 63 to 66 of our Annual Report for more 

information on SIA’s Board Committees.

Communication with Shareholders

Singapore Airlines is committed to continually strengthening our 

relationship with the investing community and believes in timely 

and consistent disclosure of pertinent information to enable a 

transparent assessment of the Company’s value. The Company 

values dialogue with shareholders, and holds analyst and media 

briefings when announcing half-yearly and year-end results. Full 

transcripts of the proceedings are made available on SGXNet and 

our Company’s website at www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/

about-us/information-for-investors.

All financial results, as well as price-sensitive information, 

are released in a timely manner through various media, 

including press releases posted on the Company’s website and 

disclosure via SGXNet. The Company’s website is an important 

source of information for shareholders and the investing 

community. Quarterly results announcements, news releases, 

presentation slides, monthly operating statistics, annual reports, 

sustainability reports and other key facts and figures about the 

Company are available on the Information for Investors page.

The Investor Relations Department meets with analysts and 

investors on a regular basis through investor conferences and 

roadshows, as well as ad-hoc meetings and teleconferences. A 

dedicated investor relations email and hotline are maintained for 

the investing community to reach out to the Company for queries.

Risk Assessment and Management

The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the 

Company’s risk governance, including the Enterprise-wide 

Risk Management Framework and corresponding processes. 

Through the Risk Management Process, all risks, including 

economic, environmental and socio-political, are identified, 

evaluated and managed accordingly on a coordinated and 

integrated basis. The Board Safety and Risk Committee reviews 

the effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Risk 

Management Process on behalf of the Board of Directors and 

meets at least quarterly to review risks and controls. The Board 

Safety and Risk Committee also ensures key risks are reported 

annually to the Board of Directors.

The Risk Management Process provides for the identification 

and management of risks from ground up, including from staff 

working in contact with customers/consumers, suppliers/agents 

and regulatory bodies. The needs and expectations of these 

external parties are taken into consideration in identifying and 

managing the risks.

The Risk Management Process also requires Senior Management 

to provide a top-down perspective to the identification and 

management of risks, so that corporate and shareholders’ needs 

and requirements are also taken into consideration.

Subsidiaries under the SIA Group are required to implement 

the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Framework. The SIA 

Group Risk Management Committee maintains oversight of 

the risk management activities of the Group and subsidiaries 

and ensures that risk responses are coordinated across the 

companies. Group-wide risk management reviews are carried 

out twice annually to ensure that risk registers are kept current 

and corresponding risk controls are kept in place and up to date.

Ethics and Integrity

Singapore Airlines is committed to achieving high standards of 

corporate governance. Ethical business conduct is a significant 

guiding principle we adopt in our worldwide operations.

Our partnership with employees, contractors and agents is on 

the basis that their integrity in the conduct of their work is critical 

to our business and reputation.

Singapore Airlines has a whistle-blowing programme called 

“Policy on Reporting Wrongdoing”, for employees, stakeholders 

and the public to raise concerns about possible improprieties 

in matters of financial reporting or any other matter, in 

confidence. The policy is communicated to our employees 

through our internal Intranet and a mandatory e-learning 

training module. Under the policy, employees may report 

suspected matters of wrongdoing affecting the Company, 

either through email at ethics_hotline@singaporeair.com.sg 

or via telephone at +65 93875667. The Audit Committee has 

reviewed and is satisfied with the adequacy of this programme. 

All whistle-blower reports are reviewed by the Audit Committee 

at its quarterly meetings to ensure independent investigation 

and adequate resolution. There were no confirmed incidents 

of corruption involving our employees or business partners in 

FY2016/17.

Singapore Airlines requires employees who are in a conflict of 

interest situation or involved in one which could potentially 

lead to a conflict of interest to report the matter to the

Materiality Assessment

SUSTAINABILITY AT SINGAPORE AIRLINES

SIA’s Sustainability Strategic Working Committee (SSWC) conducted a Materiality Assessment in 2013. We reflected on significant 

economic, environmental and social impacts to determine which topics are material to the organisation. This process included 

evaluating feedback from internal and external stakeholders, for example customer feedback. In addition, as SIA’s Head Office is 

located in Singapore, the topic boundaries are focused on operations in Singapore, unless otherwise stated within the report.

The Materiality Assessment was subsequently endorsed by SIA’s Management Committee. We will include the sustainable 

practices of our subsidiaries progressively, so as to provide a more holistic picture of the SIA Group in terms of opportunities, 

risks and performance.

SAFETY AT SINGAPORE AIRLINES


SIA’S SAFETY PERFORMANCE

SIA Safety Programme

The SIA Safety Programme serves to strengthen safety as a core value and promote 

greater understanding and awareness of safety concepts and the Company’s efforts 

towards safety management. This helps employees to better appreciate the roles they 

play, as well as the contributions they can make towards higher safety standards. The 

programme covers Introduction to Safety, Effective Safety Management, Safety Culture 

and Our Approach and Commitment to Safety. Every employee is enrolled in the Safety 

Programme and takes a refresher assessment every three years.

Management Oversight

SIA’s safety governance structure consists of five groups to guide safety management:

• Board Safety and Risk Committee (BSRC).

• Occupational Safety, Health and Environment Committee (OSHE).

• Air Safety Committee (ASC).

• Safety, Security &amp; Environment Division (SSE).

• Divisional safety departments / Safety Action Groups (SAG).

Ground Ramp Incident Prevention (GRIP) Programme 

The SIA Ground Ramp Incident Prevention (GRIP) programme is into its 13th year. 

Over 1,500 observations were made in 2016 by teams from various divisions. This 

programme focuses on preventing ground ramp incidents at our overseas stations. 

Unsafe conditions and practices noticed were minor in nature and were attended 

to immediately.

Workplace Safety and Health 

As a result of the Workplace Safety and Health Risk Management Regulations set by 

Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower, we focused on preparing relevant managers and 

risk assessment team leaders for the mandatory risk assessment exercise in FY2016/17. 

Selected staff were trained on the fundamentals of hazard identification, risk assessment 

and risk management at the workplace by applying risk management principles. 

Flight Data Analysis Programme (FDAP)

Flight data is captured in our aircraft’s Quick Access Recorders (QAR). The data, which 

captures much of the aircraft’s flight and systems performance, is downloaded from the 

QAR and is analysed for irregularities and to identify trends. Where necessary, corrective 

and/or preventive measures will be taken to improve flying standards and enhance safety.

Safety Risk Management

SIA’s Safety Risk Management policy is to manage risks in order to achieve corporate 

objectives. Safety risks are managed by proactively identifying the risks, and 

measures are then implemented to mitigate the risks to levels that are acceptable 

and necessary to enhance the value of the Company.

Safety Surveys

SIA carries out a company-wide online safety survey with air crew every two years. 

The safety survey assesses a number of areas, such as safety management, violations 

observed during operations and readiness of our crew to report safety occurrences 

or issues. It provides an overall assessment of the safety climate and culture in our 

operational environment, as well as any safety concerns of our crew.

We also have a comprehensive list of quantitative and qualitative performance 

indicators to measure the effectiveness of our efforts. These indicators are reviewed on 

a quarterly basis and are benchmarked against industry standards.

Employee Feedback

We place emphasis on using employee feedback to improve the safety environment in 

the workplace and encourage employees to identify hazards and report incidents, no 

matter how minor, to create awareness and highlight risks. Procedures are put in place 

for employees to report such incidents for both flight and occupational safety.

Cabin Operation Safety 

Determining the level of safety in our cabin operations is key to helping us 

understand the effectiveness of safety procedures and to review improvement plans. 

With the Cabin Safety Observations (CSO) programme, we are able to adopt a quality 

approach in assessing crews’ performance in their safety duties and responsibilities. 

All information gathered by our qualified observers is collated and discussed with 

Cabin Crew Management, as well as shared with cabin crew. Areas for improvement 

are identified and worked on. Findings from the CSO are categorised into Levels One, 

Two and Three (Level Three is the lowest level of severity). Our target is to not have 

more than one Level Three finding and zero Level One and Two findings per audit. 

Safety &amp; Security Week 2016

The Safety &amp; Security Week (SSW) was held from 29 August – 2 September 2016 to 

promote safety and security awareness among SIA Group staff. “Safety &amp; Security – It 

Makes Sense” was the theme of the SSW, highlighting the importance of being alert to 

our surroundings and potential safety hazards. Various divisions and units within the 

SIA Group organised programmes such as forums, seminars and campaigns to promote 

safety and security at their respective work areas.

 

Operational Safety

For our pilots, operational safety is key. To ensure the highest standards of flight 

operations, our pilots undergo rigorous training with continuous refresher courses.



We believe that it is every employee’s 

responsibility to work towards a strong 

and positive safety culture.

SAFETY AT SINGAPORE AIRLINES


SIA’S SAFETY PERFORMANCE

Recurrent Training

Recurrent training for pilots:

Conducted twice a year in the full-flight simulator, the recurrent training programme 

enhances the proficiency of our pilots in handling and managing abnormal and 

emergency situations. Recurrent training also allows our pilots to practise manual 

flying under different situations and environmental conditions. Proficiency in 

manual flying is a key skill for pilots in the face of increasing automation in modern 

flight decks.

 

Recurrent SEP training:

Conducted every year, the training ensures our pilots’ knowledge is refreshed and 

tested. It also ensures they remain competent in aircraft and cabin safety, and 

emergency procedures.

Recurrent CRM training:

This refresher course is conducted for pilots once every three years.

Recency training:

This is conducted for any pilot who has been absent from flying for more than 35 days.

Developmental training:

SIA has a Pilot Development Unit that takes charge of development training 

programmes for pilots. Most of these courses are conducted by in-house presenters and 

facilitators, with some courses run by external consultants. An in-house Flight Instructor 

Development Programme is conducted for instructor candidates.

Other training:

Within the framework of mandatory training, SIA also conducts other training for 

pilots, deemed useful or necessary in light of our operating experience, recent events 

or incidents involving other airlines (evidence-based training). Every year our staff 

from Flight Crew Training attend major pilot training conferences and seminars held by 

industry organisations and aircraft manufacturers to gain insight into new and innovative 

training methodologies and to share training experiences within the industry.

In addition to recurrent and developmental training, every pilot undergoes a 

minimum of three checks a year. These include two Base Checks in the full-flight 

simulator to demonstrate competency in manual flying and in handling and 

managing abnormal, and emergency procedures, as well as one Line Check in 

the aircraft to assess competency in operating a regular flight in accordance with 

company policies and standard operating procedures.

This continues throughout the pilot’s career and a pilot will visit the full-flight 

simulator at least four times a year either for training sessions or checks. This ensures

SIA’S SAFETY PERFORMANCE

that a pilot’s knowledge, flying skills and cockpit management skills are continuously 

practised, refreshed and updated. 

Another key initiative in our pilot development is our pilot mentoring programme. 

This mentoring framework aims to further improve our pilots’ performance through 

teaching, coaching and role modelling. It also supports the transition of our pilots in 

their new roles as they advance through the ranks, from cadet pilots to instructors.

In addition, this mentoring framework provides opportunities for our senior pilots to 

develop their coaching, mentoring and communication skills. The goal of the mentoring 

programme is to develop our pilots to their full potential, enhance safety attitudes and 

behaviours by building on their professional values, and propagate SIA’s organisational 

core values.

Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS)

SIA is an active participant in this programme, which looks at issues related to pilot 

fatigue to enhance safety and ensure optimal operating levels of our crew.

Crew rest facilities on our aircraft are carefully evaluated to ensure proper rest is 

available for our crew who are on duty. SIA has been actively developing policies 

and processes to continuously evaluate, mitigate and monitor crew fatigue, which 

are reported to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) on a regular basis. 

A Fatigue Safety Action Group compromising representatives from SIA’s Safety, 

Security &amp; Environment Division, Flight Operations and the Air Line Pilots Association 

Singapore (ALPA-S) conducts meetings once every two months.

Aircraft Maintenance

SIA’s Engineering Division’s pursuit of operational and technical excellence is fuelled by 

the strong correlation between safety and reliability. Our aircraft maintenance complies 

with the requirements set by CAAS as well as the recommendations of the International 

Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  

While this focus on achieving high standards in aircraft maintenance remains a key 

objective, the drive towards a safe working environment for our staff and contractors 

is also a priority. The incorporation of Safety Management System (SMS) practices 

into airworthiness requirements by both CAAS and ICAO has given fresh impetus to 

Engineering Division’s longstanding emphasis on “safe aircraft, safely maintained”. 

For this reason, our Engineering Division has sought, attained and maintained 

accreditation by TUV SUD PSB Pte Ltd, a global testing, certification, inspection and 

training provider, in the following aspects:

ISO 9001:2008

QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM for the provision of technical support for SIA’s 

aircraft acquisition and disposal, aircraft maintenance activities, and engineering and 

spares management.

ISO 14001:2004

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM for the provision and management of 

aviation and engineering support services.

 BS OHSAS 18001:2007

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM for the provision and 

management of aviation engineering support services.

Passenger Safety

We offer a wide variety of safety and security courses to train our cabin crew. 

All pilots and cabin crew undergo courses such as SEP training and are enrolled in 

the FRMS programme. Information on workplace safety is shared with crew through 

videos, circulars, campaigns and communication sessions. Our cabin crew are trained 

to be situationally aware at all times, and to be proficient in teamwork and effective 

communication. The importance of balancing service with safety and security is also 

consistently emphasised through the various channels. We target zero high-severity 

incidents. 

Food Safety

SIA is committed to serving in-flight meals that meet the highest levels of food safety 

and hygiene. We have a policy of not using Monosodium Glutamate in our freshly 

prepared meals. Our caterers ensure that ingredients are sourced from licenced and 

accredited establishments which conform to requirements of relevant regulatory 

authorities, as well as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) and 

International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

Locally-manufactured items are procured only from establishments that are licenced 

by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore or the equivalent authority in 

other countries. The Quality Assurance team from our local caterer, SATS, conducts 

factory audits, regular laboratory tests and random quality checks on incoming raw 

materials. In addition, SATS is regularly audited by Medina Quality and Safety Alliance 

In-flight Services.

Employees

As a global airline, SIA is dedicated to providing air 

transportation services of the highest quality. With an 

unyielding commitment to fleet modernisation, product 

and service innovation, as well as market leadership, we are 

proud to be one of the world’s most respected travel brands.

Our success would not have been possible without 

the efforts of our people and our strong collaborative 

partnership with our unions. We recruit dynamic 

individuals from diverse backgrounds and provide our 

employees with equal opportunities to achieve their full 

potential. Our union leaders have also supported us over 

the years in launching initiatives that help our workforce 

to be better prepared for the future.

In 2016, SIA won the award for the Most Popular Graduate 

Employer for the “Logistics, Transport and Supply Chain” 

sector at the Singapore’s 100 Leading Graduate Employers 

Awards. The award recognises organisations which 

students from Singapore’s institutions of higher education 

most want to work for.

Industrial Relations

We work closely with the Air Line Pilots Association Singapore (ALPA-S), 

Air-Transport Executive Staff Union (AESU) and Singapore Airlines Staff 

Union (SIASU) to ensure that fair and sustainable wage settlements and 

terms of employment are provided to employees. About 98 per cent of 

SIA employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

We adopt a collaborative partnership approach in our engagements with 

the unions. Regular monthly meetings are held between management 

and union leaders to address workforce matters. They also explore new 

initiatives aimed at preparing our employees to meet an increasingly 

competitive business environment. We have successfully launched 

various programmes to ensure the continuous development and skills 

upgrading of our employees, in order to widen their career experience, 

and improve individual performance and productivity. 

SIA’s Chairman and senior management hold quarterly luncheon 

engagements with the union leaders, where they discuss the business 

outlook and labour-management issues. Union leaders are also invited 

to company functions, such as retirement and long service awards 

ceremonies, and company Business Meetings. Union-Management 

retreats are also organised for the participants to discuss long-term 

strategic workforce initiatives.

Some key agreements concluded with the unions include: 

• ALPA-S Collective Agreement effective 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2018.

• SIASU Collective Agreement effective 1 March 2016 to 28 February 2019.

• Service Increment 2016 with AESU effective 1 July 2016.

• Service Increment 2016 with SIASU effective 1 July 2016.

• AESU Collective Agreement effective 1 August 2016 to 30 July 2019.

• Service Increment 2017 with ALPA-S effective 1 January 2017.

AESU: 

Representative body for airline executives. About 50 per cent of SIA 

executives are members.

ALPA-S:

Representative body for airline pilots in Singapore. About 95 per cent of 

SIA pilots are members.

SIASU:

Employee Code of Conduct

All employees are expected to adhere to SIA’s Employees’ Code of 

Conduct or staff regulations, published on our corporate Intranet. 

Our staff regulations cover aspects such as non-discrimination, 

harassment, anti-corruption and competition law policies. 

Grievance mechanisms are also detailed in our Collective 

Agreements. Other labour practices relating to child labour, forced 

or compulsory labour, human rights grievance mechanism, and 

diversity and equal opportunity are carried out in accordance with 

the Ministry of Manpower’s Employment Act as well as other laws 

of Singapore.

Strict compliance with our staff regulations is expected of all 

staff as set out in their employment contracts. When cases of 

misconduct are reported, the Company has an established 

Disciplinary Inquiry Process to guide appropriate actions. All 

proceedings of disciplinary inquiries are recorded and a summary 

report of each inquiry is submitted to our senior management. 

The staff regulations are also reviewed from time to time by the 

Human Resources Division and Legal Department to ensure its 

relevance and for changes to be communicated to staff. The 

number of grievances to third parties, if any, are captured annually 

and reported in SIA’s Sustainability Report.

Performance &amp; Productivity

SIA Core Values

We refreshed our core values in FY2016/17, in conjunction with the 

Airline’s 70th anniversary. Our core values define who we are as an 

organisation. All employees are expected to embrace and exemplify 

our core values in the course of their work. The spirit of our core 

values is reinforced in our onboarding programme as well as during 

staff appraisals.

Towards Optimal Productivity (TOP)

In 2012, we introduced our workforce productivity initiative, 

Towards Optimal Productivity (TOP), in collaboration with our 

ground staff unions. The TOP programme aims to develop a culture 

of high performance and a mindset of continuous learning, aligned 

with career growth and progression for our employees. 

Careers@SIA

The Careers@SIA framework was introduced in April 2016, with 

the aim of giving all our Head Office ground staff opportunities 

to achieve their career aspirations in the Company. The previous 

stratification between executive and administrative support staff 

was merged into a single continuum from Grade One to Grade 13. 

This programme allows administrative support staff to take on roles 

that were previously assigned to executive staff. The new framework 

allows for employees to progress up the ranks based on their 

competencies, work performance and potential to take on more 

job responsibilities. 

Performance Reviews

All permanent SIA employees received a regular performance and 

career development review during FY2016/17.

Employee Communications and Engagement

SIA engages its employees through communications on our internal platforms, 

internal and public events, wellness and health activities, community service, and 

social functions. In addition, regular surveys are conducted to gauge the level of 

engagement with employees.

Quarterly Breakfast with CEO and Human Resources (HR) Forums, where employees 

holding managerial positions discuss HR policies, enable the Company to engage 

employees. In 2016, all employees were invited to an “Ask HR” forum where any matters 

pertaining to HR policies could be openly discussed with senior management from our 

HR Division.

Latest news and information are shared with our people through various 

communication channels. Examples of our internal communication channels include:

• Outlook, our in-house magazine, published on a monthly basis.

• Our corporate Intranet site which can be accessed by all employees. The different 

divisions (e.g. Cabin Crew, Flight Operations, Sales and Marketing) have their own 

portals to share information specific to their areas of work.

• Business Meetings for employees are organised twice a year. The meetings cover a 

review of the Group’s commercial activities and financial results.

• LCD TVs in common areas such as employee canteens, shared meeting rooms and 

Cabin Crew Control Centre which broadcast company-related videos and news.

• An internal online platform enables online social interaction among staff and 

improves productivity and collaboration at work.

• Other forms of employee communications include regular communication sessions, 

departmental debriefs, and sessions between senior managers and team members.

The Company conducts an Organisational Climate Survey (OCS) once every two years 

to gather feedback on employee engagement and workplace issues. The last survey 

was conducted in 2016. Following the OCS results, Management reviewed and took 

necessary steps to reinforce areas that received positive feedback and addressed gaps 

which were raised by staff. In November 2016, a pulse survey was launched to assess 

staff feedback on various measures undertaken by our HR Division in response to the 

OCS results and we have seen improvement in the overall engagement scores.

Our 7Degrees Staff Lounge at Airline House, our Head Office, with facilities such as a 

table tennis table, foosball table and video games, has been well received by staff. The 

lounge provides employees with a space to unwind and network, and serves as a venue 

to hold social functions and activities.

The Flight Operations Division also engages with its ground staff via social events such 

as quarterly breakfast sessions and an annual Christmas party.

To ensure that the management team continues to engage with our pilots, Flight 

Operations Division holds a Flight Operations Get-Together session once a year, briefing 

sessions on the Company’s performance each month and provides updates on other 

crew operational matters every quarter.

The Cabin Crew Division engages with our crew members on various platforms, web-

based applications as well as face-to-face dialogues. The dialogue sessions are held 

once or twice every month and each gathering comprises up to 30 crew participants. 

Community Service

Our employees served the community through organised group visits to homes, outings 

with beneficiaries and fundraising initiatives. The spirit of giving was also not forgotten 

during festive periods such as Christmas, when employees granted the wishes of 

beneficiaries from the Association for Persons with Special Needs (APSN) with presents.





Our success would not have been 

possible without the efforts of our 

people and our strong collaborative 

partnership with our unions.

Cabin Crew

Crew Welfare

We ensure that our pilots and cabin crew are given sufficient rest during layovers and 

after flights. Cabin crew are also encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities 

(ECAs) which aim to provide them with a holistic work experience and opportunities to 

interact with their colleagues.

In addition to rest days, cabin crew are given in-flight rest on longer flights. Our rest 

rules exceed all mandatory requirements in the Fatigue Risk Management System 

guidelines stipulated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). We constantly 

share information on fatigue management with our cabin crew to ensure they have 

sufficient rest before each duty. This is done through channels such as online courses.

Extracurricular Activities (ECA)

Thirty-two ECAs covering a wide range of interests are available to our cabin crew. 

They can choose from an array of ECAs such as the Cabin Crew Performing Arts Circle, 

Music Society and the Creative Circle to hone their creative and artistic talents. Those 

who enjoy being outdoors can join various activities such as the Cabin Crew Tennis 

Circle, Basketball Club or Golf Circle. There are also indoor ECAs such as the Fitness 

&amp; Nutrition Circle and Bowling Buddies. Lifestyle-driven ECAs such as Toastmasters, 

the Wine Appreciation Group and Le Club provide an avenue for crew to develop their 

interests in other areas. The ECAs boast a total membership of over 8,000 cabin crew 

and ground staff in the Cabin Crew Division, and provide excellent platforms for our 

crew to further develop their interests and hobbies.

Returning Crew Scheme

Crew who become pregnant are not permitted to fly for safety reasons. However, 

we actively encourage crew to return to flying after delivering their child under the 

Returning Crew Scheme. This scheme enables crew who meet certain criteria to return 

to flying with minimal disruption to their careers, with the crew’s previous years of 

service retained. Since 2012, there has been a 66 per cent increase in the number of 

applications for the scheme. The number of successful applications has also increased 

to 95 per cent as compared to 76 per cent in 2012. 

We organise one-day sessions where we invite crew who had left due to pregnancy 

to attend talks by healthcare professionals to help them return to flying. We aim 

to hold two such sessions per year. In 2016, 95 crew members returned through 

this programme. We target to achieve an increase of 100 per cent in the number of 

applications for the scheme in the coming years.

Returning Graduates Scheme

The Returning Graduates Scheme allows cabin crew who wish to pursue further studies 

to return as flying crew after their graduation. Crew who leave the Company under this 

scheme will be granted leave of absence during their study period and will be able to 

return to the Company with their last held rank, seniority and salary maintained. 

In 2016, the eligibility criteria was revised to enable more crew to return to flying 

through the scheme.

Career Transition Programme

Six months prior to their retirement, crew will receive a Career Transition Guide and a 

list of career opportunities, which aim to prepare them for an effective career transition 

should they wish to continue working beyond retirement. In addition, to ensure that 

our cabin crew are equipped with the necessary knowledge to make sound financial 

decisions, they would attend a Financial Management course which aims to develop 

their financial capabilities in preparation for their retirement.

Digitisation of Cabin Crew Reports &amp; Resources

Since 2014, cabin crew have been provided with tablets which help to digitise onboard 

work processes and aid them in providing customer service. The digital drive has led to 

greater efficiency as well as improved environmental sustainability. The introduction 

of digital documents for reports such as the Cabin Crew Voyage Report has led to a 

significant reduction in paper consumption. Digital reports now constitute 85 per cent 

of all voyage reports. Cabin crew can also refer to their tablets for the latest manuals 

and procedural documents. We target a 100 per cent reduction of paper reliance for 

voyage reports in the near future. 

For greater convenience and to encourage crew to go paperless, the printing of flight 

schedule cards has been reduced by 50 per cent. A downloadable digital copy is now 

available on the Airline’s internal online platform as well as on the Cabin Crew Division’s 

website. The aim is to eliminate printed flight schedule cards entirely. 

Training

SIA adopts an integrated approach to training and development to enhance 

professional skillsets, leadership and management competencies that drive staff 

performance. This is in line with the Company’s mission, business objectives and 

core values. 

Our people represent a key competitive advantage and we place strong emphasis on 

the development of our employees. We invest significant resources each year to train 

our pilots, cabin crew and ground employees worldwide. For FY2016/17, we invested 

a total of $24,604,784 on staff training and development, which includes a $1,044,317 

training grant from SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG). For FY2016/17, each employee had an 

average of nine training days.

Ground Staff Training 

SIA offers training for ground staff through its Corporate Learning Centre (CLC), which 

has in place various programmes for the continuous upgrading of employee skillsets 

and competencies. Training is done through a variety of methods, from traditional 

instructor-led classroom learning, to web-based courses and leadership programmes 

which are held off-site. In addition, CLC is exploring how technology can be further 

leveraged to aid e-learning in the future. Structured learning roadmaps are also in place 

to guide the progressive development of employees with targeted training at various 

milestones during their career. 

All new ground employees undergo an onboarding programme, which immerses them 

in the culture of SIA and gives them insights into the aviation industry. Previously, only 

newly-hired executives attended this programme, but in FY2016/17, it was extended to 

all ground staff. New executives hired under the SIA Executives Programme will undergo 

attachments at our customer contact centres and SilverKris Lounges. This equips them 

with hands-on customer handling experience.

The SIA Mentorship scheme also provides a unique opportunity for new executives to 

learn from senior executives of the Company. Through casual engagement sessions 

with their mentors, who provide insights into the SIA culture, core values and work 

processes, these new executives become integrated into the SIA family. 

Senior executives (Vice Presidents and above) are provided opportunities to attend 

external executive education programmes and seminars. This allows them to learn from 

and network with peers from other industries.

Continuing Education Opportunities

Under the Continuing Education Scheme, SIA provides sponsorships to employees keen 

on upgrading themselves by attaining higher educational qualifications. This entails taking 

up various recognised certificates, diplomas, graduate or post-graduate programmes. 

Employees are free to pursue these at their own time, outside of regular working hours.

The “SIA Future Learning” initiative was launched in October 2016 for our ground staff. 

Aligned with SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), the Company has set aside a sum of $500 per 

ground employee to enrol in relevant SSG-accredited programmes/courses to further 

develop their professional competencies.

Pilot Training

We conduct all required regulatory training for our 

pilots and ensure that our training programmes meet 

not only our training objectives, but are approved by 

the regulatory authorities.

Apart from mandatory training, we conduct 

developmental training programmes for pilots of 

all ranks, from Cadet Pilots, Second Officers and 

First Officers to Captains and Instructors. During the 

course of their careers, continuous pilot training 

programmes are in place to enhance their operational 

and flying skills.

In addition, we offer a mentoring framework for all 

ranks of pilots as well as online learning programmes 

in our e-learning portal SKIES. This mentoring 

framework is an important facet of their development 

and is another way that we invest in the careers and 

personal growth of our pilots. More details on our flight 

operations training can be found in the Safety section 

of this report.

Cabin Crew Training

Our cabin crew undergo a 15-week-long basic training 

programme which comprises classroom and on-the-

job training. It includes a wide variety of modules 

such as fundamentals of social etiquette, personal 

grooming, meal service procedures, food knowledge 

and wine appreciation courses.

Cabin crew are also taught passenger handling skills, 

including methods of handling young children, the 

elderly and mobility-challenged individuals, as well 

as techniques and skills for communicating with and 

relating to customers. Such training equips cabin crew 

with skills to better understand and meet the needs of 

a wide range of customers.

In line with our focus on safety and security, cabin 

crew are also trained in security, safety and first aid 

procedures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation 

(CPR), during their basic training programme.

Beyond functional skills required for cabin crew 

to carry out their duties on board, we provide 

opportunities for them to develop themselves 

personally and professionally through our Self-

Directed Learning (SDL) programme. Cabin crew 

can enrol themselves for SDL courses on a voluntary 

basis during their personal time, such as on their 

days off or during annual leave. The SDL courses 

offered range from skills development in languages, 

the culinary arts, training and leadership, to people 

management. With these courses, cabin crew can 

take control of their own developmental needs and 

complement their core skillsets with additional 

certified professional competencies.

One example is the Workforce Skills Qualifications 

(WSQ) Leadership and People Management (LPM) 

Programme, designed for senior cabin crew to develop 

leadership capabilities and chart a roadmap for 

leadership development. The programme enables 

Crew-In-Charge (CICs) to improve their personal 

effectiveness and people development skills. These 

LPM modules are also included in the training 

curriculum when our cabin crew are promoted to 

senior ranks.

Air Sommelier Scheme

This is a scheme under which suitable cabin crew are 

identified and trained to be sommeliers on board to provide 

professional wine service to our customers.

To be eligible for the Air Sommelier Scheme, cabin crew must 

attain the internationally-recognised Wine &amp; Spirit Education 

Trust’s (WSET) Level 3 Certificate in Wines &amp; Spirits Award. 

In addition, cabin crew are required to attend a rigorous six-

month in-house programme consisting of training workshops, 

periodic assessments and assignments. Successful 

participants who obtain the WSET Level 3 Certificate and pass 

the in-house programme will earn an Air Sommelier badge on 

their uniforms.

Air Sommeliers are expected to constantly strengthen 

their tasting skills and wine knowledge. This is achieved by 

obtaining professional certifications, and attending tasting 

sessions and seminars by wine experts. To ensure that they 

maintain adequate knowledge and skills, all Air Sommeliers 

are required to sit for an annual proficiency assessment.

Foreign Language Scheme 

There are two foreign language schemes, namely, French 

Language (FQ) and German Language (GQ). Cabin crew who 

are selected for these schemes will be provided training from 

established language institutes. Through an intensive eight-

week course, the crew will be inducted into the language 

and culture. Upon graduation, they will attain a level of 

proficiency required to attend to the needs of our French or 

German-speaking customers.

Crew members who are successfully accepted into the FQ/GQ 

scheme don a nametag bearing the French or German flag and 

operate on specific flight sectors requiring their language skills. 

They also undergo annual refresher training and have their 

language proficiency assessed at least once a year.

 

Partnership With SkillsFuture Singapore

Our Cabin Crew Training School is a recognised training 

organisation through a collaboration with SkillsFuture 

Singapore (SSG) and offers many Workforce Skills 

Qualifications (WSQ)-accredited courses, including the 

Leadership and People Management Programme, and 

Provide Advice on Wine Service course. Nationally-recognised 

WSQ Advanced Certificates are issued to participants who 

successfully complete the course and pass the assessment. Our 

crew members have also benefited from the many other WSQ-

accredited in-house courses. Over 200 cabin crew have earned 

a Diploma in Leadership and Management since October 2013 

when we launched the last module of the Leadership and 

Management Diploma Programme.

As part of the collaboration, new cabin crew members 

who graduate from the 15-week Cabin Crew Readiness 

Programme (CCRP) will be awarded Statements of 

Attainment under the Service Excellence WSQ framework. 

The collaboration ensures that the CCRP is benchmarked 

against national standards and reinforces the importance 

of empowering employees with nationally-recognised 

certifications for training and development. Following further 

programme enhancements, CCRP graduates now attain full 

Service Excellence Level One certification. With the WSQ 

certification, the skillsets of our cabin crew members are 

translated into recognised qualifications which will stay 

with them, even if they leave the organisation. SIA aims 

to continuously benchmark and align in-house training 

programmes to increase the number of such certifications. 

This initiative enhances SIA’s ability to continue attracting the 

best talents and supports our operational needs as we grow.

FOCUS ON PEOPLE


Customer Service and Engagement

Service excellence is one of the three main pillars on which SIA’s brand promise is built. We believe in listening to our 

customers through verbal and written feedback, focus groups, and surveys.

Social media has become an important channel through which we interact with our customers, who have high expectations 

of the SIA brand promise. As with many organisations, customers expect real-time service recovery and quick responses to 

their feedback on social media.

Our various social media channels, such as Facebook, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, as well as 

WeChat and Weibo in China, provide additional points of contact for greater online customer engagement. Our social media 

channels also allow us to communicate important travel information to customers as well as to obtain feedback to improve 

our products and services. Since September 2014, a dedicated 24/7 Social Media Engagement Unit has been in place to 

enhance communications with our customers.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT:

C U S T O M E R S

We have a dedicated Customer 

Affairs (CA) Department which 

attends to feedback and enquiries 

from customers. Where necessary, 

investigations are carried out and 

CA’s target is to respond to customers 

within 10 working days. In the event 

of service lapses, appropriate service 

recovery actions are taken to resolve 

issues, address customer concerns and 

restore confidence in the SIA brand 

promise. In line with SIA’s pursuit 

of excellence, CA shares its insights 

with various business units at regular 

meetings to review the Airline’s service 

and product offerings as well as 

operational processes. CA’s long-term 

goal is to further leverage technology 

and data analytics in order to enhance 

customer experience. 

We conduct surveys and focus 

group studies to measure customer 

satisfaction through on-board and 

on-ground customer points of contact. 

Relevant departments then use the 

information to enhance product 

quality or services. One example of 

how we listened to our customers 

during the past financial year was 

when we launched our “Deliciously 

Wholesome” in-flight meal programme 

in April 2016. It was introduced after we 

noticed a rising preference among our 

customers for healthier meal choices, 

based on feedback and focus groups 

with our frequent travellers. The 

menu features dishes rich in nutrients, 

vitamins and essential minerals which 

can help restore and rejuvenate the 

body, especially on long-haul flights. 

Some of the dishes were created by 

SIA’s International Culinary Panel (ICP).

The ICP comprises award-winning 

chefs from around the world, who work 

closely with SIA’s own chefs to explore 

the latest dining trends and create 

the diverse selection of meals served 

on board our flights. On average, the 

ICP chefs create about 30 new in-flight 

dishes for SIA annually. SIA also 

has a Wine Panel, comprising three 

renowned consultants, who help the 

Airline select high-quality wines and 

champagnes through blind tasting. 

In 2016, Amsterdam became the 

inaugural long-haul destination for our 

new-generation Airbus A350 aircraft. 

The aircraft has also enabled the 

launch of new services to Dusseldorf in 

Germany and the resumption of non-

stop flights to the United States, with 

daily Singapore-San Francisco services. 

During the year in review, SIA also 

launched a “Capital Express” service 

that links Singapore with the capitals 

of Australia and New Zealand. We also 

announced new services to Stockholm, 

which will be launched in May 2017. 

All these network-related initiatives, as 

well as those of our subsidiary airlines, 

were undertaken to provide additional 

travel options to our customers and 

support the further development of the 

Singapore hub. 

Transforming Customer Service 

In the face of ever-increasing 

competition and customer 

expectations, SIA launched the 

“Transforming Customer Service” 

(TCS) initiative in 1999, with a vision 

to invigorate the entire organisation 

towards stellar customer service, win 

new customers and retain existing 

ones. This drive is also emphasised 

by our Cabin Crew Division’s “Service 

Over and Above the Rest” (SOAR) 

programme, which aims to motivate 

our cabin crew to deliver exceptional 

service to our customers. 

In an increasingly competitive 

marketplace, we recognise it is 

imperative that we further strengthen 

the Airline’s service culture. We are 

currently reviewing a unified service 

theme, driven by the SIA core values, for 

both the TCS and SOAR programmes. 

As part of this initiative, respective 

business units would set meaningful 

service standards in their operational 

areas that involve customer interaction. 

The aim is to achieve consistent delivery 

of service excellence both on the ground 

and in the air. We believe this is key in the 

transformation of our customer service 

mindset. We aim to launch this unified 

theme in the first quarter of FY2017/18. 

Structured training programmes will 

be aligned with the objectives of the 

unified service theme, which serve to 

reinforce a service culture steeped in 

SIA’s core values. All these measures 

ensure that we stay committed to 

our mission since our founding, 

which is to provide air transportation 

services of the highest quality. The 

Airline will continue to recognise 

exemplary individuals and teams whose 

outstanding service performance has 

contributed significantly to SIA’s service 

excellence, through regional service 

awards events and the pinnacle annual 

service awards conferred by the CEO.

Customer Privacy

Our Customer Contact Services 

Department (CCSD) may collect and 

access customer data such as personal 

particulars and travel history with SIA 

when servicing customers’ reservation 

and ticketing requests. Hence, 

customers would expect SIA to respect 

the confidentiality of such information 

and safeguard it.

CCSD abides strictly by SIA’s Privacy 

Policy, which is available on our 

website, as well as the guidelines laid 

out by the Personal Data Protection Act 

(PDPA) of Singapore.

Any collection, use and disclosure of 

customer data is to enable CCSD to 

handle customer requests according to 

their respective needs.

When servicing our customers, our 

customer service representatives (CSRs) 

are required to adhere to appropriate 

verification and authentication 

procedures to ensure that customer 

data is not revealed to unauthorised 

personnel through the various channels 

of interactions, for example, phone calls, 

emails and faxes. These processes have 

been drawn up in consultation with the 

Company’s Legal Department to ensure 

strict compliance with the PDPA.

CCSD also adheres to internal processes 

for the appropriate handling of customer 

data in compliance with the PDPA.

Audit processes such as monthly call 

calibrations are in place to ensure 

that our vendors comply with our 

policies pertaining to the protection of 

customer data. Non-compliance may 

result in complaints lodged against 

SIA with the Personal Data Protection 

Commission (PDPC).

The audit processes highlighted 

instances where CSRs had 

misinterpreted the customer data 

protection guidelines which resulted 

in complaints from customers. Such 

incidents are usually committed by new 

employees who are not familiar with 

the policies. Non-compliance cases are 

clarified with the relevant CSRs and 

vendors to prevent future occurrences.

CCSD regularly reviews processes and 

customer feedback to identify issues 

pertaining to protecting customer 

data. Any issues identified will be 

re-evaluated in consultation with the 

Legal Department and relevant CCSD 

staff to better align them with SIA’s 

Privacy Policy and the PDPA.

The CA Department also abides strictly 

by SIA’s Privacy Policy. In the course of 

handling customer feedback, CA will 

need to access customer data such as 

personal particulars and the customer’s 

travel history with the Airline. 

Customers expect the Airline to treat 

such personal data as confidential.

Complaints, queries, withdrawal of 

consent, requests for access, corrections 

and updates in relation to personal 

data must be handled according to 

established internal organisational 

processes. These processes have been 

drawn up in consultation with the Legal 

Department to ensure strict compliance 

with the PDPA.

Such compliance cultivates confidence 

among customers who entrust the 

Airline with their personal data. This 

facilitates the provision of a safe, 

smooth, efficient and customised 

experience for SIA’s customers.

FOCUS ON PEOPLE


STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT:

S U P P L I E R S

SIA’s supply chain is supported by various areas of the 

business that are responsible for key aspects of our customers’ 

experience, such as Product Innovation, Marketing and 

Engineering. We work closely together to provide a reliable 

product and excellent service, which our customers have 

come to expect from us. Our commitment to providing air 

transportation services of the highest quality begins on the 

ground when a customer makes a booking with us, then at 

check-in, followed by on board the aircraft, and finally assisting 

customers who have feedback and require post-flight services.

Supply Chain Expenditure

Singapore Airlines has more than 11,000 suppliers worldwide. 

The supply chain is managed by several departments. Fuel 

costs, aircraft maintenance and rental, in-flight food and 

beverages, and ground operations and handling, make up the 

majority of our supply chain expenditure. SIA also outsources 

certain key airline-related operations such as aircraft cleaning 

and maintenance, catering, certain customer contact services 

and ground handling to third-party service providers. 

Approximately 65 per cent of SIA’s operating expenditure goes 

to the top 10 suppliers below, listed in alphabetical order:

1 

Airbus 

2 

Changi Airport Group (Singapore)

3 

Chevron

4 

ExxonMobil Aviation

5 

Rolls-Royce PLC

6 

SATS Ltd

7 

Shell Eastern Petroleum 

8 

SIA Engineering Company Limited

9 

Singapore Petroleum Company

10 The Boeing Company

In line with our focus on sustainability, SIA has adopted the 

following best practices in our engagement with suppliers:

Suppliers’ Compliance with Applicable Laws

We have provisions in our purchasing contracts that require 

our suppliers to commit and warrant that the items supplied 

are in compliance with all applicable laws and related 

requirements, including but not limited to labour laws, 

employment laws and industrial laws.

Bio-Degradable Material

We welcome proposals from suppliers that include bio-

degradable/recyclable materials as alternatives to more 

commonly used raw materials such as plastics and aluminium.

Sourcing Suppliers with Sustainable 

Business Practices 

We encourage suppliers to submit proposals which are 

environmentally friendly. For example, we request suppliers 

to declare in their bid submission whether their paper 

products comply with Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 

guidelines. Such proposals will be favourably considered 

during the product assessment and selection stage. 

The FSC is an international non-profit, multi-stakeholder 

organisation established in 1993 to promote responsible 

management of the world’s forests. Its main tools 

for achieving this are standard-setting, independent 

certification and labelling of forest products.

One of our targets is to source seafood from local suppliers 

who have been given the stamp of approval by the Marine 

Stewardship Council - a global non-profit organisation that 

certifies responsibly caught seafood. In addition, we aim to 

support more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in 

Singapore and procure items that are locally made. 

Environmental Management

Environmental management is one of the key parameters 

in our assessment of suppliers. We conduct visits to factory 

sites of potential new suppliers in order to assess whether 

they have proper environmental management practices 

in place, such as ISO 14001. Errant suppliers will be barred 

from doing business with Singapore Airlines.

 

Lightweight Design

Our Product Innovation Department engages SIA Engineering 

Company, a subsidiary of SIA, to build, repair and modify 

our aircraft cabin interiors as well as seat mock-ups. We are 

constantly exploring lighter-weight designs of cabin and in-

flight items such as cutlery as this helps reduce the amount 

of fuel needed for flights, which in turn helps to reduce 

emissions. We also look to technological advancements that 

enable lightweight design and definition of aircraft cabin 

interiors, seats and in-flight entertainment systems.

Recycling of Obsolete/Scrap Products

We work with suppliers to collect obsolete items such as 

paper-based products, plastic and metal for recycling,  

where possible.

Engineering Spares

Although the procurement of engineering spares has been 

outsourced, SIA’s engineering policy is to source for spares 

only from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and 

their accredited agents. For engineering components, repair 

organisations are required to be certified and approved by 

renowned authorities such as the US FAA, Europe’s EASA, 

Canada’s TCCA, Hong Kong’s CAD and Australia’s CASA 

before any procurement is carried out.

Consistent with our Safety Management System (SMS) 

practices, we have in place key performance indicators (KPIs) 

for warehousing operations to monitor performance in all 

aspects, including quality, safety, health and the environment.

While we have outsourced warehouse operations to supply 

chain company Bolloré (formerly SDV), our Engineering 

Division continues to chair a joint monthly Warehouse 

Safety Committee to ensure compliance with our health, 

safety and environmental standards. Bolloré is included in 

our ISO accreditation by TUV SUD PSB Pte Ltd, a globally 

recognised company that provides product testing, 

inspection and certification services. 

 

We strive to integrate sustainability throughout our customer 

experience and engagement process, across various touchpoints 

starting from when a customer decides to purchase a ticket to travel 

with SIA. Together with partners and suppliers within the supply 

chain, we constantly explore ways to improve sustainability across all 

aspects of our operations.

Basic Requirements for Catering and Handling Services

It is mandatory for our caterers to comply strictly with local laws and regulations 

with respect to hygiene, safety and security. Facilities used for storage, preparation, 

production and transportation of meals and beverages must meet the standards set 

by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the International Civil Aviation 

Organization (ICAO), and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) 

concept developed and administered by the International Flight Catering Association 

(IFCA) and International Flight Services Association (IFSA).

All catering and ground handling companies must comply with the IATA Aircraft 

Handling Manual (AHM) to ensure ground safety.

A copy of the aircraft handling safety standards is included as part of the contract, and 

catering and ground handling staff will receive adequate training to operate our aircraft. 

Each supplier is required to have a system of monitoring the training needs of each 

employee to ensure proficiency. Examples of such training include opening aircraft 

doors, driving Ground Support Equipment (GSE), handling catering equipment in high 

lifts and IATA dangerous goods awareness.

Reducing Food Wastage

To reduce food wastage, we engage our caterers to ascertain the amount and type of 

food wasted and adjust our uplift accordingly.

Improving Quality of Service to Our Customers

Besides monitoring the performance of suppliers through the Service Level 

Agreements (SLA) in our contracts, feedback from customers about their ground 

and in-flight experience is obtained in order for us to improve the quality of services 

we offer.

Anti-Corruption Practices

We have included clauses on anti-corruption and anti-bribery practices in new 

contracts since June 2012 which mandate that all suppliers, including, but not limited 

to, ground handling agents and caterers, must comply with all local laws where they 

operate. This applies and is not limited to the acceptance of offers made in the form 

of payments, gifts or other transfers of value, directly or indirectly, to any government 

official or private person in order to secure any improper advantage or to influence 

any decision or act, directly or indirectly. In addition, suppliers are to inform us 

immediately should they learn of any such violations.

To further enhance transparency of dealings by our staff and to facilitate a channel 

for any violations to be reported, a “whistle-blowing” clause has been included in 

contracts which requires both organisations to be committed to resolving the case 

whilst protecting the identity of the whistle-blower.

Suppliers’ Code of Conduct

Suppliers are required to comply with a Code of Conduct that forms part of the 

contract. Based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact related to 

Human Rights, Labour, the Environment and Anti-Corruption, and taking into account 

operational, social and environmental issues, the Code of Conduct was developed in 

accordance with our business values and with the intention of promoting sustainable 

development. The Code can be found on page 40 of this report.

Evaluation of Suppliers

Suppliers are evaluated on both cost and quality of products and services. To aid 

the evaluation process, the Ground Handling and Catering Contracts Department 

requires suppliers to provide background information on the company and its current 

operations/clients. In addition, suppliers who participate in our request for proposal 

exercises are deemed to have agreed with the terms set out in the Code of Conduct 

which also covers labour standards. We have also made it our long-term target to 

conduct spot checks on suppliers when opportunities arise.

Supporting our 

Communities


COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

SIA recognises the importance of actively supporting and 

investing in the communities we serve. For many years, 

we have been supporting charities as well as non-profit 

organisations through cash donations, complimentary or 

rebated air tickets and staff volunteerism. We firmly believe 

in sponsoring initiatives that promote education, sports, the 

arts, the environment and conservation.

Community Projects in Singapore

SIA has a longstanding commitment to help grow the 

Singapore arts scene and we continued this tradition 

by contributing to the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, 

Singapore Dance Theatre, Singapore Lyric Opera and 

Singapore Chinese Orchestra. We have also worked closely 

with the National Arts Council on various community arts 

projects. In 2016, Singapore Airlines was named ‘Friend of 

the Arts’ by the National Arts Council, for our contribution to 

Singapore’s art scene. SIA is also a longstanding supporter 

of Community Chest, a non-profit organisation that raises 

funds for many charities in Singapore. 

In the educational sector, SIA continues to support 

numerous initiatives which provide students with 

opportunities to achieve their full academic potential. 

SIA contributed to a charity cycling event organised by 

Club Rainbow (Singapore), which raised funds for tuition 

services, programmes and educational seminars for children 

suffering from a range of major chronic and potentially 

life-threatening diseases. Since 1973, we have also been 

supporting the National University of Singapore with the SIA 

Gold Medal Award, which goes to an outstanding student in 

the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. 

SIA also actively contributes to the local community. 

We have participated in Community Chest’s annual  

Fu Dai event, since its inception. During the event, 

volunteers pack festive goodie bags and deliver them to 

the less fortunate. In 2016, we were awarded the SHARE 

Platinum Award for our contributions.

SIA KrisFlyer and Make-A-Wish Singapore Partnership

In February 2017, KrisFlyer, the SIA Group’s frequent flyer 

programme, and Make-A-Wish Singapore embarked on a 

partnership which enables KrisFlyer members to donate 

their KrisFlyer miles for charitable purposes. The donated 

KrisFlyer miles will go towards supporting flights on SIA and 

subsidiary SilkAir for wishes of Make-A-Wish Singapore’s 

beneficiaries that involve overseas travel. The scheme is 

in addition to the support that SIA has provided directly to 

Make-A-Wish beneficiaries.

Harapan Rainforest Initiative

The Harapan Rainforest (also known as Hutan Harapan) Initiative covers nearly 100,000 hectares of tropical rainforest 

located on the border between Jambi and South Sumatra provinces in Indonesia. Since August 2010, SIA has been the 

exclusive airline partner for this large-scale project aimed at restoring and protecting one of the world’s most threatened 

and bio-diverse ecosystems. Despite past intensive logging activities, Hutan Harapan is still home to more than 1,350 

different species, of which 133 are globally threatened. Some of the endangered species include the Sumatran Tiger 

(Panthera tigris sumatrae) and the Sumatran Elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus). 

The Harapan Rainforest Initiative is driven by a consortium of three organisations, namely Burung Indonesia, the Royal 

Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and BirdLife International. 

In 2008, it was certified as Indonesia’s first Ecosystem Restoration Concession (ERC) and received a legal permit from the 

Ministry of Forestry. With the strong support of the Indonesian government, the Harapan Rainforest Initiative was able to 

implement programmes to achieve sustainability, including a revised forest rehabilitation approach, a new community 

cooperation plan and an income generation plan that will diversify income sources for the maintenance of the rainforest.

• Introduction of Spatial Monitoring 

and Reporting Tool (SMART)

 SMART improves the effectiveness of 

law enforcement patrols as it allows 

staff to monitor and intervene in 

forest fires, illegal logging activities 

and identify poaching traps. This 

has resulted in appropriate actions 

being taken. 

• Forest fire management system and 

early warning system

 With the installation of an early 

warning system, 80 per cent of 

hotspots detected were successfully 

extinguished - an 18 per cent 

increase from the year before. This 

was attributed to quicker emergency 

responses and better management of 

resources and equipment.

• Restoration efforts

 Through a combination of Assisted 

Natural Regeneration (ANR) and local 

community engagement, over 4,000 

hectares of forest were restored in 2016.

• Establishment of five field offices

 The field offices allow staff to have 

easier access to key areas of the 

rainforest for the purpose of forest 

protection and research. 

• Land use and resource management

 Agreements were signed with more 

than 200 families from six community 

groups, including Batin Sembilan, 

a local indigenous tribe, to develop 

agroforestry partnerships, which 

help to create a diverse, sustainable 

and profitable rainforest. 

• Elephant conservation

 As part of a long-term conservation 

project, a male elephant was 

relocated to Hutan Harapan in 

November 2016. Satellite images 

show that it has joined a herd of 

females in the western part of 

Hutan Harapan. In time to come, 

the Harapan team hopes to include 

other key wildlife species such as 

tigers, tapirs and hornbills in their 

conservation plan.

Community Projects Around the World

SIA serves over 60 destinations in more than 30 countries. Many of our overseas offices work with their local 

charities to make a difference to the communities they operate in. SIA is aware of the importance of building 

strong and sustainable relationships in these communities and strives to do so in the most meaningful ways 

possible. In the following pages, we highlight some of these overseas initiatives that serve a good cause.

More than

250

basic health 

screening in India

India

China

To raise awareness for children with 

brittle bone disease in China, SIA and the 

China-Dolls Center for Rare Disorders organised a 

Mannequin Challenge in Beijing to raise funds. Over 

100 participants from the public, industry partners 

and the media stood motionless while holding 

ceramic handicrafts. As a result of this event, a 

total of RMB15,000 was raised for the “Little Fish 

Rehabilitation Program,” which is designed to help 

children with brittle bone disease with their recovery.

India

The SIA Mumbai team, which consists 

of staff from SIA, SIA Cargo and SIA 

Engineering Company, in collaboration with 

Concern India Foundation, facilitated a Sports Day 

for over 200 disabled children in January 2017. The 

children participated in track events moderated by 

a government-accredited agency – Special Olympics 

Bharat. SIA staff provided assistance to children 

during the races, cheered them on and treated them 

to delicious Indian delicacies during the event. All 

children received participation certificates and 

winners received medals for their achievements.

In partnership with the Rural Health Care Foundation 

(RHCF), SIA’s Kolkata station organised a health 

screening exercise for Sundia Kamarhati Nimno 

Buniyadi School, which is located 60km from the 

city centre, in August 2016. More than 250 children 

received basic health screening including dental and 

eye check-ups. An interactive session which educated 

children on the importance of proper health care and 

hygiene was also conducted.

Japan

SIA Japan stations spread Christmas cheer 

by organising an annual Christmas visit 

to children warded at Narita Red Cross Hospital and 

Fukuoka Children’s Hospital. Children, parents and 

staff at the hospitals were greeted by Santa Claus and 

a Singapore Girl, and received their early Christmas 

presents which consisted of soft toys, colouring books 

and aircraft models.

South Korea

Since 2012, SIA Korea has partnered the 

Jongno Community Welfare Centre to 

provide visually-handicapped children with unique 

experiences, including cooking classes, visits to the 

airport, a strawberry farm and museums. In May 2016, 

34 staff took 27 children from the Community Welfare 

Centre to Mosan Farm in Paju Gyeonggi province to 

join a dairy farm experience programme. At the farm, 

children were given an opportunity to feed milk and 

hay to calves, milk cows, and make their own cheese 

and ice cream. Some SIA Korea staff also arranged 

for the children’s parents to enjoy a movie and 

lunch, providing them with a break from their usual 

caregiving roles. 

The Netherlands 

SIA’s Amsterdam team introduced an 

innovation-driven competition for 

elementary school children in line with the launch of 

the Airbus A350 aircraft to the Dutch capital. Students 

were asked to submit ideas for a “dream airplane” of 

the future that SIA might one day operate. 

The entries were evaluated by a panel which consisted 

of representatives from SIA, Aviodrome and Schiphol 

Airport. Children from three elementary schools were 

shortlisted for a presentation at Aviodrome and were 

also invited to go on a tour of the aviation theme park. 

SIA presented the winning school with EUR1,000 to be 

used for innovation projects.

The Philippines

In the Philippines, SIA has been sponsoring 

Bantay Bata’s Bantay Edukasyon Program 

for the past 14 years. Since 2003, SIA has provided 

financial support to needy children from Luzon, 

Visayas and Mindanao, to enable them to receive 

school supplies, transportation and allowances for 

their educational needs. To date, over 1,400 children 

have benefitted from the programme and many 

are now pursuing meaningful jobs in teaching and

Collaboration with St. Andrew’s Autism Centre

SilkAir partnered St. Andrew’s Autism Centre (SAAC) to launch Colours Project,  

a pilot retail initiative that seeks to explore potential employment pathways for 

adults at SAAC with moderate to severe autism. Passengers on SilkAir flights or 

visitors to SilkAir’s online SkyShop could purchase canvas tote bags designed by 

students and clients of SAAC. All proceeds from the sale went to SAAC’s Colours 

Project. The partnership was from December 2016 to February 2017.

Coastal security and safety in India

In 2016, SilkAir co-sponsored the Indian Coast Guard in Kochi and Trivandrum during 

their motorcycle rally by donating INR50,000 to educate and spread awareness on 

coastal security and safety. A blood donation drive and an environmental walkathon 

also took place at the rally.

Funds raised for terminally ill orphans

SilkAir supported the Global Public School by organising its annual charity event 

to raise funds and support Sevagram – a charity institution established in 1989 for 

orphans, the aged and terminally ill cancer patients.

Orphanage visit and dinner during Ramadan 

SilkAir staff in Balikpapan, Bandung, Lombok, Makassar, Manado, Medan, Palembang, 

Pekanbaru, Semarang and Yogyakarta visited an orphanage in their region during the 

month of June 2016, as part of Ramadan celebrations. Staff as well as partner agents 

were invited for the visits. Stations staged musical performances and hosted dinner 

for children at the orphanages, putting a smile on every child’s face.

Child’s Dream

SilkAir signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Child’s Dream Foundation 

in January 2015 for a three-year partnership. The Chiang Mai-based charity helps 

to improve healthcare and education for underprivileged children and provides 

socioeconomic opportunities for families living in impoverished communities. 

Under this partnership, SilkAir provides air tickets to Child’s Dream staff travelling 

for work to destinations served by the airline. In addition, SilkAir provides free 

transportation of cargo donations made to the beneficiaries. SilkAir staff also did 

volunteer work in Snor Village in Siem Reap, Cambodia, where they helped to 

repaint the only school in the village.

Sustainability Policy

Singapore Airlines is dedicated to providing air transportation services of the highest 

quality. Beyond that, there is also a long-term responsibility to help protect the 

environment. SIA has in place programmes to ensure that sustainable practices are 

implemented across the Company. We constantly explore ways to further reduce our 

carbon footprint in all of our operations.

We ensure that our operations are carried out in a responsible manner through a 

framework designed to manage issues related to carbon emissions, waste, noise, and 

the consumption of energy and resources.

Climate Change

The year 2016 was the warmest year on record. The US National Aeronautics and 

Space Administration (NASA) confirmed this using two climate indicators – global 

surface temperatures and Arctic sea ice extent – which broke numerous records 

during the first half of 2016. 

Scientists have attributed rising temperatures in recent years to the increasing 

levels of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas (GHG), in the atmosphere. The United 

Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (UNIPCC) estimates that global 

emissions from the aviation industry will increase from the current two per cent to 

three per cent by 2050. Additionally, the UNIPCC estimates that global temperature 

will rise by four degrees Celsius by the year 2100, if no significant reduction of 

anthropogenic GHG emissions is achieved.

At the 2015 Paris Climate Conference or COP 21, a landmark agreement dealing with 

climate change was made between governments. This significant step has provided 

positive momentum for the aviation industry to develop a global market-based 

measure (MBM) to reduce carbon emissions. At the 39th International Civil Aviation 

Organization (ICAO) Assembly, the aviation industry made history by adopting  

a global MBM with the “Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International 

Aviation” (CORSIA). 

The aviation industry is continuously exploring new ways to reduce its carbon 

footprint through a four-pillar strategy.

MANAGING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT



SIA supports the industry’s climate change goals and has adopted the four pillars 

into our operations. The four pillars are: improved technology, operational measures, 

improved infrastructure and a global market-based measure. 

We have implemented a comprehensive fuel productivity programme which 

includes modification of engines to improve fuel efficiency as well as performance 

improvement packages to reduce airframe drag. In addition, we plan the most fuel-

efficient routes for our flights. These fuel-saving measures, together with regular 

fleet renewal, help to reduce our emissions. We are also an active member of the 

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG), which works to accelerate the 

development and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels.

Fleet Modernisation

SIA is committed to operating a modern and fuel-efficient fleet. During the year, 

SIA took delivery of 10 A350-900s. Five A330-300s were removed from the fleet and 

returned to lessors. As at 31 March 2017, SIA’s fleet comprised 106 aircraft, with an 

average age of seven years and eight months, compared to the industry average of 13 

years and three months*. In addition, SIA has on firm order five A380-800s, 30 787-10s 

and 56 A350-900s. In February 2017, SIA announced a letter of intent with Boeing for 20 

777-9s and 19 additional 787-10s.

CARING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT


MANAGING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG)

SAFUG was established in September 2008 to accelerate the development 

and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels. Since September 2011, 

SIA has been an active member of SAFUG, as we believe that sustainable 

aviation biofuels are key to the industry’s carbon-neutral growth goal 

beyond 2020. It is expected that carbon reduction from using sustainable 

aviation fuels could be up to 80 per cent based on a full carbon life cycle. 

SAFUG members make up approximately 33 per cent of commercial 

aviation fuel demand. We engage SAFUG regularly to discuss and be 

updated on the latest biofuel developments taking place globally. 

SIA has pledged to advance and adopt aviation biofuels produced in a 

sustainable way that:

• Exhibit minimal impact on biodiversity.

• Meet a sustainability standard, with respect to land, water and 

 energy use.

• Do not displace or compete with food crops.

• Provide a positive socioeconomic impact.

SIA is committed to collaborating with government agencies and 

stakeholders to overcome supply and infrastructure challenges that may 

hinder the commercial use of sustainable aviation fuels.

OPERATIONAL 

MEASURES

Pillar

2.

Currently, SIA’s key initiatives from our fuel productivity improvement 

programme include:

&gt; Adopt engineering 

measures that improve 

fuel efficiency, such 

as fleet-wide engine 

washing, which have 

led to 10,400 tonnes 

of fuel savings per 

year. Modifying the 

A380 Trent 900 engine 

in order to enhance 

performance has led to 

10,010 tonnes of fuel 

savings per year.

&gt; Adopt improvements 

in flight operation 

procedures, such as 

‘continuous descent’ 

operations, to minimise 

fuel use without 

compromising safety.

&gt; Apply Data Analytics 

to expand and 

improve SIA’s fuel 

conservation initiatives 

to accurately measure 

performance in 

addition to identifying 

and prioritising 

opportunities for 

further fuel productivity 

improvement.

&gt; Develop performance 

improvement packages 

for airframes and 

engines to reduce 

airframe drag, hence 

improving engine fuel 

efficiency.

&gt; Embark on initiatives 

both within SIA and 

with Original Equipment 

Manufacturers (OEMs) 

to reduce the weight of 

aircraft. For example, 

customisation of 

water uplift based 

on flight sector 

requirements through 

a tailored potable 

water programme and 

removal of unutilised 

overhead storage 

compartments located 

in between the galleys of 

our 777-300ERs. These 

initiatives save 2,400 

tonnes of fuel per year.

&gt; Employ mobile ground 

power units and pre-

conditioned air units 

during nightstops and 

long transits to reduce 

reliance on aircraft 

auxiliary power units. 

This is expected to save 

at least 2,400 tonnes of 

fuel per year.

&gt; Engage in route-

planning procedures 

actively to determine 

the most fuel-efficient 

routes possible.

&gt; Implement the Centre 

of Gravity Optimisation 

initiative into our Load 

Planning System, 

which is programmed 

to automatically derive 

a preferred centre of 

gravity position for 

loading of cargo pallets 

and containers, leading 

to improved fuel 

efficiency in our aircraft 

operations.

&gt; Improve flight 

operation procedures 

that reduce fuel burn 

for A380s at London’s 

Heathrow Airport. SIA’s 

A380 aircraft departing 

Heathrow now use less 

power when taking off, 

resulting in fuel saving 

and less CO2 and NOx 

being emitted, while 

complying with the 

airport’s strict noise 

procedure guidelines.

&gt; Maintain a modern and 

fuel-efficient fleet. The 

A350-900, known for 

its superior operating 

efficiency, entered our 

fleet in March 2016.

&gt; Optimise flight 

operations and flight 

planning systems 

leading to better 

 route selection.

Fuel Productivity Initiatives

SIA is committed to improving fuel productivity of our flight operations 

through various initiatives, which aim to reduce carbon emissions. We 

report direct GHG emissions from fuel used in flight operations and 

measure GHG emissions intensity ratio by grams of carbon dioxide 

emitted per load-tonne-kilometre.

We constantly explore fuel productivity and savings initiatives for the future 

as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability. For example, we 

target to achieve fuel savings of approximately 3,425 tonnes on our Boeing 

777-300ER fleet through tailored water uplift. We will be installing in-flight 

entertainment systems and Economy Class seats made of lighter material 

on our Boeing 777 fleet. This is expected to save 2,440 tonnes of fuel. The 

targeted fuel savings for both initiatives are projected savings for five years 

and the initiatives will commence from 2018 onwards.

CARING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT


MANAGING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

ASPIRE Programme

SIA has been participating in the Asia and Pacific Initiative to 

Reduce Emissions (ASPIRE) programme since our first ‘green 

flight’ demonstration on 31 January 2010, which operated 

from Los Angeles to Singapore via Tokyo. The ASPIRE 

programme is a unique partnership between air navigation 

service providers that share the aim of reducing carbon 

emissions from fuel burn in all phases of flight. This requires 

implementing best practices and initiatives in air traffic 

management and flight operation procedures. Examples 

include measures that permit pilots to take full advantage of 

atmospheric conditions, such as prevailing winds, to reduce 

separation between aircraft and shorten flight time. In 

October 2016, SIA’s new “Capital Express” service between 

Singapore, Canberra and Wellington was unveiled as the 

latest addition to the ASPIRE Programme.

Under the programme, our Singapore-Canberra-Wellington 

and vice versa flights utilise the range of ASPIRE practices, 

including: making use of favourable winds, reducing 

airborne holding, enabling efficient ‘continuous descent’ 

arrivals and reducing taxiing times. Over the course of a 

year, an estimated 1,500 tonnes of fuel and 4,600 tonnes 

of carbon emissions are expected to be saved across the 

four sectors. Our daily flights between Singapore and other 

destinations in the Southwest Pacific, including Auckland, 

Christchurch, Melbourne and Sydney, are also operated 

under the ASPIRE programme.

As the three pillars will take time to be developed, a global MBM 

will be needed to reduce the sector’s carbon emissions in the 

interim. ICAO States agreed at the 39th Assembly in October 2016 

to implement a global MBM in the form of the “Carbon Offsetting 

and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation” (CORSIA). 

CORSIA consists of a global offsetting scheme to be applied to 

international aviation, with 66 states representing more than 

86.5 per cent of international flight operations volunteering to 

participate from 2021. The scheme will work on a three-year 

compliance cycle starting from 2021. The first two phases which 

will take place from 2021 to 2026 are voluntary, with Singapore 

being one of the states that will be participating in these phases, 

after which the scheme becomes mandatory. 

SIA recognises that CORSIA will play an integral role in ensuring that 

carbon emissions are only accounted for once and will eliminate 

duplicate economic measures. SIA supports the ongoing efforts to 

implement the scheme in an equitable and practical manner.

Aircraft Noise 

When it comes to aircraft noise management, SIA focuses on the 

reduction of noise at the source – aircraft engines. Compared to 

models produced 10 years ago, modern jet aircraft are about  

50 per cent quieter. Continuous improvements are being made  

to further reduce engine noise emissions.

On 1 January 2006, ICAO introduced a new Chapter 4 noise 

standard which is more stringent and at least one third quieter 

than the previous Chapter 3 standard. This is part of ICAO’s 

Balanced Approach to Aircraft Noise Management to reduce noise 

at the source. The continuous improvement of noise certification 

strives to ensure that the latest noise reduction technology 

available is incorporated into aircraft design, so that the benefits 

are reflected in noise reductions around airports.

SIA supports the Balanced Approach. Our fleet of A330, A350, 

A380 and 777 aircraft, as well as Scoot’s 787s, SilkAir’s A319s, 

A320s and 737-800s, and Tigerair’s A319s and A320s, all meet the 

latest ICAO Chapter 4 noise standard.

Aircraft Emissions

ICAO sets the international standards for NOX, CO2, hydrocarbons 

and exhaust levels from aircraft engine emissions under ICAO 

Annex 16, Volume II. In February 2016, the new CO2 standard was 

finalised by ICAO. This standard is applicable to new aircraft type 

designs as of 2020 and new deliveries of current in-production 

aircraft types from 2023. 

SIA supports the new CO2 standard as it has the potential to 

meet the aviation industry’s long-term commitment to reduce 

CO2 emissions.

The current NOX standard endorsed in 2004, applicable to 

new engines from 2008, is 12 per cent stricter than previous 

standards. The passenger aircraft fleets for SIA, SilkAir, Scoot 

and Tigerair, as well as SIA Cargo freighters, all meet the 

stringent 2004 ICAO CAEP/6 Emission Standards for NOX. 

Ground Emissions

All new and existing vehicles on the ground powered by diesel 

or petrol comply with requirements set by Singapore’s National 

Environmental Agency (NEA) on motor vehicle emissions. In 

addition, vehicles undergo regular maintenance and inspections. 

For example, diesel-powered vehicles undergo an annual Chassis 

Dynamometer Smoke Test (CDST) to ensure the smoke opacity 

limit meets local standards.

In addition, to conserve fuel and promote better air quality, staff 

are reminded to switch off engines while their vehicles are idling 

in order to adhere to anti-idling engine regulations.

Conservation Efforts by Subsidiaries

Energy conservation efforts are also being made by our 

subsidiaries. SIA had a facility maintenance contract with SIA 

Engineering Company (SIAEC), under which we managed SIAEC’s 

hangars, leased offices at Changi Airport, Engine Test Facility 

and Training Academy. With the cessation of the contract in 

October 2016, SIAEC has embarked on the management of its 

own premises, while embracing principles and best practices of 

conservation efforts implemented over the years. Our Properties 

team continues to manage SilkAir’s leased premises located at 

Changi Airport.

Environmental Management System 

Energy Efficiency in the Office and Maintenance Hangars

In FY2016/17, SIA continued to implement energy conservation 

initiatives to reduce energy consumption. Our FY2016/17 

energy-saving initiatives focused largely on managing the air-

conditioning and lighting within our buildings. An example was 

the replacement of high bay lighting for hangar operations. These 

facilities are monitored closely using sub-metres and the building 

automation system to provide detailed energy information. 

Our conservation efforts also include monitoring our water usage, 

waste management and efficiency of chillers. Data collection and 

mining is crucial for identifying new conservation initiatives.

We are guided by the electricity conservation adoption and 

reporting standard and methodologies of electricity conservation 

from Singapore’s Energy Market Authority.

Air-conditioners

&gt; Ensuring that our upcoming new data centre will be fitted with an efficient 

Computer Room Air-Conditioning (CRAC) dual coil system which utilises both 

chilled water and refrigerant. With constant monitoring of the building’s heat load 

requirements, the air conditioners will be able to run efficiently during peak and 

off-peak loads.

&gt; Increased chilled water set point in chillers from 7.3 to 8.0 degrees Celsius.

&gt; Installed pre-cooled coils and variable speed motors for air handling units (AHUs), 

which resulted in improved energy savings and humidity control.

&gt; Implemented shorter operating hours for building chillers, AHUs and fan coil units 

(FCU) without compromising operational requirements.

&gt; Replaced older air-cooled chiller systems with more energy-efficient water-

cooled chiller systems complete with building management system for Hangar 3, 

reducing energy consumption of the chiller systems by 50 per cent.

Water

&gt; Conducted regular water audits and submission of water efficiency management 

plan to the Public Utilities Board (PUB) annually.

&gt; Introduced sub metering at areas with high water consumption within SIA 

premises to monitor water usage. Along with daily analysis of meter readings, this 

allows for better identification of water-saving opportunities and water leakage 

within our premises.

&gt; Monitored daily water consumption to ensure any leaks are detected early.

&gt; Displayed educational posters provided by PUB at shower rooms and public hand 

wash areas in the canteen.

&gt; Harvested rain water for Airline House, SIA's Head Office. Rainwater is collected 

and used to water plants and flush toilets. This initiative resulted in water savings 

of 12,000 cubic metres per year at Airline House.



Before Replacement – Average 350lux.



After replacement – Average 500lux.

Photographs taken by SIAEC during lux level test conducted in April 2016.



After Replacement – Average 750lux. The lighting 

system is dimmable and the lighting levels are 

preset to 500lux and 750lux.

Lighting

&gt; Replaced high bay lighting for hangar operations. In FY2016/17, there was an 

increase in lighting lux level requirements from 350lux to 700lux by the operators 

within the maintenance hangars. SIA took the opportunity to introduce dimmable 

LED high bay lights to replace the sodium metal halide lamps for Hangars 3 and 

6. Not only did we manage to meet the new lux level requirements, we were also 

able to save energy despite the increase in the number of light fittings.

&gt; The ongoing LED high bay lights replacement for Hangar 1 is expected to result in 

a 30 per cent reduction in energy consumption.

Waste management

In FY2016/17, we disposed of 4,334 tonnes of waste accumulated from our 

office buildings. Toxic industrial waste (TIW) generated mostly from our aircraft 

maintenance activities is labelled and segregated from general waste, which is 

then collected by licenced general waste collectors and sent for incineration in the 

waste-to-energy plants. A licenced TIW collector is engaged to remove and treat the 

TIW before final disposal. In addition, no industrial effluents are generated from our 

commercial activities and all waste water is discharged to government-run water 

reclamation plants for treatment.

SIA has set a target to achieve a 30 per cent reduction in waste generation from our 

buildings by FY2020/21 as compared to base year FY2010/11. In order to meet the 

overall waste reduction target, departments have set their own targets, such as to 

reduce paper use in technical crew duty processes and for flight voyage reports to 

go paperless within three to five years. Longer-term targets include exploring waste 

reduction initiatives such as food waste recycling and working towards paperless 

in-flight menus. To improve our waste management practices, SIA incorporates the 

three R’s in our daily activities:

Energy Conservation best practices

In our yearly review of energy requirements for our buildings and facilities, we have identified opportunities to better optimise energy consumption in order to prevent 

wastage. These were some of our energy-saving efforts in FY2016/17:

Environmental Awareness Events

Electronic-Waste Recycling Event

A new campaign, “Let’s Erase E-waste!” was launched in June 2016. The two-week 

campaign aimed to raise awareness among staff that old electronics should be 

recycled. Electronics contain many precious metals such as beryllium, copper, gold, 

lead, nickel, palladium and zinc, which can be found in circuit boards. By recycling 

unwanted electronics, these natural materials can be used to manufacture new 

electronics, while plastic castings can be melted down to make other products.

A total of 1,495kg of electronics was collected from this drive, with household items 

making up approximately 500kg. 

Environmental Challenge for Schools (ECS)

SIA also works with the National Environment Agency (NEA) to inspire the next 

generation of Singaporeans to be active in environmental care. Under the revamped 

Environment Challenge for Schools (ECS) spearheaded by NEA, SIA partnered 

with Dunman Secondary School to work on a project which turns food waste into 

compost. The students came to SIA’s premises and presented their project. They gave 

out compost which they made by themselves and engaged staff with games to raise 

awareness of food waste.
