MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRLADY 

 

Dear Readers, 

 

On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is my 

pleasure to release the first sustainability report of  

Mun Siong Engineering Limited in compliance with 

the GRI G4  framework. 

Sustainability is an important component of our 

Group. We strive to provide better benefits to our 

business partners by increasing our range of 

services 

and 

helping 

them 

to 

achieve 

their 

sustainability objectives as well. Our concept of 

sustainability 

means 

setting 

a 

standard 

for 

ourselves. We would like to ensure that as we strive 

for financial success, we also fulfil our  obligation to 

our 

stakeholders. 

As 

an 

engineering 

design, 

construction and maintenance service provider in 

the 

oil 

and 

gas, 

petrochemical 

and 

energy 

industries, we aim to maintain sustainable practices 

in our business and ensure a high level of  customer satisfaction. 

In 2017, we re-structured and re-aligned the business strategy of our Group. We          

integrated our rotating equipment services as well as scaffolding capabilities of our 

subsidiary into our main operations. Moving forward, we have further plans to integrate 

our wholly owned subsidiary, OHM Engineering Pte Ltd into our main activities. The 

purpose of this streamlining process is to provide more efficient and productive 

management deliverables to our business partners. The Group has also appointed  

consultants to re-engineer our work processes and streamline our work flows. Upon 

successful implementation of the new ERP system, the Group will be able to further 

replicate our standard work processes across all the other subsidiaries in India, 

Malaysia and Myanmar.  

 

This sustainability report describes the activities we have pursued in this area. 

 

Yours truly, 

CHENG WOEI FEN

SUSTAINABILITY AT MUN SIONG GROUP 

The Group recognises that embracing sustainability practices is a business priority given 

that sustainability is important for the long term development and success of our 

businesses. We are pleased to issue our first Sustainability Report this year in Compliance 

with the Singapore Stock Exchange requirements based on the Global Reporting Index 

(“GRI”) G4 Reporting Guidelines.  

Besides financial performance and corporate governance compliance, which are covered in 

our annual report, we are convinced that a company will enjoy success over the long term 

only if it is able to keep a balance between economic, social and environmental factors. 

This Sustainability Report gives our stakeholders a comprehensive insight of how Mun 

Siong Group balances its financial goals to excel as one of the leading turnkey solution 

providers. It underlines our commitment to conduct our business in a sustainable manner 

and provides an insight to the creation of stakeholder value at Mun Siong. 

The information contained in this report are based on data obtained from Mun Siong 

Group’s operating business in Singapore. It covers the financial year 1st January to 31st 

December 2017. 

This year’s data will become our benchmark and we will continue to work on improving our 

data collection quality to enhance our reporting process and transparency.  

In an effort to make our communication greener, we have not produced physical copies of 

this report and have uploaded this report to the SGX website. We look forward to hearing 

your 

constructive 

feedback 

on 

our 

sustainability 

management 

via 

email 

to 

information@mun-siong.com. 

OUR BOARD STATEMENT  

The Board considers sustainability to be a strategic matter and is committed to the 

improvement of economic, social and environmental well-being of our communities and 

the environment. 

OUR SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT 

Our sustainability steering committee was formed in September 2016 and is responsible 

for steering and aligning our Group’s sustainability strategy with the Executive Committee. 

The steering committee is supported by the various business units to provide ideas and 

feedback to promote the development of our sustainability activities and the sustainability 

report. Participants in the sustainability steering committee are mainly grouped into 

Environmental sub-committee that comprises of logistics, safety, health, environment, the 

Compliance sub-committee from the Board of Directors and the Finance Director as well as 

the Social sub-committee that comprises of business units from contracts, procurement, 

human resources, purchasing and warehousing. 


 

Mun Siong Group • Sustainability Report 2017 

13 

In FY2017, the Steering committee held quarterly meetings to report their studies to the 

Executive Committee. It also conducted monthly sharing sessions during management 

meetings to raise corporate awareness and commitments towards our sustainability 

standards. 

OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY 

Our stakeholders are important to us and we need to identify their needs and 

expectations. We want to understand where they are coming from and take those factors 

into consideration when we make our business decisions.  

Our business partners, shareholders, suppliers and employees are of the highest regard 

to our company.   

Our Business Partners 

Effective work methods and productivity improvements to enhance the quality and 

schedule of work that we delivered to our business partners are developed 

collaboratively. 

Our Shareholders 

We foster an open dialogue with our shareholders. Different platforms are used to 

engage effectively, such as emails and the Annual General Meeting. 




 

Mun Siong Group • Sustainability Report 2017

Our Suppliers 

Many of our suppliers have been our partners for many years. They support us in providing 

solutions for our business partners. We carry out annual audits on our approved vendors to 

ensure that a fair and robust procurement system is in place which aligns to our social and  

environmental responsibilities. 

Our Employees 

We encourage and practise transparent and effective communications as well as accept 

and welcome diversified views from various ethnics of our employees are our key factors to 

retain long term employees and to attract talents who are able to bring along their 

valuable experience and commitments to our Group.  

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 

The activities we pursue in terms of sustainability are based on the principle of materiality. 

This principle also defines the structure and the context of this Report. In order to identify 

the sustainability aspects that are of essential importance to our Group, we conducted an 

assessment in 2016. Following the assessment, we compiled the sustainability aspects that 

are of relevance to us based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and 

other sources, and discussed them in our sustainability steering committee to assess their 

significance to our Group. The results were then transferred to a matrix sorted in order of 

relevance. Those aspects that had been identified as being material were validated and 

prioritised.

1.1  

Economic Performance to creating Shareholders value 

We maximise returns for long-term profitability, with the aim of creating sustainable 

shareholder value.  

Our financial performance is one of the key areas of our business strategy. For more in-

formation, please refer to our Annual Report. 

 

The trend in our financial performance is shown below: 






 

Mun Siong Group • Sustainability Report 2017

1.2 

Innovation 

Innovation and development work we do are important factors for the competitiveness of 

our Group. They allow our business partners to benefit from our mechanisation initiative 

and improvement solutions. Our aim is to translate our ideas into improvement solutions 

that will allow us to meet the expectations of our business partners and at the same time 

generate more productive work output. 

 

2. Social Aspect 

2.1 

Employee Retention 

At the end of 2017, the Group had a total headcount of approximately 1,200. Giving the 

new hires a good orientation program is a key aspect of our human resource work. The 

on boarding standard is also one of the ways in which we try to retain our employees. 

Comparing year on year, there was a 5.7% and 2.7% decrease in employee hiring and 

employee resignation respectively in 2017. 

 

Getting People On Board Quickly 

Most people resign within the first two years of their work with the company. There are 

so many challenges that new colleagues face. They need to familiarise themselves with 

the job and at the same time, they have to adapt quickly to the policies applying to the 

Group and assimilate to the corporate culture. If people can be quickly oriented, they will 

be motivated towards their job and reduce the risk of attrition. 

 

Training &amp; Development 

The on boarding training courses on compliance and IT security are important to new 

hires as they familiarise with the Group’s IT framework and avenue to seek support or 

advice as and when needed.   

Our Group is committed to developing a competent workforce. As a service provider we 

depend on our employees to maintain our market position and competitiveness. Hence, it 

is important that we provide regular training to our employees, allowing them to continue 

learning new skills and qualifications to upskill individual’s capabilities and competency in 

order to excel for the next level of their career path. Having qualified employees, 

especially in engineering professions, is of key importance for us and for the 

development of our company. We will only be able to recruit and retain them if we offer 

employee development opportunities. Providing resources to enable talent is crucial to 

the Group.  This enables the Group to grow with dedicated and competent employees to 

drive service excellence and business growth. 

 

Career Progression and Promotion 

Employees are nurtured to advance to the next level in their career. With a good training 

and development program, employees will be earmarked for promotion to take on more 

leadership roles.

2.2 

Employee Engagement 

In the past two years, the Group has continued to strengthen employee engagement 

through various communication channels and activities.  

As part of our efforts to enhance communication within the Group, we introduce monthly 

dormitory room leaders’ dialogue, and a calendar of activities and engagement programs 

for our employees. We also convened for various engagement sessions for two-way 

interaction between Management and employees via our town hall meeting.

2.3 Equal Opportunity and Diversity 

Our Group delivers services that tend to be highly diversified to the international oil 

majors. We depend on employees who bring a broad range of experience, 

qualifications and perspectives to their jobs. The individual’s competencies allows us 

to benefit from the market opportunities we encounter. Hence ensuring equal 

opportunities, racial and gender diversity are the core aspects of our human 

resource policy. We advocate fair and merit based employment for each and every 

individual who works for us. We select employees on the basis of their skills, years of 

experience and ability to perform the job, regardless of their race, gender, religion 

and marital status.  



Equal Opportunities 

At the end of FY2017, the percentage of women in the overall number of employees was 

4% in FY2016 and was increased to 4.5% ending FY2017. 




 

Mun Siong Group • Sustainability Report 2017 

20 

2.4 

Occupational Safety and Health 

We put SAFETY of everyone above all in whatever we do. This has since become the 

safety value that guides us in our work. We believe that safety is everyone’s 

responsibility and we have been building a strong and positive safety oriented culture in 

our workplace to promote safety. 

Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Policy is another of our guiding principles in 

creating a safe working environment for everyone. We will continuously drive to improve 

the way we carry out our work safely together with our business partners to achieve our 

goal of zero incident. 

We achieve our goal by managing risk at work, equipping our work crew with competent 

skills, provide SHE training and conduct campaigns to raise safety awareness at work. 

 

Managing Risks 

We manage risk at work through preparing risk assessment for every job, 

communicate hazards and risks at pre-task discussions, intervene unsafe 

observations, carry out safety inspections and conduct management walkabouts 

to support and ensure safety compliance. 

 

Training 

We strongly believe that to equip our workforce with competent skill and 

knowledge to carry out the work safely is one of the cornerstones of success for 

the Group. Selected staff are trained on risk management to build on 

fundamentals of hazard identification and risk assessment at the workplace. Our 

staff from different levels also attend our business partner’s in house training such 

as Loss Prevention System (LPS) &amp; Blue Zone Barrier Thinking programs to 

further enhance themselves in safety. Our engineers and supervisors also attend 

in-house Safety workshops which focuses on their soft skills.  

 

Campaign 

We held safety campaigns to heighten awareness on SHE matters and promote 

positive behaviour amongst the work crew. The campaigns held in 2017 include 

“Safe Use of Process Equipment” and “Hand Safety”. An effective campaign will 

help to eliminate any doubts that the work crew might have, boost the morale of 

the workforce, reduces costly mistakes and prevent injury.

Recognising Achievement 

Our wholly owned electrical &amp; instrumentation subsidiary received a silver awarded at the 

WSH performance Award 2017 organised by WSH Council for the fifth consecutive year.  

Our maintenance site that serves one of the oil majors in Jurong Island, achieved four 

years without a Lost Time Incident. 





2.5 Good Corporate Citizenship 

The Group views corporate social responsibility as a key component towards being 

sustainable. We are aware that with our range of services, our human resource policy, 

environmental management and many other factors, we can make an impact to society.  

The Group prides itself as a good corporate citizen and gives back to society in a caring 

way. 

Mun Siong Group has been the Ambassador to Singapore Association for the Deaf since 

2009.  For the past nine years, the Group has been sponsoring the Association. Amongst 

other things, Mun Siong contributes to their annual Children’s Charities Association of 

Singapore by sponsoring drinks and game stalls during their Christmas fair and walkathon 

around the Orchard area for the past years.  

Mun Siong Group actively participates in various charity events over the years. Initiatives 

by individual business units will be reviewed by Corporate Communications with 

Compliance units. Mun Siong Group encourages our employees to volunteer and give 

back to the society.

3.1 

Water Conservation 

Water is a limited resource. It is also a key issue globally. We are aware that we need 

water for our business operations. Our objective is to ensure that water is used as 

efficiently as possible.  

In Mun Siong Group, water is used domestically as well as whenever we are working. 

Potable water is used by all the employees for their daily needs and NEWater for our 

business operations such as hydro jetting and hydro testing jobs.  

Information on efficient use of water are shared during our weekly tool box meetings and 

at our corporate headquarter to urge all concerned to use water sparingly. These 

measures include installation of 11 tap water savers. We are also exploring innovative 

ideas to reuse or recycle water that are used in hydro jetting and hydro testing 

operations. 

3. 

Environmental Aspect 

We strive to use our resources wisely and make necessary investments in technology and 

systems that allow us to manage and reuse water, energy and waste. We believe that it 

is citizen’s duty to save and conserve the environment, maintain the ecosystem and to 

preserve the Earth for future generations. 

As part of our Safety, Health and Environment policy, we are dedicated to monitor the 

usage of resource and to keep wastage to the minimum. Targets were set to achieve a 

1% reduction in water, diesel and electricity consumption over the next three years.  




 

Mun Siong Group • Sustainability Report 2017 

23 

3.3 

Diesel Conservation 

Diesel fuel is widely used in most types of transportation. Due to the nature of our 

business, we use diesel for our daily operations in lorries, welding generator sets, air 

compressors, generators and other pumps and equipment.  

In order to manage and reduce our diesel consumption, our sustainability sub-committee 

took the initiative to propose the installation of GPS in our fleet of vehicles. The GPS 

system enables us to track and monitor the travelling route of the drivers as well as the 

diesel usage. These information allows us to educate our drivers to plan their route in 

advance and help conserve the usage of diesel fuel. 

3.2  

Electricity Conservation 

Due to the nature of our operations, in mechanical welding works, machining and usage 

of electrical tools and electricity for lighting in our offices and workshops, it is crucial for 

us to utilise energy saving tools and monitoring processes for optimal energy 

conservation. 

The environmental committee has targeted to reduce the electricity consumption by 1% 

over the next three years. A series of electricity saving initiatives have been rolled out. 

To focus on the key areas of our electricity consumption, we have replaced the spot 

lights in the fabrication yards and office pantry areas. We have also programed the air-

conditioning units to operate at about 23 degree Celsius and above as well as to ensure 

lights are turned off during lunch hours. 

We have plans to install highly energy efficient LED lighting system at selected areas that 

can potentially lower electricity consumption.

Effluent and Waste Management 

Mun Siong Group adopts the Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (3Rs) methodology to manage 

our waste. By practising 3Rs, we help to protect the environment and conserve limited 

resources. Our waste management efforts are focused on spent motor oil, paper and 

aluminium cans.  

We are constantly working to reduce waste from our operations, as well as finding 

efficient ways to recycle. Measures were conveyed to all employees to reduce, reuse or 

recycle whenever possible.
