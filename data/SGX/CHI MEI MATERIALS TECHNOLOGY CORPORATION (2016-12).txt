J.Y. Ho, Chairman 

Corporate sustainable management 

Corporate sustainable management is the key requirement to 

create economic and social value, constantly improve the 

competitiveness of company is the first priority, and 

forward-looking planning is the management of the responsibility 

for the sustainable development.  A sustainable company will 

bring its employees to live in peace and work pleasantly, to 

develop their potential, and the company will share the value 

created by employees to the community.  What is taken from 

the society is used in the interests of society.  We believe it can 

create a positive social and economic cycle. 

In 2016, CMMT has encountered many challenges in its operation. In February 2016, there was a 

magnitude earthquake in Tainan, most company were obviously affected including CMMT and 

customers. The tremendous international financial environment and swift fluctuations of the 

exchange rate have also caused a tremendous impact on our operations. Overall, the operating 

environment was difficult for CMMT in the first half of 2016. Many challenges in front of us, we will 

continue to improve the competitiveness of our company, strengthen market position in Taiwan, 

and constantly improve our own technology and development of high quality products to provide 

customers stable supply and best quality. In respect of new market development, with the 

continuous growth of panel market demand in the mainland China, new fabrication plant in 

Kunshan will be the primary strategy to increase the market share in China in hopes to create 

growth momentum and diversify risks.  

 

People are the valuable assets of the enterprise. In 2016, we also made some changes to the 

personnel system, including salary adjustment, grading and promotion system. We wish to provide 

stable salary and benefits to our employees without worries. At the same time, we also created the 

platform for our employees to elaborate their potential.  Promoting eco-friendly products, energy 

conservation, and reduction of waste, all waste water and waste disposal legitimacy have been 

obviously responsibility and obligations for enterprise.   

 

In 2016, CMMT encountered the challenges of the market and the environment, however CMMT 

will continue to enhance the technical capabilities, provide platform for people to elaborate and 

improve product quality, strive to break though the current predicament and create a sustainable 

business environment, for our employees to live, work in peace, to elaborate their potential to 

contribute to the community, and feel proud of being CMMT employees.

In recently years, panel market has diverted to mainland, which is also because China’s

Rapid recession of industry in 2016, some manufacturers were close. However, with the rapid 

growth of the panel business at the end of 2016, the demand for polarizers rapidly returned, 

which we found prices have stabilized including production line.  

 



In 2017, CMMT’s major customers’ demand increase which encourage the achievement of 

CMMT in Taiwan’s market. 

 



Except current suppliers from Japan, CMMT will also use raw materials from other countries, 

which help cost down. 

 



CMMT will focus on high-end market in the future which has higher technical threshold, mostly 

oligopoly by Japanese retailers, and the extra value will be much high than the product itself. 

With the upgrading of CMMT’s market penetration, profitability of products should gradually 

increase accordingly.

 2.1 PRODUCT AND SERVICE 

CMMT devotes to provide customers high quality products and has met relevant laws and 

regulations and contract specifications which in 2016 the following incidents never occurred.   

 

Analysis of production and supplier chain 

 

 

 

CMMT is specialized in polarizer manufacturing, main upstream raw materials suppliers are from 

Taiwan, Japan, Korea, China, and downstream major customers are panels and module plants. 

 

Supplier chain management: CMMT has certain procedures for new suppliers or raw materials 

import.  Collaborative evaluation by R&amp;D dep., quality management dep., and procurement 

dep. to confirm the usability and effectiveness of product quality during the importing process, 

in order to become qualified supplier. 

 

Supplier relations: CMMT establishes the “Operating Procedure for Managing Procurement”, 

and ask employees to comply with the “Code of Conduct” to uphold the win-win principles, in 

hopes of achieving mutual trust and interest and pursuing sustainable development jointly.  

 

Procurement objects: maintaining fine relationship with suppliers has always been the 

important goal of CMMT, to obtain stable quality of product and delivery has always been the

goal, in order to accomplish this goal, CMMT highly respects the management and interaction 

with suppliers, and uphold the win-win principles, in hopes of achieving mutual trust and 

interest and pursuing sustainable development jointly.  

 

Main materials and suppliers of polarizers 

For the time being, the main suppliers all come from Japan, and the market is monopolized by 

Japan-based suppliers. Notwithstanding, CMMT is used to maintaining fair relationship with 

suppliers and can satisfy the production need by supply sufficient materials. Recently, many 

domestic/foreign suppliers have invested in development of the related materials. This will benefit 

the safety of main materials supply.  For the time being, CMMT’s raw materials supply is 

considered well, and the source of materials is stable and reliable.  

For the raw materials TAC, PET and COP existing in a monopolized market, CMMT also continues to 

observe the other domestic TAC film manufacturers launching into the industry and test their 

product quality, in hopes of changing the upstream raw materials suppliers’ competitive structure. 

 

Domestic procurement  

Currently, domestic suppliers in Taiwan is 50%, deduct abovementioned key raw materials has the 

restrictions of monopolized characteristics, other raw materials procurement is over 90% domestic.

Products quality assurance  

 Since the establishment, the ISO9001 and QC080000 management systems were certified from 

the initial stage of plant construction until now, CMMT has continuously promoted relevant 

management activities to establish, implement, maintain and improve management systems 

continuously in order to meet the requirements of the management system. CMMT fully revised 

when each revision of international standards is required in order to achieve international standards.  

For instance: In 2009, ISO9001:2000 revised to ISO9001:2008. In 2013, QC080000:2005 revised to 

QC080000:2012 …et al. In response to 15th, September, 2015 ISO9001:2015 new version 

announcement, CMMT started revision program since third quarter of 2016, and expected to 

revised certification in 2017.   

 CMMT upholds the policy and quality goal of “customer-oriented, continuous improvement; 

harmful substances reduction, creating corporate value”, reviewed by management team regularly, 

amended and approved by president, announced then implementation. In order to ensure all the 

quality activities of CMMT are conducted under controlled conditions and build mutual trust with 

customers so that they are confident CMMT will continue to meet the requirements.  

 

Product quality management and measurements 

 CMMT has conducted control mechanism into all the quality control stations from materials input 

to the finished product output point so that defective products can be immediately stopped that 

deliver up to grade products to all the customers.

Energy conservation and measures 

 

Above measures will conserve approximately 1,400,000 kWh a year, which equal to 

2.2% of 2016 electricity consumption. 

 “Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act “was passed in 2015 in Taiwan, the carbon 

emission of enterprise will move towards the total volume control. According to 2014 “Energy Users Set 

Objectives for Energy Conservation and Implementation Plans”, energy users with contracted 

capacity exceeding 800kWh should have an average annual electricity saving rate of 1% or more 

between 2015~2019. 

In response to meet “Tainan City Self-Government Ordinance for a Low-Carbon City” and 

regulation of energy management plan of ministry of Economic affairs and improve the utilization of 

clean energy, CMMT plans to build up a solar power plant on the roof of our fabrication plant for 

self-use and electric installation in two installments design. First phase of the design is 411.84 kWh, the 

second phase of the design is 199.68 kWh, and total device capacity will be 611.52 kWh. The first phase 

was completed parallel power generation in September 2016 and the second phase completed parallel 

power generation by the end of November 2016.

Waste Disposal classification and volume 

 

Currently, all waste is disposed by incinerators or landfills in the vicinity.  

 

 

Waste reduction measures 

Polarizer mainly produces waste plastic mixture, main difference will be iodine, which will result 

different treatment.  Although it will be harmless after burning iodine products, but still producing 

non-ferrous fumes which limits total monthly emissions. In respect of short-term treatment, 

product will be broken to reduce the concentration of burning, and medium-term treatment will be 

to remove iodine molecules through chemical method. Overall, CMMT is committed to enhance 

yield and reduce waste production capacity, in order to truly reduce waste.  

 

Management of reduction of packaging materials, recycling of chemicals and banning of 

chemicals 

For the main packaging materials, chemicals and gaskets and other products, CMMT also conducts 

reduction and recovery management. CMMT also use recyclable PP box, improve the use of 

packaging materials to reduce the waste of packaging materials. For chemicals, especially iodine, 

CMMT imported recycling equipment which can purify and concentrate the wasted iodine and resell 

to supplier in order to achieve materials recycling. For gaskets, CMMT will also recycle used gasket 

to cut into smaller size shims to reuse.

nearly 22 hectares of land is reserved for conservation and detention basins, moreover, the 

detention basins are planned as landscape lakes.  Tree Valley Park respects the symbiosis of 

ecological culture and human beings, More than 30,000 trees of Taiwan native species are planted 

and 100,000 seed programs will be promoted to create a world-class cultural landscape. 

 

First Tree Valley foundation and Archeological Center were established by industrial area in Taiwan. 

In order to promote the core values of ecology, history, culture and arts in the Tree Valley Park, the 

Archeology Research Center is set up by trust so that the rich archaeological sites unearthed in the 

Park can be preserved. 

In the future, Tree Valley foundation will create an open platform for people who share the same 

faith to participate. In addition to enabling the park to be financially self-sufficient, a series of 

activities planned by the Foundation will lead to greater public awareness and recognition of the 

land. As a member of Tree Valley Park, CMMT also actively responds to the planting of native tree 

species and also provides corporate land for archeological team to use, join series of charity 

activities and donation with Tree Valley Foundation.
