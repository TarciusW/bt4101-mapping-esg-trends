OUR 

MISSION

Our mission for sustainable 

development 

integration 

is 

to provide corrugated paper 

packaging solutions through 

the adoption of international 

best practices that positively 

impact 

stakeholders 

in 

our 

supply chain.


DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

In the wake of COVID-19, the company faced unprecedented challenges and difficulties. Through determination and 

teamwork, we were able to overcome most of them. I therefore would like to express my gratitude to our shareholders, 

the Board of Directors (the ”Board”), the Management, all our employees in Singapore and China, our suppliers and, 

of course, our customers for staying the course with us. We will remember what we have gone through together for 

years to come.

Since the beginning of the crisis that was posed by the outbreak of COVID-19, safeguarding the well-being of our 

employees and keeping them safe in our facilities has always been our top priority. We took all necessary steps to 

stay sustainable in every sense of the word. Even though our Group’s balance sheet was healthy and we continued to 

enjoy ample credit lines, we remained vigilant financially by exercising prudent cost controls and conserved cash. As 

we need to continuously guard against the considerable risks posed by the pandemic, we have further strengthened 

our business continuity plan (“BCP”) to ensure that we can sustain our operations in times of crisis and extended its 

scope to cover all key processes for better effectiveness and efficiencies.

We have indeed come a long way since our inception in 1968 to become the leader that we are today in the corrugated 

packaging industry. To ensure that we can continue to lead in our industry, we are committed in doing the right 

things for the planet, our people and our communities. We are therefore humbled to have been awarded the Forest 

Stewardship Council (“FSC”) Certification for all our subsidiaries in China. We have also pledged to commit to obtaining 

the same recognition for our Singapore entities in the near future.

Our aim remains to provide quality products and services to our customers while minimizing any negative impact on our 

environment. We also want to make a positive impact by improving our recycling methods for paper and wastewater as 

well as through other initiatives. While we continue to work towards our agreed sustainability goals, we also believe that 

there are always more aspects that we can look into. For instance, our subsidiary, Hefei Dansun Packaging Co., Ltd. 

adopted a two-stage activated carbon absorption process which helps to treat the waste gases that originated from 

the volatile organic compounds, allowing the treatment of exhaust gas conforms with the national emission standards. 

Hence, we will continue to explore new technology or new ways of doing things that we can implement or adopt into 

our practices to further improve our sustainability performance.

Sustainability is at the heart of our business model. Incorporating sustainability goals in our business growth plans 

means that we need to provide the relevant training for our employees. We do that by offering both external and internal 

courses, as well as encouraging all employees to seize such opportunities to grow professionally and mentally. It is 

indeed our belief that people development is core to our continuous success.

COVID-19 has ushered in a new era of innovation with unprecedented speed. It has uncovered opportunities to redefine 

our workplace, innovate new technologies, and create value that can transform our industry and our environment. It 

is time to adopt advanced technology and introduce automation with urgency. It is time to take action together and 

respond to the biggest challenges of our time. With this, we will emerge from this crisis even stronger.

Thank you for being there for us. We welcome suggestions on how we can further improve our environmental, social 

and governance (“ESG”) factors. Please sent them to us via email at ir@ts.sg.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN (GRI 102-9, 102-10)

The key raw material in our production is paper roll and the predominant types we use are kraftliner, kraft top liner, 

medium and white top liner. In Singapore we procure paper roll from overseas suppliers. Our paper roll in China mainly 

originates from paper mills in China.

There were no significant changes to our supply chain in 2020, while the Group has expanded its raw material sources 

via import. The Group takes pride to continually ensure that all our supplies are purchased from sustainable sources. 

Suppliers who are reported to have engaged in errant practices are immediately suspended until there is reasonable 

assurance that the offending practice has been rectified in accordance with the ethical and legal forestry operations 

and sourcing of wood or forest products.

ABOUT OUR

REPORT


COVID-19 has brought unusual and unpredicted challenges to all businesses. The Group expects the operating 

environments of both Singapore and China to remain challenging in the near-term, with demand for goods and services 

softening. 

Nevertheless, the Group remains committed to our current ESG strategies. We will closely monitor the ever-changing 

business landscape and keep shareholders informed of any material impact on our business as and when they arise. 

The Group retains a healthy balance sheet and ample credit lines to support and finance its operation and investment 

activities. At the same time, we will take all necessary precautionary measures to safeguard the health and safety of our 

employees while complying with directives issued by the local authorities.

Customers

To sustain our product and 

service 

portfolio 

and 

increase top-line revenues, 

contactless services will be 

optimised. 

Supply chain

To maintain multiple 

paper sources amid the 

COVID-19 pandemic and 

make effort to expand 

other sources which are FSC certified 

that will minimise disruptions and can 

better support our supply chain.

Managing process and procedures

Our 

decision-making 

framework and approach will 

be further enhanced for 

greater 

autonomy 

and 

efficacy whilst integrating sustainability 

practices.

Technology

Digital transformation will be inculcated and 

further accelerated to equip operational 

platforms and tools that may be applied for 

staff on a work-from-home (“WFH”) scheme.

WFH employees work remotely and this becomes a 

new norm.

Employees

It is our top priority to put in place the key 

preventive measures to safeguard the well-being 

of our employees and to keep them safe in our 

facilities. BCP in response to the COVID-19 

outbreak have been incorporated, to minimise disruption 

of company operations and to ensure that business 

remains viable during the virus outbreak. 

COVID-19 PREVENTIVE MEASURES

Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic has quietly spread, pulling at people’s heartstrings. We quickly 

complied with the prevention and control requirements imposed by the governments in Singapore and China to reduce 

the risk of our employees being infected. Listed below are some of the key preventive measures that we adopted:

• Took appropriate precautionary measures in accordance with the latest advisories published by the local authorities.

• Appointed dedicated teams to conduct regular checks, coordinate and monitor the measures and compliance at 

workplace.

• Conducted daily temperature screening, health declaration and tracking of records at the workplace.

• Distributed face masks and hand sanitizers to our employees.

• Set up alternate workstations to split up teams; staggered working hours and implemented rotating shifts.

• Staggered the schedule for dining and practised social distancing.

COVID-19 MITIGATING MEASURES

09

TAT SENG PACKAGING GROUP LTD 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020

RESPONDING TO

COVID-19


• Employees were urged to adopt good personal hygiene practices and exercise precautions at all times.

• Employees and visitors were made to observe safe distancing rules and put on masks at all times.

• Briefing and training have been conducted for employees on how to prevent and control.

• Deferred employees’ business travel as strict border measures have been imposed by the relevant Authorities to 

curb COVID-19 infections.

• Employees were strongly encouraged to take the COVID-19 vaccination.

• Deferred company activities that involved large group gatherings until further notice.

• Provided adequate IT infrastructure for work-from-home employees.

• Maintained good housekeeping and cleanliness of the workplace premises.

• Carried out regular disinfection of high contact areas with a disinfectant known to kill COVID-19.

• Conducted business meetings, including Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company via virtual means instead 

of physical meeting.

• Our China subsidiaries performed preventive disinfection of imported containers of paper material.

It is crucial that everyone remains vigilant to avoid a resurgence of community cases. Therefore, the Group continues 

to carry out and update its COVID-19 preventive measures according to the guidelines and best practices that are 

published by the relevant authorities and ensure that our employees are kept informed of any new updates.

THE STRENGTHENING OF BCP DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

Ensuring business continuity is our core responsibility to our customers and general public as some of our packaging 

products are supplied to customers in the industries of medical, health care and pharmaceutical. The products that 

are produced by these customers are vital to everyday life and public health.  As the situation unfolded, securing the 

raw materials needed to keep serving our customers became a top priority.

During the year, the pandemic caused a critical shortage of containers, shipment delays, evolving export restrictions 

and changes to laws and regulations that created challenges for our paper roll procurement. In response to this, we 

expanded our raw material sources so as to ensure that we can continue to be supplied by reliable suppliers with FSC 

certification and to minimize the risk of disruption to our supply chain.

During the year, we focused on initiatives that further strengthened our BCP so as to ensure continuity of operations 

in times of crisis. We also extended the scope of our BCP to cover all key processes to mitigate business risks. 

Furthermore, we also engaged our internal auditors to perform an audit of our business continuity management process 

to review the adequacy and compliance of the BCP.

RESPONDING TO

COVID-19


SUPPORTING OUR STAKEHOLDERS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

The Group fully participated in the fight against the epidemic within the scope of its operations, proactively finding out 

the actual needs of various stakeholders during this period, and cooperated with stakeholders including employees, 

customers, suppliers, and shareholders. We took the initiative to act, to support our stakeholders, to fulfil our corporate 

social responsibility and to stay vigilant during the pandemic outbreak.

In Singapore, some of our Malaysian employees were affected by their country’s Movement Control Order during the 

COVID-19 outbreak. To protect the well-being of our employees and to stabilise our workforce, we converted part of 

our office site into a Temporary Living Quarters for this group of employees. We provided necessary arrangements for 

accommodation and met their daily needs while they continued to work.

For the China-based subsidiaries, employees from other provinces were encouraged with monetary incentives not 

to return to their hometown during Chinese New Year. An additional on-the-job work subsidy was granted to such 

employees who worked during Chinese New Year.

As an essential part of the supply chain, our Singapore’s entities were able to continue the operation to support essential 

customers during the period of the circuit breaker. Our China subsidiaries have also gradually resumed their production 

after the extended Chinese New Year holiday and continued supplying to customers. Even though it was challenging, 

we continued to make on-time payments to suppliers to ensure that they continued to supply us without interruption.

It was the first time that we conducted our AGM via virtual means instead of a physical meeting. To safeguard the 

well-being of our shareholders, we encouraged them to participate in the meeting by submitting their questions and 

casting their votes in relation to any of the resolutions tabled for approval at the AGM before the stipulated deadline. 

We addressed their questions prior to the AGM and uploaded the Company’s responses on the SGXNet and the 

Company’s website.

In addition, our Singapore entities also donated to the Community Chest to support the COVID-19 Courage Fund during 

FY2020, doing our part to lend a hand to the vulnerable groups who are affected by the pandemic.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT (GRI 102-42, 102-43, 102-44, 102-46, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3)

Carrying out a Materiality Assessment is the most important aspect of our sustainability strategy. The assessment 

ensures we learn about the sustainability issues that concern our stakeholders and that they are addressed promptly 

for a more robust and sustainable approach.

The materiality assessment process this fiscal year included internal stakeholders’ meetings involving employees and 

management, and an online survey. There were no differences in the order of importance of some of the materiality 

topics.

Additionally, two more United Nations Sustainable Development Goals SDG7 “Clean Energy” and SDG12 “Responsible 

Consumption and Production” were adopted and embedded into our business practices for 2020. This involves setting 

and committing to clear, relevant and measurable long-term targets.

Disclosures in this report cover our Singapore and China manufacturing facilities in general. However, all topics reflected 

in the Material matrix only cover our Singapore entities. Metrics applicable to GRI core disclosures are reported only 

if they are a good representation of the impact of our value chains.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE (GRI 102-32, 103-2)

The Sustainable Development Committee, set up in 2017 by the Group, promotes, monitors, and reports on 

sustainability business practices. The committee reports to the Board and is represented by Managing Director/CEO, 

Mr Loh See Moon, and Executive Director, Madam Cheong Poh Hua. Full profiles of our directors are available on 

pages 9 to 12 of our Annual Report FY2020.

NOMINATING BOARD MEMBERS (GRI 102-24)

To ensure oversight of nominating board members, the Board has established a Nominating Committee (“NC”). The 

NC reviews Board composition annually, assuring an appropriate mix of expertise and experience. This provides the 

Management with the benefits of having a diverse perspective of issues that are brought before the Board.

When a vacancy opens up, the NC, in consultation with the Board, determines the selection criteria for the position 

based on the skills and knowledge deemed necessary for the Board to best carry out its responsibilities. Candidates 

may be suggested by Directors, Management or sourced from external sources. Whilst mindful of related regulatory 

requirements, the NC considers prospective Board Members based on good character, merit, competencies, expertise, 

skills, track record, background, and other qualities. To promote diversity, the NC will also give due consideration to 

gender, age, ethnicity, disability and geographic representation.

The NC will then make a recommendation to the Board for the appointment. In turn, the Board appoints the most 

suitable candidate who must stand for re-election at the next AGM of shareholders.

RESILIENCE THROUGH

GOVERNANCE


CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (GRI 102-18, 103-2)

The Group is committed to setting and maintaining high standards of corporate governance as well as promoting 

corporate transparency by adhering closely to the principles and guidelines set out in the Code of Corporate Governance 

2018. One of the roles that the Board plays is to consider sustainability issues, such as environmental and social 

factors, as and when necessary, as part of its strategic formulation.

To ensure that specific issues are subject to considerations and review before the Board makes its decision, a number 

of Board Committees were established to assist the Board in carrying out its oversight function more effectively. These 

Committees function within clear written terms of reference that have been approved by the Board. Such terms of 

reference will be reviewed by the Board and Board Committees on a regular basis to affirm their continued relevance 

and to enhance the effectiveness of these Board Committees.

The Board implemented a Board Diversity Policy in November 2019, reserving at least 10% of the total number of 

board seats for women. 16.7% of the Board seats are currently occupied by women as at the date of this report.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (GRI 102-25, 103-2)

A Conflict of Interest policy and disclosure process is in place to protect the interests of the company. All disclosures 

are to be made to the Human Resource Manager and the General Manager/Director. They will determine whether a 

conflict exists and proceed according to the best practice.

INVESTOR RELATIONS POLICY (GRI 102-33, 103-2, 103-3)

The Investor Relations Policy was updated in November 2019 to outline our modes and frequency of communication. 

It affirms our compliance with relevant regulations and recommended practices designed to provide our shareholder 

community access to timely and material information. We are committed to making timely, full and accurate disclosures 

in accordance with the listing rules of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited.

PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION POLICY

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY (GRI 103-2, 103-3, 403-1)

In Singapore, we achieved zero workplace fatality case and have driven responsible safety behavior among our 

employees. Protecting our employees is a core value. We take care of ourselves and each other so everyone goes 

home safely at the end of every day.

In FY2020, we continued to focus on:

a) 

Workplace Safety &amp; Health Committee (“WSHC”)

Includes various department supervisors who monitor, manage, and implement workplace safety practices. The 

committee meets at least once a month to develop, plan, organise, manage and improve on our workplace 

safety programs. The meeting is chaired by the committee chairman (also our Production Manager) and the 

committee secretary is a registered Workplace Safety &amp; Health Officer.

b) 

5S Committee

Organise a monthly inspection to ensure that the concept of 5S – Sort (seiri), Set in Order (seiton), Shine (seiso), 

Standardise (seiketsu) and Sustain (shisuke) – is habitually practiced, and to commend the efforts of our staff 

in maintaining a tidy, clean and safe working environment within the organisation.

Total Workplace Safety and Health (“Total WSH”) is an integrated approach to manage safety, health, and well-being in 

the workplace. This approach views a safe and healthy workplace as one that has workers and managers collaborating 

in a continual improvement process to protect and promote the health, safety, and well-being of all workers and the 

sustainability of the workplace.

Our China entities take guidance from the Union Law that allows employees to be represented by trade unions for 

collective bargaining. We strive to create a progressive working environment to give our employees a wider and holistic 

representation.

Due to the nature of the industry, there is no significant seasonality in our workforce numbers and no significant work 

is performed by non-employees.

TRAINING &amp; DEVELOPMENT (GRI 103-2, 103-3, 404-1, 404-2, 404-3)

We invest in training and development because we believe that as the capabilities of our employees increase, so does 

the Company. The training path will make the engaged co-workers feel more empowered to contribute to innovative 

solutions that advance our responsible packaging goals.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, training has changed dramatically with the distinctive rise of e-learning via 

digital platform implemented globally. However, for Singapore entities, training for manual workers whereby physical 

attendance is needed has been reduced mainly due to the stringent Safe Management Measures taken in place for 

safe distancing and prevent from spreading of virus.

Nevertheless, we will continue to provide our employees opportunities to harness their skills and talents for their own 

professional and mental development. This, we recognise, will eventually benefit our organisation as well.

INJURY &amp; OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE RATE (GRI 103-2, 103-3, 403-2)

A commitment to employee health, safety and well-being is embedded in our culture and shapes the design of our 

processes and products. We take a holistic approach to offer a wide variety of guides, training, programmes, and 

benefits to promote employee health, safety and wellness. One such programme is the SATA Chest X-Ray Programme, 

guaranteeing treatment if any employee contracts tuberculosis. This reduces incidence and risk of related diseases.

ABSENTEE RATE (GRI 403-2)

Absentee means absent from work because of incapacity of any kind, not necessarily as a result of work-related injury 

or disease, but excludes permitted leave absence such as holidays, examination leave, maternity leave or paternity leave 

and compassionate leave. The absentee rate is calculated as actual absentee days lost, expressed as a percentage 

of total days scheduled to be worked by the employees for the entire year.

Absentee rate in Singapore increased from 2.1% in 2019 to 6.6% in 2020. This was mainly due to COVID-19 travel 

restrictions taken in place, thus affected employees (Malaysians) were placed on no paid leave (NPL)/leave of absent 

(LOA) during the lock-down period enforced by Malaysia Government.

We continue to encourage our employees to maintain a healthy lifestyle to help keep the absentee rate low.

We also reward good attendance by giving employees a monthly incentive.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT (GRI 103-2)

Engaging our employees is our way of showing our appreciation. This is also one of the ways we receive feedback 

from our employees. We recognise and appreciate the contribution of staff members who have dedicated their time 

with us over the years.

In 2020, Long Service Awards were presented to Singapore employees.

MATERIAL CONSUMPTION

As the Group’s raw materials significantly comprise of paper, our management has identified that paper waste 

management and supplier assessment for environmental impact are key material aspects for the Group’s sustainable 

development. All our China subsidiaries have attained Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, an independent 

assessment which accredited our management of practices to be in compliance with the internationally recognised 

standards of the FSC and in accordance with the correct social, economic and environmental standards. Our Singapore 

plants are also in the progress of obtaining the same recognition in the near future.

The Company, UPI, TJDS, HFDS and TSSZ have attained ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (“EMS”) 

certification that guides and manages our environmental responsibilities. We are committed to reducing and preventing 

pollution to the environment, by implementing an effective EMS and Environmental Policy. Our EMS seeks to:

1. 

Conserve energy and recycle our waste.

2. 

Minimise the use of depletable natural resources.

3. 

Minimise the generation of waste and pollutants by our manufacturing process.

4. 

Comply with local environmental legislation and other requirements.

5. 

Continuously improve the performance of the environmental management system.

PAPER (GRI 103-2, 103-3, 301-1, 306-2)

Our raw materials comprise mainly of paper harvested from wood. Whilst wood is a renewable resource, paper can 

be recycled several times.

In 2020, our factories in China and Singapore consumed 277,288 tons of paper rolls. As we offer customised solutions 

to our customers paper waste is inevitable as it is generated from the manufacturing process. Our paper shreds are 

automatically collected using conveyor belts under grooves on our factory floor. The wastepaper is then compacted 

into bales and sold to a local licensed wastepaper collector. The collector collects the wastepaper daily from a skip 

bin that they provide, consolidates them, and exports the wastepaper to overseas paper mills for re-manufacturing 

into various recycled paper and paper products.

In 2020, we met the targets in our Environmental Policy to keep paper wastage under 8.6% annually. We sold 22,911 tons 

of wastepaper, and that is equivalent to 8.26% of our total paper consumed, achieving our goal of recycling &gt;90% of 

our wastepaper.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT (GRI 301-1)

Most of our raw material is paper roll, produced from wood. To obtain paper, logging and deforestation are necessary, 

and the process creates long term loss to ecosystems which becomes vulnerable. According to the Climate, Nature 

and our 1.5°C Future report that was published by the World Wildlife Fund, logging to produce timber and pulp for 

global markets is the main driver of forest degradation.

We recognise that the nature of our business requires us to utilise a considerable amount of paper from all over the 

world. Consumers across the world are increasingly more conscious of protecting the environment and being aware of 

the product source makes an impact of their purchase. On this grounds, we recognise that sustainable procurement 

must continue to be a prerequisite for our long-term sustainability.

Diagram 15: Guideline for Sustainable Procurement

To meet our sustainability standards, we screen all our suppliers thoroughly to guarantee our paper roll procurement 

are primarily from FSC certified suppliers. The certification system allows us to identify, purchase and use wood, paper 

and other forest products produced from well-managed forests and/or recycled materials. Adoption of the FSC Chain 

of Custody means that the paper we use as raw material is unlikely to have been harvested illegally in violation of 

traditional or civil rights, or threatens high conservation value areas in any way.

We also commit to follow environmental guidelines when procuring suppliers. Every year, we review our suppliers and 

their activities to ensure they meet our sustainability standards.

In 2020, the Group procured an average of 75% from FSC certified suppliers of paper materials and we are committed 

to responsible sourcing and will continue to do so.

ENERGY (GRI 103-3, 302-1, 302-4)

In 2020, our Singapore plant has recorded an average monthly electricity usage of 90 kWh per metric ton of actual 

paper usage. The average electricity consumption has been maintained while our production output has slightly 

increased by 1% compared to 2019. 

We continue to foster our energy efficiency practices in all our operating plants and offices:

a) 25% of high bay lamps have been replaced by 100w LED high bay lamps for Singapore factory.

b) Install of skylights in all operating plants to allow sunlight onto the production floor.

c) While TSSZ, HFDS and TJDS are using steam supplied by external source for fuel, NTTS and UPI use natural gas 

for fuel to achieve a cleaner environment.

Moving forward, we will continue to work towards improving energy efficiency across all our plants and offices. The 

Company also starts looking into solar energy in order to reduce carbon footprint in the near future.

WATER &amp; EFFLUENTS (GRI 103-2, 306-1, 306-2, 306-4)

The Group uses water during production of corrugated products, as part of the supporting processes. We conserve 

water through recycling, reuse, and improvements to our manufacturing processes. In conformance with local regulatory 

requirements, all our plants are equipped with wastewater treatment facilities to treat wastewater before discharge. 

Leftover sludge is collected and disposed of by licensed waste contractors.

In Singapore, we engaged licensed laboratory organisation to conduct domestic wastewater analysis regularly. This is 

aligned to our risk-based approach to comply with Public Utilities Board’s Trade Effluent Regulations.

TSSZ has also upgraded the wastewater treatment facilities with the installation of automatic dosing device and 

automatic mud pump in order to facilitate the smooth treatment process. In addition, the sewerage pipelines have been 

upgraded to prevent the wastewater pollution from water leakage and mitigate the risk of non-compliance.

The Group will be continuously vigilant in the effort of promoting environmental awareness throughout all subsidiaries, 

and to avoid damage to the environment. Conserve natural resources through prevention, reuse, recycle, and the use 

of optimized manufacturing operations.
