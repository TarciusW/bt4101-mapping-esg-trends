In China Kunda, we believe selecting reliable, high-quality and cost-efficient suppliers can achieve business profitability. 

Most of our raw materials are sourced from local vendors in Guangdong, China. our top 10 suppliers are mainly short 

production cycle manufacturers offering materials ranging from plastic pellets, sheets, paints to household appliances. 

Please see figure 4 for the total amount spent on our top 10 suppliers.

Changes to the organization

In fY2018, the Group had announced the closure of the automobile component production facility in beijing. In 

fY2019, disposal of our subsidiary in beijing was completed and a new subsidiary, SeJ, commenced operations in 

Shenzhen to supply furniture fittings and appliances. 

10 new key suppliers1  are engaged and thus, the total number of key suppliers engaged by China Kunda increased to 

43 in fY2019 compared to 33 in fY2018 as a result of commencement of SeJ’s operations. these new suppliers are 

equipped with production lines for both furniture and electrical appliance, large production bases and precise digital 

facilities, which help us to improve our competitive advantage in the market.

In November 2018, we saw a 13% increase in employee numbers, which was mainly attributed to the establishment 

of SeJ. However, this number decreased by 11% in January 2019 as a result of decrease in workforce which is usually 

happens after Chinese New Year.

Under our enterprise Risk Management (“eRM”) framework, the board oversees the overall risk (including eeSG 

risks) management and internal control system with support from the audit committee whose members are all 

non-executive directors. the Senior Management governs the process of risk assessment, risk monitoring and risk 

treatment, with assistance from the external advisors. at the same time, they are responsible to monitor the daily 

operations and internal control procedures. all concerns will be reported to the board for quarterly risk assessment 

review. 

this year we appointed an additional management team led by our executive Director to respond to issues in 

furniture business using the same approach as in IMD and the Plastic Parts business.  

sustainability Governance 

the management team headed by our Chief executive officer shapes the sustainability policies, manages 

the sustainability initiatives and monitors the sustainability performance at various operating units. Under the 

management team, the Heads of Department are responsible for communicating sustainability policies to the 

respective divisions and ensuring the implementation of the sustainability measures. to ensure the effective

materiality assessment

In fY2018, we conducted a 3-step materiality assessment to determine the priorities of various eeSG matters. In 

fY2019, the board and management team re-assessed these matters and are of opinion that they are still relevant 

to today’s operations.

our new subsidiary, SeJ, commenced operation in December 2018which contributed less than 10% of the overall 

revenue in fY2019. the scale of the new operation is small and thus has little impact on our materiality assessment 

results. In fY2019, we continue to disclose on Material Use, employees training and advancement, Regulatory 

compliance, and Innovation and R&amp;D.

We will continue to reassess the materiality matters in the subsequent reporting period to ensure that the relevant 

eeSG matters are addressed in our sustainability report. 

this process is shown in figure 10.

China Kunda recognises regulatory compliance as key for internal controls and is committed to maintaining good 

corporate governance, complying with all related laws, regulations and standards and taking compliance issues or 

concerns reported seriously. 

We strive to apply the highest standards to ensure full regulatory compliance with zero fines or sanctions incurred.  

Practices

In fY2019, China Kunda continued to take our compliance responsibilities by:

•	 Setting up compliance cultures and sound compliance management systems to avoid risks on non-compliance 

behaviours.

•	 Communicating compliance regulations/standards to all employees and including compliance rules in our 

employee handbook. employees are required to sign a declaration form, agreeing to comply with the rules, repeated 

offenders will receive severe penalties or dismissal from their job. 

•	 Utilising compliance management system to guide our senior management’s actions to minimize non-

compliance risk.

•	 Having the core team to review, monitor, and respond in real-time to any non-compliance issues.

Grievance mechanism

our grievance handling process allows a clear, fair and easily-accessible approach for our stakeholders. We 

encourage all our stakeholders to raise any issues they encounter. We have established a whistle-blowing policy 

which seeks to provide a channel for the employees and any other persons to raise concerns in good faith and 

in confidence about possible improprieties in matters or financial reporting or other matters such as possible 

corruption, suspected fraud and other non-compliance issues. figure 12 illustrates our grievance mechanism.

It is crucial for a modern enterprise to adapt to the ever-changing business market, especially when we face a 

dramatically shortened product replacement cycle in our industry. It requires the corporate to constantly enhance 

our capability in technology and innovation. therefore, in China Kunda, we place innovation and R&amp;D as our core 

competitive advantage position to drive sustainable development. 

Policies

We benefit our markets by meeting our end-customers’ demands and reducing costs. Innovation and R&amp;D play an 

important role in expanding our number of customers, lowering manufacturing cost and positioning ourselves to 

benefit from state policies. 

In fY2019, we continued the Innovation Incentive Policy in technology Development to reward innovative projects. any 

project proposed to receive an incentive is reviewed and approved by our core team and technical Director. 

With key decisive factors such as market influence, projected production level and final output in mind, the policy has 

been reviewed in fY2019 and is summarized as follows (figure 14):

economic conditions and weakening demand, our pace on innovation and R&amp;D slowed down and failed to meet our 

target at the end of this reporting year.

enVIRonment

In recent years, supply shortages and the surging price of industrial raw materials emphasis the importance of 

operation management on the materials used in production processes. China Kunda believes that proper use of 

raw materials can greatly reduce costs and improve economic efficiency. to achieve this, we track our use of raw 

materials on a regular basis. In fY2019, SeJ did not produce any goods. therefore, disclosure of material use is only 

relevant to KPe.

Practice

China Kunda monitors the consumption of renewable and non-renewable materials for the purpose of optimising our 

manufacturing processes. apart from that, we have implemented an incentive system to reward employees for their 

performance in managing the company’s resources based on their ability to reduce overall material cost ratio.

Performance

In the previous year, China Kunda decreased raw material cost ratio to 43%. We continued our efforts to optimise 

production processes and achieved our 41% target in fY2019.

figure 16: fY2019 China Kunda Material Use Performance

FY2019 Performance

FY2020 target

•	Decrease raw material cost ratio to 

41% by fY2019

•	41% achieved

•	Maintain current performance and keep 

improving

In fY2019, our total consumption of non-renewable materials declined by 11.5%, falling from 570,066kg to 504,401kg. 

our usage of plastic pellet, paint, and protective film has decreased significantly as shown in figure 17 below. this 

was in tandem with the decrease in production volume in fY2019. total renewable material consumption (mainly from 

cardboard) also declined from 16,396 pieces in fY2018 to 14,492 pieces in fY2019, a decrease of almost 11.6%. 

Moreover, in fY2019, we continued our resources recycling practices and recycled 33.9% (4,910 pieces out of 14,492 

pieces) of cardboard, an increase from 3.8% in fY2018 (630 pieces out of 16,396 pieces). Part of reasons behind the 

increase is attributed to improved data collection.

employees are an important component of China Kunda’s sustainable development. training and advancement can 

instill sense of belonging to the company and is beneficial for employees’ personal growth as well. Proper training and 

advancement will enable us to gain more competitive advantages.

Practice

China Kunda is committed to training for all employees. our Human Resource Department conducts mandatory 

orientation workshops on production safety, mechanical operation, craftsmanship and product quality requirements 

for new hires to achieve seamless integration to our company culture. In addition, career planning sessions based on 

the results from regular employee performance assessments are conducted to align employees’ performance with 

company’s plans.

China Kunda also provides subsidies to our employees who seek to upgrade their education and skills. a training 

institution has been set up to regulate the management oftraining subsidies. an incentive system is also put in place 

to reward employees that have excellent performance in training sections.

Case study 1: training activity in SeJ

In april 2019, SeJ organized a sharing meeting to guide our employees on how to improve our business’s 

competitiveness by providing better services. the meeting emphasized the importance of customer satisfaction, self-

improvement, holistic service, and our relationships with our stakeholders. 

through this meeting, everyone had a chance to understand the direction of SeJ’s development and improve 

themselves by contributing to SeJ’s future operations.

Performance

 

 figure 24: fY2019 China Kunda training and advancement Performance

In fY2019, we increased the average training hours for non-managerial employees. our total training hours increased 

by 3.3% from 600 hours in fY2018 to 620 hours in fY2019. Due to more managerial skill courses arranged, average 

training hours of 37.3 hours for managerial roles is more than average training hours of 1.7 hours for non-managerial 

roles during fY2019. the decrease in average training hours for managerial roles was because the training provided 

previously are considered still relevant and re-training is not required.In fY2017, fY2018 and fY2019, 100% percent 

of employees received regular performance and career development reviews.
