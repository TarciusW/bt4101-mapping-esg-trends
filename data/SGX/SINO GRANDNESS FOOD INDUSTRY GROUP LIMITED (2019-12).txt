SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

BOARD 



STATEMENT



This year has been beset with challenges, with the ongoing 

trade war between the People’s Republic of China and 

the United States of America as well as the outbreak of 

a global pandemic. In many ways, these challenges have 

emphasised the importance of viewing long-term business 

success through a more holistic lens. We are reminded of 

the importance of sustained risk management and early 

planning, as well as rapid but systematic responses to 

arising crises. 

In particular, the Covid-19 pandemic has shown how the 

performance of the Group is intrinsically linked to social 

issues, with the health of the Group predicated on the 

health and safety of our employees, local communities and 

other key stakeholders. It is in this vein that Sino Grandness 

reinforces our commitment to a people-centric approach to 

our business decisions and operations. 

Even as Sino Grandness pays close attention to the 

pandemic and concomitant economic impacts, we have 

not lost sight of the need to address the ongoing climate 

crisis. The impacts of climate change are already visible, 

with more intense and frequent extreme weather events 

observed across the world, and it is expected to have 

manifold direct and indirect impacts on food supply chains. 

Climate risks are business risks, and we intend to gradually 

strengthen our response to climate change in the coming 

years. This is in line with the heightened ambition exhibited 

by Chinese government, who enhanced its climate targets 

this year to set a goal of reaching net zero emissions by 

2060. The Group will continue to pay close attention to the 

government’s sustainable development and low-carbon 

strategy and ensure our compliance with evolving laws and 

regulations, in order to support its overarching vision of a 

carbon neutral economy.

SINO GRANDNESS FOOD INDUSTRY GROUP LIMITED

Sino Grandness’ Board of Directors takes sustainability issues in consideration as part of its strategic formulation and 

reviews management performance. To assist the Board of Directors in carrying out its principal functions, the Board of 

Directors is supported by the Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee and Remuneration Committee.

The Group’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy continues to guide the review of the Group’s policies, 

standards and impacts with regard to environmental and social issues, as well as key stakeholders such as regulators, 

suppliers, customers and employees.

The Group’s subsidiary, Garden Fresh Group, is a member of Shenzhen Agriculture Industrialization Association. Sino 

Grandness’ canned products are compliant with international standards, including the Hazard Analysis and Critical 

Control Point (“HACCP”) food safety system, British Retail Consortium (“BRC”), International Food Standard (“IFS”) 

and International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) certifications. With these qualifications, the Group’s canned 

products can be exported to overseas customers including the European Union, which has strict environmental and 

food safety import requirements for food products.

As a key in the management of Sino Grandness, stakeholder  participation helps the Group review potential risks and 

business opportunities. Communicating with our stakeholders and understanding their views allow the Group to better 

fulfil their needs and manage their expectations through our business practices.

The Group constantly communicates with our key internal and external stakeholders through various channels. This 

ensures that our stakeholders have the opportunity to learn about the Group’s progress and operational direction. It 

also offers the Group the chance to listen to their views in order to identify material issues and respond accordingly. 

The table below outlines the various communication channels that the Group uses to engage with different groups of 

stakeholders. In light of the pandemic, all face-to-face meetings and related activities observed the Group’s Covid-19 

health and safety protocols, or were conducted on digital platforms.

06

SINO GRANDNESS FOOD INDUSTRY GROUP LIMITED

The Group has identified the following risks and opportunities based on the material topics identified for the reporting year.

SUSTAINABILITY RISKS 



AND OPPORTUNITIES



RISKS

RESPONSES/ OPPORTUNITIES

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND 

SAFETY RISKS

Without proper management, workers 

at production facilities may be exposed 

to occupational hazards ranging from 

operation of machines to use of chemicals, 

compromising employee wellbeing and 

productivity. In addition, highly-transmissible 

infectious diseases such as Covid-19 pose 

major health risks to our employees.

HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS

The Group’s Safety and Environmental Department oversees 

the identification of safety hazards and implementation of safety 

inspection, accident investigation and mitigation measures. Safety 

guidelines and training are also provided to employees.

BREACHES OF CUSTOMER PRIVACY

Customer privacy and data management 

has become an increasing priority among 

companies worldwide. Data breaches can 

result in erosion of customer trust and brand 

reputation.

DATA PROTECTION MEASURES

The Group continues to enhance data our governance to safeguard 

our customer data it collects from customers and suppliers in our 

business activities.

PRODUCT SAFETY RISKS

The Group is subject to laws and regulations 

concerning product safety across the markets 

we serve. Non-compliance with regulatory 

standards may result in lengthy litigation, 

monetary and non-monetary sanctions, and 

threaten our business reputation.

PRODUCT QUALITY CONTROL

The Group’s Procurement Department and Quality Control 

Department, among others, are responsible for monitoring product 

quality according to our policies and procedures. For instance, the 

“Quality and Safety Management Manual” was introduced to educate 

employees on proper hygiene compliance according to prevailing 

regulations, and to guide them in identifying and mitigating food safety 

risks. In addition, the Group has in a place an “Unsafe Food Recall 

Management System” which involves reporting any cases of food 

safety risks to local regulatory agencies and recalling the products.

DIFFICULTIES IN TALENT 

ATTRACTION AND RETENTION

Recruiting and retaining qualified and 

highly-skilled employees remains an ongoing 

challenge in the manufacturing industry.

TALENT ATTRACTION AND DEVELOPMENT

A fair employment system which promotes learning and development 

opportunities are key to building and maintaining an engaged and 

skilled workforce. In line with the Group’s policies on employee 

training and development, our management team identifies training 

needs, formulates training plans and evaluates training effectiveness 

on an annual basis. We also encourage our employees to participate 

in external training courses for career development.


07

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

SUSTAINABILITY RISKS 



AND OPPORTUNITIES



RISKS

RESPONSES/ OPPORTUNITIES

EMPLOYMENT MALPRACTICE

Employment malpractice, such as 

discrimination, harassment, child labour and 

forced labour, and accompanying negative 

publicity can undermine employee morale, 

customer trust and business reputation. 

Non-compliance with the relevant laws and 

regulations may cause businesses to suffer 

from lengthy litigations, monetary sanctions 

and reputational losses.

COMPLIANCE AND ETHICAL PRACTICES

The Group is aware of our obligation to comply with applicable 

regulatory requirements. We are considering setting up an active 

monitoring system to observe changing social norms, legal 

requirements, and administrative regulations in different areas of 

operations. Our Board of Directors will continue to take sustainability 

issues into consideration as part of their strategic formulation, so as to 

provide timely responses to changing needs of the stakeholders and 

local communities, and to ensure that the Group conducts activities in 

a socially responsible manner.

ENVIRONMENTAL 

CONTAMINATION

The Group is subject to laws and regulations

concerning water and effluents. Taking into 

account its business nature, the Group 

operates with a latent risk of contaminating 

our surrounding environment and 

communities. Environmental non-compliance 

may result in monetary and non-monetary 

sanctions, as well as reputational losses. 

Tightening regulatory controls also entail 

investments in cleaner production process 

and effective treatment of effluent and waste.

POLLUTION CONTROL SYSTEM

The Group has been proactively managing the environmental 

impacts of our production. We ensure the quality of our effluents is 

in compliance with prevailing regulatory requirements through on-

going monitoring and third-party testing. In addition to articulating 

an emergency response plan, the Group maintains an open line of 

communication with the communities in which we operate.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions 

from manufacturing facilities constitute a 

significant source of physical and transition 

risk to current and future operations. Shifting 

weather patterns and extreme weather 

events could lead to decreased productivity 

and higher cost of raw materials. Tightening 

regulatory standards on GHG emissions 

or the introduction of carbon tax may pose 

regulatory risks to the Group, especially given 

the heightened climate ambitions exhibited by 

governments around the world.

EMISSIONS MANAGEMENT

Given that energy use is the primary source of the Group’s GHG 

emissions, we aim to gradually enhance energy efficiency to reduce 

our operating costs and GHG emissions. The Group will also consider 

the adoption of new energy sources for our operations, and tap on 

policy incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy.


08

SINO GRANDNESS FOOD INDUSTRY GROUP LIMITED

Occupational Health and Safety

Sino Grandness strives to provide a safe workplace for employees. To this end, the Group has established the 

Occupational Health and Safety Responsibilities Regime. The regime defines the roles and responsibilities of different 

employment functions and levels of management across the Group. To promote a safe work environment, the Group 

has also set up in-house safety rules. We aim to gradually improve our occupational health and safety system such that 

it covers all potential occupational health and safety hazards through the incorporation of relevant control measures. 

The Group’s Safety and Environmental Department is responsible for communicating national safety regulations, 

guidelines, codes of conduct, among others, to the relevant departments across the Group. The department is also 

responsible for identifying sources of safety hazards, formulating safety rules, conducting regular safety inspections 

and training, performing accident investigations and proposing mitigation measures, and overseeing the delivery of 

personal protective equipment.

In the reporting year, Sino Grandness did not hire workers who are not employees but whose work and/or workplace 

is controlled by Sino Grandness. The total number of hours of work recorded at the Shenzhen and Hubei facilities were 

396,000 and 91,650 respectively.

CUSTOMER PRIVACY

Sino Grandness acknowledges the importance of protecting the data privacy of its customers, including the distributors of 

the Group’s beverage, canned fruit and canned vegetable products. Sino Grandness has established relevant procedures 

in the Employee Handbook to emphasise the operational practices pertaining to the use and handling of confidential 

information. Employees are required to abide by standard practices of non-disclosure at work and refrain from disclosing 

confidential information in personal interactions or public events.

Some of our customer privacy protection measures have been highlighted below:

• 

Upgrading the Group’s computer and internet security systems to reduce the risks of data leakage;

• 

Assigning designated employees to establish, distribute, use, copy, extract, store and dispose confidential information 

with the Chairperson’s oversight. Designated employees must store confidential information in secured mediums when 

distributing or transporting the data within or outside the Group;

• 

Conducting training programs to enhance employees’ awareness in protecting customer information; and

• 

Setting up a penalty regime for potential or actual data leakages depending on the nature of data and the economic 

impact on the Group.

In case of suspected data leakage, employees are expected to take mitigation measures and report the suspected leak-

age to the Human Resources and Administration Department. In cases where the Group does not experience significant 

impact or economic loss and mitigation measures are effectively implemented, the Group will issue a warning to the 

violator or impose a financial penalty.

In cases where the Group experiences significant impact or economic loss due to the data leakage, such as incidents of 

data theft or abuses of authority which violate confidentiality, possible actions include dismissal, request of compensa-

tion comparable to the losses of the Group, or filing a report to the relevant authorities.

There were no substantiated complaints pertaining to breaches of customer privacy in the reporting year.

The Group’s only office operation is located at Sino Grandness’ headquarters in Shenzhen while our operational 

unit at Hubei has a manufacturing facility. Water consumption at Shenzhen is for sanitary usage only, whereas water 

consumed at Hubei is for sanitary usage, drinking and consumption. Water is used in the production line for ingredients 

cleaning, routine cleaning and the production of drink products.

In the reporting year, our Hubei facility consumed 284.3ML of freshwater, which was sourced from local public utilities. 

Effluents produced by the Shenzhen office were directly discharged into the communal sewerage system, while 

effluents of all types produced by our Hubei operations were treated in the onsite wastewater treatment plant before 

their discharge into the communal sewerage system.

None of the water sourced by the Group for the reporting boundary was from water-stressed areas.

In the reporting year, the Group did not identify any cases of non-compliance with laws and regulations with regard to 

water and effluents. Our activities complied with the “National Environmental Protection Law (国家环境保护法)”.
