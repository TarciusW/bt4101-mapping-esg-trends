materiality aSSeSSment 

Tiong Woon identifies material sustainability matters as matters that have significant impacts on the Group, our key 

stakeholders and our external environment. In prioritising the sustainability matters, we conducted a formal materiality 

assessment workshop in December 2018 with the assistance of an independent sustainability consultant. We adopt a 

four-step materiality assessment process in Figure 5 below. A total of four material sustainability matters and three other 

sustainability matters are identified through this assessment. We will continue to review the material sustainability matters 

on an annual basis to ensure relevance to our business.

Corporate governanCe

Apart from being a mandatory requirement for SGX-listed companies, upholding high standards of corporate governance, 

ensuring the sustainability of our business, and maximising the value of our stakeholders are of great importance to

corporate governance is reflected across Tiong Woon’s operations and in our interactions with suppliers and customers.

Corporate Governance Policies and Initiatives

Tiong Woon strives to sustain a business that strictly adheres to the most efficient and compliant of corporate 

governance practices. Hence, over the years, our Group established specific policies and procedures that help align its

Creating 

SuStainable growth

eConomiC performanCe

Economic performance is imperative for the Group. Ensuring continued sustainable growth remains a key focus by the 

Group. In Tiong Woon, we constantly look for new opportunities to grow our business and provide positive financial 

returns to all our shareholders. We also recognise our role as a key player in developing the local economy. Our economic 

footprint has direct and indirect impacts to the countries where we operate in.

Economic Performance Policies and Initiatives

We recognise the importance to stay ahead of the competition by responding effectively to the challenging business 

environment. By focusing more on its core business, the Group is able to consolidate its resources and streamline its 

businesses to stay competitive in the industry.

To explore new business opportunities, the Group strives to venture its business into new markets. This provides avenues 

to gain market share and increase revenues. With the Group’s global network and business presence, Tiong Woon 

remains focused to drive growth, improve profitability and enhance stakeholders’ value. 

Economic Targets and Performance

In Fy2019, the Group’s economic value generated1 amounted to $117.2 million as compared to $97.7 million in the 

previous year. The growth was due to improved market conditions and our efforts taken to focus on our core business. 

Despite challenging and competitive business environment, the Group will continue to upgrade its fleets’ capacity and 

explore ways to be more efficient by providing integrated solutions for its clients. Tiong Woon is committed to create 

and distribute economic value across our operations. A total of $113.7 million of economic value was distributed2 

through various forms including taxes to the government, purchases from suppliers, compensations to employees and 

investments to communities. This represents a 15% increase in economic value distributed between Fy2018 and Fy2019.

Full details of the Group’s financial information can be found in Annual Report Fy2019.

Case Study: Tiong Woon Corporate Social Responsibility

corporate citizenship. In Fy2019, Tiong Woon conducted 

our long-standing corporate responsibility programmes 

through several key initiatives. We expanded our ‘TWC 

Green Initiatives’ programme by carrying out tree planting 

activities within our company premises. In addition, we 

organised performances and games for the older folks 

and made contributions to Ren Ci nursing Home. We also

Health and Safety Policies and Procedures

It is important to provide a safe and healthy environment for our employees. A conducive working environment will not 

only boost employees’ morale but also increase the overall workforce’s productivity and efficiency. Additionally, breaches 

in safety can result in a diminished ability for the Group to provide high quality of services to our client which have a 

material value on our economic performance. 

Tiong Woon establishes a group level Health, Safety and Environment (“HSE”) Policy which undergoes an annual review. 

We have also attained an Occupational Health and Safety Assessment System 18001:2007 and bizSAFE level Star 

certifications, reflecting our strong commitment in providing a safe working environment for all employees. 

For our marine operation, we have a separate Quality, Health, Safety and Environment (“QHSE”) Policy and QHSE 

Management System to address safety hazards at sea. Our employees are required to obtain all necessary certifications 

such as ship firefighting and piracy mitigation prior to work assignment to ensure they are well equipped to work in risky 

maritime operations. Our system is compliant with local and international maritime law.

To monitor and track HSE performance as well as to oversee the implementation of HSE programmes, a dedicated HSE 

committee has been set up at the group-level. This committee consists of representatives from the Group’s subsidiaries 

and projects. 

Regular safety programmes such as regular toolbox meetings, campaigns, and emergency fire drills are conducted 

throughout the year. A safety training matrix has been maintained to ensure that relevant employees are equipped with 

essential safety skills and knowledge. Tiong Woon also organises bi-monthly management walkabouts to monitor and 

assess any safety-related hazards. 

Independent audit is performed on regular basis to evaluate the effectiveness of our policies and management system. 

We have also undertaken several internal audits at our operations in Singapore during this reporting period.

Health and Safety Targets and Performance

Our health and safety performance report is prepared annually and in accordance with calendar year to align with the 

reporting requirement to the Ministry of Manpower Singapore. For sustainability reporting purpose, we have also provided 

an interim health and safety performance data from January to June 2019 to provide insight on the most recent health 

and safety performance.

Despite our efforts in maintaining a safe working environment for our workers, we encountered 3 cases of injuries 

between January to June 2019. This was a reduction compared to the 9 cases which occurred between January to June 

2018. Based on incident investigation, it was due to the improper use of tools that resulted in injuries. upon receipt of 

information about these injuries, a work time-out was ordered to investigate the cause of the injuries. To prevent the 

re-occurrence of injuries resulting from improper use of tools, a safe work procedure and risk assessment briefing was 

conducted for the employees working with the said tools.

We recorded an overall injury rate of 9.2 in 2018 and 2.5 in the first half of 2019. The detail of our HSE performance is 

presented in Figure 11 below.

Case Study: Promoting Safe Work Culture 

Through regular safety events and training, we strengthen the safety culture in the Group by reinforcing the 

importance of workers’ compliance with our HSE policies and safe work procedures and equipping them with the 

right skills and expertise to perform their jobs safely.

 





Crane Safety Campaigns

In collaboration with Shell, we conducted Crane Safety 

Campaign at Pulau Bukom facility in June 2019. The campaign 

raised workers’ awareness on the safety risks associated 

with the lifting of crane counterweights onto the trailer. It 

was supplemented with a live demonstration on safe work 

procedures to prevent potential incidents and injuries from the 

activity.

 

In-house Mobile Crane Simulator Training

In Fy2019, we conducted in-house simulator training for our mobile crane 

operators. The training included simulations on handling different cargoes 

and lifting gears, assessing safety hazards, as well as handling multiple 

emergency scenarios. The training enables us to develop our operators’ 

technical capabilities while at the same time prevent incidents and injuries 

that may occur from training on the real crane.

Talent Development Policies and Procedures

Our people are our greatest assets. A well-trained workforce plays a key role in distinguishing our services from the 

competition. Tiong Woon is committed to investing the professional development of our employees to ensure they can 

contribute to the long-term success of the Group. 

The Group has established several in-house and external training programmes. In addition to the focus on safety 

procedures, these training programmes cover soft skills such as customer service training and technical training on our 

products. For new joiners or less experienced workers, Tiong Woon also provides mentorship programmes to help them 

accelerate their learning process.

Annual performance appraisals are conducted to assess employees’ performance. A face-to-face meeting will be held 

between employees and their respective head of departments to discuss their job performance, including the areas of 

responsibilities and improvements. This process is guided by the performance management procedure adopted by the 

Group. 

Training Target and Performance

In Fy2019, the Group recorded a total of 6,926 training hours, averaging 10.1 training hours per employee. The 

breakdown of average training hours by employee category7 is presented in Figure 12 below.

employee well-Being

We believe that there is a direct correlation between employee retention and enhanced productivity. As such, the Group 

takes extensive steps towards ensuring the overall health and well-being of our workforce and providing competitive 

employment benefits.

Employee Well-Being Policies and Initiatives

Our employment benefits and welfare are outlined in the Group’s Human Resources manual. All employees are covered 

with health care benefits such as hospitalisation and surgical insurance plan, critical illness insurance plan, medical 

care and dental care. Personal Accident Insurance Policy and Workmen Compensation Policies with disability/invalidity 

coverage are also provided. All our staffs are entitled to various leaves such as annual, childcare, compassionate, 

marriage and examination leaves.

To promote the overall well-being of our employees and raise awareness on the topic, Tiong Woon has set up a fitness 

and wellness club which organises various recreation activities. Employees can exercise regularly at our gym facilities and 

class studios. In addition, a recreation lounge with karaoke system is created for employees to relax and promote team 

bonding.

Employee Engagement

The continuous and direct engagement is our key strategy towards improving the employees’ satisfaction. In 2019, the 

Group conducted employee surveys that covered a wide range of area of concerns, including team work, information 

sharing, relationship with superior, work and life balance, job passion and fairness at work. The Group also conducts 

town hall biannually to share with employees on the result of these surveys and progress on management action plan to 

address the feedbacks.

The Group organised a separate employee engagement session for our employees working at Pulau Bukom due to the 

remote location. The session focused on understanding any issues that have a direct impact of their well-being while 

working on the island. One of the initiatives resulted from this discussion was the replacement of water filters to improve 

the quality of drinking water for our employees at the island. Besides collecting timely feedback on quality of working 

environment, the engagement encouraged open communication where all concerns would be heard and acted upon.

energy effiCienCy and greenhouSe gaS (“ghg”) emiSSionS

Energy efficiency plays a key role in our effort in reducing our environmental footprint. It also contributes to the 

profitability of the Group by lowering our operating costs. Tiong Woon embarks on a phased approach to manage our 

energy consumption and environmental impacts.

Energy Efficiency Policies and Initiatives

The Group’s energy consumption includes the usage of diesel and Marine Gas Oil (“MGO”) for fuel as well as electricity 

from the grid.

The fuel consumption is for heavy lift and haulage equipment, tugboats, barges, and other supporting vehicles. The 

electricity consumption covers usage at our Singapore properties including our tenants’ activities, workshop and offices, 

workers’ dormitory and jetty.

The Group has implemented several initiatives to improve our fuel efficiency such as gradually replacing our equipment 

with Euro 6 diesel engines9, performing regular maintenance to optimise vehicles’ fuel efficiency, switching to more 

environmentally friendly fuels and educating operators on fuel efficiency behaviors. 

To reduce electricity consumption, several meters are installed to give better insight into the consumption patterns 

at the compounds. The input allows our Estate Management Team to track the energy consumption regularly for any 

irregularities. 

Energy Targets and Performance

The Group consumed a total of 61,756 GJ10 of fuel and 1,494 MWh of electricity (5,378 GJ of electrical energy). We saw 

significant reductions on the Group’s direct energy intensity from fuel11 (Figure 19) by 19% from 1.15 MJ per SGD to 0.7 

MJ per SGD. In addition, we saw the direct electrical energy (Figure 20) intensity12 reduced by 11% from 0.0242 kWh per 

SGD to 0.017 kWh per SGD.

Tiong Woon’s fuel consumption and direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions are presented in Figure 19 below. The decrease in 

fuel consumption was the result of a significant decrease in consumption of MGO between Fy2018 and Fy2019. This 

can be attributed to a greater proportion of time charter jobs for our fleet where the purchase of MGO is carried out by 

our clients. As such, fuel use for these jobs are not within our scope. Tiong Woon’s electricity consumption and indirect 

(Scope 2) GHG emissions are presented in Figure 20. The electricity consumption remained steady during this period 

despite the increase in the operational activity of the Group. This is because the Group’s activities are typically conducted 

away from our properties.

Euro 6 refers to engines that have been certified as meeting an emissions standard as defined by the European union (Eu). Euro 6 engines are 5% 

more fuel efficient compared to Euro 5 engines.

10 

The total energy consumption is expressed in Gigajoules (“GJ”), a unit of energy. The energy is derived from the quantity of fuel, density and the net 

calorific value of the specific fuel. net calorific value of diesel is 43 Gigajoules/Tonnes (IPCC 2006). net calorific value of MGO is 42.65 Gigajoules/

Tonnes (Eu 2005).

11 

The direct energy from fuel intensity is calculated by dividing the total direct energy consumption from fuels over the revenue of operations in 

Singapore. The energy intensity is expressed in Megajoules (“MJ”) per SGD. 

12 

The direct electrical energy intensity is calculated by dividing the total electricity consumption over the revenue of operations in Singapore. The direct 

electrical intensity is expressed in kilowatt hour (“kWh”) per SGD.
