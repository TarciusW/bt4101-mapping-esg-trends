1 BOARD STATEMENT 

It gives us great pleasure to present our sustainability report for the financial year ended 

30 June 2019 (“FY2019”), where we highlight the progress and achievements of Boldtek 

Holdings Limited (“Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, “Group”). This sustainability 

report is a testament to our commitment to working alongside our valued stakeholders, and to 

build a sustainable business based on our resilience, adaptability and innovation.  

Our responsibility to society is to ensure that sustainable practices are incorporated into every 

aspect of our business. We strive to meet the needs of not only our customers, suppliers, 

employees and the community we operate in, but also the needs of our environment and our 

future generations.  

This sustainability report provides salient details of how we have fulfilled our responsibilities 

during FY2019. 

2 ABOUT THE REPORT 

This sustainability report articulates our commitment to sustainability and transparency. This

3.2 Governance 

Our Board of Directors (Board) oversees all corporate governance and operational matters 

relating to our business. For corporate sustainability, the Board is supported by the Corporate 

Sustainability Committee (CSC) which comprises Chairperson, Secretariat and a Member. 

CSC provides leadership and approval over corporate sustainability matters such as 

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plan, community investment and environmental 

initiatives. Supported by CSC, the Secretariat is our Governance Support Officer (GSO) in the 

area of corporate sustainability, and pro-actively raises awareness through education and 

training across the organisation. Through the Corporate Sustainability Work Group (CSWG), 

our GSO engages businesses and functions in collectively executing the CSR plan, identifying 

and managing the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors as well as engaging 

stakeholders. Businesses and functions provide back-to-back assurance over the quality of 

information for sustainability reporting.  

 

3.3 Ethics and Compliance 

Being a listed company in the Singapore Exchange (SGX), we are managed to the highest 

standards of corporate governance as required in the listing rules. We strictly conform to local 

and international best practices. Our corporate governance framework covers ethics and 

compliance through a Code of Conduct as well as action guidelines which are to be adhered 

by the officers and employees across the organisation. Every new employee is introduced to 

our Code of Conduct and our policies on ethics and compliances. Communication channels, 

such as Whistle-Blower and Board escalation process, are in place to enable all employees 

and individuals engaged in business activities to report complaints of unethical behaviour. We 

have a dedicated officer who maintains a register of incidences regarding ethics and 

compliance issues and escalates to the management where appropriate.

4 INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR BUSINESS 

CSR is pragmatically integrated into our business practices as one of the core values in our 

corporate culture. Embedding such responsibility into our management processes across the 

value chain allows us to establish credibility among our stakeholders. Through our actions 

today, we play a part in influencing the environment for our future generations. Through 

integrating the notion of sustainability in our business, we ensure that our business strategy 

and operations are in line with a long-term vision towards a conducive and sustainability future. 

4.1 Sustainability Management Framework 

In July 2017, we took the initiative to establish our sustainability reporting framework. We 

performed an analysis of our business and operation models as the basis for our stakeholder 

mapping and materiality assessment. Based on our analysis, we identified five key stakeholder 

groups within our sustainability context and their respective material issues, details of which 

are provided in this report. 

4.2 Key Stakeholders and Material Issues 

We have a regular review, assessment and feedback process in relation to Environmental, 

Social and Governance (ESG) topics. Key to this is our regular Risk Assessment and Control 

Self-Assessment exercise which entails the identification, assessment and documentation of 

material risks and corresponding internal controls. Such material risks include fraud and 

corruption, environmental, health and safety, and human capital risks which are ESG-relevant. 

We are continuously improving the adequacy and effectiveness of our Risk Assessment and 

Control Self-Assessment processes in response to changing business and operation 

environment. 

Through regular stakeholder engagement, we identify and review material issues that are most 

relevant and significant to us and our stakeholders. Considering that stakeholders and material 

issues are country-specific, we are reporting the stakeholder engagement and material issues 

for our Singapore operations in this report.

5.1 Protecting Our Environment for the Future Generations 

5.1.1 Our Approach 

We are committed to comply with the environmental policies and standards. We continually 

seek new and innovative ways to reduce the environmental impact of our products and 

services while maintaining the highest levels of quality. We recognize our responsibility to 

protect the environment for the health and wellbeing of future generations.  

5.1.2 Reduction of Carbon Footprint 

We recognize that the effective management and monitoring of its carbon footprint can reduce 

operating costs, raise brand profile, create a competitive edge and increase stakeholder value. 

Our carbon footprint is measured in terms of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission. However, 

GHG emission is an absolute measure of how much carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is 

emitted. Our GHG emission is predominantly indirect (Scope 2) emission. We have 

insignificant direct (Scope 1) emission, and we do not include the GHG emissions generated 

by our suppliers (Scope 3). 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our GHG 

emission efficiency index for consistent tracking of carbon footprint over time. To this end, we 

have set a target for GHG emission efficiency improvement of 10% from our 2018 level by 

2030. Our target for GHG emission improvement is 0.83% per year. Although various business 

lines and operations account for different percentage of GHG emissions across the 

organisation, they all support this target and have aligned our environmental objectives 

accordingly.  

5.1.3 Reduction of Paper Consumption 

We consume paper which are environmentally certified such as Forest Stewardship Council 

(FSC) certified, made from KHAN-NA etc.  

All our employees are encouraged to minimise paper wastage at work. For example, lower 

gram paper is used for daily printing, blank sides of unneeded single-sided copies are used 

for printing drafts, adoption of digital documents instead of paper documents etc. 

Considering the changes and dynamics of business and operations, we established our paper 

consumption index for consistent tracking of paper consumption over time. To this end, we 

have set a target for a paper consumption improvement of 10% from our 2018 level by 2030. 

Our target for paper consumption improvement is 0.83% per year.  Although various business 

lines and operations account for different percentage of paper consumption across the 

organization, they all support this target and have aligned our environmental objectives 

accordingly.  

 

 


 

 

Sustainability Report

5.1.4 Promoting Green Practices  

We have embraced various green practices in our business and operation such as New Soil 

Technologies, ISO 14001, and Green and Gracious Builder Award (Excellent) was presented 

to a Singapore subsidiary of the Group by Building &amp; Construction Authority (BCA). 

The ISO 14000 family of standards provides practical tools for companies and organisations 

of all kinds looking to manage their environmental responsibilities. ISO 14001:2015 sets out 

the criteria for an environmental management system and can be certified to. It can be used 

by any organisation regardless of its activity or sector. Using ISO 14001:2015 provides 

assurance to our management and employees as well as external stakeholders that 

environmental impact is being measured and improved. 

BCA launched the Green and Gracious Builder Scheme in February 2009 to raise the 

environmental consciousness and professionalism of builders. It is also a benchmark of a 

builder’s CSR to the environment and the general public. Apart from setting standards for 

green practices, it also sets standards for gracious practices. These gracious practices will 

improve the image of the builders and construction industry. 

New Soil Technologies (NewSoil) converts excavated soft clay into local formulated dry 

cementitious soil stabilizer as an alternative source of material for reclamation fill and road 

works. NewSoil is a combination of in-situ marine clay, extracted from excavation, with 

formulated additive. Each individual soil batch is carefully formulated based on the in-situ soil 

properties, before being conditioned for each and every project so as to meet the specific 

requirement and need. In short, it is a clear-cut solution for un-usable in-situ soil by converting 

it into NewSoil. 

NewSoil is primarily an alternative source of Hard-core Aggregates. Furthermore, this 

technology can be employed effectively to harden any kinds of soil for use as Temporary 

Pavement in most construction sites. Therefore, this formula of turning unwanted raw 

materials into a usable product can eventually be applied in converting unwanted Marine Clay 

into usable hard-core aggregates as sub base, which acts as a stable processing of soft 

foundation for most road construction works. Lastly, conversion to engineered soil can also 

reduce all cost involved in marine clay disposal, which can be a form of cost savings in view 

of the limited available disposal sites. 

Application of NewSoil 

 

Temp Access Road   

Backfill Application  

 

Alternate Hardcore Source 

 

Other environmental benefits include:  

• 

Facilitates reduction in energy usage (by eliminating reliance on vehicular 

transportation for disposal activities)  




 

 

Sustainability Report  



Page 12 of 24 



•  

Encourages sustainable construction approach through material reuse/recycle usage 

(with a depleting natural resource in mind)  

•  

Reduces potential environmental impact (caused to our ecosystem by typical sea 

reclamation works)  

•  

Provides almost 20 percent cost savings as compared to high cost incurred using 

existing unwanted soil/marine clay disposal ways  

•  

Eliminates the need for marine clay disposal sites  

5.2 Caring for Our Employees 

5.2.1 Our Approach 

Our people are our most valuable resource and investing in their professional and personal 

well-being is vital to our business sustainability. Our goal is to instill a strong work ethic among 

our employees, which are in line with our core values and Code of Conduct. They are the 

foundation upon which we build all our business initiatives and conduct our day-to-day 

activities.  

We recognised that a motivated workforce will convey a positive and powerful message to all 

our key stakeholders, such as our customers, suppliers and members of the community. By 

attracting, nurturing, empowering and rewarding our employees, we create an environment 

conducive for innovation and inspiration flourish to further boost our competitiveness. Such 

commitment to our employees promotes a corporate culture of passion, quality, excellence 

and trust within the organisation which will translate to our ability to create value for our 

stakeholders. 

Our Human Resource (HR) management principles and policies have been developed and 

established based on fair employment practices with the goal of attracting, supporting and 

maintaining a motivated workforce. Our HR policies cover key areas such as remuneration, 

benefits, health and safety, career development and training.  

Our business operates in an environment which comprises diverse races, cultures and 

geographic locations. With this in mind, our HR polices are implemented across the 

organisation within the principles with pragmatism, taking into consideration of the prevailing 

laws and regulations as well as local culture, norms and racial sensitivity. 

5.2.2 Employment Practices 

Our employment practices focus on maximising the strength of our employees by providing 

equal opportunities based on merits, and help our employees to develop strength through our 

comprehensive training and development programme. We regularly review the performance 

and development of our employees to effectively match their strength to their job specifications. 

Our performance-based reward scheme provides guidance and motivation to our employee 

to perform to their potentials in alignment with the objectives of the Group. 

5.2.2.1 The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices  

We proactively pursue and adopt best practices in HR management. Our HR practices are 

guided by the Singapore Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. 

The Singapore Tripartite Alliance comprises the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore National 

Employers Federation and National Trades Union Congress. The Tripartite Alliance has 

formulated guidelines on fair employment practice for adoption by Singapore employers, 

embracing the recruitment, training, treatment and reward of employees.  


 

 

Sustainability Report  



Page 13 of 24 



5.2.2.2 Communications  

As our Group grows, effective communications across the organisation are crucial to ensure 

continuous alignment of objectives of the employees and the organisational objectives. We 

achieve this through our various communication sessions customized based on target 

employees. Communication sessions for our managers are held on a regular basis. Agendas 

covered at these sessions are customized, in line with the target functional scope of the 

managers. For example, in monthly managers’ meeting, operational agendas such as 

leadership and operation issues may be discussed while quarterly sessions are for 

discussions on high level topics include strategic business directions, ongoing developments 

and key project reviews.  

5.2.2.3 Employee Feedback  

We value our employee’s expertise in their areas of responsibilities. Therefore, their feedbacks 

are important in the improvement of overall management and operation of the organization. 

Through various established processes of employee engagement, such as employee 

objective setting, performance review as well as exit interview in the case of resignations, we 

gather such valuable feedbacks for the continuous improvement of our organisation. 

In addition, there are other feedback channels for areas specific to business and function, 

such as health and safety issues and compliance issues. Such feedbacks are managed by 

the leaders and managers of their specific business and function domain. We have also 

established reporting and escalation channel should the feedback requirements the attention 

of higher management. 

5.2.2.4 Career Development and Training 

We recognized that consistent and ongoing education is critical to maintaining a competitive, 

skilled, productive and motivated workforce. Employee career development and performance 

management established based on merits and contributing skill sets towards the organisation 

objectives through objective settings and regular performance reviews. We continue to review 

and improve our career development and performance review process in light of the changing 

business and operation environment. 

Our training programme covers a variety of areas catering for employees with difference job 

scopes and skills set requirements. Our core training curriculum and contents are developed 

guided by well-established industry and international standards such as ISO 9001, ISO 14000, 

OHSAS 18001 and bizSAFE Star. In addition, specific training curriculums are developed 

based on the specific requirements of the specific businesses and functions. Training topics 

range from soft skills development in areas such as communications and leadership, to 

technical programmes covering project management and office productivity tools.  

In FY2019, employees each received an average of 5 hours training. We recognised that the 

training requirements vary depending on the levels of management responsibilities. Each 

senior manager registers an average of 8 hours training while managerial and non-managerial 

staffs receive an average of 14 hours and 6 hours of training respectively. In light of changing 

business requirements and opportunities in variety of training methodologies, we continue to 

revise our training curriculum and programme to align with organisation objectives and to strive 

for effectiveness and efficiency in our training approach.

5.2.3 Workforce Diversity 

Our business thrives on diversity. As such, we leverage on a host of strengths and skills that 

can only come from a diverse workforce embracing employees from various ethnic groups, 

religion, age and gender.

In addition to the human resources we managed under our payroll internally, we also engage 

external contracted companies as our outsourced vendors which provide outsourced 

personnel, such as cleaners and security guards who work within our premises. Although we 

supervise these people, they are employed by contracted companies and are not included in 

our head count. We do not employ other types of un-contracted workers. 

We expect all the contracted companies we work with to share our core principles of HR 

management practices. In our vendor selection process, we take into consideration their HR 

management practices as one of the key selections and performance criteria. We regularly 

review the performance of our vendors based on these criteria as a key basis to determine 

whether to continue to engage the vendors for their services. 

5.2.4 Employee Benefits 

Employees in Singapore are covered by the Employment Act, which provides basic 

employment terms and working conditions including contract requirements, remuneration, 

hours of work, overtime, rest days and annual leave entitlement.  

In addition to the statutory benefits outlined in the Employment Act, we provide further benefits 

to our full-time employees. Examples of these benefits include paternity leave and 

compassionate leave.  

5.2.4.1 Work–Life Balance  

While developing the talents of our employees and providing equal opportunities for them to 

excel are the key drivers for the Company, we also recognise that well-being and contentment 

of our employees is pivotal to the success and sustainability of our business and performance. 

Our employees are our most valuable asset, and we appreciate that their overall well-beings 

need to be well looked after in order for them to sustain their performance and realise their full 

potential.  

To support our employees to strike a work-life balance, we aim to create an environment that 

allows our employees to achieve harmony in their personal and professional life. We achieve 

this through the adoption of a flexible approach to work arrangements.  

5.2.4.2 Retirement and Healthcare  

The Group has presence in various geographic locations where there are various local laws 

and regulations on pension and healthcare for employees. Our HR management practices 

comply with such laws and regulations. In Singapore, we participate in the Central Provident 

Fund (CPF) personal savings scheme. Under this scheme, monthly deductions from 

employees’ gross salaries and the Company’s employer contributions (according to rates 

stipulated in the CPF Act) are paid into the employees’ CPF saving accounts. For more 

information on the CPF scheme and contribution rates, please go to www.cpf.gov.sg.  

5.2.5 Safety and Health in the Workplace 

We are committed to Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) and take every precaution to 

prevent occupational injuries among employees. We believe that optimum work conditions not 

only make our employees safer, but it also boosts their morale. As an essential requirement, 

we are in compliance with the Ministry of Manpower’s Workplace Safety &amp; Health Act. In 

addition, we have attained certification for OHSAS 18001 and bizSAFE Star. These well 

recognised standards provide us with the frameworks to manage risks associated with safety 

and health in our workplace.

5.2.6 Individual Rights  

Respecting and protecting basic human rights are fundamental to all our operations. Labour 

rights, the prohibition of discrimination and harassment, protection of privacy, prohibition of 

forced and child labour, and workplace health and safety are all strictly observed within the 

work environment. Accordingly, discrimination and harassment of any kind is not tolerated in 

our Group.  

We also respect our employees’ rights to freedom of association as well as their membership 

with other professional bodies.  

In FY2019, no incidents of forced labour, child labour or young workers were identified across 

the organization, and no human rights-related grievances have been reported. 

5.3 Focusing on Our Customers’ Needs 

5.3.1 Our Approach 

Customer service, quality products and the highest level of product safety have always been 

our priorities, with customer satisfaction being the goal of all our corporate activities. Customer 

retention begins with trust, and we place the utmost importance on training our employees in 

customer service excellence as well as in continuously striving to improve the quality and 

safety of our products and services. 

Open and frequent communication and responsive feedback are ingrained into our daily 

activities with customer interaction. In addition to striving for excellence in product service and 

support, we attach enormous importance to data privacy. We have process and controls in 

place over confidential and sensitive data related to our customers such as contracts. 

We have been certified under the ISO 9001 standard for quality management systems. The 

certification has helped us increase the control of our internal processes and the quality of our 

services.  

5.3.2 Customer Feedback and Satisfaction 

We listen to our customers and take their opinions very seriously. We capture our customers’ 

comments for analysis and action. Customer compliments are also tracked so that we can 

monitor where we are getting things right and cascade positive feedback to our employees, to 

their superiors and to our CEO.  

5.3.3 Service Quality and Safety 

Reliability and quality of our products are of paramount importance to us. Health and safety 

of our customers is always our priority. To ensure product safety to our customers, we have 

in place a set of key quality assurance processes and standards, such ISO 9001, OHSAS 

18001, BizSAFE Star, BCA Green &amp; Gracious, to ensure compliance with regulations and 

international standards. Ultimately, we aim for total elimination of product safety incidents so 

as to foster a ‘Safety First’ culture through employee training and quality control.

5.3.4 Data Safety and Privacy  

Ensuring safety and privacy of our customers’ data is of great priority to us. We have 

processes and controls in place for handling and communicating sensitive and confidential 

information of our customers such as contracts, customer orders and service delivery orders. 

We strictly observe all local laws and internal regulations applicable to personal information 

protection. 

For the collection and disposal of wastepaper, individual is responsible for the shredding all 

papers, including confidential documents. Such practice established within our office provides 

us with the confidence that sensitive information is protected during the whole life cycle of our 

documents. 

5.4 Partnering Our Suppliers 

5.4.1 Our Approach 

We recognise that we are only at the beginning of our journey to integrate sustainable 

business practices throughout our value chain, and we are committed in our pragmatic 

approach to continuous improvement. We aim to identify new opportunities for collaboration 

with our suppliers, gradually increase transparency and continue to build shared capacity to 

minimise our indirect environmental and social impacts. 

5.4.2 Supplier Selection 

Our supplier selection process includes criteria such as financial health, quality of products 

and services, competitiveness of pricing etc. In addition, we also take into consideration of the 

overall sustainability policies adopted by our suppliers. Our final decision on supplier selection 

is based on the overall assessment which takes a balanced view across all selection criteria. 

5.4.3 Supplier Review  

We regularly review the performance of our key suppliers to determine whether to extend our 

partnership with them. During the key supplier review process, we engage with our key 

suppliers to communicate our expectations and mutual feedbacks. Such review process 

ensures alignment of our key suppliers’ services and products to our business requirements 

and sustainability objectives through pragmatic and continuous improvement in our 

partnership with our key suppliers. 

5.5 Supporting Our Community 

5.5.1 Our Approach 

We have been providing support to the communities. To this end, our engagement 

programmes also encompass financial and practical support in carefully selected communities, 

through donation.  

5.5.2 Our Community Initiatives Highlight 

During FY19, the Group had made various donations to selected communities.

6 PERFORMANCE TABLE 

6.1 Energy Usage and CO2 Emissions  

GHG emissions are measured in tonnes (t-CO2); the underlying measures for direct and 

indirect CO2 emissions calculation are electricity consumption in kilowatt Hours (kWh) and fuel 

consumed. The electricity and fuel we purchase are both from non-renewable sources. 

Our business and function grow over time; the GHG emissions and electricity consumption 

vary. To ensure consistency and comparability of the GHG emission and electricity 

consumption measures over time, we create a GHG emission index and electricity 

consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the GHG emissions and 

electricity consumption for the size of our activities. We normalize the amount GHG emissions 

and electricity consumption by the amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the 

size of our activities. The GHG emission index is measured in t-CO2 per SGD million and the 

electricity consumption index is measured in kWh per SGD million.

6.2 Paper Consumption 

We capture the data for paper consumption by how many reams of paper used where one 

ream is equivalent to 500 sheets of paper. To ensure consistency and comparability across 

various paper sizes, such as A3 and A4 papers, we measure the paper consumption by the 

weight of paper used which is adjusted for the various sizes and quality of papers. 

Our business and function grow over time and the paper consumption patterns vary. We 

devise a paper consumption index for our performance monitoring. The index adjusts the 

paper consumption for the size of our activities. We normalise the amount of weights of paper 

consumed by the amount of our revenues which we use as a proxy of the size of our activities. 

The paper consumption index is measured in kilograms per million SGD.
