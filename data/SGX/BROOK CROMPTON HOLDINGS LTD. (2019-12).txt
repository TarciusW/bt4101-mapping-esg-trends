A sustainability policy (“SR Policy”) covering our sustainability strategies, reporting structure, materiality assessment 

and processes in identifying and monitoring material ESG factors has been established and serves as a point of

and update our material ESG factors from time to time, taking into account the feedback that we receive from our 

engagement with our stakeholders, organisational and external developments.

strategy, review our material impacts, consider stakeholder priorities and set goals and targets, as well as collect, 

verify, monitor and report performance data for this Report.

7.2 Sustainability Reporting Processes

Under our SR policy, our sustainability process begins with the identification of relevant factors. Relevant factors are 

then prioritised as material factors which are then validated. The end result of this process is a list of material factors 

disclosed in this Report. A brief description of the processes is shown below:

stakeholders’ feedback and sustainability trends. The details of each material sustainability factor are presented as 

follows:

8.1 Customer Satisfaction 

In line with our mission to develop innovative adaptable and robust product designs, grow our customer partnership 

and service network worldwide, we are committed to provide value to our customers through the following strategies:

Offering reliable and efficient products

We aim to deliver the best to our customers by providing them with reliable and efficient products. 

On product reliability, our products are certified under various internationally recognised quality standards with 

details as follows: 

STANDARD/ 

CERTIFICATION 

AREA

ISO 9001

product defect level diligently and this is measured by the amount of warranty claims made to as a percentage of total 

purchases. During the reporting period, we successfully maintained a product defect rate of less than 1% (FY2018:

With regards to product efficiency, we believe that offering products that are highly efficient helps our customers 

to achieve lower long term cost ownership and also to preserve the environment through lower emissions. Refer to 

Section 8.2 Energy-efficient products for more details.

 

Offer a comprehensive product range that meets customers’ needs

We offer a wide range of electric motors for operations in safe area segments, hazardous atmospheres and hostile 

environments to meet our customers’ varied needs. Refer to our corporate website: http://www.brookcrompton.com/

home.aspx. for a comprehensive list of our products.

Maintain presence and proximity

Through our global network of sales offices and warehouses in United Kingdom (“UK”), Middle East, North America and 

Asia Pacific and European Union (collectively referred to as “key markets”), we are able to better serve our customers 

through:

• 

Customising our products to meet the requirements of our customers so as to build trust and confidence in 

our brand and products. With our extensive technical knowledge and experience, we are able to design and 

manufacture bespoke products that meet individual customer’s specifications.

• 

Providing efficient and effective post-sale customer care services

Our service centres are typically located alongside solution distribution centres in our key markets to bring us closer 

to our customers. 

Nurture a team of experienced employees

With over 110 years of technical and design expertise, our global footprint is driven by a core regional team and 

experienced professional staff that supports our operations in the development and delivery of complex end-to-end 

turnkey solutions to our clients. 

For information on employees’ years of service to our Group, please refer to Section 8.4.

Improving our products through gathering continuous feedback

We recognise the need to constantly develop new and better products that meet our clients’ requirements. Customer 

feedback collected from various channels such as face-to-face meetings, visits, email communications, phone calls 

and teleconferences. Feedback collected is mined to gather valuable insights into current and future customer 

requirements. Insights gathered are discussed during regular management meetings to drive product improvements, 

enhance service level and provide inputs for strategies.

8.2 Energy-efficient products 

To ensure the sustainability of our business, we firmly believe in preserving the environment. Thus, we are committed 

to providing energy efficient products that contribute to the reduction of environmental impacts.

Such products include a range of energy efficient motors that comply with market recognised international standards 

as follows:

Efficiency level aims to measure the ratio of usable shaft power (output) to electric input power (Input). Our products 

have attained the IE3 Premium Efficiency or IE4 Super Premium Efficiency and Premium Standards efficiency levels 

under IEC and Nema respectively. 

Typically, electric motor systems consume large amounts of electrical energy with energy representing a high proportion 

of total motor operating costs over the motor’s lifetime. An improvement in efficiency could result in significant energy 

and cost savings which will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.

8.3 Equality and diversity in the workplace

To inspire and nurture our people, we are committed to the goals of diversity 

and equal opportunity in employment by providing a work environment for 

our employees that fosters fairness, equity and respect for social and cultural 

diversity, regardless of their gender and age. The total number of full-time 

employees within our Group as at 31 December 2019 is 69 (FY2018: 57). The 

increase in manpower is due to our business expansion in North America. 

On gender diversity, the percentage of females over total permanent 

employees is 19% (FY2018: 23%) as at 31 December 2019. 

On age diversity, matured workers are valued for their experience knowledge 

and skills. As at 31 December 2019, more than half (FY2018: above 50%) of 

our workforce is at least 40 years old.

To promote equal opportunity, we have implemented various human resource measures as follows:

adjusted where justifiable

• 

Staff recruitment advertisements do not state age, race, gender or religion preferences as requirement.

• 

A discrimination and harassment guidelines is in place to support our overall commitment to equal employment 

opportunity without discrimination.

8.4 Employee retention

The continual success of our business depends on a team of 

professional, skilled and experienced staff and managers. 

In line with our mission to inspire and nurture our people, we 

are committed to employee retention through the following 

efforts:

• 

Employees are engaged regularly via various channels 

such as appraisal exercises which allows employees 

to gain feedback on their career progress. This also 

encourages them to take self-initiated actions to 

improve their capabilities. During the reporting period, 

100% (FY2018: 100%) of employees received regular 

performance reviews.

• 

In-house and external training courses are organised 

regularly for employees to improve their professional 

skills. For example, a systematic training program is in 

place in UK and North America to equip staff with the 

needed product and service knowledge.

We believe a low turnover improves the sustainability of operations and allows us to contribute positively to the 

development of social and human capital in a wider community. As at 31 December 2019, 38% (FY2018: 48%) of the 

employees have served more than 10 years with us. The decrease in percentage between FY2019 and FY2018 is 

mainly due to the recruitment of new employees to support business expansion in North America.
