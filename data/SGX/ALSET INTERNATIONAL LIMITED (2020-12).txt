BOARD STATEMENT 

GRI 102-14 

 

Dear Stakeholders, 

 

On behalf of the board of directors (“Board” or “Directors”) of Alset International Limited 

and its subsidiaries (“Alset” or collectively “the Group”), we are pleased to present to you 

the fourth Sustainability Report (“SR”) of our Group for the financial year ended 31 

December 2020 (“FY2020”) which provides information on the economic, environmental 

and social aspects of our sustainability practices in two (2) major operating business 

namely property development and biomedical science. 

 

Sustainability continues to be a widely discussed issue both locally and globally.  At Alset, 

we continue to focus on our progress towards sustainable development and how we have 

aligned our business practices and operations against our Environmental, Social and 

Governance (“ESG”) goals. 

 

The report provides an avenue for us to keep our stakeholders informed about our 

sustainability performance. It will also highlight the Group’s strategies, policies, practices, 

performances, and targets, for the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 

(“FY2020”), in relation to the economic, environmental, social and governance factors as 

stated in the Global Reporting Initiative Standards (GRI Standards).  

 

For FY2020, we have identified ten (10) indicators that matter most to our business, and to 

both internal and external stakeholders.    

 

These material issues have been taken into account through our four Pillars of 

sustainability strategies – Corporate Governance, Economic Performance, Environmental 

Sustainability and Human Capital.   

 

Corporate 

Governance 

Corporate governance is at the centre of our business in achieving our 

sustainability goals. Alset believes that good corporate governance practices 

are essential in building a sound corporation with an ethical environment, 

thereby protecting the interests of all stakeholders. We do not tolerate any form 

of corruption or fraud within the Group. 


 

 

 

 



4 

Economic 

Performance 

Alset believes in the creation of long-term economic value and a stable 

economic performance of the Group by adopting responsible business 

practices and growing business in a sustainable manner. The Group generates 

revenue primarily from property development and biomedical science business 

for FY2020. 

Environmental 

Sustainability 

Alset believes that environmentally friendly practices complement business 

efficiency and advocates corporate social responsibility towards the 

environment by incorporating these processes in our operations.  As a socially 

responsible corporation, Alset strictly complies with related environmental and 

health and personal care products safety regulations.  We remain conscious of 

our energy footprints and look for ways to reduce them while balancing our 

needs. 

Human 

Capital 

Employees are highly valued as they are a key to the contribution of Alset’s 

growth and success. As such, we emphasize the career development, welfare, 

health and safety of every employee.  The health &amp; safety of our employees is 

our priority.  Policies on health and safety are in place to protect all employees.  

In addition, with the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) 

pandemic, we have stepped up our controls and implemented safe 

management measures at our workplace. 

 

Alset anticipates significant uncertainty in our businesses in view of the COVID-19 

pandemic.  During this challenging time, Alset will continue to monitor the dynamic 

economic, environment, social, and governance landscape.   

 

We recognize the need to adapt our operations to accommodate these changes. Alset’s 

Board will continue to consider sustainability issues as part of our strategic formulation and 

operations across the Group. 

 

We appreciate having all our stakeholders on this journey together with us, to build a more 

sustainable future. 

Mr. Chan Heng Fai 

Executive Chairman, Executive Director and Group Chief Executive Officer

sustainable business operation is a strong driver of value and success for the business, as 

well as for the community and environment.  

Property Development Business 

The Group endeavours to incorporate sustainable construction in our property 

development operations.  Contractors and subcontractors will be required to have 

adequate environmental and occupational health and safety policies to ensure that their 

works and services have minimal environmental impacts and workplace safety risk. 

All our suppliers under Alset’s Property Development business, who we have a long-term

OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY 

GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 

Our Sustainability Strategy 

Alset takes a four-Pillars approach to sustainability strategy formalized by the 

Sustainability Committee.  These four material pillars are identified as Corporate 

Governance, Economic Performance, Environmental Sustainability and Human Capital.  

These pillars, as part of our sustainability strategy and operations, guide us in creating 

sustainable value for all our stakeholders.    

 

Property Development Business 

The Group aspires to meet the current and upcoming expectations posed by sustainable 

development in the property industry.  The evolution of the industry has brought about a 

strong emphasis on environmental and social considerations in property valuation, thereby 

requiring new ways of assessing property worth and value. 

Some features of a sustainable property business are as follows: 

 

• Develop, design and construct green and eco-friendly sustainable properties 

• Minimise negative environmental impacts and maximise sustainable use of 

resources in properties developed. 

• Provide property related services that are environmentally friendly and which 

benefit the social community 

• Provide long-term sustainable value for property owners as well as tenants. 

 

Biomedical Science Business 

The Group aspires to benefit the environment and society through our commitment 

towards a sustainable health and personal care supply chain.  We are committed to 

protecting the health and safety of our consumers by distributing safe health and personal 

care products that are of good quality and nutritional value. 

 

In addition to our focus on health and safety, we endeavour to develop an environmentally 

responsible supply chain by procuring from suppliers that implement sustainable business 

practices and comply with environmental regulations. 

 

 


 

 

 

 



11 

Stakeholder Engagement 

GRI 102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-44  

Business decisions made by Alset consider the interests of our stakeholders who are or 

would be affected by our operations and decision-making processes. 

 

Our stakeholders include employees; suppliers; customers; regulators; investors; and 

shareholders whom we have identified considering the economic, environmental, and 

social impacts of our business, across the supply chain which are applicable to both 

Property Development and Biomedical Science businesses. 

 

Due to COVID-19, the frequencies of physical engagements with stakeholders have been 

reduced. Instead, Alset transitioned to using Zoom online platform to engage stakeholders. 

 

We continually engage our stakeholders in the performance of our business through 

various channels.   Through open communication channels, we align our sustainability 

approach with their needs and expectation.  This engagement is important as we seek 

opportunities to manage our businesses in a sustainable manner.

Materiality Review Process 

GRI 102-47 

We applied the GRI reporting principles – stakeholder inclusiveness, the sustainability 

context, materiality and completeness – in defining the report content by considering the 

Group’s activities, impact and substantive expectations and interests of our stakeholders. 

 

In determining the material topics relevant to FY2020, Alset performed an internal strategy 

review which included a relook at our business strategy, business model, key stakeholders 

and processes to identify the Group’s significant economic, environmental and social 

impacts as they are integral to Alset’s success of building a sustainable future.  

 

We identified the following ten (10) indicators during the review conducted. The materiality 

assessment was subsequently endorsed by the Sustainability Executive Reporting 

Committee.  The following table summarises our key stakeholders, engagement platforms 

and their key concerns:

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 

GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 

 

By adopting responsible business practices and embedding sustainability in 

our business, Alset believes it can create long term economic value and 

contribute to a stable economic performance of the Group.  

 

At Alset, we believe sustainable economic growth benefits not just our shareholders, but 

all our stakeholders as well. Through sustainable economic values generated by our 

operations, Alset will be able to distribute the economic benefits directly or indirectly to our 

stakeholders.  As a socially responsible organisation, besides dividends to our 

shareholders, our economic benefits were distributed to governments through taxes, 

employees through salary and wages, and the society through the creation of jobs.  

Management Approach  

To strengthen our position and our sustainable performance, the Group plans to continue 

expanding our business operations by acquiring or setting up new businesses to broaden 

our range of services.   

 

The Group also contributes to economic development by supporting local businesses as 

we work with local vendors within the countries we operated. This will indirectly help the 

community as more jobs are created when we work with local vendors.

Total property development revenue for FY2020 decreased by 30.35% to $21.18 million.  

This was largely due to decrease in revenue recognized for the USA projects, which 

reflected the challenging market conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-


 

 

 

 

 

 



19 

 

19 pandemic could negatively affect demand for real estate, impact the ability of our staff 

and contractors to continue to work and adversely impact the timeliness of local 

governments in granting required approvals. Accordingly, the completion of important 

stages in our projects has been delayed. COVID-19 pandemic may also impact our 

business’s future developments due to uncertainty of market conditions. We continue to 

carefully monitor the situation and make efforts to mitigate these risks. 

 

As part of our sustainability strategy of incorporating sustainable construction in our 

development operations, we have earmarked the remaining undeveloped lots of Black 

Oak for the development of Alset EHomes which comprises eco-friendly gated single-

family homes (“SFH”) fully fitted with, amongst others, sustainable transport, living and 

energy systems including solar systems and energy storage as well as electric cars 

utilising a vehicle-to-grid concept. We have kicked off infrastructure works for this 

sustainable healthy living community project and intend to develop proof-of-concept Alset 

EHomes in due course. Apart from the Black Oak development, the Group intends to bring 

this concept to other parts of the US as well as markets abroad. Alset EHomes’ 

sustainable healthy living systems will also be applied to these newly built SFH as an initial 

proof-of-concept. 

 

In line with our business strategy to expand, Alset also recorded $3.91 million revenue 

from its Biomedical Science business through its new subsidiary, HWH World Inc. (“HWH”).  

HWH was incorporated in Korea in March 2019 and started to conduct the distribution of 

health and personal care products through network marketing. Having already established 

our footprint in the Seoul region of Korea, we have proceeded with our plans to expand to 

Cheonan, Daegu, Daojeon and Busan regions to capture new growth opportunities. 

Despite the headwinds faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, HWH is well positioned as a 

platform to help the many financially impacted individuals to earn a supplemental income 

by sharing and referring premier health and personal care products in our HWH 

Marketplace to friends, family and other prospective customers through social media and 

other technology channels.  

 

The group will continue to expand its business operations, providing quality products and 

services to more consumers, generating sustainable economic value for its stakeholders. 

We will continue to explore strategic partnerships and acquisitions to create long-term 

value for our shareholders.

Indirect Economic Impacts 

GRI 203-1  

Besides the direct economic value being generated, Alset also recognize that we have 

significant indirect economic impacts and have implemented various practices to ensure 

that we benefit the local community, economy and businesses during our operations.  Our 

construction project requires the expertise of direct/indirect suppliers and specialists – 

concrete, reinforcement, tiles/stone and furniture which generates business opportunities 

within and among the supply chain. 

 

The local community also benefited from the following development efforts: 

- 

Construction of various storm water management ponds.  These ponds help to 

retain pollutants and provide flood control, while beautifying the environment.  

- 

Ballenger Creek Pike Nature Trail and Sidewalk improvements. This helps provide 

for a pedestrian friendly neighborhood that promotes the interconnection of multiple 

phases as well as outdoor exercise. 

- 

Completion of the Clubhouse/pool construction. The Clubhouse and Pool provide a 

best in class amenity center that homeowners will use for social clubs, barbeques, 

birthdays, meetings, indoor exercise and used for the Home Owners Association to 

conduct monthly meetings. 

- 

On-site reforestation efforts to offset the usage of impervious areas and create 

environmentally friendly drainage. 

- 

Avoid and minimize impacts to wetlands using stream and wetland crossings 

working in close conjunction with the Army Corps of Engineers to make sure all 

codes/laws are abided by and impact is limited to protect these wetland areas and 

the wildlife that uses them.  

- 

Conservation of a Historic Farm House that once served the property. Great efforts 

were made to work with the Maryland Historical Trust in order to preserve a portion 

of the house that is now being retrofitted by a local home contractor and will be sold 

to a potential buyer. Archaeological digs were also performed in and around the 

property to make certain that items of historical significance were not present in the 

past.  

- 

Designing highways, streets, roads, or common driveways to enhance 

interconnection, safety, efficiency and convenience to all users. 

 -

Procurement Practices 

GRI 204-1  

All the contractors we engage for the Ballenger Run and Black Oak Project are based in 

the USA.  These contractors hire locals for the construction work and generally source 

their material locally. 

 

For the Biomedical Science business, Alset is committed to procure all its products and 

services – where possible – locally in South Korea.  Most of our suppliers are companies 

based in the Canada, United States and South Korea. The general products and services 

we procured are health and personal care products as well as security authentication 

services.  We strictly comply with safety regulations by the local regulatory bodies and we 

only engage with suppliers who possess the relevant certifications.

ENVIRONMENT 

GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 

 

With the growing awareness and importance of sustainability in Singapore, 

Alset is committed to minimising our environmental impact by focusing on 

reducing our energy footprint. 

 

Energy Consumption 

GRI 302-1  

The consumption of electricity is being monitored on a monthly basis to measure the 

success of the initiatives that are implemented. We are happy to share that we have been 

able to reduce the overall electricity consumption of Alset in FY2020 as compared to 

FY2019.

In FY2020, our Singapore office at Suntec Tower consumed a total of 5,129 kWh, a 

decrease of 210 kWh as compared to FY2019.  This is attributable largely due to the work 

from home arrangement during the Circuit Breaker period. 

 

Our Hong Kong office reported a total consumption of 12,463 kWh, a decrease of 7,601 

kWh as compared to FY2019.  The decrease was due to collective efforts of staff to 

reduce electricity consumption as well as the work from home initiatives during the Covid-

19 period. 

 

Our Houston office reported a total consumption of 6,882 kWh, a slight decrease of 47 kW 

as compared to FY2019.

Reduction of Energy Consumption 

GRI 302-4  

The Group’s energy consumption is limited to the electricity used in our offices. We have 

implemented energy control policy and adopted various energy-saving measures, such as 

using energy-saving equipment and setting all printers, copiers, and computers to the 

energy-saving mode where possible.  

 

To raise the awareness of energy conservation, the Group encourages employees to 

establish energy-saving habits at the office, such as switching off lights and electronic 

appliances before leaving the office or switching off the lights in each room when they are 

not in use. 

 

While the Group is not able to promise a specific level of energy reduction, we will monitor 

our energy consumption and make plans to reduce our energy consumption levels through 

the implementation of other energy-saving measures.

Employment 

GRI 102-7, 102-8 

 

All our employees play an integral role to building the success of Alset. 

 

Intellectual capital is an asset that should not be overlooked. While new members of the 

team bring fresh perspectives and suggestions on how the Group can grow, employees 

who have been with us for many years provide valuable experience and knowledge. 

 

It is essential that our hiring practices are fair, merit-based, and non-discriminatory so that 

we can recruit people with the right knowledge and expertise to contribute to the growth of 

our business. More importantly, we need to build a conducive and harmonious working 

environment so that our employees continue to stay with us. 

 

Our employee demographic data is based on our employee records generated from our 

Human Resource system. 

 

Employee headcount as at 31 December 2020 increased by 4 personnel from 17 in 

FY2019 to 21 In F2020.  Being a global group, we have employees of different 

nationalities – Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and the USA. There were no temporary 

or part-time employees in FY2020.
