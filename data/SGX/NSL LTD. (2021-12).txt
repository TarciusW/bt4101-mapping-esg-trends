Board Statement

NSL Ltd is pleased to issue its fifth 

sustainability report in line with 

the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) 

requirements on Sustainability 

Reporting.

In 2021, the COVID-19 global 

pandemic continued to impact our 

businesses. Safe management 

measures in accordance with 

government guidelines were 

implemented to safeguard business 

continuity and protect the well-

being, health and safety of our 

employees. 

Enhanced safety measures were 

taken in its Malaysia precast 

operations such as bi-weekly 

Antigen Rapid Test at all plants and 

procurement of early vaccination 

for 350 foreign workers at Seelong 

plant ahead of the national 

vaccination programme rollout. 

In Singapore, regular rapid tests for 

COVID-19 infection were conducted 

for employees and visitors before 

it became mandatory. Despite that, 

there were numerous COVID-19 

cases in our waste management 

plant last year and the plant added 

safety measurement practices 

and successfully curbed the 

spread, ensuring minimal service 

interruptions to our customers.

Our training and development 

plans were stepped up in 2021 

despite the ongoing pandemic as 

we recognised the importance of 

upskilling our staff. Courses relating 

to safety, digital transformation, and 

hospitality were organised last year, 

and some were even conducted 

online. 

During the year, Eastern Pretech 

and NSL Group’s Research and 

Development team successfully 

developed green concrete 

formulations using 100% of 

manufactured sand, a by-product 

of coarse aggregates production, 

for its core product. The team 

is currently researching and 

incorporating raw materials with 

lower carbon footprint to other 

concrete products. 

NSL OilChem Waste Management’s 

new Industrial wastewater 

treatment plant continues to treat 

high strength industrial wastewater 

collected using physical, chemicals 

and biological processes. Unlike the 

traditional method of incineration 

of such wastewater, this method 

allows recovery of wastewater into 

public sewer for further treatment, 

promoting sustainability and 

reducing carbon footprint of the 

treatment process.

The Group’s collaborations with 

institutes of higher learning strive 

to develop products and processes 

utilising waste materials for greater 

sustainability and less landfill 

requirements. 

The Board would like to thank 

the management and employees 

for their relentless efforts in 

developing and maintaining 

sustainable practices under current 

unprecedented environment, and 

their contribution towards this 

report.

Green Products and Services 

Sustainability is at the heart of our main business offerings, from the processing 

and safe disposal of hazardous waste to the development and distribution of 

green concrete. We place great effort in producing green products and services, 

and believe that we can create an impact in this area.

Over the course of 2021, we offered 

35 different varieties of green 

concrete in our design mix to support 

sustainable construction in Singapore 

and Malaysia. Different green 

concrete types are used in tandem 

with specific project design and job 

requirement. 2020 and 2021 green 

concrete production volume are 

shown in the table below.

Progress in Our Green Product 

and Service Portfolio

Green Concrete

We have seen an emerging transition 

towards achieving net zero carbon 

emission in the construction and 

building sector. Recognising the greater 

demand for reducing embodied carbon 

across organisations, we enable that 

transition through making green 

concrete available to the construction 

industry. 

We are currently exploring the 

addition of high strength concrete to 

our green concrete mix to enhance 

product quality. We will also be 

partially replacing our normal OPC 

cement with cement derived from 

lower carbon footprint raw materials.

the suitability of manufactured sand 

as a replacement for natural sand, 

EPM and the Group’s Research and 

Development team successfully 

developed concrete formulations 

using 100% manufactured sand 

for hollow core slab products 

without compromising the product

Manufactured Sand

Manufactured sand is graded 

fine aggregates created by 

crushing quarry waste not used in 

construction. EPM is increasing 

the use of manufactured sand in 

concrete because it contributes 

to environmental sustainability. 

Manufactured sand typically comes 

in different shapes, gradations, and 

mineralogy compared to natural 

sand, thus there is a concern 

that these differences impact the 

performance of concrete using 



In 2021, the proportion of 

manufactured sands used in 

Beranang plant exceeded 80%. 

The intention is to introduce 

the use of manufactured sand 

in Seelong plant in 2022.

NSL Chemicals’ Collaborative 

Work with NUS and NTU

NSL Chemicals is working with 

Nanyang Technological University 

(NTU) on a three-year project to 

develop technological solutions 

for site investigation and material 

reuse under the Urban Solutions 

and Sustainability Integration Fund 

(USS-IF). As part of the project, the 

team will look at possible reuse of 

landfill material from Pulau Semakau. 

When successful, the service life of 

Pulau Semakau will be prolonged and 

industrial waste designated for landfill 

can be reused. 

In another three-year project, also 

funded under USS-IF, with National 

University of Singapore (NUS), NSL 

Chemicals is seeking cost effective 

means to remove or recover heavy 

metals from non-incinerable waste. 

The project when successful will 

allow safe reuse of non-incinerable 

waste and promote near zero waste 

discharge.





Our Performance

We have 100% replaced natural sand 

with manufactured sand in most of 

our projects in 2021 in comparison to 

50% replacement in 2020.

Roadstone 

Our roadstone business 

is responsible for creating 

environmentally friendly products 

for the road construction market, 

particularly the resurfacing of 

roads, in Singapore. NSL Chemical’s 

roadstone business uses 100% waste 

material from steel melting process 

as raw material. This helps to prevent 

excessive exploitation of natural 

occurring rock and conserve landfill 

sites for industrial waste dumping, 

promoting sustainable development. 

Additionally, as the material is 

available locally, the carbon footprint 

of the product is lower compared to 

imported aggregates. 

NSL Chemicals also made high 

grade monolithic refractories that 

are durable and minimise utilities 

consumption. High grade castable 

has long service life in incinerators 

and steel mills, minimising waste 

generation from refractory lining 

replacement. Additionally, the 

adoption of dry ramming mix as lining 

for steel making eliminates water 

usage in lining material preparation 

and requires less heat before 

application. All these reduce utility 

consumption and carbon footprint.

Energy

NSL Group proactively improves our energy 

management processes as energy is crucial to 

our industrial operations, and can potentially 

alleviate climate change. 

The National Environment Agency’s 

(NEA) Energy Conservation Act (ECA) 

in Singapore mandates the Group’s 

registration with NEA, for industrial 

facilities which consistently consume 

54 terajoules or more energy per 

calendar year for two out of three 

preceding years. Upon registration, 

the organisation is required to appoint 

an energy manager and commence 

the reporting and monitoring of their 

energy use and greenhouse gas 

emissions, annually. Additionally, the 

organisation must submit an energy 

efficiency improvement plan to NEA. 

How We Manage and Reduce 

Our Energy Use

NOWM appointed an Energy and 

Water Efficiency Manager in 2021 to 

oversee energy and water usage. The 

manager submitted an Energy Use 

Report comprising Energy Efficiency 

Improvement Plan Monitoring 

Results and an Emissions Report 

under the Carbon Pricing Act to NEA 

in June 2021 as part of its Energy 

Conservation Act (ECA) requirements. 

A Water Efficiency Management Plan 

was also submitted to PUB to monitor 

the water usage at the treatment 

plant at 23 Tanjong Kling Road. PUB 

officers visited the site in October 

2021 and were satisfied with the 

water conservation measures taken 

at the plant.

NSL Group’s Research and 

Development, and IT departments 

have automated processes and 

workflows to improve energy 

efficiency and productivity of the 

laboratories in the new organic 

wastewater treatment plant in Tuas 

Avenue 10, Singapore. 

Additionally, the wastewater 

treatment processes at the Tanjong 

Kling plant were enhanced to 

strengthen the plant’s capability 

in meeting regulatory discharge 

standards. These included additional 

polishing step to improve discharge 

systems and the online monitoring of 

chemical oxygen demand (COD). As a 

result of these enhanced processes, 

we consistently saw better water 

quality with discharge water quality 

that is compliant with regulatory 

requirements.

Waste Management

As a leading provider of waste 

treatment and disposal services, we 

believe that waste management is 

integral for our business. In addition 

to providing our customers with 

waste management services, we 

also focus on the responsible 

management and reduction 

of waste across our 

business operations. 

How We Manage and Reduce 

Our Waste

At NOWM, we continued to follow 

international standards for safe 

chemical disposal, safe wastewater 

discharge and disposal of incineration 

ashes. In Singapore, we ensured 

wastewater discharged to the sea 

and public sewers, align with the 

Singapore regulatory standard.

Our Performance

For NOWM’s operations, waste 

generated can be separated into 

hazardous and non-hazardous 

waste. In 2021, 1.3% (by weight) of 

total waste generated is made up of 

non-hazardous waste while 98.7% 

(by weight) of total waste generated 

is made up of hazardous waste.

Targets

• We aim to find ways to 

efficiently dry non-incinerable 

waste to reduce final waste 

volume for disposal. 

• We are looking for possible 

alternative use of waste 

material in the long run.

Air Quality, Noise and Dust Pollution

NSL cooperates with the regulations 

imposed by the Singapore government 

by managing our energy and 

emissions.

 

How We Manage Air Quality, 

Noise and Dust Pollution

We acknowledge that our operations 

can have an adverse impact on 

air quality through the emission of 

greenhouse gasses, dust and noise 

pollution. 

Since 2019, NEA enforced the Carbon Pricing Act (CPA), which 

mandates any industrial facility with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 

equal to or above 2,000 tCO2e annually to register as a reportable 

facility with the agency. Furthermore, facilities with emissions beyond 

25,000 tCO2e annually are subject to the Carbon Tax. 

An annual source emission test was 

conducted for our incinerator and 

boiler stacks at 23 Tanjong Kling 

Road plant and all emission are within 

allowable limits. We conduct periodic 

boundary noise measurements and 

noise mapping, using an external 

vendor, to manage our noise 

emissions from our operations. 

Additionally, we closely monitor air 

particles, dust exposure and chemical 

effluents through our scrubbing 



technology. Employees who work 

near a noisy environment are send 

for audiometry testing on an annual 

basis.

Our wastewater plant in Tuas is 

designed with scrubber units to 

handle waste gas, ultimately curbing 

air pollution.

11

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021


Targets

• We will continue to maintain our emissions below 

allowable limits. 

• We will install an additional scrubber at our 

organic wastewater treatment plant in Tuas 

Avenue 10 to further reduce odour.

Environmental Compliance

How We Manage Environmental 

Compliance

We work closely with Statutory Boards 

such as NEA, the Singapore Civil 

Defence Force (SCDF) and the Public 

Utilities Board (PUB) to improve our 

practices and maintain transparency. 

We aim to minimise the risk of 

incidents arising from non-compliance 

in focal areas such as water and 

effluent discharge, air pollution, 

hazardous material handling and fire. 

A combustible Dust &amp; Toxic 

Substances dust monitoring test was 

conducted in 2021 at NSL Chemical’s 

refractory plant. Concentration of 

nuisance particulates for all locations 

are within the permissible exposure 

levels stated in the Workplace Safety 

and Health Regulations published by 

Ministry of Manpower (MOM). 

NSL Ltd is committed to reduce 

associated industrial process risks by 

adhering to regulations and implementing 

stringent quality and safety standards. 

We look to continually improve our risk 

assessment processes, emergency 

preparedness and monitoring, 

as guided by international best 

practices and standards. 

Our Performance

We are pleased to report that in 

2021, we achieved full compliance 

in discharge processes at our 23 

Tanjong Kling and organic wastewater 

treatment plant in Tuas Avenue 10. 

Our inorganic wastewater treatment 

plant in Tuas Avenue 12 plant incurred 

fines amounting to $23,000 in 

October 2021 for contravening PUB 

sewerage and drainage regulations. 

These fines were imposed as a result 

of operational lapses at the plant in 

October 2020. These lapses led to the 

suspension of approval to discharge 

trade effluent at the plant in November 

2020. Through implementing a 24-

hour surveillance to monitor process 

at the plant, NOWM turned the 

operations around and received PUB’s 

approval to discharge trade effluents 

at the plant in August 2021. 

Targets

• We aim to have zero 

incidents of non-compliance 

with environmental 

regulations in 2022.

Labour Practices, Employee 

Training and Welfare

Living with COVID-19 at the 

Workplace

Our planning assumption was – when 

COVID-19 cluster happens at our 

workplace, we need to “Be Prepared” 

to manage the situation.

Being prepared means:

• Frequent reiteration of messages 

on the importance of personal and 

social responsibilities in keeping 

social distance, maintaining 

high standard of personal and 

workplace hygiene through 

washing of hands, sanitising, and 

proper mask wearing.

• If unwell, practise the discipline 

to self-isolate, administer self-

testing (ART), report sick and alert 

superior early to facilitate contact 

tracing and ring fencing.

• All employees are to be vaccinated.

For NOWM, our preparation and 

contingency plans were tested on 6 

September 2021. Between 6 to 15 

September, 27 staff in the Logistics 

Department were tested COVID-19 

positive. The logistics cluster can be 

attributed to the proximity between 

drivers and attendants, sitting side by 

side in a vehicle cabin, on a daily basis.

While they practised safe distancing 

at the 26 Tanjong Kling plant, it 

was not at an adequate level to 

avoid the spread of COVID-19. 

To prevent a similar occurrence, 

NOWM implemented an 11-point 

working guidelines for the Logistics 

Department.

Additional measures were also taken 

to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on 

its operations:

• Staff working at 26 Tanjong Kling 

were isolated from staff from other 

locations. They had to come to 

work and return home on their own 

instead of taking the company bus.

• Drivers and attendants were 

restricted from coming out of 

their vehicles when making 

deliveries so that there was no or 

minimal contact between drivers/

attendants and plant operators.

• High-risk Operations, QC and 

plant staff were scheduled to take 

weekly COVID-19 tests. Office-

based staff who were not rostered 

on split-team rotation were 

converted to alternative days split-

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021




The First COVID-19 Cluster

On 6 September, a vacuum truck driver fell sick and saw a doctor at 

Raffles Medical Clinic. His COVID-19 test results was positive. Noting that 

the driver’s last test on 30 August was negative, the Logistics Department 

conducted a contact tracing of all NOWM employees who had or might 

have been in contact with the driver between 31 August to 6 September. 

Four groups were identified. 

• 6 attendants and operators worked closely with him during the said 

period. These are his closest work contacts. 

• The slop vacuum truck discharge team and QC testing team at 23 

Tanjong Kling whom he came into contact with when he went to the 

plant to discharge his waste collections.

• Other NOWM employees working at the 26 Tanjong Kling office and 

workshop areas.

• Customers’ place where he collected waste from. 

COVID-19 tests were carried out for all relevant staff in the first three 

groups. Everyone tested negative except for five close contacts. Contact 

tracing was then conducted for the five close contacts. At this time, 

additional staff from the Logistics Department reported positive tests 

for COVID-19.

The Company decided to extend its COVID-19 test programmes for  

all Operations, QC, and plant staff at all four operating sites. At the  

26 Tanjong Kling plant, where the Logistics Department was located, all 

office staff were also tested. The completed test results confirmed that 

COVID-19 only affected the Logistics Department staff.

With more stringent guidelines in 

place, the Logistics Department did 

not register any new cases between 

15 September and 12 October. The 

Delta variant however saw NOWM 

experiencing a second wave of 

COVID-19 positives. On 12 October, 

a plant operator at 23 Tanjong Kling 

plant tested positive. In all, 34 staff 

across all NOWM locations tested 

positive from 12 October to  

27 November. 

In both cluster periods, staff who 

tested COVID-19 positive were either 

asymptomatic or experienced mild 

symptoms of fever and sickness. None 

escalated into serious illness. But, a few 

of our COVID-19 positives operators 

were chased out by their landlords 

and had to resort to much persuasion 

before they were allowed back.

NOWM was able to overcome 

the two waves of COVID-19 

successfully because of our 

people. Notwithstanding personal 

hardship and emotional strains of 

being separated from loved ones 

(especially for our migrant workers), 

everyone laboured on and covered 

for their stricken colleagues to ensure 

business continuity.

How We Manage Our Talent

In light of the pandemic, talent 

management has been crucial for 

business continuity and upholding 

organisational culture. Our human 

capital management approach 

is based on five key pillars: fair 

labour practices, talent attraction, 

training and development, employee 

engagement, welfare and well-being.

Fair Labour Practices 

We are committed to extend fair 

labour practices to every person 

across our businesses, regardless 

of their function. We are particularly 

conscious of our migrant workers 

in Singapore and Malaysia. We 

count on them for our operational 

processes and acknowledge 

their struggles, particularly in the 

pandemic.

Training and Development

At NSL Ltd, we recognise the 

importance of keeping our staff 

abreast with market advancements, 

and continuously upskilling them. 

Skill development is a positive long-

term investment for our company 

as it contributes to enhanced 

business performance and employee 

satisfaction. In 2021, training and 

development plans were stepped 

up despite the ongoing pandemic. 

Various courses relating to safety, 

digital transformation, and hospitality 

were organised and some were 

conducted online. The average 

training hours for per employee was 

increased from 26.6 hours in 2020 to 

30.3 in year 2021. 

To support NOWM’s Digital 

Transformation efforts and 

provide staff with skills and career 

development opportunities, NOWM 

organised a Coursera Online 

Learning pilot project in August 

2021. The objectives of this pilot 

project are to upskill and develop 

skills and competencies in three 

domains, namely (1) Data Processing 

using Microsoft Excel, (2) Artificial 

Intelligence/Data Analytics and (3) 

Data Visualisation, and assess the 

effectiveness of online learning for 

skills development.

Employee Engagement

We believe in the importance of 

engaging with our staff to better 

understand their needs and concerns, 

so that we can improve their everyday 

experiences at work. During the 

pandemic, we were unable to 

organise any employee engagement 

activities. NSL Ltd was particularly 

focused on maintaining regular 

communication with all employees to 

keep them informed of the changing 

business paradigms. 

The Sports and Recreation Club 

(SRC), our activities committee, is 

responsible for organising employee 

engagement events to promote
