CHAIRLADY &amp;

DEPUTY CHAIRMAN’S 

MESSAGE

We have prepared our FY2021 Sustainability 

Report in accordance with the internationally 

recognised best practices from GRI Standards 

as well as SGX listing rules. We aim to provide 

an update on our efforts in achieving a 

sustainable business operation over time to 

our stakeholders. With a performance-

orientated approach towards sustainability 

reporting, our objective is to provide a 

systematic and comparable approach to 

benchmark against the rest of the process 

industry sector in Singapore, as well as related 

industries in countries where we are operating 

our businesses; to continuously improve our 

sustainability through best practices.

FY2021 presented a unique challenge to the world, our economy, our business, as well as our 

people with the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Since the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, the world 

has been grappling with the pandemic’s damaging effects on people and businesses. With the new 

Omicron variant that is spreading rapidly both locally and globally, the COVID-19 pandemic 

situation is far from being stabilised.  It has challenged all of us on how to swiftly execute new 

ideas, embrace and learn new concepts on how we work and communicate as we move into the 

future. 

Achieving a sustainable future will take both personal and business commitments to adapt to the 

new ways in how we live and work. Throughout FY2021, we continued to support our employees’ 

adjustment and adoption to remote working, as well as continuous training programs using 

videoconferencing software. This is achieved via digital tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, 

to reduce and replace physical meetings. More importantly, we enabled our employees to continue 

their necessary training programs, upgrading their skills and knowledge via webinars and Microsoft 

Teams to achieve our training targets despite social distancing constraints. Flexible working 

arrangements is another initiative that we have implemented and adopted despite the relaxation 

from the government to allow 50% of those who can work from home to return to the office. The 

Company encourages employees to work from home and continue to effectively deliver their jobs 

via digital means. With these implementations, we have managed to control the number of infected 

cases within the Company, thus also ensuring the continuity of business operations. We believe 

that social distancing measures to limit the physical interactions among employees are imperative 

to the health of our employees. With this objective in mind, we have conducted the second 

dormitory reshuffling in the year to achieve the best possible arrangement that we could provide to 

ensure safe distancing among the work crews who are residing in the dormitories. These 

measures help to safeguard employees’ health by minimising the potential exposure to COVID-19.

 




Mun Siong Engineering Limited | Sustainability Report 2021

Of all the challenges that we face, the changing climate that has resulted in a rising global 

temperature, as well as the increasing social disparity is important and material scopes that we 

would like to monitor in our sustainability reporting. Our sustainability strategy is founded on the 

three pillars of human capital, safety and health and environment. 

Human Capital

Human resources are imperative to the success of business operations. An internal audit was 

carried out by an external party on our human resource processes in FY2021, to review the 

procedures and policies in the Human Resource department, from daily Human Resource 

operations matters to procedure and policies formulation. To provide a sustainable Human 

Resource framework, we formulated our Human Rights Policy to ensure equal opportunities 

regardless of age, gender, and race. With COVID-19 raging through the world for the past two 

years, our foreign employees residing at the dormitories were constrained by the movement 

controls set in place by the Singapore government. Caring for one another plays an important part 

to motivate and supporting each other during such difficult times. Our employees through collective 

passion, are doing well to keep each other safe as a united Mun Siong Team. We continue to 

strengthen our business strategy in achieving our sustainability goals. On our roadmap, we will 

continue to develop our goals, investing in our people for a better tomorrow.

Safety &amp; Health

The safety and health of our employees have never been more important in these tumultuous 

times. Our safe management officers are heavily engaged in the daily monitoring of our 

employees, our business partners as well as our suppliers’ wellbeing whenever and whoever visits 

our premises. We have developed and implemented our in-house safe work operating procedures 

and safe management plan for our employees. With the advisories from Government agencies, we 

closely monitor the daily well-being of our employees. To remind everyone to constantly sanitise 

their hands as and when required, besides the provision of hand sanitiser at all entrances and 

exits, we have also provided each employee with a carry-along tube of sanitiser. Maintaining good 

hygiene through regular cleaning and sanitising has always been the key reminder at every site’s 

morning toolbox talk to all the front-line workers. It will continue to be a top priority wherever the 

Group carries out work.

Environment

With the world looking towards a net-zero future, we too have committed and are putting in efforts 

to harness not just our ability to reduce the consumption of electricity, water and diesel that have 

an impact on the planet but also to work with our business partners to work towards their 

sustainability journey. We are setting our target to reduce our emissions by 5% in FY2022. While 

working towards our net-zero ambitions, we also hope to seek cooperation and support from our 

suppliers, business partners as well as government agencies in all our countries of operation.

OUR COMMITMENT

Sustainability is becoming increasingly important in a changing world, and as Mun Siong Group 

grows, we have to be ever more cognizant of the impact of our operations on the planet, as well as 

how we are integrated into the social fabric of the communities that we are based in. Sustainability 

thus remains a key consideration in business decisions, to ensure we do not sacrifice the future, 

just to meet the needs of today.

MATERIALITY

Mun Siong's Sustainability Reporting Steering Committee, in collaboration with all stakeholders, 

assessed the materials elements based on work activities and areas of concern in early 2021. 

Nonetheless, there are impending revisions to some of the GRI criteria that will take effect in 2023, 

but most of the reporting standards will remain the same, based on the committee members' best 

judgment. As we have successfully embarked on the route of lowering our carbon footprint by the 

end of 2021, we have designed and implemented strategies to attain our goals. Despite the 

constant changes brought on by the pandemic, Mun Siong remained steadfast and made the 

required revisions to the strategy plan to ensure that our goals were met. 

In FY2021, the aspects that have been identified as material issues and will be covered in this 

report are as follows:

LEARNING &amp; DEVELOPMENT 

Human capital is a key asset to the success of a company. Our approach to training, upgrading 

employee’s skills, and career development are key factors to Mun Siong’s success in being 

sustainable in a highly competitive and dynamic business environment. 

We commit to providing every opportunity to our people for personal growth and development, 

regardless of their age, job level, gender, race, and nationality. We have been a Certified 

On-the-Job Training Centre (COJTC) in Singapore for the past 26 years and our in-house trainers, 

along with our respective subject matter experts, work closely together to provide training 

programs that will equip our employees with competent skills and knowledge to stay ahead in an 

ever-changing environment.

FY2021 has been a challenging year for the Learning and Development department. With the 

COVID-19 pandemic continuing to rage globally, many activities were halted and unable to be 

carried out. Likewise, over 38% of the training courses planned for in FY2021 were either 

suspended or cancelled due to a lack of available trainers. In addition, due to border closures, 

many of our employees were stranded in their respective home countries and unable to return to 

the country of employment throughout the year. 

Despite the challenges and significant headwinds, we managed to provide a total of 21,764 hours 

of training as compared to 18,470 hours in FY2020. We focused mainly on Workplace Mandatory 

Safety programmes, as well as COVID-19 Safety trainings. This ensured that our employees 

acquired the relevant safety knowledge to comply with local COVID-19 policies, and more 

importantly, to allow them to continue providing their services safely while keeping the risk of 

COVID-19 infection to a minimum.

During FY2021, our employees attended an average of 19.0 training hours each compared to 16.1 

hours in FY2020. Approximately 10% of the total training hours were recorded by the employees 

in a supervisory role and approximately 90% by our direct workforce.

However, despite our training and development program coupled with our talent management 

scheme with the company, the attrition rate in FY2021 was high as the rates of foreign workers 

departing back to their countries were high and, on the reverse, we were unable to bring them in 

due to border closure restrictions.

The total training cost increased by 2.3% and the average training cost per staff also increased by 

35% for FY2021. This is due to ASPRI no longer subsidising for WSQ Low Levy courses this year 

and the training fee adjustments from other training service providers.

HUMAN CAPITAL

Our workforce remains the cornerstone of our business and sustainable growth. We are fully 

committed to investing in the training and development, compensation and benefits of our 

workforce despite disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also supported our 

workforce to have remote work arrangements, initiation of virtual teams meeting and self-isolation 

arrangements. Our human capital policy is reviewed on a regular basis to provide adequate 

investment and care for our workforce while staying within the constraints and updated legislative 

requirements advised by various Government agencies. During the year, we focused on managing 

and organising mental wellness and stress management webinars for our workforce to overcome 

this pandemic.

New Hires

As a part of our human capital policy, we believe in equal employment opportunity, adopting and 

ensuring the implementation of fair employment practices that meet or exceed the requirements 

set by Singapore's employment act. We hire new employees according to their capabilities and job 

requirements. We provide clear briefings on job responsibilities during the interview and the first 

day of the onboarding program. In FY2021, we recruited 6% more local employees compared to 

FY2020.

Racial and Gender Diversity

We encourage and advocate diversity and equal employment opportunity to hire the best talent. 

We are operating in a dynamic business environment, with an essential need for the Company to 

engage employees with a diversity of thoughts and experiences, one who can contribute to 

identifying and expanding the Company’s business opportunities, reducing the risks and achieving 

a sustainable business model.

widen the views in policy formulation and the overall consideration in navigating corporate cultures 

to become a more conducive and attractive workplace.

Over the years, we have been actively trying to increase the hiring of female employees in this very 

much male-dominated industry. Although there is improvement in 2021, we need to intensify our 

effort on recruitment of female employees.

We prohibit discrimination and promote racial harmony and equality in our Company.

Talent Retention

Human resource is an important asset to the Company as a strong and cohesive team provides a 

solid foundation for the Company to build upon. Retaining talents is always one of our major 

objectives and key challenges. As part of our retention strategy, we conduct interviews (feedback) 

every 6 months to understand the concerns regarding work conditions and environment, job

responsibilities, etc, in our workforce. From this, we review our human capital policy and initiate 

improvements on an ongoing basis. This ensures that we can manage our people's expectations 

and further maintain a good relationship with them. Exit interviews are also conducted to 

understand why employees decide to leave us. We retained approximately 61% of craftsmen who 

are equipped with at least two core skills sets. It is a decrease of approximately 9% compared to 

70% in FY2020.

Note 1: FY2020 may not be a representative year to benchmark due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Compensation &amp; Benefits

We provide fair and equitable remuneration packages according to individual’s job responsibilities 

and performance. To maintain a competitive and attractive compensation package to our 

employees, in Singapore we take reference to the National Wages Council (NWC) and Manpower 

Research Statistics Department’s (MRSD) benchmarking tools and recommendations as guidance 

for our annual salary adjustment.

Performance management targets to connect an individual's work goals towards the Company’s 

objectives by providing clear performance expectations. We assign Key Performance Indicators 

(KPI) for our employees to have clear targets for them to work towards. In addition, we also 

conduct face-to-face performance assessments discussions for our employees. This process is 

reviewed together with the employees, the respective heads of department and the HR manager 

on an annual basis.

Transition Assistance Programs

Over the year, we have initiated multiple transition assistance programs. We also offered 

re-employment to elderly employees who have reached the retirement age, on a contract basis, 

as well as offer contracts to ex-employees. In FY2021, approximately 10% of new hires are 

ex-employees. 

To ensure continuous improvement of our manpower, we provide re-training and job re-designing 

to better facilitate our elderly employees, to enable them to continue contributing to the Company. 

To better understand our employees, the Company on a bi-annual basis conduct interviews to 

better understand and review gaps and issues for everyone. This helps us identify their 

competency and knowledge gaps, and additional skill requirements for their jobs. We also send 

the trained employees on job rotations after relevant training to ensure that they can implement 

what they have learnt.

In FY2021, we offered re-employment contracts to 29 employees out of 30 employees upon

retirement. With close to 100%, we are pleased that the progam is effective.

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP 

Mun Siong believes in giving back to the community. 

Despite the COVID-19 situation this year, which prevent us to hold any team community service 

events, we were still able to contribute to the community individually by participating in the Blood 

Donation Event at Bloodbank @ Westgate Tower in Singapore, following the safety guidelines to 

keep everyone safe.

The event took place on the 23rd and 24th of October 2021.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT 

At Mun Siong, our people are the driving force of our business and that we recognise the 

contributions and hard work of our people. We prioritise providing an environment where our 

employees can foster close relationships while having a balanced work-life. 

Despite the COVID-19 situation this year that prevented us from holding any recreational activities 

and events within the company, we still find ways to express our care and appreciation to our 

people.

On the 4th of October 2021, we gave out hand sanitisers to our staff working on-site and in 

headquarters, along with individual bottle of fruit jams for every single employee, as a token of 

appreciation for their hard work and a reminder to maintain good hygiene habits in prevention for 

COVID-19.

ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT

Originating from a family business, we strongly believe that ethical behaviour cultivates a culture 

of inclusion, care and trust. Having such a culture will help us attain improved performance and 

establishes strong relationships with all our stakeholders. We align our orientations programs and 

trainings with our vision and core values to show our workforce the behaviour that we advocate 

within the Group.

Anti-Corruption

Corruption not only misallocates resources, it also reinforces income inequality, undermining the 

integrity of government and community decision-making. We conduct our business in a 

transparent and accountable manner and work with business partners, the government and the 

community to ensure corruption conduct is strictly prohibited within the Group.

Our mandatory compliance with anti-corruption is embodied in our code of conduct for employees 

and our corporate governance. We have an anti-corruption policy that sets out mandatory 

requirements to identify and manage the risk of anti-corruption and reduce it from being breached. 

Our anti-corruption policies and processes are regularly reviewed by our Service Excellence 

Division and approved by the Finance Director.

The anti-corruption policy governs the framework for key compliance risks, including anti-bribery 

and anti-corruption. We recognise the importance of ongoing efforts to strengthen anti-corruption. 

Anti-corruption risk assessments form a critical part of our program because an adequate set of 

controls is instrumental in managing the risk exposures.

Our anti-corruption policy prohibits authorising, offering, giving or promising anything of value 

directly or indirectly to any business partners, suppliers or government officials with the intention of 

influencing the receiver’s decisions.

The Company also sends out timely reminders to all employees during the festive season, not to 

offer any form of gifts, with the intention of influencing the receiver’s decisions. We regularly remind 

our employees of our anti-corruption code. The anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies are clearly 

stated in our employees’ handbook as well as in our purchasing policy.

Safe Environment to Speak Up

It is important that our stakeholders feel safe to highlight any issues that they have identified as a 

mismatch in our Group’s core values. We encourage anyone to report unethical, inconsistent or 

illegal conduct that does not align with our code of corporate governance and corporate policy, and 

to do so without fear of retaliation. Our Functional Directors, who are members of the Executive 

Committee, are directly involved in resolving differences and disputes at site. We have zero-

tolerance policy for any form of retaliation from the Company or management and aim to resolve 

concerns in the most effective way possible.

We also have a Whistleblowing programme whereby reports can be lodged anonymously via the 

Whistleblowing Report form on our website. This form can be accessed by anyone and 

encourages a speak up culture. Concerns raised are sent directly to the Audit Committee 

Chairman for investigation or resolution as appropriate, in accordance with our internal policy and 

whistle blowing policy.

SAFETY &amp; HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT

Mun Siong has always made safety and health a top priority. We've improved our Accident 

Frequency Rate (AFR) and Accident Severity Rate (ASR) in the last three years. To do this, we 

have abided by our Safety, Health &amp; Environment (SHE) Procedures, Risk Assessments, Safe 

Work Operating Procedures (SWOP), Safe Management Plan (SMM), and Care Intervene &amp; 

Thank Program (CIT) in a consistent manner. Our top management, functional directors,  and 

management have reinforced compliance by spending time on field verification and validation on a 

regular basis.

In addition to the aforementioned, safety policies were also reviewed, amended, and disseminated 

to all employees. New craft-based safety trainings were introduced in response to each 

department's new work-related dangers and mitigation measures. Craft-based trainings were also 

used in other departments to further raise awareness and increase competency.

Nonethless, due to COVID-19, managing employees' health has been extremely challenging.

During the year, we have to constantly revise and update the Safe Management Measure Plan 

(SMM) and to maintain COVID-19 statistics required by various official advisories from time to time.

Mun Siong has provided 3-ply masks and hand santiser to all employees on a regular basis to

ensure optimal personal hygiene.

In Singapore, due to the unique requirements of having work permit holders living in dormitories,

in order to manage and reduce the transmission of COVID-19, the grouping and arrangement of 

workersin their accommodation, transportation and work locations were our major focal areas to 

limit the chance of intermingling amongst the workgroups.

Mun Siong launched the COVID-19 Awareness e-Campaign 2021 - Together Let's Stop the Spread 

to maintain a steady level of awareness. To raise awareness and emphasize the need of SMM 

compliance, all employees were given hand sanitizers, and T-shirts. The campaign recommended 

a 5-step method, as indicated in the banner below. To affirm that the message reached every Mun 

Siong employee, a presentation slide pack was disseminated via email and online internal chat 

groups.

SUSTAINABILITY

Sustainability entails addressing our own demands without jeopardizing future generations' ability 

to meet their needs. In addition to natural resources, we also require social and economic 

resources. The four primary pillars of sustainability are business human rights, labour, anti-

corruption, and the environment. Mun Siong has taken the first step towards environmental 

sustainability by striving to reduce our carbon footprint. To start, we became members of the 

Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC) and pledged to reduce our carbon footprint to zero by 

2050.

We were able to obtain scope 1 and 2 emissions data from January to December 2021, which were 

then documented in CPLC's CERT tool. This enables us to qualify our emissions and set realistic 

goals for reducing our carbon footprint in 2022. Between January to December 2021, we incurred 

total emissions of 1,177,905.84 kgCO2e.

Water, diesel, transportation, and energy are our main target areas for lowering our carbon

footprint. Mun Siong believes in Net Zero Carbon methods rather than Carbon Neutral alternatives 

such as buying carbon credits. Work From Home (”WFH”) is a crucial element for additional 

reduction in our emissions comparing to our previous years. Regardless of government advisories, 

Mun Siong will continue to advocate working from home whenever possible to save on fuel 

consumption as well as to reduce transportation emissions. This will enable us to not only 

contribute to a better environment, but also to enhance our operational efficiency and reducing our 

operating costs. 

Due to the Safe Management Measures, vehicle capacity has been greatly reduced and our fuel 

consumption increased. However, with our ongoing efforts in good journey management and WFH 

planning, thus there was only a 2% increase of diesel consumption. As for the management of 

reduction in water consumption, Mun Siong’s Specialized Services department are venturing into 

various methods and technology to recycle our industrial water and increase efficiency during their 

hydro jetting works. This is expected to bear fruit in 2023.

Mun Siong was awarded the LowCarbonSG Logo in 2021, an initiative launched by the Carbon 

Pricing Leadership Coalition in 2021. The logo is awarded to companies that demonstrate progress 

in measuring and monitoring their carbon emissions.
